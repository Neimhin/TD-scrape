          <p eId="para_17">On foot of yesterday's meeting with Mr. Jeremy Masding, group chief executive of Permanent TSB, and other officials of the bank, Mr. Masding wishes to correct the Official Report in one of the answers he gave to the committee.  I will read a letter, dated 9 April 2014, that I have received from him:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18">Dear Chairman </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_19">  I would like your permission to clarify the record in respect of one our [<i>sic</i>] answers given during our meeting with your Committee this morning.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_20">  In response to questions from Deputy Pearse Doherty, it was stated to the Committee that the Bank does not charge interest on the warehoused portion of a Split Mortgage Solution.  While that is correct in respect of Homeloan Mortgages, the Bank does currently charge interest on the warehoused portion of a Split Mortgage solution where it applies to a Buy-To-Let (BTL) property.  I want to acknowledge that in his questions, Deputy Doherty did raise the position with BTL mortgages specifically but this distinction was not picked up by my colleagues or myself.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_21">  On behalf of my colleagues and myself, I want to apologise to the Committee and to Deputy Doherty for this error.  It was not our intention to mislead or confuse the Committee.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_22">  I would also point out that of 4,000 (approx.) Split Mortgage solutions agreed for mortgage customers in arrears over 90 days, just 297 of those relate to Buy-To-Let customers. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_23">  I would appreciate it if you could bring this communication to the attention of the Committee at the earliest opportunity. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_24">Yours sincerely </p>

          <p eId="para_27">Before we commence business, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off completely to avoid interference with the broadcasting of the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">  I welcome the representatives of Bank of Ireland.  We are joined by Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive; Mr. Liam McLoughlin, chief executive, retail Ireland; Mr. Stephen Mason, director, mortgage arrears resolution strategy; and Mr. Pat Farrell, head of group communications.  They are here to assist the joint committee in its examination of mortgage arrears and progress made in putting in place solutions aimed at resolving difficulties in the sector.  I thank Mr. Boucher and his staff for the written material they provided for the committee.  The discussion will begin with opening remarks by Mr. Boucher, following which members may put questions to the delegates, as appropriate.  It is very important that we manage our time well to derive the maximum benefit from the meeting.  Each member will have a strictly limited time slot within which questions may be put and replies given.  Questions from members and replies by delegates should be clear and concise.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">Since we last met the joint committee, 2013 was a year in which there was significant progress for the group.  Our strategic shape was maintained.  We addressed the preference share issue, from which we incorporated a repayment of €1.8 billion to the taxpayer.  We managed our exit from the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme.  We have achieved our net interest margin target and enhanced our net interest margin.  We have continued to significantly reduce our costs, while investing in our businesses, our people and, in particular, our IT infrastructure.  A feature of last year was our access to the funding markets right across our capital structure.  Of particular relevance to the committee are the asset quality improvements we saw in the period, with a €1.2 billion reduction in defaulted loans.  The Central Bank and some third parties conducted an asset quality review, AQR, balance sheet assessment, BSA, on behalf of the troika in the last quarter of the year, which we addressed in our year-end financial figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">  We had and still have a deficit in our defined pension benefit schemes, but we agreed with the various stakeholders that there would be some changes to benefit arrangements to address this.  We ended the year with a strong capital ratio, a significant change in our financial performance and are now profitable and generating capital.  There is ongoing improvement in the financial performance and the earnings power we are rebuilding in the company.  Each of our four principal businesses is seeing improvement in financial performance, each half year, in particular our retail Ireland business.  We have worked to continue to manage our cost base, including staff and other costs.  The arrangements we have made with stakeholders will improve the pensions position.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">We have a very significant business in Ireland but we also have roughly 46% of our assets outside the Republic of Ireland, primarily in the UK. The next slide shows the enhancements and improvements in our defaulted loans, reflecting an improvement in the economies in which we operate - the UK, the US and in Ireland. The work we have done in restructuring customer loans has begun to be reflected in our financial figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> The next slide notes the position with regard to our SME loans, the Irish SME book. The number of defaulted loans has decreased, provision coverage has increased and we have end-state strategies agreed with nine out of ten of our challenged customers, thereby meeting the targets that the Central Bank of Ireland agreed with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> The next slide shows what we have been able to achieve across the capital structure, while the next but one shows our business in Ireland. We have a very strong franchise position, with approximately 250 branches and more than 1,700 ATMs and self-service devices, and a very significant take-up of our online propositions and new banking propositions for our customers. We have significant market shares in consumer banking in that we did four out of ten new mortgages in 2013. We have significant life assurance business through New Ireland. We provided half of new SME property lending in the market in 2013 and that is reflected in our customer relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> I ask the committee to note the significance of our franchises outside of Ireland and in particular our relationship with the UK Post Office, which is a very attractive opportunity for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> We have stated in our financial forecasts and capital plans for the period to the end of 2017 that Ireland is our core business and that to achieve our objectives and goals in our core business we need to meet lending targets for the economy that we have set for ourselves. We are receiving more than 1,000 credit applications per week from the SME sector. We approved €4 billion in new and increased funding. Bank of Ireland's case is that the only figures we count here are new and increased lending. We have supported almost 16,000 start-ups and we are on track to achieving our objectives. We receive about 1,000 applications a week in new business for home mortgages and we approved €2.2 billion in mortgage facilities in 2013. Our ambition is for gross new lending to home owners and consumers of about €12 billion in the period 2013 to 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> The significant improvement in our own financial performance has facilitated us in repaying taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland at a significant cash profit to the taxpayer, and the taxpayer continues to own a 14% share holding in Bank of Ireland, which is worth somewhere in excess of €1 billion as of today.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I will ask my colleague Stephen Mason to speak about the mortgage arrears situation.</p>

          <from> Mr. Stephen Mason<recordedTime time="2014-04-10T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_42">We have made significant progress in the resolution of mortgage arrears.  We point out that the number of Bank of Ireland private dwelling-house accounts and balances in arrears decreased in 2013, and this positive trend has continued in the first quarter of 2014.  The pace of increase in buy-to-let arrears accounts and balances slowed significantly in 2013 and stabilised during the second half of the year, and that overall trend improved in the first quarter of this year, with a reduction in buy-to-let accounts and balances.  Nine out of ten of our PDH, private dwelling-house, accounts are up to date and eight out of ten of our buy-to-let accounts are up to date.  The significant improvement in arrears trends during 2013 and to date in 2014 reflects the effectiveness of the group's operating infrastructure, the restructuring of customer mortgages on a sustainable basis, mortgage resolution activity and improving economic conditions.  Bank of Ireland has one in five PDH mortgage accounts in the market while accounting for approximately one in ten of PDH mortgage accounts greater than 90 days in arrears.  We also exceeded all our mortgage arrears resolution targets set for the end of the year.  Bank of Ireland PDH mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days are running at fewer than half of the industry level.  Our figure is 6.9% while that of the industry excluding Bank of Ireland is 14.1%.  The graph attempts to show that proportion has improved year on year.  In 2009 we were at 67% of the average, and this figure has fallen year on year down to 49% of the average, which is a reduction of 27%.  Our figure was 53% of the average on the last occasion we appeared before this committee.  We have improved again against the market in the short time since we were last with the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">  Our percentage of PDH mortgage accounts in the market has risen over four years from 20.1% of the market to 21% of the market.  This confirms our message of being open for business.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">  Page 26 of the presentation shows the forbearance stock on our book.  In 2013 we offered forbearance to nine out of ten customers who, through completing an SFS with us, showed they had potential difficulties or were in difficulty.  Eighty-six percent of our restructures are meeting the terms of their arrangement.  The Central Bank figures show that the equivalent figure for the remainder of the industry is 77%.  Our focus has been on concluding solutions with customers, and we have had to meet targets on proposed and concluded solutions.  On the number of proposed solutions for PDH customers, we have proposed solutions to 64% of people against a target of 50%.  We have achieved concluded solutions with 40% of PDH customers, against a target of 15%.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">I thank Mr. Boucher and Mr. Mason for the presentation.  I will begin the questions session by asking an obvious question.  The State has a 14% holding in Bank of Ireland at a value of €1 billion.  Has a timeframe been negotiated as to when the State will redeem its holding so that Bank of Ireland will then become a wholly privately owned company?</p>

          <p eId="para_58">The committee has been trying to establish whether there is some level of consistency between the different banks under the regulation of the Central Bank.  That is not to say there has to be a similarity of approach by every bank, but rather, there should be a consistency of approach.  It is very noticeable that in the area of split mortgages and mortgage-to-rent arrangements Bank of Ireland is below par compared to AIB and Permanent TSB.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Ulster Bank is operating a concessionary type of mortgage, which its representatives gave as the explanation as to why the split mortgage option is not being availed of by its customers. Why is the figure for Bank of Ireland so low compared with those for AIB and Permanent TSB in respect of split mortgages?</p>

          <p eId="para_61">On page 27 of our presentation, the Chairman will see the Central Bank figures in terms of the number of forbearances in the marketplace.  These show that there were 3,300 split mortgages in place at the end of December, of which we have 21%.  That is a fairly significant share of the split mortgages that are in the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">In his opening statement Mr. Boucher acknowledges the State's 14% stake in Bank of Ireland.  When Mr. David Duffy of AIB was before the committee yesterday afternoon, I asked him whether the State's 99% ownership of that bank afforded it a certain level of flexibility not available to other banks operating in a more private capacity.  He refuted that, however, maintaining that his bank is operating in very much the same line as its competitors.  There has been a great deal of comment on the disparity between decisions made by the different banks.  Do the delegates see themselves as having the same types of flexibilities as AIB has in regard to resolution processes and dealing with the distressed book?</p>

          <p eId="para_73">I cannot speak for AIB.  We are a commercial organisation which must operate on a commercial basis while also ensuring we meet the full requirements of legislation and regulatory provisions.  We also must consider our mortgage book relative to the industry and relative to our competitors.  I do not believe our competitors can point to the same progress as we have made, year on year, in terms of challenged mortgages and the level of arrears reduction.  On the whole, the progress we are making is reflected in the numbers.  Where a standard financial statement is submitted - which includes customers who are not in arrears - in nine out of ten cases, we are able to offer a solution.  As Mr. Mason pointed out, 86% of our solutions are working.  We feel we are making progress in terms of the way we deal with these issues.  Other banks are in different positions, with significantly higher arrears situations and larger mortgage books.  Everybody must make their own decisions as to what they feel is best for their business.</p>

Reference was made today to there being some 2,200 court proceedings initiated, judgments obtained and so on, but the way the figure has been presented to us does not include court letters.  Will the delegates clarify whether the sum of 3,478 excludes court letters issued?  If so, the figure of 3,478 is actually an underestimation.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">We heard the same from some of the other banks but, in fact, debt write-down is taking place after the disposal of property in a repossession or voluntary surrender.  In some cases the remaining debt was left there as a legacy issue with no apparent decision as to what would happen with it.  What is the situation if a Bank of Ireland mortgage holder goes into a voluntary surrender or the property is repossessed and there is a legacy debt of, say, €100,000?  The property has been repossessed because the person cannot afford the payments.  Where does he or she stand at the other side of that?</p>

          <p eId="para_105">Everyone is of the view that there must be a return to normalisation in the market.  When people hear the term "recovery" it could frighten them because they might interpret it as meaning that another housing bubble is coming down the tracks.  With regard to normalising the housing market, in 2009 the Central Bank introduced additional prudential guidelines in respect of the home purchasing sector.  Will our guests provide an indication of what is the loan-to-value, LTV, requirement in that area and outline the position regarding mortgage schedules?  Are the periods of repayment relating to such schedules still 35 years or are they reducing to 20 or 25 years?  What is the household income ratio in respect of the mortgages that are being issued?</p>

          <p eId="para_106">Clearly, Bank of Ireland is very keen to support the recovery of the economy.  In that context, we have a desire to lend €33 billion to the economy during the next four years.  Some €12 billion of that will go into the consumer and mortgage business.  We have a €4 billion fund here at present into the mortgage market and almost four out of ten mortgages issued in 2013 were given out by Bank of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">  We have a maximum LTV policy of 90%.  The experience in respect of new drawdowns in 2013 was 70%.  A total of eight out of ten applications submitted were approved.  Our income multiples are arranged on the basis of a number of factors.  The range is four and one quarter to four and three quarter times the amount of a customer's income.  Again, this depends on whether the person is a first-time buyer or not a first-time buyer.  The maximum period of a mortgage for a first-time buyer is 35 years, while the average is 29 years.  The latter is based on what we have seen in 2013.  The maximum term for someone who is not a first-time buyer is 30 years and the average is 25 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">It depends on the conditions and the particular sector.  In general terms we would hope to improve our lending.  I wish to mention one matter which might be relevant in that context.  Underwriting is dealt with separately.  People will have targets and they will recommend loans but the underwriting system is separate and this means a second pair of eyes is cast on transactions in order to ensure that policies are being adhered to, that criteria are being met and that an independent assessment is carried out.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">That clarifies the position.  I have put a particular question to the representatives of the other banks who came before us and I will now put it to our guests.  The LTV requirement varies between the institutions.  In Bank of Ireland's case it is 90%.  It has been suggested to me that a particular practice is developing and I would like to know if it has gained traction within Bank of Ireland.  Let us consider circumstances where a house is for sale of €200,000 and the person who wants to buy it cannot either satisfy the LTV requirement or come up with the deposit, which would be €20,000.  Not too many people have that kind of money on account at present.  In light of the significant increase in rents, it would be extremely difficult to save that amount.  It has been brought to my attention that what is happening within some financial institutions is that the valuation of the property listed on the application is being increased to €220,000 and this means the mortgage can be granted because the LTV requirement has been met.  Is that type of behaviour occurring within Bank of Ireland?</p>

          <p eId="para_116">That is not permitted.  The property has to be separately valued by means of an independent valuation process.  Our primary focus is on the income capacity of the customer rather than the LTV requirement.  The primary focus of our underwriters is the income multiple.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">For all the good news to which our guests referred - including the reduction in arrears - the bottom line appears to be that approximately one third of private dwelling house owners whose mortgages are in arrears are subject to legal proceedings or to the threat thereof from the bank at present.

          <p eId="para_129">That is correct.  In the context of owner-occupiers whose mortgages are in arrears for 90 days plus and default loans, we have SFSs outstanding of approximately 2,200.  We have sought engagement with the customers involved and tried a variety of means to seek engagement with them.  However, the desire for engagement has not been reciprocated by those customers for whatever reason.  We cannot offer a restructuring solution where we do not have an SFS.  We are not allowed to do that.  Therefore, the customers in question have, by default, narrowed the options available to us.</p>

I think he said that the bank has only completed one.  I certainly fault the Government for much of that, but the bottom line is that the first condition of the mortgage-to-rent scheme is that the customers must be approved by the bank.  Is that not right, that the bank must put them forward?</p>

I don't really want to through the SFS process.  I can pay you an incremental €200 a month as an informal arrangement."  At the end of December, we would have had 1,348 accounts in that overpay category.  Quite a lot of people who would have been in the default category, that is, those who are 90 days plus in arrears, might not have gone through the SFS process but have entered into an informal overpay category.

          <p eId="para_182">The key for us in how the market looks at the bank is whether the non-performing loans are reducing, whether our early arrears are reducing and the restructuring options that are in place.  We gave very significant disclosure, which we have extracted from our annual report and put with the presentation.  The most important thing the market looks at is the redefault ratio.  Obviously we look at it and note it from a customer's perspective and from the Central Bank's perspective.  We have said that 86% who are in a restructure have not met the full terms.  That does not mean the other 14% have totally redefaulted.  They could have missed half a payment or one payment.  For us, the key criteria is that restructures stick.  Otherwise, we are wasting our time, the customer's time and the market and investors would get nervous that we were putting place something whereby a problem might re-emerge in the future, which is the point the Senator made.</p>

Of the 682 split mortgages that were reported on 31 December last year, it appears that many of them were not for people in the mortgage arrears resolution targets process.

The numbers available are for people in default at the end of September but the other accounts could have been in default previous to that and have now gone back into the good book.  Some of the accounts might not have been in arrears but others might have been in early arrears.  Some accounts might have been in default before September.  The figures we give are for those in default at the end of September and we show where they are at the end of December.  That is what we were asked to do.

          <p eId="para_278">I was just making the point that they could have been.  Some of them would have been in early arrears and some of them would have been in the good book.  The MART system shows where the people who were in default at the end of September were at the end of December.  That is what the figures show.  We have a lot more split mortgages than that.

          <p eId="para_314">In the presentations made to the committee last week it was interesting that some of the groups dealing with people in mortgage arrears have a concept that the banks are going after individuals with equity in that if they can get equity out of a solution they will go after those people.  We have not heard much on this occasion about small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that have significant property debts.  What solutions is the bank offering those people to help keep the core business working well?  Many of the groups that came before us last week believe the banks do not have the expertise to deal with many of the difficult cases coming before them.  They described some of the solutions given as computer programme solutions because they are not being done on a case-by-case basis.  The figures are simply put into a computer programme and whatever is spat out is the resolution offered.  Do the witnesses believe they have the expertise in this area, and do they genuinely engage with people to sort out these issues?  That is important from the committee's point of view.  I know the bank has a commercial mandate.  That is its agenda but it is a different agenda from the one we heard about last week.  When all of this area is discussed in private afterwards the committee will consider whether it should make recommendations to Government on using the legislative powers of this House to help out people more.  Could the witnesses give me a quick answer on those points?</p>

          <p eId="para_316">We have almost 1,000 people working across our SME and our mortgage business in regard to working for solutions.  As stated earlier, at the end of December just over nine out of ten of our SME customers had solutions in place, 28% of those were in the insolvency space but the remainder were solutions that kept the business operating in a trading manner after the initial arrangement was agreed with the customer.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">  About 750 of the 1,000 people are on the mortgage arrears side.  All of them have been through an extensive training programme.  In terms of the make-up of those staff, we have over 100 network account managers in branches who deal with customers in regard to dealing with their mortgage arrears.  We have a similar number in regard to SMEs.  All of them have been through a variety of training programmes on how to deal with customers in financial difficulty.  Those programmes include us working closely with a number of experts outside the country who have experience in similar financial difficulty cases.  We have worked closely with the UK asset resolution team in the midlands.  That 86% of our solutions are still in place is testimony to the fact that there is a good process in place, and it is working.</p>

          <p eId="para_318">I will give a bit more detail in response to the SME question.  In terms of the figures, €1.487 billion is for forbearance for the SME sector; term extension is €679 million of that.  Adjustment or non-enforcement of covenance is €116 million.  The figure for reduced payment but meeting full interest is €278 million.  The figure for reduced payment greater than full payment is €277 million.  The figure for capitalisation of arrears is €36 million, and there are hybrid solutions of about €37 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">Mr. Boucher is consistent in that he continues to push the bank's policy of no write-downs.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Why is Mr. Boucher so intransigent on that issue? What is wrong with saying that the bank is writing down loans? There are a considerable number of borrowers who are in arrears and not co-operating because they feel, because of what they read in the media, that the banks will not give them a fair hearing. Some of the groups last week stated that Mr. Boucher's bank, in comparison to others - they may be wrong - seem to hardball customers more than, maybe, some of the other banks and it is something of a lottery as to whom one has a loan with. Why is there such a problem with saying that the bank writes off sums, that it has written off so much money on home mortgages, it has written off so much money for SMEs that are in difficulty trading and it has written off so much money for SMEs that also happen to be hugely involved in the property sector where their core SME business is good but their property loans are clearly in trouble? Why is there a problem in saying that with those who have buy-to-lets where the bank is receiving the full rent of those properties, the bank has worked out solutions with these individuals where the bank has written off debt? The bank is doing it. I do not understand why there is such a hang-up about saying that it is doing it. If the bank did so rather than always giving this sense that it will provide no write-down and no debt relief, and the borrower pays back everything unless, of course, he or she goes broke, it might give a sense of hope to borrowers that the banks are working on their side to create solutions.</p>

The delegates claimed the recapitalisation moneys were an investment.  It was not a voluntary investment by the State; the bank would not have existed without it.  It was bust and came knocking at the State’s door for taxpayers’ money at the time in question.  It is not just a case of getting the tax money back.  Owing to what occurred and the activity of Bank of Ireland and others, the State went bust.  It was not able to borrow on the markets because its debt ratio was too big.  The consequences are felt every day in every community.  It is important that we have this discussion in the appropriate context.

That is what we have done.  We have not changed our activities.  Obviously, we wanted to achieve the targets but part of normal collections activity would be that if a customer is not engaging, one would go into the collections - the legal process.  Also, if a customer is in an unsustainable position, one would look to agree voluntary surrender with them before entering into the legal process.  That is what we have done.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">As regards residual debt, a thread running through the committee hearings is that the mortgage to rent scheme is simply not working.  If a customer were deemed by the bank to be suitable for mortgage to rent, they would therefore surrender their home which would be sold to the housing agency.  If there was €100,000 of residual debt, the customer remains in their home but would pay a rent to the housing authority.  In all cases, however, the bank will continue to demand that they pay back the residual €100,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">I will explain the context and background to it.  We have an EU-approved plan concerning the bank for a number of years.  Part of that EU plan is that, from the end of June this year, we are prohibited from engaging in paying broker commissions.  Broker commissions are a common feature of the Irish marketplace.  Those commissions are generally in the range of 75 to 100 basis points.  Our view was that if we cannot pay broker commissions, we would then pay that money directly to the customer.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">The bank believes it is fair to pay €2,000 to those who can afford a €200,000 mortgage.  Bank of Ireland sees that as fair, right and proper for those who can afford such a loan.  Let us look at the person whose family home has been repossessed.  The bank has put them and their family out of their house and the residual debt is €200,000.  The bank has deemed that they cannot afford to stay in their home because they obviously cannot afford to pay €200,000.  However, the bank does not see it as fair to write off €2,000 for them.  How does the bank square that circle?  If a person who can afford a €200,000 mortgage comes to the bank before the end of September, the bank will give them a cheque for €2,000 to pay their stamp duty.  However, a person turfed out of their house with a residual debt of €200,000 will be chased by the bank until the end of their lives for that sum and, as Mr. Boucher said, not a penny will be written down.

He or she is not getting a fair deal, as things have been explained.  We have had other people in before from AIB and Ulster Bank to explain their procedures.  The Bank of Ireland's procedures are much harsher than those of the other banks which have come before us.  The witnesses have said they want to maximise the return to the bank, but the result of playing hardball with customers is that returns will be reduced.

          <p eId="para_458">There are many reasons.  We can go into that.  The Bank of Ireland was very late to the party in terms of the reckless lending that went on.  Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned the position the bank was in at that stage.  Can Mr. Boucher go through his understanding of the interbank protocol on arrears where there is a deal done on a mortgage?  If the Bank of Ireland has an unsustainable mortgage on its books, there may be multiple other loans, including a car loan and a holiday loan and accrued arrears.  When the bank is calculating whether a mortgage is unsustainable, does it write off the unsecured element first?</p>

          <p eId="para_460">Whether the customer has the unsecured debt with us or another bank which has signed up to the protocol, we all understand that the secured debt - the mortgage - takes priority.

          <p eId="para_462">Yes.  Unsecured debt can be a significant issue.  If one looks at the number of SFSs we took in across 2013, the average customer presenting with difficulties had €36,000 of unsecured debt.  If that is being repaid over a five or six year timeframe, it can be quite a drain.

          <p eId="para_476">Let us be reasonable.  The bank has obviously investigated this and knows what the options for customers are.  Has it looked to see exactly what the options are?  If the bank exercises its veto, surely it has done the work to decide what the customer's other option is.  When the bank has done that due diligence and examined it, it knows it is pushing people into bankruptcy.  The only option it is leaving that customer is bankruptcy.  I am trying to be fair - Mr. Boucher should not give me glib answers but give us honest answers.  Mr. Boucher was before us previously and issued a denial in respect of a Red C opinion poll done for the bank.  When we received the paperwork, it contradicted Mr. Boucher's position.  I am asking him to be honest with me and to tell me that the bank has at least looked at this and understands very clearly that if it exercises its veto on the mortgage on a constant basis, it is leaving the customer with no other option but bankruptcy.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">All I am saying is that bankruptcy is a very significant decision that depends on one's individual circumstances, how one feels one can come out of it and how one's credit rating will appear after it.  It depends on the individual circumstances of the customer.  We would recommend that a customer gets independent advice, not advice from the bank, as to what the option at that stage is.  The customer should get independent advice from MABS or someone else.  They need to understand the implications of bankruptcy.  That is the only point I am making.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">I want to stick with this issue because I do not see any benefit to the bank in acting in this manner and exercising that veto.  It is not good for the customer or the bank.  Could Mr. Boucher explain the logic to me and explain where there is a better financial outcome for the bank when it exercises that veto?</p>

          <p eId="para_479">We have to look at the wide range of issues with which we must deal.  We must ensure the viability of the bank and in particular take into consideration those customers who are meeting their mortgage repayments and those who are in restructures and sticking to them.  I presume that paying a mortgage is not easy for quite a lot of those customers.  A total of 86% of our customers fully meet the terms of a restructure, while the other 14% are probably meeting quite a lot of the terms.  We also have the providers of capital to the bank.  We need capital to be able to lend into the economy.  Our ambition is to lend over €33 billion into the economy and we need the capital to do that.  We have ensured that the way we have run the bank means that how taxpayers' money is spent with Bank of Ireland is not our decision.  The bank should never have got into the position where we had to get taxpayer support and we worked hard to make sure that the taxpayers got €6 billion back.  That €6 billion is for the taxpayers to decide through their elected representatives how that money is spent.  It is not for Bank of Ireland to decide how taxpayers' money is spent.  Those are the considerations we must take into account.  Sometimes we can look at something and say that it is not fair in isolation but one cannot look at situations in complete isolation.  One must take into consideration one's broad range of responsibilities and how one runs a bank and takes into consideration those broad range of responsibilities.  It is very easy sometimes to hone in and say that something is very difficult and harsh.  Sometimes it is but we must take everything into consideration.  In taking everything into consideration, we have managed to restructure the bank and ensure we are lending into the economy, that we are the only bank with an EU viability and restructuring plan and that we are the only bank that got support that has repaid the taxpayer.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">That was a lovely speech.  I am interested on the taxpayers' behalf because they have a 14% stake in the bank and saved the bank from the results of reckless lending so let us come back to the customer.  The customer has gone through the procedures and there is an independent recommendation that there should be a write down on the mortgage where the bank still receives some payment.  The bank's policy is to say that there is no write off yet it would probably get a better return if it accepted the recommendation.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">The recommendation is good for the bank, the taxpayer and the bank's shareholders but because Bank of Ireland says it is going to play hardball, that it is the hardest one in the market and that it does not do write downs, it does not let that happen.  That customer has gone through all the procedures.  We know the mortgage is unviable and that the customer does not have the means to repay it.  The customer has an independent recommendation that there should be a write down, which gives the bank some return, but Bank of Ireland says that it wants a certain image, that it is the hardest guy in the market and that the customer will get no write down.</p>

We are performing better than the entire sector.  Our arrears and non-performing loans are coming down because we consistently apply our policies.

          <p eId="para_486">The logic of what Mr. Boucher is saying is that because we are so tough, we have scared everybody else into performing.  The bank is not acting in its best interests.  It is not acting in the best interests of shareholders and it is certainly not acting in the best interests of the customer because they have engaged with the bank.  The banks sends letters to them telling them to engage, which they have done.  They have gone the full way and engaged with the insolvency mechanism, of which Bank of Ireland is a supporter.  When it comes to the last hurdle, somebody who has played by all the rules is told by the bank to take a running jump.</p>

The customer has engaged with the service Bank of Ireland says it supports and advocates for.

          <p eId="para_494">Last week we met representatives from organisations that are trying to support borrowers in distress.  When we asked them whether any of the four banks we met this week, AIB, Ulster Bank, Permanent-TSB and Bank of Ireland, stood out from the others in terms of playing hard ball or being tough on borrowers, they identified Bank of Ireland.  I do not know what my committee colleagues think but based on the evidence I have heard thus far I can see why they said that.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">  The figures provided to the committee indicate that as of the end of last year, 5,321 legal proceedings had been commenced.  What is the total number of legal proceedings commenced by the bank?  The figure is based on the end of the year and applies only to mortgages that were in arrears at a particular time.  There is a bigger figure, namely, the total number of legal proceedings by the end of the first quarter of 2014 across all mortgages.  What is that figure?</p>

As the movement between this return and the previous return was not in the thousands, I do not expect the new figure to be in the thousands.  I do not have the figure, however.  We have to send the numbers to the Central Bank by the end of April and that is what we will be working on.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">Bank of Ireland does not have figures for the legal letters issued, although the other banks provided that information.  When the representatives were asked for the information, their response was that they do not consider it a long-term solution.  It would have been more helpful to give us the figure we sought while adding the caveat that they do not regard it as a long-term solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">  If we take a broad comparison with the other banks and the letters they issued to initiate or threaten legal proceedings, it would not be unreasonable to suggest a figure of 4,000 to 5,000.  If that is true, it means the total number of legal proceedings and letters threatening legal proceedings is approximately 8,700.  The representatives might provide an estimate of the number of repossessions that Bank of Ireland is likely to complete.  I am very surprised that a bank which is initiating thousands of legal proceedings that may ultimately end up with repossession has not made an estimate in this regard.  However, a reasonably conservative estimate is that one in five legal proceedings will end up in repossession. That would suggest a total repossession figure of approximately 1,700.  Does that jar significantly with what Bank of Ireland expects?</p>

          <p eId="para_506">The question is based on the premise that 4,000 letters have been issued but were not included in this return.  Quite simply, that is not the case.  We wanted to give the committee every piece of information it sought.  Suggestions were made previously that people could count warnings of legal proceedings as proposed solutions.  We did not do that.  We submitted to the committee what we had submitted to the Central Bank as our MART return and anything in terms of our non-co-operation strategy would not qualify as MART and was not included in this return.  Our intention was not in any way to withhold information from the committee and we will provide the information sought.</p>

When the Central Bank issued figures in September based on the MARP returns, it suggested that 55% of cases across the banks were legal and 45% were forbearance.

          <p eId="para_518">It is a different population.  We are looking at customers who were still in default on 30 September.  Many of the customers to whom we offered forbearance were in default, and the forbearance would have sorted out their issues and moved them back into the good book.  Unfortunately, the way the figures are presented does not tell the full story because they represent a point in time.  Ultimately, what one will be left with in terms of default is that more of the customers will be in the legal process because forbearance should be curing customers and taking them out of default.  The figures I have presented pertain to the more than 10,000 customers who completed standard financial statements over the year.  They were a mix of pre-arrears, early arrears and late arrears.  Where they either had difficulties or expected difficulties, we were able to offer forbearance in nine out of ten cases.</p>

We never think we are perfect, but must continue to enhance our processes and procedures and examine advice from a range of parties.  Therefore it is hard for us to say exactly what is a combination of our view of what is working and where we do and do not have to improve.  I cannot identify some specific point.  It may be that a point was made which was already under consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_525">In answer to a question from Deputy Kevin Humphreys we said the bank was a mover to say unsecured debt is a significant issue.  If the banks agreed a protocol among themselves that if a customer had a Bank of Ireland credit card and a mortgage with Ulster Bank we would agree that reciprocation would apply, and vice versa.  We take writedowns on unsecured debt.  That is the nature of lending.  Unsecured debt, by its nature, is lower down in the waterfall-----</p>

When we say we will think about something that means we do, and we take it seriously.  We recognised there was a concern.  The vast majority of defaulting customers are on trackers and we felt there was a perception that we were seeking to make a profit.  Therefore we said that for the period of the warehousing, for three years subject to review, it would be the cost of three-year unsecured money to the bank at that time.  That was transparent because we issued a bond to the market at a rate of approximately 2.5% to 2.6%.</p>

          <p eId="para_566">Much of the debate has been on the mortgage side.  I refer to the SME sector.  Bank of Ireland's presentation referred to sustainable solutions having been put in place for nine out of ten of its SME borrowers who were in arrears.  I want to zone in on the 10% of the SME sector for whom no solution is in place.  The SME sector is a broad church.  Fortunately it is a real engine of our economy.  From my constituency experience I suspect the 10% which are a residual problem for the bank by and large fall into the microenterprise sector, for example sole traders, corner shops, petrol stations, publicans and small builders who might have no employee other than themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">They are key to provincial Ireland's economic recovery and the problem we have is that while a recovery is under way, it is patchy. </p>
          <p eId="para_568"> With regard to Bank of Ireland's profiling of the SME sector and companies that remain in difficulty, is it borne out by its analysis of the sector? Does the bank have a specific programme to deal with the microenterprise sector, as opposed to the SME sector generally? Some businesses may have in-house accountants and a range of legal and financial services at their disposal, but others do not have the expertise and may have made imprudent investments in the good times. It may not have been buy-to-let properties but a range of foolish investments. That leaves them with a debt that is dragging the core business down. If it is not a tangible asset, how can the bank ensure the viable core business survives when the debt it carries from a non-core business investment is in danger of dragging it down?</p>

          <p eId="para_569">The SME sector is critical to the bank and we are investing significantly in it in terms of both resources and supports.  More than €12 billion of the €33 billion about which we spoke is geared towards supporting the sector, which is a support for jobs and employment in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">  I would like to clarify that at the end of December we reached a target of nine out of ten where we had in place solutions and that we are now working through these customers.  The figure of one in ten relates to time.  We tend to get to all of these customers also.  It is not the case that they are not for saving or proper resolution.  It is a case of we reached nine out of ten and are now working in 2014 through the remainder of the portfolio and will do so in a proactive manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">Does the bank require a different slate of solutions for microenterprises the debt level of which may not be associated with a tangible asset, for example, buy-to-let properties, in which many other SMEs may have invested?  The debt may relate to the expansion of the business that did not work out, but a viable core business remains.   I can think of a number of such businesses in my area which still have a viable core business but a debt owing to an investment is dragging them down.  I take on board what Mr. Boucher says about it not being policy to write down, but in circumstances such as this where there is no debt solution, the business will fail.  That is not beneficial to anybody but particularly provincial Ireland where there is a preponderance of such enterprises.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">It is our objective to keep the business open.  More than 75% of the solutions we have put in place so far in the case of the figure of nine out of ten have kept the core business going.  That would be our objective in the micro sector also.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">Our experience has probably been significantly less than we have seen elsewhere in terms of Bank of Ireland buy-to-let lending and being banker to the core business.  We come across situations where we are the banker to the core business but buy-to-let borrowings have been provided by other banks and we were uncomfortable with providing them at the time they were given.  We try to ensure cashflow is retained within that business and the buy-to-let aspect must be dealt with by the bank that lent the money.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_515">
          <from>Deputy Michael Creed<recordedTime time="2014-04-10T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_576">However, there is an excessive concentration on buy-to-let lending.  Businesses have debts on other investments that are no longer tangible assets which are in danger of dragging down the core business.  They may have made myriad non-productive investments, but they cannot repay the debts associated with them.  Every business did not purchase a buy-to-let property and there are debts not associated with the core business, particularly in microenterprises, that need a different template to work out a solution.  I take some comfort from the bank's commitment to keep the business open in all circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">  The representatives of the four banks who have now appeared before us agree that the mortgage-to-rent scheme is not working and that there are too many road blocks, but I am unclear as to where and what are these road blocks.  Will the bank outline a brief summary of them?  When it recommends people, what hurdles must be cleared?  Where are the impediments to progress?  Is it the local authority?  We need more information if we are to work with the banks to refine the process because the scheme is one of the preferred solutions to ensure people stay in the house they call home.  If we can do that in the context of this scheme------</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_516">
          <from> Mr. Stephen Mason<recordedTime time="2014-04-10T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_578">I understand why the question keeps coming up, but the process is long.  I do not have the criteria with me and they are part of the issue, but I will bring the Deputy briefly through the process from a couple of months ago and I do not believe it has changed.  We see if a customer's position is unsustainable.  We check against the qualifying criteria to see if the customer would meet them.  They have to do with property value, size of property, household income, etc.  It is then approved by Bank of Ireland management if we believe it meets the criteria; the mortgage is unsustainable and we see if we can it get into mortgage-for-rent sector.  The case is anonymised and sent to the housing agency for approval.  Without the customer's details, it looks to see if it meets the profile.  That is the first part of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">  Once approved as being eligible, the customer is contacted and advised.  The mortgage-to-rent consent to participate letter and appropriate pack with relevant information and the next steps are sent to the customer.  Part of the process allows the customer 60 days in which to lodge a social housing application with his or her local authority and return the signed consent to participate letter to the bank.  Once the bank receives the social housing approval letter to proceed, it obtains consent from the customer and the customer's details are then forwarded to the relevant housing association.  We issue our mortgage-to-rent letter.  The customer has 28 days to obtain both legal and financial advice, for which we pay under the scheme, and return the signed copy indicating that he or she wants to participate.  The voluntary surrender of the property by the customer to the bank takes place and the bank then sells the property to the housing association.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">  From that brief description of the process, the Deputy can see that many people are involved, that there are many hand-offs and that the criteria are restrictive.  The whole thing needs to be looked at.</p>

          <p eId="para_582">The representatives might give us the benefit of their experience in operating the scheme, indicating which gatekeepers are superfluous in the process and how it might be streamlined more effectively because it is a good solution which allows people to remain in the house that they call home.  There are too many gatekeepers along the line based on what Mr. Mason said and if we can streamline the process, we should learn from this.</p>

We would be careful not to criticise people who are doing their own jobs in difficult circumstances, but if we set out the steps involved, the criteria used and a flow chart of what has to happen, perhaps different parties might look at the flow chart and say what parts are adding to the solution or causing issues to arise.</p>

          <p eId="para_593">In justifying the very hard line Bank of Ireland is taking with home owners who are in mortgage distress and in defending his own exorbitant annual income, Mr. Boucher keeps referring to the shareholders of the bank as justification for everything.  As a major bank, does he feel it has any responsibility to Irish society more generally in respect of what Bank of Ireland and the other banks have got the Irish people into, or to its customers who were and are the victims of being ensnared in the property bubble, the profiteering that happened there and the prices they were forced to pay for a home?  Does he feel that any such consideration should come into the decisions made by Bank of Ireland in regard to home owners who are in distress?  From listening to Mr. Boucher on the last occasion and now, my sense is that if we brought in a stone wall from Connemara and placed it over there, I would get as much change from it regarding the interests of people who are suffering and in distress as I am getting from Bank of Ireland and Mr. Boucher as chief executive.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_529">
          <from> Mr. Richie Boucher<recordedTime time="2014-04-10T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_594">It is correct that we are a commercial business, but it is very important to us that our business is from Ireland.  We would not have a future as a business if Ireland, as a country, did not have a robust and strong economy.  We were supported by the taxpayer so we had a couple of criteria.  We had to survive.  What did survival mean?  It meant that we participated in supporting economic recovery whilst we repaid the taxpayer.  It is, and has been, extremely important to us in Bank of Ireland that we do not decide how the taxpayers' money is spent.  The taxpayers should never have been put in a position that they had to invest in Bank of Ireland, so we worked hard to ensure that the cash went back quickly.  We had to take difficult decisions to run a business to ensure, first, that the taxpayers got back €6 billion in cash.  That is €6 billion in cash from Bank of Ireland.  None of the other banks has done that.  That €6 billion means that either tax rates can be kept lower or more services can be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">  For the economy as a whole, we must take into consideration our reputation in wider society and our ability to support the economy.  We must have capital and the provision of capital to us should never come from taxpayers but from the private sector.  However, our private sector investors are investing for the long term.  We have sold the bank to private sector investors on the basis of the growth story in Ireland and the growth story in our bank.  We have clearly set out to our investors our ambition to lend into this economy and support it, because if we do not support the economy we do not achieve our financial and business objectives.  That is as simply put as I can put it.  We have a responsibility to support the economy in a way that makes commercial sense.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_530">
          <from>Deputy Joe Higgins<recordedTime time="2014-04-10T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_596">The problem is that the unsustainable level of mortgage repayments means that far more money is going to the banks than should be going to them, money which would otherwise be going into services, employment creation, shops and so forth on a local basis.  In fact, it is quite damaging to the economy.  The 4.5 million taxpayers would be quite interested in having a global solution to this crisis.  However, the circular sent to the committee by Mr. Boucher is clearly in the very narrow interests of the bank's shareholders.  Even issues such as temporary interest rate reduction, deferred interest, reduced payment less than interest rate, payment moratorium and permanent interest rate reduction are out.  Anything that might give more flexibility to people, even on a temporary basis, has been ruled out.  Among the major banks there are 30,000 home owners who are in danger of losing their homes.  Does Mr. Boucher not see the benefit of a global solution?  Does he not think he should be talking to other banks and the Central Bank about a global response, rather than this very narrow way with which not just Bank of Ireland but all the banks are approaching it?</p>

          <p eId="para_597">Again, we received support from the taxpayer.  A total of €6,000 million in cash has come back from Bank of Ireland to society, to all of the taxpayers.  It is paid to the broad base of taxpayers.  Our responsibility is to all of the taxpayers.  I could empathise, and Deputy Humphreys thought that I was not focusing on his question, but we must take into consideration our responsibilities to a wide range of factors.  If we focus on the particular point the Deputy is representing, which is the taxpayers, our bank formally believes it is not up to our bank to decide how the taxpayers' money should be spent.  It is up to our bank to ensure the taxpayers have no risk to Bank of Ireland, that they have got their money back and that they have a profitable investment.  Then the taxpayers decide how that money is spent, not Bank of Ireland.  All of the taxpayers, through their elected representatives, decide how that money is spent.  That is how we address the situation.</p>

Lastly, I have a question which I put to the representatives of all the banks.  Does Mr. Boucher not see the common sense that ordinary people see, that rather than putting tens of thousands of people through the torture and distress there should be a global write-down to today's home values, with a clawback built in should the prices go very high again?</p>

Will the witnesses tell us a bit about how Bank of Ireland interacts with the group of people in respect of whom it has gone to the drastic extent of issuing legal proceedings or putting them in the position of supposedly voluntarily surrendering their homes?

          <p eId="para_617">It is a thorough process.  It starts with our collections activity when someone goes into arrears.  We make every attempt to contact customers to figure out what their problems are and to try to get them to meet one of our 100 network account managers around the country.  We have 250 branches and 267 mortgage advisers.  Customers can meet any of those advisers or network account managers, who will help them to complete a standard financial statement, SFS.  If we can get that done, we find that we can offer forbearance in nine out of ten cases.  If customers do not respond to our telephone calls, letters or text messages, we will not just stop after a week.  We try to do it for a number of months.  If customers still do not engage with us, we move into what we call our non-co-operation strategy, in which we write to the customers outlining that, despite our attempts to engage with them, they have not done so and will lose the protections of the code of conduct of mortgage arrears, CCMA, and the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, unless they respond to us within 25 days and give us the information we require to be in a position to offer them forbearance treatments and help them with their solutions.</p>

I will not give the banks credit, but I acknowledge that, in my experience, they have not been moving for wholesale repossessions.  This is not particularly because they are nice, but because it would not be in their interests.  Where someone has no option and is forced to give up the family home because there is no sustainable solution available, it has dramatic consequences, yet there is still an outstanding amount and Bank of Ireland will chase that person down for it and take him or her to court, even though it knows the person has no money.

          <p eId="para_658">On the buy-to-let sector, I have made the following point to all of the banks.  There are many people who are tenants of landlords who owe money to the banks.  They are innocent victims in all of this in that they are paying rent to their landlords who have gone bust.  The banks have several thousand of these landlords on their books and commenced repossession proceedings in respect of some of the properties concerned.  Does Bank of Ireland propose to respect the rights of tenants who faithfully pay their rent and have every right to expect security of tenure and not to be turfed out by receivers appointed by the bank or does it propose to turf out tenants whose contract is not with the bank but with the landlord, which contract they have continued to honour?</p>

          <p eId="para_659">I will try to respond to that question and then ask my colleague, Mr. McLoughlin, to comment further.  First, if the tenant has a tenancy agreement, that agreement is not impacted on by whether the property changes ownership.  It is also in the bank's interest for the tenants to remain in place.  In the cases we appoint a rent receiver, this is done because the tenant is paying rent, but the landlord is not paying it to the bank.  The purpose in the bank appointing a rent receiver is to ensure the tenants' money is paid to the bank.  Mr. McLoughlin will comment further.  The basic principle from our perspective is that our receivers observe tenancy agreements and contracts.</p>

          <p eId="para_661">Often a person could be a party to a one year lease agreement which then expires, but because these things often operate on an informal basis, he or she expects to continue paying rent and remain in the property.  The Residential Tenancies Act provides for a four-year cycle in terms of tenancy, which means that a person could expect security of tenure for three or four years.  However, the bank can get around this by appointing a receiver who chooses to sell the property.  I would like to hear from the delegates that Bank of Ireland's attitude is not a mercenary one of moving in as soon as it can to sell a property, particularly if there is a tenant in it who is faithfully paying rent.</p>

In the case of a person who has been in a property for four years, notice periods apply.  The bank always abides by these notices, if exercised.  We do not tend to act in a mercenary way in that regard.  There is in place with our fixed charge receivers a code of governance, the terms of which we ensure are abided by at all times.</p>

          <p eId="para_679">From the Government's point of view but not in accordance with conscience.  The difference is 68% which is indicative of the bank's culpability in creating an asset price bubble.  When the asset price collapses and the music stops - I will give the delegates a paper on this issue after the meeting - the bank should be accountable for 75% of the collapse in the asset price.  The same applies to Allied Irish Banks, for which the figure is 72%.  Irish Life &amp; Permanent was at a figure of 300%, but it was an insurance composite and using reserves to lend.  The whole thing is a mess.  The customers of the banks, collectively, have been literally financially "Nagasakied".  They are radioactive and will be exposed to financial radioactivity for the remainder of their lives, which is wrong.  This should be taken into account on a case by case basis.  There has been much use of terms such as "We have to be consistent"  and "We have to be fair."  Let us start with the issue of fairness.  Who caused the problem?  It was caused by the banks' boards, as the balance sheets will show.  That is the starting point.  What was the secured senior bond level in Bank of Ireland in 2008?</p>

          <p eId="para_683">Yes, for Bank of Ireland alone.  That is how crazy the whole thing was and there are now 180,000 distressed and depressed families.  I am depressed listening to these proceedings and it is not personal.  I accept that Mr. Boucher was not on the board at the time.  However, he now has a responsibility to face the mess and the financial destruction of the country courageously, fairly and justly.  I know that he has the skills to do it and that he understands what I am saying, namely, that it is his duty to bring it to the Government's attention in order that it can go to the European Union and insist on creditor recapitalisation of the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">That brings me to Bank of Ireland having 8.8% provisioning of the total loan book of €92 billion. Do the witnesses know what Ulster Bank has in write-offs and provisioning? It is 30% and over. Do the witnesses know what AIB has for write-offs and provisioning? It is 18.5%.

          <p eId="para_686">I know that.  I do not want to get held up with this.  There has also been mention of shareholders, so let me give an example.  In July 2011, some 35% of the bank was sold to new capital, with an inflow to the bank of €1.1 billion.  This came from Mr. Wilbur Ross and Mr. Prem Watsa, a director in the bank.  They bought 35% for €1.1 billion, with a cost of 1% of the bank at €31 million.  Some 6.4% of the bank, which cost €201 million, was sold for €690 million, with profit of €489 million.  They still hold 12.8% of the bank, which cost €402 million, with a market value of €1.38 billion, leaving a valuation uplift of €978 million.  The delegation told us a few minutes ago that customers have €2.4 billion of negative equity, with the bank responsible for at least 75% of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">I can provide all the figures.  It is really ridiculous that we have five minutes to try to cover this ground.  I have a few questions to leave the witness.  The bank has spoken about sustainability, which takes in term, repayments, costs, residual and collectible factors.  We have not spoken about those.  How experienced are the staff?  It has been indicated there are 1,000 staff dealing with this area, whereas AIB has 2,000 and Ulster Bank has 450, with 200 in Edinburgh.  With regard to meaningful engagement, the bank has call centres and I cannot even get through to my Bank of Ireland branch in Stillorgan because my call is sent to a call centre.  I cannot speak to people despite the fact that I am very lucky that I have money held in the bank.  This is really all wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">I have some final questions.  What is the bank's credit committee structure for deciding policies, and what directors arrive at a policy of having no write-offs or write-downs?  It is disgraceful because the banks collectively caused the bubble.  We must remember the figures.  There was a 173% weighted average loan-to-deposit ratio, which is 83% above the 90% norm over six years.  That is 92% of the asset price bubble.</p>

          <p eId="para_722">I will not rehash old territory.  The position has been made very clear in terms of the bank's attitude towards writing down debt and the priorities for the bank with regard to repaying the taxpayers' loan, along with the interests of shareholders, etc.  I will focus on some aspects of the procedures as they relate to customers.  I will begin by making a quick comment.  In a previous career I was a practising solicitor and involved in drawing down mortgages, as were most solicitors.  This involved ordinary people.  In every case in which I acted for a client, I never achieved a single change to the standard form deed of mortgage.  In every case the valuation on the property being bought was paid for by the purchaser, and the securing the bank's mortgage over the property was paid for by the customer who paid the legal firm to act on the bank's behalf to register the mortgage.  I wish to discuss the bank's duty to customers, as the bottom line for many people dealing with the bank who are in distressed positions is that they had no real hand, act or part in establishing the legal relationship they have with the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">  Another Deputy has put this succinctly in that we seem to be squeezing the pips from the lemon when dealing with customers, so any ounce that can be taken will be taken.  Unfortunately, on a daily basis I deal with vulnerable people who find themselves in mortgage distress, and I will focus on some of the issues that have come to my attention and that of other organisations which have come before the committee in the past week.  The first relates to the type of assistance that customers get when dealing with Bank of Ireland.  The Money Advice &amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, was before the committee and made it clear that it was not in a position to give the high level legal and accounting advice required by people who find themselves in mortgage distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">  The witnesses may answer that the bank has repaid the taxpayer €6 billion and it is therefore down to the State to provide expert advice to people in mortgage distress.  Given that these are Bank of Ireland customers and in looking to level the playing field for them in their engagement with the bank, does Mr. Boucher not think it reasonable to do what AIB or EBS have done in appointing the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation on an independent basis, funding it in assisting the bank's customers in dealing with the bank?

          <p eId="para_730">No, the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation is completely at arm's length.  I have had dealings with it, so I can confirm that.  Second, with regard to this independent service and why it is necessary, one of the things about engagement with the bank, as the witness knows, is the standard financial statement, which many people find incredibly difficult.  MABS, which is an expert body in terms of dealing with debt, reported to us that it assisted 5,481 people in the six months from July to December 3013 to complete an SFS.  However, 42% of them were subsequently queried by the lender.  The MABS representatives gave us to understand that Bank of Ireland was a significant factor in querying these standard financial statements.  They made the point that because these standard financial statements are not stress tested, they have seen fundamental basic expenditure which they regard as necessary being over-ruled by independent financial institutions in order to squeeze the pips out of the lemon.</p>

          <p eId="para_733">The Senator is talking about something that I have not seen.  However, I can say that the SFSs that we receive from MABS are of a very high professional standard.  I can also say, and we have proved it in our presentation today, that when we put forbearances in place, 86% of people continue to pay those forbearances.  The industry average is 77%.  If any bank is trying to get the last pip out of a customer or trying to set their standard of living so low that they cannot sustain it, that is one way of making sure that the forbearance falls over.  We are not doing that.</p>

          <p eId="para_734">The evidence of MABS to this committee was that 42% were queried.  Its representatives raised a serious concern that they are not sustainable because financial institutions are trying to take too much money out of people's pockets.  In the longer term they recommended independent stress testing of standard financial statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">  I will move to the next matter.  There are two issues that concern me - when a mortgage is deemed to be sustainable, when it is not, who determines that and the independence of that process, and, second, when somebody is deemed not to be a co-operating borrower.  In the first instance, having a solution proposed that is not sustainable-----</p>

          <p eId="para_737">My concern is that there is no independence in this process.  What is deemed to be sustainable is entirely determined by the bank, and there is no independent review of that.  That is the first point.  The second point is sustainability.  Can the witnesses tell me the number of mortgages that are in arrears of more than 90 days that they have deemed to be unsustainable?  The reason I am concerned about this is that the insolvency process, which we all hope will push many of these situations to a conclusion, cannot be accessed by borrowers who are deemed not to co-operate.  The bottom line is that Bank of Ireland is not a statutory body, yet its decisions have implications for people's capacity to access a statutory solution.  Do the witnesses have a view on that?</p>

The bank must get all the documents, look at it again and there is a separate process in the bank.  I accept it is the bank.  However, we must retain all the files, all the decision-making process and the Central Bank from time to time audits that decision-making process.  We have a documentary trail which shows the original SFS, the original process and the original decision as to whether it was deemed sustainable or not.  If the customer is not happy, it goes to a separate committee of the bank which is completely separate from the original decision makers.  We must also retain all of the files for an audit on behalf of the Central Bank by third parties to examine whether we have been consistently applying that process.</p>

          <p eId="para_746">  I wish to make a final point about receivers.  I can forward a submission to the witnesses about the point I wish to make.  I understand that approximately 1,250 receivers have been appointed to buy-to-let properties under deeds of mortgage, with at least 800 of them appointed by Bank of Ireland.  There is deep unhappiness about the actions of receivers in the buy-to-let market.  From personal experience I know that tenants have been evicted, repairs have not been done and tenants have been left in total uncertainty.  There was an attempt by the Irish Banking Federation to produce a document setting out the duties of receivers and the duties of tenants but the situation is hopelessly inadequate.  It must be remembered that 20% of the Irish population, which is one in five people in this country, live in rented properties.  Will the witnesses accept that something must be done to set up an equivalent to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears for buy-to-let properties that takes into account that tenants are a fundamental and important part of this process and that receivers must step into the shoes of landlords in every sense?  That includes repairs.  One cannot take the money without doing the job.</p>

          <p eId="para_787">Bank of Ireland is the last institution to attend here.  We have not seen some of the others.  Perhaps the Chairman will decide whether we need to examine this.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">   A common feature among the institutions is that a large number of the solutions to mortgage arrears are legally based.  I took a quick look through the bank's figures because I wanted to be certain that I am operating on the correct basis.  For home loans, out of 11,054 cases that are in arrears for more than 90 days, there were 3,942 non-legal solutions and 3,478 legal solutions, which represents 47% of the entire 7,420 so-called solutions provided.  For buy-to-lets the bank has 5,638 mortgages that are in arrears for more than 90 days, with 907 of them, or 27%, receiving non-legal solutions, and 2,368, or 72%, on the legal side.  For combined measures, 4,849 cases had a non-legal solution and 5,846 had a legal solution, which equates to 45% non-legal and 55% legal solutions.  Can Mr. Boucher tell me if that is a sustainable model for dealing with the mortgage arrears crisis?</p>
          <p eId="para_789">  I read down through the figures and the most obvious item was the fact that there are only 81 split mortgages in the home loan sector and 17 in the buy-to-let sector.  Permanent TSB has a large share of split mortgages.  I ask Mr. Boucher to address my point.  Did he understand the point I made?</p>

          <p eId="para_792">First, regarding our forbearance solutions, it is important to bear in mind that one of our key desires is to ensure that if a customer needs forbearance, it is before they go into arrears.  It needs to be taken into consideration that forbearance costs the bank money.  We reach out to customers, saying to them "If you feel you have a financial problem that could negatively impact on your ability to pay the mortgage then we encourage you to come to us before you go into arrears."  Our forbearance policy is very much aimed at that, so I do not think we can dismiss them.  I just wanted to make that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_794">I noticed that the bank called in receivers for some home loans, which is unusual.  I have not seen that happen with the other institutions.  I have seen receivers called in for buy-to-lets.  How many civil proceedings does the bank have under way, outside of what is measured here in terms of the courts?</p>
          <p eId="para_795">  There is an issue at the moment with regard to positive equity.  I call it the paradox of positive equity.  It means that people perceive that they are more vulnerable to the financial institutions and banks if they are in arrears but in positive equity.  Is the bank pursuing customers who are in arrears for fewer than 90 days via court proceedings?</p>

          <p eId="para_828">Our primary focus for mortgage lending is the income capacity of the customer.  The multiple will depend on different circumstances but it is between 4.25 and 4.75.  We will provide a mortgage for up to 90% of the purchase price or a formal valuation, whichever is lower.  The average loan to value of mortgages we wrote in 2013 was 70%.  I do not have the quantum of property or the percentage of property we had in 2008, but if the Senator had the advantage of seeing our pack, we break down the profile of our loan book on one of the slides.  We break down the portfolio and show the gross amount before the provisions of €8.8 billion.  For property and construction, prior to the provisions, it amounts to 18% of the loan book, with roughly half in the Republic of Ireland and half in the rest of the world.  Some €8.8 billion is in the Republic of Ireland and €8 billion in the rest of the world.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">  With regard to regulation, it is an extremely challenging and intrusive process and we have engagement every day at various levels in the company.  In the primary process, at the top, the Central Bank operates PRISM - that is, the probability risk and impact system - and looks at the risk factors of the bank, the capital of the bank and various other factors.  It makes an assessment of the bank and, based on its observations, requirements and requests, we get a risk mitigation programme.  We have certain timescales in which to deliver certain outcomes that are satisfactory to the Central Bank.  The Prudential Regulatory Authority, PRA, in the UK follows the same process under a different name.  There is a myriad of interactions, but the risk mitigation programme, RMP, and the PRISM are the primary areas of focus.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">A document relating to Bank of Ireland has gone missing in the Department of Finance.  It was from a tax advisor who deals with high net worth individuals.  It made a proposal to the governor of the bank, before it was recapitalised by the State, to buy it out and take it over.  This was rejected by Bank of Ireland and the Department but the correspondence has gone missing in the Department of Finance.  Has the Department requested the original copy from the bank?</p>

          <p eId="para_843">The letter was cc'd to Brian Lenihan.  It is highly suspicious.  That was the only item of correspondence between the bank and the Department of Finance during this period.  There are major questions about the tax adviser, who I do not claim did anything wrong.  He was a tax adviser to the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in respect of the whiparound in Manchester.  This is a sensitive letter about the taking over of the bank by a global outside agency, yet no correspondence exists in the Bank of Ireland or the Department of Finance.  Is it not suspicious that the correspondence has disappeared from both the Department and the bank?</p>

          <p eId="para_850">The point I was trying to make, by drawing an analogy, was with the aim of ensuring that people did not compare apples to oranges.  If we are to describe the orange, for want of a better term, repossessions are part of a normalised market.  In the UK, if we have a loan book of €27 billion and roughly 180,000 mortgage accounts, 600 repossessions a year would be a relatively normalised market.  Members should not quote me on these figures as I am just throwing them out.</p>

          <p eId="para_852">It depends.  There are two factors, one of which is that a much bigger proportion of our mortgage book in the UK is buy-to-let.  I wanted to point out that in a normal market, based on our experience, repossessions happen, and in our case, with a normalised book in the UK, there are about 600 a year.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_770">

          <p eId="para_854">No; I am bringing matters to a conclusion.  I thank Mr. Boucher, Mr. McLoughlin, Mr. Mason and Mr. Farrell for coming before the committee.  This has been an ongoing process and every time we have requested the bank to come before us since the target measures were put in place, it has done so.  We appreciate the documentation provided to the committee, which arrived early so that we could assimilate it and compare it to information received from other banks.  This is an evolving process and, as with some of the other banks, the prescriptions laid out in the Keane report were not seen by the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the banks as the definitive means of unravelling or dealing with this difficulty.  Other resolution processes have come to the fore as we examined the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">Difficulties with some of the resolution processes seem to be apparent, such as the mortgage-to-rent issue, and these have been repeated in recent days.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> It is worthy of acknowledgement that in the case of each of the institutions which have come before the committee, while there may have been robust challenges, differences of opinion and perhaps some strong questions with regard to how individual banks are approaching individual things, it is testament to the work of the committee members that there has also been a response by the banks to issues that have been raised by us. In the case of Bank of Ireland and the issue of the split mortgages, in particular the variable-rate case, while members may have different views about it, the bank representatives have responded to the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> One thing noted in today's engagement was that the initial letters of correspondence to customers are not being counted as part of the resolution processes. That was a major bone of contention at the committee the last time around and I welcome the fact that the Bank of Ireland figures presented today did not include these as a means of stepping up the figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> I will be advising the institutions that have come before us - I imagine it is being done anyway because they have been watching proceedings - to examine the transcripts and see what is being debated back and forth among everyone. While we are looking for consistency, I recognise that we cannot have the same approach throughout all the banks and that it is not necessarily going to be the case. We are looking for solutions on a case-by-case basis and the last thing we need on a case-by-case basis is a set prescription as a panacea to all the difficulties that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> I strongly call on the representatives of Bank of Ireland as the resolution practices evolve and as there is a tweaking and a tinkering of approaches, to let this committee know about the developments, because if there are improvements to the system we would like to hear about them and we may well be in a position to welcome such measures at times.</p>

          <p eId="para_861">With that said I will bring proceedings to an end.  I thank Mr. Boucher, Mr. Mason, Mr. McLoughlin and Mr. Farrell for coming before the committee today.  The discussion has been purposeful.  We will be meeting with the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the Governor of the Central Bank later this month, at which time we will be drawing our recommendations, which we will be furnishing to the relevant agencies.</p>
