            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Timmy Dooley</b> asked the <b>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</b> if he will provide an update on the industrial relations issues at the CIE group of companies; the cost to the taxpayer of the proposed tendering of 10% of public transport bus routes; his plans to improve bus travel times in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2">I welcome the Minister; I think this is our first Question Time with him in the hot seat, as it were. I wish him well in his role.</p>
            <p eId="para_3"> In his first days as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, he was faced with the transport companies, particularly Irish Rail, on the verge of industrial unrest. The strike went ahead and I was disappointed that he took so long to involve himself in trying to find a resolution. Notwithstanding that, I ask him to update the House on the status of the industrial relations issue at the moment with the entire group of companies. He might also deal with the cost to the taxpayer of the proposed tendering of 10% of public transport bus routes, and any plans he, the NTA or the transport companies have to improve bus travel times in the Dublin area.</p>

            <p eId="para_4">I thank the Deputy for his good wishes. I look forward to working with him, Deputy Ellis and Deputy Halligan both here in the Chamber and in the relevant Oireachtas committees during the time ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> Irish Rail management, SIPTU and the NBRU recently engaged in further discussions with the Labour Relations Commission to avoid further disruption and damage to Irish Rail’s business. I am hopeful that the deal concluded on 3 September will be accepted by the employees and further disruption to services will be avoided. Cost-saving measures were agreed in Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann in 2013, which included temporary changes to terms and conditions for their employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> I am informed by the National Transport Authority that it expects the outcome of the tendering of 10% of public transport routes to commence in late 2016, with the same level of service at a reduced cost. In addition, competitive pricing of services will lead to benchmark pricing, which will inform the NTA on the appropriate cost of bus services.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> The NTA has statutory responsibility for the strategic planning of transport in the greater Dublin area. In the performance of that role, I am informed by the NTA that it is working with Dublin City Council to undertake a transport assessment study of Dublin city centre. I understand they expect to complete that study in the coming months and that the joint report will contain extensive proposals for enhancement of public transport movement within the city. It is intended that the report, when completed, be made available for public consultation and for consultation in the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">I wish to make one brief point in response to the final point the Deputy put to me. I know that Dublin City Council is working with Dublin Bus to identify particular issues in bus transport, and perhaps I can go into that in more detail with the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">I appreciate that the question has a number of parts and it is difficult to get it done in the time; that may be an issue for the House at a later stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> I have always raised concerns about the partial privatisation of certain routes within the network. We only need to look at the experience with London Bus. The Minister might not have had a chance to read himself into what happened with London Bus when it went down the privatisation route. On the face of it, it seemed like a good idea. It looked at the potential for reducing costs while maintaining the same service, but sadly that was not the case. While costs decreased, the service became degraded over time, and unfortunately, when the state had to re-involve itself to try to bring the service back to an acceptable level, it took a hell of a lot more money because, as a result of the poor delivery of service, notwithstanding the service level agreements, passengers effectively moved away from London Bus. We need to be careful to ensure that any action or misadventure by virtue of this privatisation will not result in such a modal shift away from public transport. I have real concerns about that and I ask the Minister to look at the London Bus experience to ensure he is satisfied that this policy decision is appropriate from his perspective.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_14">I am very much aware of the experience with transport in the London area and the role of Transport for London in that regard. I am very committed to the continued development of a high-quality bus service for the city of Dublin and well beyond that through Bus Éireann and through the role of private bus operators. That is why, in the Dublin area at the moment, Dublin Bus is undertaking a number of pieces of work in conjunction with the city council to improve the availability and quality of the bus service. I point to two pieces of work in particular: the work taking place in the Thomas Street and James's Street area, and the works under way in Drumcondra to put in place improved bus access down Drumcondra Road and into the city centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> On the future of the bus market in Ireland, I emphasise that what we propose is the tendering out for competitive contract of 10% of bus routes at the moment. I am committed to the role of a public bus service in the future. We are looking at 10% of those services. As those contracts are awarded, it will result in certainty over a five-year period for those routes and others. The sole reason this is being done is to ensure we have better availability, quality and diversity of services at the same or reduced cost to the taxpayer.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">When looked at in detail, it is more of an ideological decision than anything else. The Minister's party, when in opposition, talked a lot about effectively privatising the public transport network as it applied to Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. It was not possible with Iarnród Éireann, since it has no capacity to make profit. There seemed to be an agreement between Fine Gael and the Labour Party that at 10% everybody won. The Minister should be in no doubt that the hawks within his party want ultimate privatisation of the bus network. Ten percent, in terms of the cost savings, will be minimal. I have every expectation that the large companies that come in will meet their service level agreements for the five years and will carry any losses if necessary in order to do that. However, the long-term game here - this is what concerns transport workers - is about privatisation and the dismantling of a public transport network that has been built up over many generations. If the Minister continues with that policy decision, he is ultimately allowing a process to begin in which the endgame is very clear.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">I am not interested in implementing a policy based on being right-wing. I am interested in implementing the right policy, which is to put in place a mechanism regarding 10% of the bus routes with the sole objective of improving choice to passengers. As the Deputy is aware, under EU law we will be obliged to meet requirements regarding workers who will be affected by it. A series of rounds of discussion and structured engagement have taken place between the NTA and the bus unions on the matter. Before the summer, I wrote to the unions emphasising the importance of it, and three rounds of discussion have taken place. This is about putting in place an appropriate level of tendering to bring competitive tension into the market for the long-term benefit of everybody. Across the period of the difficulties in Irish Rail, I have made a commitment to go into the current round of budgetary negotiations and maintain subvention to the Irish Rail group, which we have not been able to do in recent years, in recognition of my respect for and understanding of the role of public transport companies. Where appropriate, we need to have a level of competitive tension for the benefit of passengers and everybody in the bus market in the long run.</p>

            <p eId="para_22"> In the past week, media sources have said the NTA and some people in the Minister’s Department are considering a plan to extend the Luas line on the north side of Dublin to Ballymun, Finglas and other places. Are there plans to do so? The Minister’s predecessor, Deputy Varadkar, indicated that there were no plans in this regard. Could the Minister elaborate on the media reports that are appearing?</p>

            <p eId="para_23">I thank the Deputy for his wishes and I, too, look forward to working with him. The National Transport Authority, NTA, has responsibility for the implementation and development of infrastructure projects in the greater Dublin area, such as the Luas light rail projects. The NTA is undertaking a technical consultancy study, entitled the Fingal-north Dublin transport study, to assess the long-term rail transport requirements of the north Dublin-Fingal corridor, extending from Finglas to Malahide and including Dublin Airport and Swords. This review is examining existing proposals, including the metro north, as well as other options for a rail-based transport solution to meet the area's needs in the long term. I expect to receive a report from the NTA on the outcome of the review by early 2015. I also expect at that time to receive the updated DART underground business case and the preliminary business case for the Swords/airport bus rapid transit, BRT, from the NTA. I will then consider the options for addressing key public transport deficits in the greater Dublin area, having regard to the outcome of the studies as regards costs, benefits, affordability and funding options, with a view to finalising a position by mid-2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Significant Exchequer resources will be required to advance any major project irrespective of the availability of private or EU funds. New projects cannot be funded within the existing level of resources available to my Department. The key priority over the coming years is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards. If additional funds are available, which is not certain, there will be many projects competing for these scarce resources. I will prioritise any additional funds for projects for which there is a clear need and which are affordable, have a sound business case and add value to existing infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">While I welcome the NTA's study, it is clear that north Dublin has been the poor man of the transport system. We have a vital area, the airport, to which we need a link. That could be through Ballymun, Finglas or Swords, and it is extremely important. As the Minister knows, because it affects his area, the metro north has already cost approximately €165 million. When the so-called Celtic tiger was in full roar, we were told it would cost €2 billion. Now, it would cost much less. We need to consider such a link. There is a suggestion that the line would go underground from Cabra to Finglas. Could the Minister elaborate on whether this is the case? We have the new station, which is a vital cross-city link. Is there anything in this?</p>

            <p eId="para_26">I am well aware of the need for improved public transport in that part of the city. As the Deputy knows, because his constituency is in the area, the population forecast for the region and the development already taking place indicate that public transport is needed now and that the need will grow in years to come. I am well aware of the social impact and economic cost of failing to provide it. In the study to which I referred, 20 projects for the north side of the city are being reviewed, which include existing options such as the metro north. With the amount of debate and contest that has taken place about which mechanism would be used and what it would cost, a study must be done to examine all the options and make a recommendation by way of a shortlist and a selected project. All of that is being done to bring clarity to the situation the Deputy has described.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">In the past, particularly with regard to the metro north, we were mainly examining the underground option. That was obviously a very costly way of doing it, but there are other ways, and I am sure the NTA is examining whether the project could go overground. There is another issue regarding the metro north. Many people along the route paid levies of €4,000 to €6,000, many of which are outstanding. Will we go down the same road of imposing fees on the basis of whether a route might be put through a certain area?</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> We need to examine the transport infrastructure across the city to the airport. Ours is the only capital city that does not have a transport link to the airport, which is a shame. I look forward to the NTA's review. Although cost is a major issue, getting this link right and examining how we transport people across the city must be a priority. There would be major benefits if we could transport people by Luas or metro.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">Our priority with the funding available is to maintain the infrastructure we have, including roads, and put our money into making them as safe and efficient as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">The future outlook is that, with the population growth we expect to see, particularly on the north side of the city, and the economic development taking place in that area, there will be a need for enhanced public transport in the future. That will require new funding from the Exchequer or the private sector, or both, as well as clarity on the best option for that part of the city.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> To reply to the Deputy's specific question on development levies for metro north, that project has been deferred and is currently on hold. One of the benefits of this process is that it will allow us to evaluate what the metro north plans would offer in comparison with other routes. I am aware of the money that has already been spent on the project, but I have to make the right choices in regard to taxpayers' money now and in the future. Issues arising in regard to Swiftway, the rapid bus transport system, are also being investigated in the context of developments in that part of the city.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">I wish the Minister well in his well deserved appointment. In the light of his clearly stated priority to keep the numbers of road fatalities and injuries down and taking into account the fact that alcohol is estimated to be a contributory factor in at least one in three fatal road collisions, I ask whether he will undertake to examine the proposals of the Brendan’s law campaign to introduce mandatory penalties for drink drivers involved in fatal accidents and automatically suspend the licence of a driver involved in a fatal accident who subsequently fails a breathalyser test. Other countries in the European Union already follow these stipulations and I am interested in hearing the Minister's remarks on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">I thank the Deputy for his kind words. Before I respond to his question, I offer my condolences to the families who have been affected by tragic deaths on the roads, specifically the family who were affected so tragically that they have dedicated their grief to doing all they can to ensure a similar fate does not befall other families. I acknowledge the grief and loss that lie behind the campaign to which the Deputy referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> This is a matter I take extremely seriously. The key to reducing the tragic loss of life and serious injuries on the roads is to continue to change driver behaviour. To date this year, 135 fatal collisions have been recorded, resulting in 140 fatalities.  While the number of collisions is down by five compared to this date last year and the number of fatalities is down by four, considerable work remains to be done to further reduce the number of fatalities on the roads and we can all play our part in achieving this aim.  Huge strides have been made in legislation in dealing with drink driving offences.  The introduction of mandatory alcohol testing has been a very effective intervention to improve road safety.  We have also introduced a reduction in the blood alcohol content level for drivers and all drivers involved in road traffic collisions where a serious injury has occurred are now obliged to provide a preliminary breath specimen.  </p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The proposal to automatically suspend the licence of a driver involved in a fatal accident who subsequently fails a breathalyser test in advance of a conviction in court cannot be implemented, given the rights of citizens to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of natural justice. My Department and I are willing, however, to meet the families who have been affected by this horrific incident to hear their proposals in more detail and discuss their concerns. I recognise the legitimacy and the grief that are driving the issues the Deputy raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">The Minister is undoubtedly aware of the publicity generated by Christine Donnelly, a mother from Waterford who lost her son, Brendan, in 2009 at the young age of 24 years. He was tragically killed one night while travelling with another family to Cork Airport. His friend, Liam, was also killed in the collision. Both families are here today. A man was later sentenced to five years imprisonment and disqualified from driving for 15 years as a result of the crash, after admitting dangerous driving. The court heard that prior to the accident he had consumed 20 beers, vodka and Aftershock, as well as snorting a line of cocaine. Christine is campaigning for what has become known as Brendan's law, that is, a change to current drink driving legislation in order that the licence of a driver who fails a breathalyser test is set aside without prejudice once he or she is charged. Brendan's law would also provide for mandatory sentences on disqualification for drink driving and being involved in a fatal accident.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> In the context of the Minister's commitment to improve road safety, is it reasonable that a driver who is involved in a fatal accident and fails a breathalyser test should be able to resume driving until the case comes before the courts? As I indicated previously, this is not the case in many countries in Europe. This is exactly what the families are seeking. I accept that the Minister cannot state he will change the law automatically, but it should be thought out and perhaps legislation might be introduced to amend the current law.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">I wish to make three points in response to the Deputy's questions. The first is that under our legal arrangements and constitutional order, it is a matter for the courts to make a disqualification order preventing a person from validly holding a driver's licence for a period of time. The second point concerns the number of people currently disqualified on the existing statutory basis. Some 12,248 people were disqualified as drivers on 29 September 2014 under the various legislative provisions available to us, from the Road Traffic Act 1961 to the recent Road Traffic Act 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> On the presence of drugs and the influence they can have, particularly where combined with alcohol, it is my intention to address this specific issue in the forthcoming road traffic Bill. From my meetings with the Road Safety Authority and organisations involved in measuring the substances contained in drivers' systems at the time of accidents, I have come to believe this is a very important issue that we must address legislatively.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">The families are not so much acting out of grief for those whom they have lost as making practical and common-sense proposals. Despite the reduction in the number of alcohol related fatal collisions, drink driving remains one of the biggest killers on the roads. Between 1990 and 2006, a total of 7,078 deaths occurred, of which a staggering 2,462, or 35%, were alcohol related. Behind each of these statistics is a broken hearted family who will never get over the tragedy completely. Irish law is inferior to that in other countries where penalties reflect the enormity of the offence. Successive Governments should be ashamed of a system in which criminals serve longer sentences for non-fatal offences than for killing someone through drink driving. The time for change is long overdue and I appeal to the Minister to consider this law. I am grateful to him for agreeing to meet the families. Perhaps when he hears what they have to say, he might consider amending the legislation at some time in the next few months or before the end of this Dáil.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">If the families are present, I will meet them briefly after this debate and will also arrange a proper meeting at a time that is convenient for them to discuss the matter further.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> On the track record of the country in regard to road safety, this and previous Governments have focused on dealing with the horrendous loss of life on the roads. I point to the setting up of the Road Safety Authority and the recent strategy established for it that has 144 actions. I meet the authority regularly to examine the implementation of these actions. Several weeks ago, I met with its board to discuss this very issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> At the nadir of this horrendous loss of life on our roads, 115 people lost their lives in 2001. In 2014, the total number of deaths on our roads has come down substantially. Still, too many people lose their lives on our roads. I have explained to the Deputy the constraints of our legal and courts system within which we must operate. I will meet the family after this, and my Department will do so again. I understand the family’s intention is to reduce the chance that the grief they have experienced will be inflicted on other families.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">My direction to the Commission for Aviation Regulation was issued in response to statements made by the commission in its draft determination that it had not received any directions or policy statement notifications by or on behalf of the Government.  Accordingly, it was necessary for me to formally clarify that ministerial directions issued previously to the commission remain in place.  It is also important that the commission takes on board current government policy. I confirmed to it that the draft national aviation policy, currently being finalised, is to be considered as a statement of present policy. Essentially, this is to ensure the new aviation commissioner is fully cognisant of the Government’s plans for Dublin airport in delivering the overall objectives for the sector and for the wider economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The direction I issued is very general in nature, confirming the status of Government policy and the need to protect the financial viability of Dublin Airport in order to implement that policy. However, it is within the commission’s discretion to decide how that is to be accommodated in the final determination. The capital investment plans proposed by the DAA are an operational matter for it in accordance with its statutory responsibilities.</p>

The process currently under way involves all of these stakeholders. I understand that the trustee and the principal employers have recently issued documents in respect of the proposed changes in pension arrangements. These communications mark the commencement of the formal consultation process which the trustee is required by the Pensions Act 1990 to undertake in respect of the reduction in benefits that it is proposing. Each member will also shortly receive a personalised illustration of future pension benefits that it is proposing. The target date for implementation of the proposals remains 31 December 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> Huge efforts have been put in by all concerned over many years in an attempt to resolve the scheme's funding problems. A set of proposals has now been put forward which offer the best chance to resolve the long-standing problems of the scheme and give the members certainty about their future pension entitlements. I urge all concerned to accept them.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">I understand the notion of the Government setting out a broad aviation policy to apply to all airports in the State. A regulator is needed in a sector where there is no effective competition. Accordingly, the regulator adjudges and makes determinations to ensure a balance between the big and the small. I cannot understand, therefore, why the Minister or his Department would have found it necessary to issue a direction, a communication or a policy statement that got into the minute detail of the operational plans of one particular airport. I believe that is an overreaching of the Minister's and his Department’s powers. It is not just Ryanair, as Aer Lingus has indicated its concerns about the Government’s involvement in the day-to-day operations of Dublin Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> Will the Minister explain further why the Government wants to get involved in the minutiae of the operations of one particular airport rather than the sector in general, an area in which I believe the Government, of course, has a role in setting a broad framework?</p>

            <p eId="para_54">The Deputy needs to make up his mind about me. On the one hand, he said I overstepped the mark when I got involved in the Irish Rail dispute, despite my recognising that there are industrial relations mechanisms in place which I must respect and allow to do their work. Now, on this matter, he claims I am getting too involved when I am acting inside the legal scope and parameters available to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> For the benefit of the record of the House, in the letter in question I referred to the role of Dublin Airport as an international gateway for Ireland, the desirability of terminal and runway facilities to promote direct international air links, and the sustainable operation of the airport on a commercial basis without recourse to Exchequer funding or an equity injection by the State. These objectives are laid out in our draft aviation policy. My ability to do that is recognised under section 10 of the Aviation Regulation Act 2001.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">In case the Minister was confused by my request and thought that one did not match with the other, my suggestion on the strike at Iarnród Éireann was that he needed to get on the record much earlier on providing subvention and increasing it in line with growth in the economy in accordance with demands. That is the Minister’s role and all that I suggested he do. I did not expect him to go to the Labour Relations Commission to resolve the issues. There are individuals in place to do that, but the Minister needed to participate in it for quite some time. The former Minister did the same in the past. In fairness to him, he put his hands in his pockets and commented from the sideline.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> As there is no direct subvention from the State to the airport sector, I thought it was inappropriate for the Minister to involve himself at a time when the DAA is challenging the aviation regulator on the amount of the charge it can levy and setting out its own stall without necessarily living within the envelope provided to it. Taken in tandem with the Minister’s communication, it can only be seen as undue interference. Ryanair, its legal advisers and Aer Lingus clearly believe that to be the case, which is regrettable.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> The Minister will also be aware that Aer Lingus believes that an increase in charges in line with his suggested policy may actually kill off the benefits created by the Government’s decision to axe the €3 travel tax. That is a direct statement from Aer Lingus and one which should give concern to all who have seen the upturn in tourism over the past several years, which has benefitted the State and the economy in general.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">The Deputy states that I should intervene in one area but not in another. The guiding principle I have is the legislation. I must act firmly within it and recognise and respect the structures and bodies that exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> In the last correspondence I had with Ryanair, it subsequently wrote to me interpreting the directions I issued as “pointless” and having no impact on the CAR’s draft determination. I am a child of Ryanair. When I moved over to the United Kingdom first, the cost of flying home to see my family and friends was prohibitive. I understand the positive effect and benefit it brought to our air travel sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> My duty, though, is to look at what the policy objectives are for Dublin Airport and to make the right decision in terms of the powers that are available to me, which I have done.

            <p eId="para_64">In November 2011, under the regional airports programme capital expenditure grant scheme, funds were allocated by my Department to Waterford Airport for the construction of a runway end safety area, RESA, which involves the purchase of land at the southern end of the airport to facilitate this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> As indicated previously, the CPO process for the purchase of this land is already under way. As part of this process, the matter was referred for arbitration with a hearing scheduled for 26 August 2014.

            <p eId="para_66"> Waterford Airport is making every effort to conclude the arbitration process. However, there are steps to be carried out under the CPO process which are outside their control.

            <p eId="para_67">I listened with great interest to an interview with Mr. Michael O'Leary of Ryanair on Today FM last week in which he was asked why Ryanair does not fly from Waterford Regional Airport. By the way, that is the airport which launched the airline, Ryanair. It will come as no surprise to the Minister that Mr. O'Leary replied that the runway is too short for commercially viable jets. For instance, it is not capable of landing a Boeing 737, of which model the whole of Ryanair's fleet is comprised.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> I asked the previous Minister the status of the compulsory purchase order of the 18 acres of land to facilitate the €150 million extensive works at Waterford for which the Department pledged upwards of €400,000. I note he previously told me that the board and management of the airport and the local authority had been engaged in a fund-raising exercise with the private sector to raise the necessary balance of €850,000. Has the Minister any news on that? Has that process advanced?</p>

            <p eId="para_69">I am aware of the challenges Waterford Airport faces. Its passenger numbers last year were 28,169, which is a notable decrease on where they had been historically. Currently, the airport operates two services a day to Birmingham and Manchester with Flybe. I also note that it has suffered the withdrawal of some services, which provides the background to why this issue is being examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> Waterford Airport has advised my Department that the airport board is committed to providing the necessary funds from local sources to fund the laying of an additional 150 m of runway and indications we have received from the chairman are that its target is €500,000 in relation to all of this. In light of the efforts that are being made in this matter by the airport board and by private sector stakeholders and local authorities in the region, my Department has confirmed to the airport our commitment to fund this piece of work and the associated purchase of land. As background, I should say that between 2013 and 2014 more than €900,000 in Exchequer funding has already been allocated to the airport for safety and security related projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">What is vital in securing the long-term viability of the airport is a direct service to London. While this piece of infrastructure is limited, it will facilitate direct flights to London.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> I note that a major report prepared not so long ago found that Waterford Airport supports up to 560 jobs, with 85% of businesses in the south east stating that direct access to the region was crucial for their operations. Based on the circumstances in Waterford which has a high unemployment rate and our attempt to attract businesses into Waterford in the long term, it is crucially important that all of the infrastructure, particularly the airport based on the assessment by businesses in and outside Waterford, is upgraded and, essentially, looked after by the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_73">I re-emphasise to the Deputy that €900,000 was provided via the Exchequer to the airport over recent years. On the specific purchase of land to which he refers, I understand that due to some of the difficulty that was involved in this land the local authority played the leadership role in trying to facilitate this through the use of a compulsory purchase order. That compulsory purchase order was then referred to arbitration, as is the right of anybody involved in that process. My information is that on 26 August an arbitration meeting was due to take place in this regard and for a number of reasons, that meeting was not held. On completion of this arbitration process, which must be respected because every stakeholder and party involved has a right to initiate it, the airport has confirmed that the land purchase and consequent creation of the piece of infrastructure to which we refer will be undertaken.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">Under the sports capital programme, SCP, funding is provided to voluntary, sporting and community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> I was delighted to announce €31 million in provisional allocations under the 2012 round of the sports capital programme. The Deputy will be aware that this had been the first round of the programme since 2008. The 2012 round of the programme attracted a record number of 2,170 applications. With such high demand, it was never going to be possible to fund all applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> I was pleased, therefore, to press ahead with a new round of the sports capital programme in 2014. Some 2,036 applications were received under the 2014 SCP, the second highest number ever received, illustrating the continuing demand and need for investment in sporting facilities. In July, I announced provisional allocations totalling €40.5 million. A total of 821 of the provisional allocations were towards local sports clubs and organisations, with the remaining 59 provisionally allocated to regional or national projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_79">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, on all the work he has done in his area, particularly with the sports capital grants programme. Am I to take it that it is his aspiration to have another round of sports capital grants? If so, and if it is a matter of having to reduce the budget, it would still be possible to bring a sports capital grants programme for next year with a reduced budget if one were to perhaps exclude some of the larger sporting organisations and focus only on the smaller, less popular sports. A little funding for a sport that does not require a significant amount makes a big difference, for example, a rowing club. I have received feedback from some in Dublin which were successful on the last occasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> It is important, if we are to go with a round in 2015, that if that is possible from a budgetary point of view we should go early. On the timing previously, while the grant is welcome, some clubs would appreciate receiving the funding early in the year so that they can get the infrastructure built in advance of the summer season when their particular sport might be played more.</p>

            <p eId="para_81">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I really hope there will be a further round of sports capital funding. The Deputy is quite correct to note that no such programme operated between 2008 and 2012, which put a lot of pressure on small voluntary groups nationwide. The Deputy also is correct that the provision of small amounts of funding to small clubs has worked well. The Government does not get any recognition for the larger funding amounts, but the smaller organisations are extremely thankful for the funding they receive as it puts in place highly valued facilities for them. I hope the Deputy and my colleagues, as well as the two Ministers who are present, will support me in this regard. I already have spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and am hopeful that I will secure another round of sports capital funding. The last two rounds of the sports capital programme have been recognised as being positive for sports and organisations. It was the first time for many years in which there were no major rows concerning the manner in which the money was distributed. While some people consider the <i>pro rata</i> system to be unfair, I believe it to be the best way forward. When the Government and I allocate this funding, we try to spread it among sports and to make sure that the smaller organisations get an opportunity in addition to the larger organisations. I reiterate my hope that a further round of sports capital funding will be secured and I look forward to the support of the Deputy and that of our colleagues to put pressure on the Government. It is good news for sport and for participation, and I hope another round will be secured.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">Funding for the rural transport programme, RTP, was €10.62 million, €9.79 million and €9.74 million in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, and has been €8.85 million to date in 2014. Total expenditure for 2014 is expected to be approximately €11.3 million, including one-off expenditures linked to the restructuring of the programme. Passenger journeys were 1.74 million, 1.73 million, 1.74 million and 1.14 million in 2011, 2012, 2013 and to the end of August 2014, respectively. The total numbers for 2014 are expected to be approximately 1.63 million. I will arrange for the National Transport Authority to send a breakdown of these figures on a county basis to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> The Deputy will be aware that the RTP currently is being restructured in order to protect the provision of rural transport services into the future. The restructuring involves the establishment of 18 transport co-ordination units in place of the existing 35 RTP groups that have provided the service up to now, to reduce administrative costs and to maximise spending on the provision of services. Responsibility for management of the RTP was assigned to the National Transport Authority with effect from 1 April 2012. This includes responsibility for implementing the restructuring of the programme. I have referred the Deputy's question relating to an update on the establishment of the transport co-ordination units to the NTA for direct reply and I ask him to advise my office if he does not receive that reply within ten working days.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> The Deputy should note that the rural transport programme is a high priority for me because of the area for which I now am responsible. I understand the difficulties and challenges that face people in rural Ireland, particularly those to whom the Deputy referred. It is very much a priority for me.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">I thank the Minister of State for these figures. While some of them are preliminary in nature - the usage figure for this year obviously must be extrapolated - from what the Minister of State has suggested, there has been an element of fall-off in usage. I suggest to her that this probably is in line with a fall-off in the funding and therefore, while I wish the Minister of State well in her new role, I urge her to fight the good fight, as it were, as the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has done in respect of sports funding. He has continued to make the case today and does so on a regular basis. Now that there is a level of growth in the economy, I similarly encourage the Minister of State, who hopefully will get the support of backbenchers in both parties, to ensure that both the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, are in a position to give some additional funding to try to get the programme back to where it was, notwithstanding the cost savings that are being made. It is vitally important that the spread and diversity of effort be maintained because so many people still need this service, for whom the reach and the extensions are not available. It is vital, but it will require more money. I hope the Minister of State wins the battle.</p>

Protection of the budget is of course the priority for me, and this will be dealt with in the budgetary process. I believe the Deputy will find that towards the end of the year, passenger numbers will actually remain the same or increase slightly. However, I assure him that I already have met the National Transport Authority and have asked it to examine areas within the rural transport system and what vision exists for it, and to ascertain what other services the system could expand to encompass in the future. I intend to visit the Deputy's constituency in the near future and I assure him that I will listen not only to my own colleagues but to Members of the Opposition as well, because this can only have a positive effect on rural Ireland.

            <p eId="para_98">I will take this opportunity to wish the new Ministers well in their new roles. The Wild Atlantic Way is a beautiful, idyllic and innovative tourist attraction. As Ireland's first long-distance touring route, it is a wonderful initiative and has great potential for expansion. Why does the Wild Atlantic Way not follow the entire Atlantic coast?</p>

            <p eId="para_99">While my Department provides the capital funding for investment in tourism projects such as the Wild Atlantic Way, it is not directly involved in developing or managing them. The development of the Wild Atlantic Way is a matter for the board and management of Fáilte Ireland. It is important to note that the Wild Atlantic Way was developed specifically for the western seaboard to address the decline in international visitors to the region. It builds on what is distinctive and appealing about the west coast - its rugged coastline and powerful ocean - to give it visibility in a congested international tourism market. The route was developed with the assistance of tourism consultants and regional steering groups. The steering groups comprised Fáilte Ireland, local authorities, local Leader and development companies and other key agencies such as Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">Fáilte Ireland is developing a similar unifying tourism proposition for counties in the east and the south. These areas share a strength in the richness of their historic environment, including Viking Waterford, Mediaeval Kilkenny and Brú na Bóinne. This is a work in progress and it is intended to form a complementary tourism proposition to the Wild Atlantic Way. The brand proposition will group the cultural and heritage tourism assets and experiences in the east and the south via a network of routes, trails and journeys in a new tourism experience that can easily be understood by and will appeal to overseas visitors. It is intended that the research, brand development and consumer testing will be completed during 2014 and the new proposition will be launched in early 2015.</p>

            <p eId="para_101">While I welcome the new initiative, I still believe my constituency of Cork East is missing out on what would be a much needed boost to the local economy. My home town of Youghal is situated at the mouth of the River Blackwater where it meets the Atlantic Ocean. It is a renowned tourist town which is steeped in history. Just half an hour away are the Jameson Distillery in Midleton, Cobh, Fota Wildlife Park, a beautiful golf resort and <i>Titanic</i> Port which the largest liners in the world visit on a regular basis. Does the Minister of State agree that it was a missed opportunity not to have included east Cork in the Wild Atlantic Way? It would have made more sense to include it in the initial marketing of the route. It is a positive brand and already has positive associations. It is impossible to recoup the lost revenue. It is like calling a part of Route 66 something else. East Cork should have been incorporated into the Wild Atlantic Way.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">I thank the Deputy. The Wild Atlantic Way has been one of the greatest initiatives undertaken by Fáilte Ireland and I compliment both it and everybody involved in it. This year unbelievable numbers of German, French and other international visitors have travelled on the Wild Atlantic Way. I recently heard a report on RTE - I sometimes wonder if it is always looking for negative stories - during which someone complained that we did not have a south-east initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">The Wild Atlantic Way runs along the west coast. It was put in place because for many years thousands of visitors had been lost to the west coast as there was no initiative to bring them there. This has been a record year in terms of the numbers who have come to the west and the country as a whole. I take the opportunity to say "Well done" to Tourism Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and my Department for the work they have done in the past three years. I met many people in Deputy Timmy Dooley's county of Clare over the summer who told me it was the best year they had had for 20 years. I visited west Cork recently and the discovery points offer a brilliant facility. When the project is finished, it will be fabulous. West Cork is beautiful. The Wild Atlantic Way is a rugged coastline which, I am sorry to say, does not extend to every corner of the country. We have to have what we sell. The area includes counties Clare, Galway and Sligo, but we are examining other facilities in the areas mentioned by the Deputy. That is why we are working in the south east to ensure facilities are made ready and enhanced.</p>

            <p eId="para_105">I disagree with the Minister of State. East Cork should have been included in the Wild Atlantic Way. We have a most beautiful coastline and so much to offer in terms of culture and tourism. In times of economic hardship that have affected many small rural businesses it would be a wonderful contribution to have a tourist attraction benefiting as many counties and areas as possible. There is no logical reason we should have a partitionist approach to tourism. Marketing the island of Ireland as a desirable destination makes sense. Has the Minister of State had any communication with government Departments or relevant bodies in the North on expanding the route? Does he agree that it could be cross-Border and incorporate as much of Ireland's beautiful scenery as possible?</p>

            <p eId="para_106">As the Deputy knows, Tourism Ireland is an all-Ireland body. We have meetings on a regular basis. The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and I have met Ms Arlene Foster, MP, MLA, and the Regional Development Minister, Mr. Conor Murphy, MP, MLA, on many occasions and there is very good co-operation between us. The Giants Causeway outside Derry will be included in the Wild Atlantic Way and the island of Ireland will be sold as such. One part of the island enhances the other; there is nothing wrong with marketing them in a different way. We have many landmarks on the island of Ireland. We have everything to attract visitors to come here, including culture and the rugged landscape of the Wild Atlantic Way. West, east and south Cork all have something to offer. That is why Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are working on more and more products to encourage thousands of visitors to come to the country. I am glad to say record numbers have come to the country in the first eight months of the year and long may it continue. Over 220,000 people are employed in tourism. The jobs are to be found are in every corner of every county. They are not confined to west Mayo or west Cork but can be located in east Mayo or east Cork. We need to bring visitors to the country and have a good product for them. The discovery and viewing points are being developed. The Government invested €8 million in the project last year, off which €2 million came from Fáilte Ireland. We need more money for capital projects. We want to have the best products in the world to bring people here and create jobs.</p>

Broughan</b> asked the <b>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</b> if he will provide an update on the actions he is taking to progress the enactment of section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010; and if he is seeking sanction, in conjunction with the Department for Justice and Equality, to have the necessary resources allocated in order that the outstanding technical and administrative issues to give effect to the section may be resolved.

            <p eId="para_108">I congratulate the Minister and the Ministers of State, in particular Deputy Ann Phelan. </p>
            <p eId="para_109"> Section 44 of the 2010 Act, as the Minister well knows, refers to the third payment option, whereby people who have been summoned to court to face a fine for penalty point offences can avail of a third chance to pay the fine before the matter goes to court. Recently people have found that that option is particularly important. The Minister provided figures for last year which showed that the vast bulk of people escaped conviction and penalty points. Both he and his predecessor have constantly quoted administrative and technical difficulties in implementing the section. Can it now be implemented?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_61" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_110">Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 provides, as the Deputy said, for the introduction of a third payment option within the fixed charge processing system. Under this mechanism, a person who is served with a summons for a fixed charge offence will have a final opportunity to pay the charge, of an amount 100% greater than the original penalty, not later than seven days before the court date on which the charge is to be heard. If a person takes up this option, proceedings are discontinued and he or she need not attend. The provision is intended to address those circumstances where persons receive a summons but state in court they did not receive the earlier fixed charge notice. Commencement of the section will also make it possible to commence a number of other linked measures designed to improve the enforcement of fixed charge notices.  </p>
            <p eId="para_111"> A subgroup of the criminal justice working group is continuing to examine how best to bring this provision into effect, including the substantial technical and administrative arrangements required, and has drafted an outline implementation plan, including a preliminary financial analysis. While it is not possible to indicate a precise date for implementation, this matter will be progressed as quickly as possible under the auspices of the working group.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">The reality is that the Minister's predecessor, the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, dropped the ball and did not implement the section. The issue has been ongoing since the previous Administration. There is a need for a sense of urgency. As I mentioned, a number of weeks ago the Minister told me that of the almost 48,000 people summoned to court in 2013 for offences attracting penalty points, only 11,055 had received convictions. In the first seven months of this year, of the 32,000 people summoned to court for these offences, only 7,977 received convictions. This is a real issue. As the Minister knows, the backdrop to it is provided by the road casualty figures for last year which, unfortunately, regressed and are regressing further this year. The Minister is now at the wheel in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">I acknowledge that it is very complex in relation to how the Minister's Department works with the Department of Justice and Equality, but there is an onus on him to ensure he is not coming back here to say the matter is administrative and technical. He must get the working group to report as a matter of urgency and then implement the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_114"> The Minister might come back to me on section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 2014 which provides for the taking of a specimen of blood in hospital from an incapacitated driver following a crash. When is it intended to implement that provision? People believe it is very important to deter the mayhem which, unfortunately, continues to happen on the roads.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">I agree entirely that we need to do all we can to reduce the numbers of casualties and collisions on the roads. I mentioned in response to Deputy John Halligan that the number of collisions, as at 30 September, was down by five on the same date last year, while the number of fatalities is down by four. However, far too many people continue to be seriously injured and lose their lives. I will have to come back to the Deputy on the specific question he put to me on section 12. I will write to him to answer his question on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> Regarding implementation of section 44, I have looked into exactly this issue. My predecessor, Deputy Leo Varadkar, was well aware of the urgency of it and no ball was dropped in relation to it. We are looking at how two very large and complicated systems come together. We have the summons system within the courts and the fixed charge processing system operated by An Garda Síochána. The two systems together generate hundreds of thousands of notices each year. I am reverting back to the subgroup to emphasise again the urgency that must be demonstrated to make this happen. However, it must be done within two parameters. First, it must be at an affordable and appropriate cost to the State and, second, the method of implementation developed must be one which does not put at risk the current level of implementation within the system and its current level of effectiveness.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">The Minister mentioned cost, but he will have seen in his briefing documents since becoming Minister that each fatality costs the nation over €2 million, besides the incredible and devastating impact on families. There is no question that the cost-benefit analysis would encourage him to implement the section urgently. While efforts were made at the justice working group under the Minister's predecessor and the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, there are still issues about how the Courts Service implements the penalty points legislation. The House has done its job in passing the legislation and it is now for the Courts Service and An Garda Síochána to enforce it and the Minister's Department to invigilate it. While I welcome the figures provided for the numbers of crashes and collisions this year, there is still an onus to ensure the two Departments work smoothly together and that people who have earned penalty points for careless driving and misbehaving with mobile phones, etc. have them applied to their licences immediately. I urge the Minister again to ask the working group to deliver on and implement section 44, as well as section 12 of the 2014 Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">I agree with the Deputy that there is no financial cost that is comparable to the cost of losing a life. I accept the point, but in order for me to see the project go ahead, I must see a final cost for it. There will be significant capital and current costs involved in a system that will be integrating two other systems which currently handle hundreds of thousands of cases each year and are integral to how this part of the justice system works. Whatever is recommended must meet two criteria. First, I must know what the cost will be. We must be satisfied once that cost is in place that it is an appropriate use of taxpayers' money. Second, we must put in place a system that will work at least as well as what is in place, although we obviously want to do something that will work a great deal better. I will do what I have said and communicate again to the working group in this area my intention to see this work completed promptly to ensure we put in place a system that will address the issue of which the Deputy and I are aware.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_119">I was saying that under section 5, the exclusion of employers with ten or fewer employees would have to be redefined. I have suggested the provision should include the annual turnover of companies to reflect the fact that some companies can be hugely powerful and influential, although their staff numbers may be low. It is also necessary to take into account the fact that some companies employ varying numbers of staff at different times of the year and may declare the size of their companies or groups for lobbying purposes at a time of the year when staff numbers are at their lowest. Therefore, there is the potential for misrepresenting the size and, more importantly, influence of an organisation. </p>
          <p eId="para_120"> Section 5 also lists exemptions from the regulatory requirements of the Bill. We welcome the inclusion of some categories such as "information sought by public bodies" and "communications relating to Trade Unions", but we will need further clarification and discussion on Committee Stage on the inclusion of vague terms such as "international relations" and "communications between public officials".</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> It is obviously of great importance that all relevant communications and actions that may comprise lobbying are included in the Bill to avoid the creation of loopholes. While section 5 outlines what is meant by "lobbying", the phraseology is vague. In the interests of transparency, it is important that digital communications and records of meetings are explicitly included in the definition. This would ideally include meetings at Government Buildings and meetings held elsewhere. The European Union has a register of lobbyists for the European Parliament and the European Commission. Groups on this register receive access badges for the European Parliament buildings. However, groups can avoid the register if individual MEPs sign them in or they hold meetings off-site.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">It is important that all groups are registered and that all meetings with groups on the register are open to scrutiny. Measures such as these might require changes to the Freedom of Information Acts and therefore we may have to revisit that.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> I welcome that section 19 of the Bill proposes to give the commission the power to authorise an investigation, request information and prosecute those who act in contravention of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> Section 14 of the Bill provides for delayed publication of the register. This comes into place where the registrant feels that the return made would be expected to have an adverse effect on, among other things, business interests in general or would cause a material financial loss or the loss of a competitive position to the person to whom the information relates. While I can to some extent appreciate the reason for including a measure such as this, I am none the less worried about it. As currently drafted, it is vague. It leaves too much room for manoeuvre and, frankly, an opening for abuse of the legislation. Any exemption of this nature must be absolutely unambiguous and more explicitly defined in the legislation. Anything that is open to a subjective assessment as to what is injurious or damaging to an individual's interests must be weighed and considered very carefully. That is something I hope to return to on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> Given our history and our contemporary experience of political corruption and of certain individuals having a disproportionate influence on policy makers, it is imperative that this legislation provide for an adequate cooling-off period for former public officials who wish to engage in lobbying activities. Section 22 provides for a period of one year only for this purpose. That is far too short. Other jurisdictions, such as Canada, that have enacted legislation regarding the registration and regulation of lobbyists have provided for a two-year cooling-off period. As the Minister is aware, a significant number of submissions throughout the consultation process also recommend that. In the interest of transparency and to avoid any conflict of interest, this period must be increased to two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> I have heard the Minister's argument in previous debates on this particular issue, and an exchange took place here yesterday which asserted that a longer cooling-off period would be a gross infringement of a person's constitutional right to work. I do not accept that. For people who act as public officials and for whom lobbying would represent a clear and material conflict of interest, two years is proportionate and reasonable. I do not accept that it would represent an onerous burden on them or an infringement of their constitutional rights. I cannot understand, given the experience of this State over decades and the documented evidence of wholesale political cronyism, corruption and abuse, any Minister or any State system so vigorously arguing the toss on a two-year cooling off period. I give the Minister notice that as far as I am concerned, that is a baseline requirement of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> The Minister of State, Deputy Nash, was not in the Chamber yesterday for the opening part of this Second Stage debate, which I welcome, because it is necessary that we regulate lobbyists. It is a positive move that finally we have this legislation, but yesterday I raised with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, what I believe is the alarm, concern and disgust of citizens across this State at the turn of events in recent weeks, not just the appointment of Mr. McNulty to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, but also what is now a litany of stories about political appointments to the Irish Aviation Authority and, it seems, to SOLAS. There was commentary on appointments made to the governing board of University College Dublin, all of those politically inspired and motivated.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> I have raised consistently in the House the issue of State board appointments with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and he has told me consistently that I was making a fuss about nothing. He told me consistently that the democratic revolution had arrived and that matters were resolved. We now have irrefutable evidence to the contrary and it is now clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that not just Fine Gael but the Labour Party also regard appointments to State boards as either a leg up for their political cronies or a consolation prize for other political associates who have failed in various electoral contests.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> The Minister has very belatedly brought forward a memorandum to Government, so it seems that all the responses he gave to me and others in this Chamber on this matter assuring us that all was well were far from factual and far from the truth. Unless we get that matter straightened out, and until the moment it is irrefutably the case that every appointment to a State board goes through a public process that is transparent and that appointments are made on the basis of merit alone, any talk of rooting out cronyism or corruption or of a democratic revolution is fanciful rhetoric.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> I come back to this point as I finish my contribution to this debate, because I believe there must be a legislative infrastructure to safeguard public processes, to ensure there is a level playing field and fair play, and to rebuild the confidence of citizens in the democratic structures and the basic democracy of this State. However, it is farcical to trumpet legislation, whether it is freedom of information reform or this registration of lobbyists legislation, while the nod-and-wink culture is alive and well within this Government, consisting of the same people who were correctly critical of former Administrations led by Fianna Fáil for precisely this type of behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> In debating, hopefully amending, and adopting this legislation, we have to do it in a context and on the basis of an understanding that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour Party political patronage must now draw to a close. It must be done, and it must be seen to be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_137"> I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this new legislation, the Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014, which I warmly welcome. If legislation comes before the House that people support, it is important that it is supported here. I welcome the legislation because it is relevant to the debate on what has taken place this week and all the cronyism that still exists in this country despite all the talk of reform during the last election. During the last election campaign, I recall clearly not only the Government parties but all Deputies telling people at their doors that they represented reform, change, accountability and transparency. Those were their buzzwords, because people had had enough. The entire system needs to be radically changed and reformed, yet we have had more of the same this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">When debating the Registration of Lobbying Bill, it is important to focus on the positive aspects of the legislation and the broader issues. People either support a meritocracy in any democratic society or do not. If people are competent in the field, they should be nominated and supported. This should be done as a matter of urgency. I do not say this lightly because, in the past, we saw tribunals and scandals in Irish politics. This must be cleaned up. For many years, Ireland was known as the land of saints and scholars, then it became known as the land of tribunals, cronyism and scandals. This must change now. Reform, accountability, transparency and straight politics are needed in this country. This should be the priority issue for the Government and all political parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> It saddened me to see the shenanigans with regard to the Seanad and the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA. I remarked to myself that this is the same Government that wants to organise a banking inquiry. I would not trust many people in this respect. If they cannot handle a Seanad issue professionally and objectively and cannot handle a nomination to a board, many people wonder whether people in the cross-party group will be able to handle the banking inquiry. It is something we must seriously examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> With regard to legislation on lobbying, it is important to focus. We must be careful about the democratic, open, honest lobbying that goes on in Irish society. I came across two examples in my constituency this week. I was asked to visit a local school, Belgrove Senior Girls School in Clontarf, to meet the staff and discuss class size and education for children with special needs. It was effective lobbying and did not cost any money. The public representatives met the local teachers and parents to discuss the importance of reducing class size and stopping cuts to education. That was honest lobbying. Following that meeting, I ended up in ChildVision on Gracepark Road, which is in my constituency. It is a centre for visually impaired and blind children. I met children who were visually impaired and physically and intellectually disabled. That group lobbied me and it was an example of good lobbying.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> On the other side, we have the Taoiseach's gross mishandling of the nomination of Mr. John McNulty. It is an example of a tacky scandal, cronyism and bad lobbying. This is only the tip of the iceberg. We need reform of the whole system. We must root out the insiders and bring in people who are competent. It applies to NAMA and the recent opportunity when my friend, Deputy Shane Ross, tabled legislation dealing with the Judiciary. We must examine these reforms. People must trust and have confidence in people.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> It was interesting to hear the Government running around saying that Mr. McNulty was highly qualified but got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. I challenge that. There are many good quality people in the art world who would give an arm and a leg to get onto the board of IMMA. Artists involved in the sector would give their right arms to be involved in the board. I would like to do some lobbying for such people. If there are good people in education, music and the arts, and the disability sector, they should be put onto the relevant boards involved in providing services. Many of them are doing it out of a sense of public service. They are not looking for freebies, jaunts in cars or €15,000 per year. There are many quality people who are members of boards in the State and they do a fantastic job. They do not get any money and they do it out of a commitment to public service. They want to give something back to society. Let us make sure that these people are not labelled. I have seen examples of great practice in this regard. A classic example is the directors of the Northside Centre for the Unemployed on Glin Road in Coolock, Dublin 17. They are all voluntary members and they give their time and support to the local community. They get no freebies or trips. Many good people do voluntary work and it must be encouraged. They are also very talented and the Government must wake up to this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> Although it seemed like I was going off message, I will stick to the legislation. Ireland lacks specific legislation regulating lobbying. This came up in the final report of the Mahon tribunal, which observed that such legislation:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_144">...is likely to decrease the corruption risks associated with that activity by increasing transparency and accountability in the policy making process. Such regulation would not however, adversely affect the positive role played by lobbyists in the political system. On the contrary, it could well help promote a more positive perception of that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">It is important to mention that in respect of what arose in the Mahon report. One of the reasons I am supporting the legislation is the following important point. The final report of the Mahon tribunal made five recommendations about lobbying, namely, that professional lobbyists be subject to registration requirements and that professional lobbyists be regularly required to disclose at a minimum the identity of their clients, the objects of their lobbying activity, and the details of the public institutions and public officials being lobbied. It recommended that professional lobbyists should be required to adhere to a statutory-based code of conduct. These recommendations were made at the time of the Mahon tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> I welcome the legislation, which is part of the process of cleaning up the system. We all received a mandate for reform at the last general election and we were also lobbied about accountability and transparency. It is important that we know and identify the people involved in the industry. I note that recent research identified 401 organisations that could potentially engage in lobbying. The research did not include or sample private firms but included business associations, comprising 37.9% of the 401 associations; NGOs, 30.2%; professional associations, 21.2%; and labour and agricultural associations, comprising 4.2%. These are the organisations directly involved in the trade. We met many of the open transparent and democratic organisations, such as farmers groups, education groups, teachers groups and disability groups that are openly and sensibly lobbying. I welcome the legislation and I would like to see more of these kinds of Bills coming before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">This is one of the Bills that members of the Opposition are almost compelled to welcome because the principles behind it are unarguable. The problem is whether the Bill goes far enough. We welcome the Bill because of some of its provisions but it is minimalist in its approach. Lobbyists tend to be unpopular and we tend to think of big business, the gun lobby in America, the tobacco lobby and other powerful bodies that have managed to control politicians in a way that I hope does not exist here. However, the slow welcome given by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, to the Bill is indicative of the fact that there are, within IBEC, bankers, other big businesses and monopolies that are slow to represent any restrictions on lobbyists.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> I regret that and it is part of the reason this Bill does not go far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> I wish to address not just the issue of lobbyists for big business but the issues which have attracted so much attention in recent weeks, the issue of lobbying for jobs, a subject which for some reason is not part of this Bill. Anyone from a rural constituency will be familiar with the actions of many people who come to constituency offices or go to politicians' clinics and lobby for places in the Judiciary, who lobby for seats in the District Courts and are given them by virtue of the patronage which this Government and all Governments hold in that area. This Bill is part of a pattern which we hope will be added to when the Minister introduces his memorandum about semi-State bodies but it would have been preferable if all lobbying for State positions and in particular for positions in the Judiciary were included in this Bill. I would prefer to see that lobbying not just of politicians but lobbying by politicians were included in this Bill so that a complete record of communications made by politicians when they are looking to see that their pals receive crucial jobs, is on the record. That would put a fast end to the sort of activities we have seen in recent weeks. Why do we not see the hidden hand which controls these jobs which for decades have been given as part of the spoils of war by Ministers to their pals?</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> I am unable to envisage the legislation which it appears is about to be introduced in November or the new rules to tackle this particular problem. I can see that it will address it cosmetically and I am not reassured at this stage by the words of the Minister yesterday when he said that criteria would be published on the website, that weightings would be applied and names published and that the process would be in the hands of the public advertising system which is being set up. The problem is not being addressed at all. The problem so obviously apparent but not recognised in what the Taoiseach or the Minister said yesterday is that we can no longer trust Ministers to make the choice of appointments. We know that and we know also that we have seen totally and utterly cosmetic systems put up by the present Government to disguise the fact that all the old rackets are still going on, that it is still appointing people <i>ad nauseam</i>, not just to semi-State bodies but to other bodies. It is not sufficient for people on the Government side to say in the media, "We have appointed 200 people through the public appointments system, the new public application and advertising system". I do not think I am in order to name people but some of them turn out to be former Fine Gael Deputies; they go through the system but they are still chosen because the Ministers make the choice. I was alarmed when I heard that the Ministers will get a list from which they will then choose someone who is experienced enough and has the expertise, as decided by politicians who have disgraced themselves in this particular field in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> It is not just semi-State bodies that should be attacked but it is also the Judiciary. I could name but I will not do so-----</p>

          <p eId="para_158">That is perfectly reasonable and I am perfectly happy with that ruling. It is the case that people who happen to be running mates of people holding the highest office in the land have ended up in the Judiciary as have people who have been Members of the European Parliament. This is not acceptable if it is not done transparently and it is not being done transparently. The proposed measures appear to be restricted to semi-State bodies or agencies. I do not believe they will attack that problem which is deeply embedded in one of the most sensitive areas of this State. Judicial appointments should no longer be part of the spoils of war; they are and they have been.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> What about appointments such as to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the EBRD? That is one of the plum jobs which are handed out by successive Governments. It has been ruthlessly used to promote politicians who have no experience of banking but who usually have retired from this House while one or two of the others have been identified exclusively with the political party in power. The most recent appointment carries a salary of £172,000 per year which is taxed at a preferential rate. There was no interview. I do not know whether that job involved lobbying but it was given to someone who could not be described as a sympathiser with anybody on the Opposition benches but to someone who had a record of being an adviser to several Ministers in a rainbow Government. That practice will continue unless we take appointments of this sort - not just to semi-State bodies - out of the political arena. As Deputy Finian McGrath referred to in his contribution one has only to note the response to Private Members' Bills brought forward by both Sinn Féin and Independents, from both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and Labour, to realise that they intend to keep their hands on the lever of cronyism, even if they intend to disguise it with well camouflaged legislation and rules in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_160">I welcome that on foot of the recommendations from the Mahon report that the lobbying of public officials, Ministers and their Departments is to be regulated in this Bill. The public will be able to see which individuals and interests are lobbying which Departments and the specific individuals in each Department, as well as being able to examine the motivation for the lobbying and the extent to which it is carried out. However, the legislation does not guarantee that particular lobby groups will not be able to unduly influence Departments contrary to the wider public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> The legislation falls far short of what the Government promised in the programme for Government which stated that there would be a cooling-off period of two years before any former Minister or Government official could lobby former colleagues still employed as public officials. </p>
          <p eId="para_162">Instead, the legislation provides for a one year cooling off period during which an ex-Government official can still work for an interest group which lobbies the Government. However, he or she will be obliged to apply to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, for an exception to be made in order to allow him or her to lobby ex-colleagues still working within government during the cooling off period. If the ex-Government official is dissatisfied with the decision of SIPO, he or she will have the right to appeal. Surely the integrity of the legislation would be strengthened if there was a complete ban, in all circumstances, on former Government officials carrying out any lobbying work for the two year period promised by the Government when it entered office.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> The non-governmental organisation Transparency International has expressed concern to the effect that, despite the new regulatory regime, there will be no actual disclosure of information shared between the Government and individuals from lobby groups. This calls into question how effective SIPO will be in delivering the highest standards of transparency in the relationship between special interest groups and the State if the records of such meetings are not open to public scrutiny. </p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The independence of SIPO is to be questioned. Last year I lodged a complaint with it in respect of the "Prime Time" programme on which the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, might have breached the code of behaviour for public office. It proved extremely difficult to obtain satisfaction from SIPO. Essentially, the commission found that it did not believe the matter was one of significant public importance and, thus, what had occurred was not a specified act which came within its remit for investigation. Sadly, it interpreted the legislation in a very timid way and this allowed it to defend the then Government Minister in the process. No reasons were given as to why the commission did not see the matter as one of significant public importance. Surely this is unsatisfactory, particularly as it is a fundamental principle of law that one is entitled to a clear, reasoned decision. If this was not the case and reasons were not provided, no one would ever be able to challenge a decision as being unreasonable or irrational. When I telephoned Mr. Brian McKevitt of SIPO, he informed me that I was not entitled to a copy of the report on the inquiry into the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_171"> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has stated his intention "to strengthen the degree of openness and scope for public scrutiny of the interactions and engagements between all sectors of society with the political and administrative systems. This legislation will allow the wider public to reach informed evidence-based judgments about the extent to which different interest groups are accessing key decision makers across the political and public service systems." Members of the Government have previously expressed such sentiments in even harsher and more combative tones. In 2011, not too long after coming to office and in the context of the findings of the Moriarty tribunal, the Taoiseach stated he would "sever the links between politics and business once and for all and, in so doing, achieve three fundamental goals: stop the further pollution of our society; re-establish a moral code and order regarding public life; and, through that, restore public confidence in politics and government." In view of recent episodes and what we have learned of late, these words seem to ring hollow.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Later in 2011, instead of cutting the links between politics and business, the Taoiseach seemed to strengthen them when he and the Government invited Mr. Denis O'Brien to attend the Global Ireland Forum.

          <p eId="para_176">The Moriarty tribunal revealed a series of payments to representatives of Fine Gael who had assisted the gentleman in question to win a lucrative mobile phone licence contract for his company Esat Digifone. The profits from that contract assisted the individual to whom I refer to become a multimillionaire. This link between business and politics was still awaiting severance when the Taoiseach was photographed with the same gentleman at the New York Stock Exchange in 2012.

          <p eId="para_197">This is crazy. We are discussing lobbying and how people involved in business who have close links with the Government of the day may gain favour. I am not stating such individuals will always gain favour, but they may gain it on occasion. Do we scrutinise matters to ensure everything is done in a proper manner? I do not believe we do. Will the Bill address that problem? Again, I do not believe it will. It was only brought to my attention yesterday that a personal friend of the Taoiseach had been appointed to the board of Sustainable Energy Ireland. Perhaps that man deserved to be appointed or perhaps he did not. Was this cronyism or was it in the best interests of the State? The difficulty is that we do not actually have a mechanism to check. What the people realise is that one can still buy favour. Allowing people to have access to Government officials without there being proper scrutiny of what occurs means that nothing is going to change. All the talk about reform on the back of which the Government came to office in 2011 has proved to be nothing short of a joke, as nothing has changed. The established parties have proved to be so similar that it is not funny.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill. The need for legislation to regulate lobbying was well identified in the final report of the Mahon tribunal. I am glad that the Government has taken the necessary steps to make the lobbying system more transparent. The report of the Mahon tribunal noted that professional lobbyists should be registered and obliged to reveal the identity of their clients, the objective of their lobbying activity and details of the public institutions being lobbied on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">The need for a statutory-based code of conduct was highlighted as was the fact that senior officeholders should be required to record and publish details of their contacts with professional lobbyists.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Prior to the publication of the report but following evidence given in the course of the Mahon tribunal the need for a regulated system of lobbying was evident. That is why the Government undertook to regulate lobbying as part of its commitment on political reform and as part of the programme for Government. It is interesting to note that the last five efforts at legislating in this area failed. No further delay should be entertained in dealing with the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> The aim of the Bill is to ensure greater openness and transparency on public policy formulation, development and decision-making. However, we must ensure that the process is not too convoluted or cumbersome to the point where non-professional lobbyists or members of the public are dissuaded from contacting their local representatives or Ministers in respect of a topic that interests or affects them.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> I am pleased to note that the legislation is underpinned by the ten principles for transparency and integrity in lobbying developed by the OECD, in particular, the second principle of the code which aims to ensure a good fit with political culture. One of the strengths of Irish political culture is the high level of access the public has to political representatives. There is nothing in the Bill that will necessitate a reduced level of access. The most important element of the OECD ten principles is the fostering of a culture of integrity. This includes a cooling-off period before Ministers, senior officials or political advisers can take up a position in the private sector that may present a conflict of interest with a previous public role. Through voluntary codes of conduct efforts have been made to increase transparency but only putting these on a statutory footing will ensure real progress can be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Defining a lobbyist is the first task of the Bill. Lobbying is defined by the activity rather than the person and I believe this is the correct approach. The lobbyist is an employer or person who, in the course of his business and in return for payment in money or money's worth, makes, manages or directs communications to a designated public official in respect of a relevant matter. The development or rezoning of land is to the fore in terms of relevant matters especially in view of the events of recent years, in particular the events investigated by the Mahon tribunal. However, I believe that in future more concern will be placed on attempts to modify public policy, prepare legislation, award licences and arrange exemptions to various systems. In the coming years I anticipate that issues such as wind farms, fracking, telecommunications licences and control of tobacco, alcohol, gambling and gaming are the areas that will form the nexus between politicians and lobbyists. It is imperative that a clear legislative framework is in place to avoid conflicts of interest and to allow the public to access information of the lobbying process.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> There are several exemptions to the legislation and if the Bill is to function effectively these should be communicated widely. Exempted communications include those made in the proceedings of an Oireachtas committee, where they could pose a danger to the security of the State. They also include information made to a public official in response to a request by that official or communications between members of a relevant body appointed by a Minister or public service body for the purpose of reviewing any public policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> One element of the Bill that I question relates to where a person ceases lobbying permanently. If a person ceases lobbying he can notify the Standards in Public Office Commission and the change will be stated on the register, but he will not be deleted from the register even though he need not make any more returns. It is only fair that if someone ceases lobbying permanently then after a period of three or five years his name should be deleted from the register. Otherwise, the register would become useless, clogged up with people who worked as lobbyists ten, 20 or 30 years ago. This would take from the transparency of the register and work against the object of the legislation. This aspect should be reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Irish farm organisations have expressed some concern in respect of the Bill taking the view that it may be impractical, unworkable and prohibitively costly. However, most of the interaction between the IFA and politicians is conducted by unpaid individuals and I do not believe that the current system would be too cumbersome for interest groups, whether farming, environmental or other interest groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> The Bill is long overdue and represents a step towards greater transparency in government. However, just as an earlier version in Australia needed to be updated because it proved unworkable, the current legislation will only be effective if it results in a change in mindset in respect of contact between professional lobbyists and public representatives.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_209">I welcome the passage of the Bill through the Dáil. This important Bill has the potential to make Irish public life more transparent and accountable. The Bill encapsulates the new approach to the legislative process introduced by the Government. The legislative journey of the Registration of Lobbying Bill did not begin on its publication on Friday, 20 June this year. In 2012 the government reform unit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform commenced reviews of the international approaches to regulate lobbying. This involved significant consultations. Then in April 2013 the Government approved the drafting of the Bill and the general scheme was published. This was, in turn, examined by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, which held hearings on the Bill as part of the new pre-legislative scrutiny stage. All of this points to a desire for greater transparency and accountability. To be clear, I welcome the Bill and the aims and ideals contained within it.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> However, the Bill gives rise to several issues. One is the role of a Deputy and the close proximity of a public representative in Ireland to the electorate. This proximity is one of the main positives of the proportional representation with a single transferable vote electoral system. The Bill will stipulate that a firm with more than ten employees must declare itself and register as a lobbyist even if its representative is only contacting the local Deputy about a problem such as an access road to a business premises. That is my interpretation of the Bill anyway and it is a matter of concern. Let us suppose someone from a business employing several people wants to go to the local council, Deputy or Minister to explain about a bad bend in the road preventing trucks from coming up or down. Is that lobbying? Must that firm register? It is an important matter for the firm but not a major issue of public interest. My reading of the Bill is that such activity would have to be declared.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> Many companies and business people are private and have no wish to declare whether they have political allegiance. They may have no wish to say that they went to a local Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin or Labour Party councillor, Deputy or Minister. That is one of my concerns. Must a firm register this even if it is a big issue for the firm but not a major issue of public interest? It could be a safety issue or something that could improve the business, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Another issue is the problematic definition of lobbying. Naturally, lobbying includes efforts to influence the policy process, legislative action or Government action. However, the term lobbying can be viewed through a far wider lens. Government policy is influenced by public opinion. Public opinion is influenced by myriad opinion pieces, newspapers, online news sites, television and radio. Almost all such action seeks to influence Government policy in some way. Therefore, is this activity not lobbying?</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Another activity which could certainly be described as lobbying is philanthropy. There are many organisations in Ireland and abroad which attempt to shape or influence public and Government policy. The majority are dedicated and their bona fides could not be questioned. Whether I agree with the aims of the organisation is secondary. The wealthy individuals funding these groups and organisations are lobbying and trying to shape society in a way that they see fit and that is lobbying. However, only the organisation not the funders would have to declare and register under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> There are other areas of the Bill that I hope will be addressed as it continues along the legislative process, including grassroots lobbying. In other countries certain groups can be exempt. In some cases grassroots lobbying or lobbying by religious organisations is not considered lobbying for the purposes of making a return in the United States. The USA has a huge lobbying industry but it has exemptions for certain areas. A similar situation exists in the provinces in Australia, whatever about at federal level. Does every group or organisation that is part of a charity have to register every time a representative meets a Deputy?</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> The following circumstances are exempted: communications by or on behalf of an individual relating to his or her private affairs on any matter other than development or zoning under the Planning and Development Acts or relating to any land apart from the individual's private principal residence. Zoning has been an issue. We have a long and problematic history in this country in respect of zoning. When I was a councillor I would have been in favour of many zonings or supportive of a particular zoning without ever having met the party concerned. Subsequently I could have met an owner or engineer working on behalf of a landowner. That is fine and the contact must be registered under the Bill. However, what is the position if I subsequently support that zoning? Perhaps I was going to support it anyway because I believed it was right for a town or village. This need not be residential zoning; it could apply to industrial or enterprise zoning or other things.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Is the public perception suddenly that because I met an engineer or the landowner and I voted for the Bill I was bought off or that I voted in this way because I was lobbied? In many cases, members voted in that way because they felt it was the right thing to do for their town or village and would have voted in that way in any case. I have a concern about that provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> The second exemption relates to communications by or on behalf of an employer with not more than ten employees relating to the affairs of the employer in any matter other than the development or zoning of land under the Planning and Development Acts, 2000 to 2014, which is broad. Employers may want to construct an extension to a building and to meet to discuss a planning application. They do not want to show their allegiances or state they went to the local party representative. If they choose not to go down that line, do they then say they will not bother going through with the development? That is a concern. The exemption applies to companies with not more than ten employees. If somebody has 11 employees and wants to talk to his or her local representative about something, this has to be registered.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> Relevant matters under section 5(7) are defined as any matters relating to "the initiation, development or modification of any public policy or of any public programme ... the award of any grant, loan or other financial support...". Is a sports group seeking to speak to a public representative about a sports capital grant covered by this provision? Is the local school board of management seeking to speak to a public representative about building a school extension covered by it? There remains a great deal to be teased out as the Bill goes through the House. I welcome its thrust, but there are many issues to be sorted out.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanKenny" eId="spk_114">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kenny<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_219">Lobbying has an important role to play in helping to ensure all perspectives, assessments and opinions are presented and available to inform decision-making in key areas of public policy and legislative proposals. I strongly welcome the Government's decision to introduce the Bill to the House, as it marks an important step in the process of helping to rebuild public trust in the political system by throwing light on its interaction with those who seek to shape and influence policy across all sections of society. The intention of the legislation is to strengthen the openness and scope for public scrutiny of the interactions and engagements between all sections of society with the political and administrative systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The Bill will enable the wider public to reach informed evidence-based judgments on the extent to which interest groups are accessing key decision makers across the political and public service systems and increase public understanding of lobbying activity in Ireland. The legislation also clarifies what is a "designated public official". It includes Members of the Oireachtas, Ministers and Ministers of State and their special advisers, councillors and MEPs. I understand it is envisaged that, on commencement, the Bill will apply to communications with officials at Secretary General and assistant secretary level in the Civil Service and equivalent levels in local authorities. The Minister may prescribe further public servants as designated public officials and will have regard to the public interest in arriving at a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> The legislation will provide for a register of lobbying to make information available to the public on the identity of those communicating on specific policy, legislative matters or prospective decisions with designated public officials. The Bill allows for the development of a code of conduct by the Standards in Public Office Commission and also provides for restrictions and conditions on the taking up of certain employments by certain designated officials for a specified time where a possible conflict of interest arises. An example of this in the past decade was county managers retiring and immediately taking up positions working for property developers. That issue needed to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> The legislation also states a lobbyist must be registered before carrying on lobbying activities unless it is his or her first time to lobby. In that case the registration and return must be completed before the next return date.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> A regular review of the effectiveness of the legislation is provided for. The first review should be held no later than one year following commencement of the legislation, with each subsequent review to be held every five years thereafter. Reports on the findings and recommendations of these reviews will be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas within six months of the end of the relevant period.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> The legislation establishes that lobbying activity is carried out by persons in the course of their business in return for payment by a client, an employer or his or her employee on behalf of the employer, or any person on matters about the development or zoning of land. It defines the communications that constitute lobbying and those that are excluded. It also determines that normal citizen interaction with public representatives relating to a person's private affairs or communications by employers with ten employees or fewer relating on the affairs of that employer will not be included in the register unless the communication is in respect of land zoning or development.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Planning matters relating to an individual's principal private residence will be exempt and the legislation also sets out other exemptions to the regulatory requirements in the Bill. Such exemptions include those relating to international relations, factual information sought by a public body or other information sought by and published by a public body, matters posing a threat to the safety of persons or the security of the State, communications between public officials acting in an official capacity and communications between members of a group established by a Minister or a public body subject to a requirement to comply with a transparency code.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> When lobbying is mentioned, I always think of the Mahon tribunal and the lobbyist Mr. Frank Dunlop who played a starring role in both the Mahon and Flood tribunals. He sent me lobbying material in the 1990s in respect of the Penine Holdings development in Baldoyle, which figured in the Mahon tribunal, and a development near Clare Hall on the Malahide Road in the Dublin City Council area. I recall that on one occasion the maps he sent were completely wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> I am happy that this legislation is before the House. Lobbying plays an important role in politics, but it also has the potential to be badly and seriously abused. I witnessed this in my constituency when the lobbying process was used to facilitate corruption, as evidenced by the Mahon tribunal. The Bill will help to shine a light on the lobbying industry and I strongly commend it to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_228">I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which is timely. It has been needed for a long time. I always have reservations about having more regulation because sometimes we catch the wrong people in the net and a great deal of bureaucracy is created for those who are acting properly to try to catch those who abuse the system. However, I have no doubt that it is important to regulate lobbying.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> We often hear comments in the media about the Whip system. One of the reasons I favour the system which we all enter into voluntarily in political parties is it prevents powerful interests lobbying and manipulating individual Deputies to their own ends. The notion that the country would be immune to the type of lobbying that occurs in other places is innocent. Would we, for example, be immune to the power of the drinks industry, the tobacco industry or many other powerful industries that seek to influence legislation in this House? We all know the method employed by lobbyists in other jurisdictions where politicians have a free vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I refer to the method of picking off people one by one, either through inducements, flattery or targeting their seats, which is a particular risk in our system of multi-seat constituencies. </p>
          <p eId="para_231"> When considering this issue in its totality we must try to ensure that lobbyists are not able to exert undue influence in the system. I confess that I have something of an allergy to professional lobbyists, regardless of whether they had worked previously with Ministers or in Departments or somewhere else. If one has a case to make, one should be able to make it. It always surprises me to see charities employing professional lobbyists given that charities can easily gain access to politicians. None of us would ever refuse a meeting with a charitable organisation seeking to outline its case. </p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Not many organisations used lobbyists when I was a member of the Government. During that time, one had information sessions in places such as Buswells Hotel, which were organised by representatives of the motor industry, the drinks industry, which has been highly active in recent times, and to a much lesser extent the tobacco industry. Deputies will be familiar with industry lobbying from these types of events. A large number of charitable organisations have also made a good case to politicians over the years. For some reason, however, a small number of them use lobbyists to do so. Organisations that sought, through a lobbyist, to arrange a meeting with me while I was a Minister did not get a meeting half as quick as they would have if they had approached me directly. I always prided myself in agreeing to meet groups expeditiously.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Recently, while attending a presentation arranged by a certain organisation, I pointed out to its representatives that it was not necessary to employ someone to come to the House to try to influence me and that they should instead make their point themselves. I also stated that it made me suspicious to see organisations with excellent bona fides resort to employing somebody to make their case rather than relying on the power of their argument. </p>
          <p eId="para_234"> The Fianna Fáil Party called for the introduction of this important legislation in January 2012. We must ensure the Bill does not inhibit ordinary citizens from accessing the system as this is a good feature of our society. I do not know of any politician who would refuse to meet the least well-off members of society or give access to ordinary people. Nevertheless, it is vital that we have in place a rigid system that ensures that all efforts to influence the system at a significant level, in particular by corporations, are declared. On the other hand, we must also ensure we do not interfere with the day-to-day work of various organisations, many of which represent charity interests and have a legitimate right to make their case to us. </p>
          <p eId="para_235"> The inclusion of a cooling off period for former Ministers and officials is vital. The absence of such a provision in the current regime can present a significant problem for Ministers as they do not have any control over those who leave their employ and take up positions elsewhere. Ministerial advisers and others whose contract had elapsed used to suddenly reappear in the system working as lobbyists for various industry interests and purporting to use their access as a selling point. The problem was that their previous boss was powerless to prevent this and the impression was given, as we have often heard from members of the current Government, that the former employer had somehow endorsed certain actions or was in some way associated with the actions of the lobbyist. </p>
          <p eId="para_236"> A one year cooling off period during which former Ministers and officials will be banned from taking up certain forms of employment appears to be too short. The cooling off period should last at least two years if it is to protect all Members of the Oireachtas. Now that the Labour Party and Fine Gael are in power and certain things are happening that they used to criticise, they are finding that they do not have control over these issues. We must create a system that provides for an adequate cooling off period. It may be, however, that the period that must elapse before a person can return to civvy street should be related to the length of time a person was employed in the public service. A person could be employed for four or five weeks before political instability results in him or her losing his or her job. These things have been known to happen. There is also a significant difference between the case of a person who leaves the private sector and joins the public service as an adviser before returning to his or her previous position and one that involves a long-term public service employee who never had a connection with lobbying and whose main qualification for suddenly becoming a lobbyist is that he or she previously worked in the public service. </p>
          <p eId="para_237"> I note that the Irish Farmers Association opposes the Bill because it will require the association to list all contacts between its officers and public representatives. We must produce a workable solution that addresses issues of this nature. The IFA is a large organisation and there would not be a mart where one of its officials would not speak to a public representative. One cannot argue that such contact is unfair or inappropriate. We must find a fair way to make it possible for larger organisations to engage in this manner. In the case of a political party with several thousand cumainn, accounting for a contribution of €10 is a greater problem than seeking to counter the influence of a €10 contribution. It is vital that we achieve proportionality and ensure the legislation is workable, controls major interests such as drinks and tobacco companies and prevents lobbyists from exerting an untoward influence on the political system. </p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_240">I want to ask the Taoiseach a number of questions concerning the appointment of Mr. McNulty to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys. Yesterday, the Taoiseach's attempt in the Dáil to bring clarity to the matter did not succeed and has raised far more questions than answers. There has been a lack of clarity. To paraphrase what has emerged, it seems that Mr. McNulty in his interview with the Taoiseach said he was interested in becoming a member of a cultural body. He was interviewed by the Taoiseach for the Seanad nomination and, mysteriously, Fine Gael officials became aware of his desire to serve on such a body. They then sent a memo or CV over to the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, saying "Put him on a cultural body". She then, in great haste, decided to put him on the board of IMMA with another person. The entire process of nominating him to the Seanad, as a Fine Gael process, was completely and absolutely separate to the process of his nomination to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art. That is what we have heard at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> I do not know whether the Taoiseach was aware that the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, was asked by Fine Gael officials or was going to appoint Mr. McNulty to the board of IMMA. That brings into question the Minister's role. Why will she not do interviews on this matter? Why will she not come before the House and give a comprehensive statement on it? When did she receive the request from Fine Gael officials to appoint him to the board of IMMA? Who mandated them to make that request of the Taoiseach? Why did she act with such haste in increasing the size of the board to facilitate his appointment, rather than just wait for a casual vacancy to arise and then fill it in the normal way?</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> There is a range of questions but I only want to ask the Taoiseach one and I would appreciate a very clear answer. I asked it yesterday, as did Deputy Adams, but we did not get a clear answer. Did the Taoiseach, or somebody on his behalf in Government Buildings, ask Fine Gael officials to tell the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to appoint Mr. McNulty to a cultural body? Yes or no?</p>

          <p eId="para_255">I want to make the point. I am going to make the point. He applied for a job in a multinational with cloud computing. There were 5,000 applications and less than ten were accepted of which his was one. The point I am going to make to Deputy Martin is one that he will appreciate. He wanted to do his public duty and give service but because the firm does not give him time off, he took ten days' holidays to attend to his public service duty. Yet he is branded as a crony and a lackey, which is wrong. I am sick of that situation and now we are going to change it. From 1 November, this will not apply any more.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> In his opening question, Deputy Martin made another point. When I interviewed John McNulty - who was very forthright again this morning on radio and is an excellent candidate - I never discussed anything with him about cultural boards or any other boards. I discussed with him his potential as a Senator to do a political job because this was a political seat for the Fine Gael Party, which arose from the election of Deirdre Clune to the European Parliament. That assertion was made yesterday evening as well. John McNulty never discussed with me anything to do with boards, culture or anything else. We discussed the operation of the Seanad and his capacity to be a good Senator and serve in the area he comes from. </p>

One gets a terrible sense that people are trying to piece together and concoct a story that ends up blaming Fine Gael officials. Who mandated the Fine Gael officials to go to the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and say that Mr. McNulty wants to be appointed, and should be appointed, to a cultural body? Who mandated them to do that? Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that senior headquarter officials in Fine Gael went off, without his knowledge or endorsement, and said to the Minister "Appoint him"? Did any other names come from the Fine Gael officials, other than Mr. McNulty's, to be appointed? Look at the window we are talking about. We are talking about a few days between his nomination to contest the Seanad by-election on the Taoiseach's behalf and his nomination to IMMA.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">The Deputy has taken a wrong line again. I spoke to Mr. John McNulty about his capacity to be considered for nomination to the Seanad. When I gave my <i>imprimatur </i>to indicate we should consider nominating him, the Fine Gael system of validating candidates took over from there. We had already set up, internally in the party, a sub-committee of the executive council to consider names for nomination to the Seanad. There were 44 nominations submitted, or 29 people. Therefore, 29 were being considered. Obviously, the Fine Gael personnel working on this became aware in the course of the conversations with Mr. McNulty that he indicated he would like to serve on a cultural board if he intended to be a candidate for a cultural and educational panel. As he said himself this morning, he did not know when he was appointed by the Minister to the board of IMMA that he would be a candidate for the Seanad. My point yesterday, which I made to the Deputy clearly, concerned accepting the fact that the process within the Fine Gael system was itself flawed because the official dealing with this did not go back to the sub-committee of the executive council. That was the cause of great angst and a cause of concern to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">The point is that those associated with the internal mechanics of IMMA then said that if a person is nominated for the Seanad, he must stand down from the board. I have accepted that in a general way as Head of Government and through fixing the internal mechanics of Fine Gael Party business, which is not a matter for here. Yesterday, the Government made a decision to have a new framework, starting from 1 November, for all public appointments to be publicly advertised and externally validated, whereby every Minister will set out the conditions and criteria that will apply for each board under his or her Department's remit. Therefore, we will not have the system that applied since the foundation of the State. In the meantime, any board appointments that must be made between now and November will be announced by the relevant Minister so everybody will know that vacancies exist on certain boards. It is a case of accepting that this system is flawed in general and that we need to reform it. We have made the Government decision and it will be implemented from 1 November on <i>www.stateboard.ie</i> so every member of the public, be he in Gorey, Wexford or otherwise, who wishes to do public service on a board can check the relevant details. People will know the boards, vacancies, criteria, skills and required conditions and they will be verified by the Public Appointments Service. Names sent to a Minister will already be authenticated as the names of people of quality fit to serve on a board.

          <p eId="para_289">The Taoiseach says he has many more important issues to deal with but he is the Taoiseach and cannot dictate to the Opposition what questions we ask. Yesterday he told the Dáil there were 29 nominees to the Seanad vacancy for which he interviewed Mr. John McNulty. Was he the only Fine Gael nominee he interviewed? Yesterday the Taoiseach said that during the course of the validation and eligibility process, Mr. McNulty expressed a desire to serve on a cultural body. Today the Taoiseach says he did not raise this with him. To whom did he express that desire? Can the Taoiseach tell the Dáil who forwarded Mr. McNulty's CV to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys? Was anyone else's CV forwarded to her? Who authorised the sending of Mr. McNulty's CV to the Minister?</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> The Taoiseach states the Minister appointed Mr. McNulty to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art in her own right. In other words, he implies it had nothing to do with him, and that there were two separate processes. However, the Government quota of nine nominees to the board was already filled. Therefore, the nominations the Minister was about to make breached the Government's ceiling. I note the absence of Labour Ministers in the Chamber again. Was the Labour leader, the Tánaiste, consulted on this?</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> The Taoiseach also states he accepts responsibility for the Fine Gael Party officials bringing Mr. McNulty's interest in serving on a State board to the attention of a Minister, but he says it was nothing to do with him and that it was a separate process. If it was nothing to do with him, how is he responsible?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_292">I was responsible in two ways, first as leader of the Fine Gael Party and second as Taoiseach. In respect of the Fine Gael Party, I have already pointed out that the system that the party had in place internally was not followed through. I noted reports today in some of the newspapers suggesting, for instance, that members of the executive council of Fine Gael were disappointed that there was a perception that they were being blamed. The fact of the matter is that when former Senator Deirdre Clune was elected to the European Parliament, a vacancy arose in the Seanad. The sub-committee of the executive council considered the position. There were 44 nominations, or 29 names, submitted, and the executive council made two recommendations. Subsequently, Deputy McGinley said he was going to retire. That left a vacancy for a major political representative for half of Donegal. I looked at Mr. McNulty's credentials and said he was a candidate who would fit the bill in terms of work in the Seanad. I discussed the workings of the Seanad and its political agenda with him. We never discussed anything about cultural boards. In the course of the validation process and preparing the criteria, the Fine Gael personnel did not go back to the executive council. I was upset about that because it was set up for that purpose. I accepted responsibility for that flaw in that system and am rectifying it.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> In a broader sense, I now want to move on with the reform agenda. The Government has already carried out reforms in terms of corporate donations, gender balance, gender quotas and freedom of information. All of these issues have been dealt with, and here is another aspect of political reform that needs to be dealt with in everybody's interest. There are very good people who will not serve on public bodies or boards in any circumstances because of the likelihood of their being pilloried as being associates of political parties, cronies or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">That is why an external, independent validation of all of these is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> Deputy Adams made the point that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, breached the ceiling in terms of the number of personnel serving on the State boards. In the case of State boards, the Government made a commitment, which has not been followed through fully, that numbers on boards would be reduced from 15 members to nine members. That has not been followed through because many of the cultural institutions fought valiantly for the retention of their independence. Some of them were quite vociferous on that. The National Concert Hall Bill is on the A list for determination during this session. </p>
          <p eId="para_296"> There were six vacancies on the board of IMMA and the Minister chose to make two appointments. She made them in her own right as Minister, based on the credentials of the candidates.</p>

          <p eId="para_299"> In the case of chairmen of boards, the Government changed the rules and chairmen must come before the relevant Oireachtas committee to see what the applicant brings to the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> I am not informed of every individual appointment made for non-remunerated positions on State boards, where there are thousands of positions to be filled over the years. However, from now on all of that process is removed from politics and politicians. All the positions will be publicly advertised and externally verified.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">Every Minister will set out the criteria, the qualifications and the skills necessary to serve on all of the boards under his or her responsibility. That information will all be posted on <i>www.stateboards.ie</i> and the public will have full transparency and accountability there. Every person appointed must be independently assessed and verified.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> In regard to commercial semi-State boards, where particular skillsets are required, for instance in the NewERA sector which deals with Ervia, Bord Gáis, Bord na Móna and so on, consultations with NewERA will set out the specific skillsets required, such as accountancy, legal qualifications, data management, business acumen or whatever. Following that those specialised appointments will be made. This is a major change in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> What I want to see resulting from all of this is that State board service and public duty service will not be seen to be in any way reproachable. It should be entirely above reproach and I hope to oversee that through the decision the Government made yesterday.</p>

I am trying to keep this simple. I asked the Taoiseach a series of straightforward questions which he ignored completely. Was Mr. John McNulty the only Fine Gael nominee the Taoiseach interviewed? Please answer this question.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> The Taoiseach says Mr. McNulty expressed his desire to serve on a cultural body, but has said today that Mr. McNulty did not raise that with him. I repeat my question. Who did he express that desire to? The Taoiseach is bound to have checked this out and to have asked someone about it. Will he tell the Dáil? Paddy wants to know; Patricia wants to know. Will the Taoiseach also tell the Dáil who forwarded Mr. McNulty's CV to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys?</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_359">It is one issue but two incidents. Yesterday, in my constituency, a landlord attempted to carry out an illegal eviction. This involved a couple with a one-year-old child. While the family were out, the landlord came into the flat, cut off the electricity, took off the front door and changed the locks on the main door of the building. The couple made contact with my constituency office and Councillor Pat Dunne, who works in the office, responded very quickly because the family were obviously distressed, fearful and did not know what to do or who to turn to. He went to the flat and managed to sort out the issue and to explain to the landlord that he was in breach of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. He was very lucky because he did not know what he was going into, whether there were heavies there or what was happening. The landlord reinstated the electricity, put the door back on and changed the locks again.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> The point I want to make is an important one. The very distraught tenant, facing the prospect of his family being on the street, told Councillor Dunne that before he rang my office he had rung for gardaí not once but four times. The gardaí refused to intervene, stating it was a civil matter. This is not the first time this has happened in my area. About six months ago, I sent a letter to the Dublin South Central Policing Forum asking for clarification on the Garda position in regard to illegal evictions. We got a direct reply from Garda headquarters that the Residential Tenancies Act was not criminal legislation and they did not get involved in civil matters. Therefore, the illegal eviction of a family is a civil matter, not a criminal matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Yesterday, again, 12 people in Edenmore were arrested for peacefully protesting against the installation of water meters by a private company, a subcontractor employed by Irish Water. Section 12 of the Irish Water Act has been quoted to these people, stating that Irish Water and its subcontractors and agencies can install water meters. It says nothing about it being illegal to protest.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> It seems that two laws are being administered here, one for a criminal offence in regard to the installation of water meters while, at the same time, there is no criminal offence in the illegal eviction of a family from their home. I believe the Taoiseach would agree this is wrong, immoral, unfair and should not be happening. The law should be administered equally across society and there should not be one law for private companies and private landlords and another law for families threatened with an illegal eviction or those peacefully protesting against the installation of water meters.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">I do not know the details of the case Deputy Collins has mentioned except for the circumstances she outlined. The Cabinet sub-committee dealt this week with the question of the housing position, homelessness, social housing and the actions that have been taken by Dublin City Council to deal with a problem that is not getting better, to put it that way. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government was to meet this week with the four local authority managers about that situation. If the Deputy wants to give me the details of the specific case she mentioned, whether it be civil or otherwise, I will see whether anything can be done about it, although if it is a civil action, it is a civil action.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> I had a couple of telephone calls yesterday from people who live here in Dublin. The contract companies working for Irish Water came to install water meters and they were harassed.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">Peaceful protest in this country is perfectly legitimate but it is not legitimate to stop people from going about their duty and their work. The gardaí have had to be called in a number of cases where much more than peaceful protest took place. In other locations around the country, I have had evidence that where work started in some estates, people suddenly arrived to protest. I have had evidence of residents actually coming out and asking these people to remove themselves. It seems as if there are some groups who travel from location to location to protest. As the Deputy said, they are entitled to protest but they are only entitled to protest legitimately and they cannot interfere with and should not prohibit people going about their lawful work.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Irish Water is designed to bring quality water infrastructure for the country and that should not be interfered with. There is a process that the law applies for everybody here. As I said, in many other parts of the country contractors have installed water meters without anybody appearing, and they have done a first class job. It is all part of the capacity to provide high quality water for the people of our country and for business for years to come.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">Yes, we do not need meters to have good water. The question I am asking is very simple. The gardaí refused to act to stop an illegal eviction by a landlord on the basis it was a civil matter. Yet, while other people stand peacefully over a water shore, they are told it is an illegal protest, and section 12 of the Irish Water Act is quoted, which states that Irish Water and its agencies can install water meters in an area. It does not say that person should not have the right to say "I do not want a water meter".</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> The Taoiseach brought in questions of people travelling around the country and around the city, and all of that. I was at a meeting last week in Drimnagh called by the Drimnagh residents support group, a residents association in the area, where more than 300 people came out and said they did not want water meters installed at their premises or at their homes. If an ordinary person comes out and says to Irish Water or the subcontractor, "I do not want a water meter here, go on to the next house if they want a water meter", that is quite legitimate. Instead, the gardaí are being used to stand in estates, taking registrations of cars going in and out, removing people from the stopcocks over the shores and arresting them, bringing them down to Coolock Garda station and telling them they must wait to see if Irish Water or the subcontractor will press charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> This is one law for those who have plenty of money and one law for those who are peacefully resisting. Ordinary people are coming out of their homes, with their children, to say they do not want a water meter installed, and they do this in the knowledge that they will get an assessed bill in the future - they are well aware of that so they are not doing this blind. They do not want a water meter and they are very angry. It is just a microcosm of the anger that this Government is imposing another austerity tax on people. I want clarity from the Taoiseach on this. Why is one law being used in one circumstance and another law being interpreted by gardaí as being a criminal matter when it comes to protests about water meters?</p>

          <p eId="para_372">Evictions and people being removed from their homes are very traumatic incidents. As I said, if the Deputy gives me the details, we will look at that. The Deputy said we do not need water meters to have good water, and that is true. However, the taxpayers of this country are paying €1.2 billion to produce that water. We cannot have a situation where people can expect to have a free water supply of good water paid for the taxpayer, with some people not contributing.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> These water meters are installed on the public thoroughfare, not on private property.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">The contractors who are subcontracted to Irish Water will not go onto private property unless they are invited to do so. When the situation kicks in where the first leak between the meter and the edge of the house will apply, obviously, the recommendation is to fix that free. Water meters are on the public thoroughfare, and they are there because water paid for by the public is going through that pipe.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> It is perfectly in order for people to have a legitimate protest, and I meet them around the country on so many occasions, but it is not legal to prevent people from doing their job and doing their duty, for which they are paid, in order to provide water meters on public property so that a contribution can be had from those who avail of the water flowing through those pipes. That water is produced and paid for by the Irish taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">We want to see a situation where the charges are fair, equitable and affordable. The water meters are on public property and not on private property. If people want to protest legitimately about that, they are entitled to do so but they are not entitled to prohibit or prevent people from doing their duty. </p>

          <p eId="para_380">People would have been alarmed by comments made at the weekend by the chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. This is a body established to give advice to Government in respect of budgetary and fiscal policy. There is no question that the advice of the council has been studiously ignored over the past three years. This weekend, the chairman of the council, Professor John McHale said, "if I found I wasn't having an effect, I would consider my position." He went on to say that resignation is a tool we have to raise the political costs of bad policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> I find it extraordinary to a certain extent that there has been no comment from Government about this or about the budget submission made by the council. I have read its submission and I think everybody in the House should read it. In terms of politicians wanting to do x, y and z, we may not like it but if we are to learn lessons, I respectfully suggest that the least we should do in the House is have a comprehensive debate on the position put forward by the council. The Taoiseach should initiate this. I am asking him to allow Government time to discuss the report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in respect of fiscal options for the forthcoming year and beyond. There is no point in having a fiscal council if its advice is consistently ignored and not just ignored but no process entered into where there is any deliberation on it and any counterpoints put with research and evidence. We can all have conflicting views on things but it is not satisfactory when the report is just published, put to one side and dismissed. There is the risk that the body perceives itself to be undermined in terms of the work it is charged to do. At a minimum, I would have thought that we would have a Dáil debate on it so I ask the Taoiseach to agree to give time for that. </p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The programme for Government contains a commitment to a transparent process around the budget. We know that last year, we did not get the correct or truthful figures relating to the health Estimate. It is very clear from the correspondence between the chief executive of the HSE and the former Minister for Health that on budget day, we did not get the truth relating to the health Estimate and that in essence, we got false figures dressed up around medical card probity and so on. When one reads the correspondence, one can see that the chief executive said that it was €500 million short on top of deficits it had taken on board from the previous year. </p>
          <p eId="para_383"> In order for political parties to put forward counter proposals to the Government's budget, we need absolute transparency in terms of the health Estimate for 2015 and we need to know the outcomes for 2014. Yesterday, the Minister for Health accepted that it was a €500 million deficit to the end of the year and that in essence, €1 billion is being sought in 2015. </p>
          <p eId="para_384"> In light of the programme for Government commitment to a transparent budget, would the Taoiseach be agreeable to the entire process relating to health being made transparent in advance of the budget and the expenditure figure that will be laid down by the Government on budget day? In other words, the figures that will be contained in correspondence between the HSE and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will be made available to Members of the House in advance of the budget and that we know the proposition coming from the HSE, its presentation, its concerns about patient safety and so on so that we would all be in a more informed position in budget day to make an informed commentary on whether the expenditure on health is valid or not or the figures that will be provided are valid or not. It is the least the Government can do given what happened last year, the enormous stress on our public health system over the past nine months, the extraordinary difficulties in the acute and elderly systems and the fact that hundreds of people cannot access fair deal and hundreds of people are in acute wards. We need absolute transparency on that health budget and I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could do that. </p>
          <p eId="para_385"> The programme for Government also states that "we will bring to an end the unacceptable executive practice where no record is kept of ministerial involvement with an issue and resulting decisions". Given the decisions made to appoint various people to the board of Irish Museum of Modern Art and other State boards, can the Taoiseach assure us that adequate records were taken of all those decisions and that he will make them available to the House or will we have to revert to freedom of information requests to the relevant Department and possibly the Department of the Taoiseach?</p>

          <p eId="para_392">Can I say something? All I am pointing out to the Deputy is that yesterday Deputy Creighton raised the question of a debate on the report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. In addition to that, she raised the question of a debate on the European Commission, the IMF and others. I have asked the Whip to make arrangements for a debate in respect of what Deputy Creighton asked for yesterday. Deputy Martin is asking for the same debate in respect of one issue. We set up the independent Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. It is not the Government. It has recommended a cut of €2 billion. Our deficit must be below 3% next year. The report produced by the council is a good report that sets out what it thinks should be done. At the end of the day, and as Deputy Martin well knows, the Government must make decisions about the budget based on the information and analysis and the issues it thinks should be dealt with. That is what is the Government will do. It is not a case of taking the report of the independent Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and leaving it on a shelf untouched, unread or unassessed. The Government must make decisions at the end of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">In respect of the Department of Health, there are some new personnel, including a new Minister. The expenditure will be somewhere over €12 billion for 2015. These questions have not yet been concluded because discussions are ongoing between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Health and his personnel-----</p>

I assume that when they conclude their deliberations on the policy, ceiling and rates of expenditure, that will become public information. I hope it can be completely authenticated so that if the Deputy's party wants to submit a set of proposals for independent costing, that can apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> In respect of ministerial decisions, they are all publicly available. Issues relating to the Deputy's party or any other party are not subject to freedom of information in the same way as public business.

          <p eId="para_399">Tá ceist fíorthábhachtach agam maidir le Riar na hOibre an lae inniu. Baineann sé le mná atá fós i ndrochstaid sa Stát seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> My question concerns the Government's decision to proceed with the redress scheme for the victims of symphysiotomy. When will the Government announce further details of the scheme? There has been an unnecessary and inexcusable delay when one considers that many of the victims are elderly and some are in poor health. I know from meeting them in my constituency that many are very frustrated and their families are very upset. Some victims have welcomed the redress scheme but many others are angry and unhappy. The Taoiseach may know that the ICCL has strongly backed the victims, particularly with regard to the refusal of the Government to lift the statute of limitations and allow victims, if they wish, to choose whether to go to court or take a different course of action in order to get closure. The Government has denied victims who wish to go down the legal route their day in court. We have all said this is a barbaric practice, but these women have been denied their entitlement to take the legal route if they so wish. Is é mo bharúil féin ná go bhfuil sé sin thar a bheith mícheart. Tá sé de cheart ag na mná seo a gcás a dhéanamh sna cúirteanna má tá sé sin de dhíth orthu. Will the Taoiseach's officials meet with the victims of symphysiotomy to discuss these concerns? </p>
          <p eId="para_401"> My second question concerns the commitment in the programme for Government to support the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrew's Agreement. The Taoiseach will know, as it was announced by the Government, that talks are due to start, which I very much welcome. I also welcome the interest shown in this by the US Administration. I was, like the Taoiseach, in the US last week and talked to many opinion makers there about the need for this to happen. Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Irish Government will raise the failure of the British Government and others to implement key aspects of the Good Friday Agreement? The Government is a co-equal guarantor to the Agreement. Issues such as Acht na Gaeilge, the lack of a bill of rights, the lack of an inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane, the lack of a North-South consultative forum and numerous others remain. The Taoiseach will also be aware that there is an anti-Agreement axis which is trying to hollow out the provisions of the agreement and undermine the institutions. Will the Taoiseach make it clear that the planned talks must take place free from threat and without precondition, and that they should be time-bound and commence as quickly as possible? Will the Government act as defender, guarantor and champion of progress in the North and hold the British Government to account for its failure to implement key aspects of the agreement?</p>

          <p eId="para_402">The Deputy has raised two important questions. He asked whether officials would meet survivors of symphysiotomy. I can confirm that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, met the three support groups representing women who have had symphysiotomies. Patient Focus and Survivors of Symphysiotomy Limited, have welcomed the establishment of the <i>ex gratia</i> payment scheme. A third group, Survivors of Symphysiotomy, has advised women to reject the scheme. </p>
          <p eId="para_403"> The purpose of the Minister's meeting was twofold. First, he wanted to check the appropriate medical and health services were in place and that medical cards were being provided to the women. Second, while he wished to hear the views of the support groups in order to help to shape the parameters of the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme, he also wished to confirm to them that the scheme would be put in place as quickly as possible. He was pleased to hear that, apart from some delays in one area, services are being provided quickly. The HSE is providing prompt and appropriate services and its representative at the meetings undertook to address quickly the specific delay raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> Many of the women are moving on in terms of age and would have to decide whether to go through adversarial, controversial, difficult and stressful court cases which could take a very long time.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">The Government agreed the scheme last July. The Minister responded to the concern of the group and decided that an independent assessor would administer the scheme rather than the State Claims Agency. As the Deputy knows the scheme will be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial. Awards of €50,000, €100,000 or €150,000 will be made to women who provide evidence that they had a surgical symphysiotomy. The amount of the award will depend on the assessment of the effect the symphysiotomy had on each of the women. Medical assessments will be arranged for women with no medical records. The Minister also stressed that he planned to make arrangements to respond to individual queries from women or family members so that the scheme is as user-friendly as possible. He also clarified that there is no obligation on the women involved to waive their right to go to court as a precondition of joining the scheme. The previous Minister, Deputy Reilly, had made that arrangement. Women may opt out of the scheme at any stage in the process up to the time of accepting their awards. If they accept an award they will have to sign a waiver promising to discontinue any legal proceedings against the party arising out of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> I can assure Deputy Adams that women will have their applications dealt with speedily. This is a sensitive issue. They will receive payments within a number of months. It is a genuine effort to recognise their suffering, what they went through and the difficulties and scars they have had to bear since, and to try to assist them in dealing with a very sad, traumatic and difficult chapter in their lives. I hope that confirmation will bring some comfort to the women.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> We previously discussed the other matter raised by the Deputy - namely, the Good Friday Agreement and the talks due to begin. I am happy that we have come to a position whereby the Irish and British Governments, as co-guarantors of the agreement, can involve themselves in, it is to be hoped, bringing some matters to a conclusion. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has been in regular contact with the Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers MP. I spoke to President Clinton last week in New York about the necessity for progress, as I am sure Deputy Adams did.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> We can discuss Acht na Gaeilge, the bill of rights and other matters such the murder of Pat Finucane. We need a serious analysis of the situation. I understand some remains were discovered this morning, which is welcome and will, it is to be hoped, bring consolation and closure to whatever family is involved. Murders and deaths occurred on all sides. We are moving forward with the new systems in place, such as the PSNI and the judicial system. We need to find a mechanism to deal with the sensitive issues of the past because, if they are transferred into the new system, the same problems will be recreated in a different way. We need to be a bit more imaginative and creative about where and how we want the process to go. There are thousands of people who want closure for their particular problems. People are still affected by the murder of Pat Finucane, the events at Ballymurphy and Kingsmill and whatever else. We need to determine how we can open that reservoir in a way that will bring some sense of closure to the people involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">If one takes it and tries to transfer it into a modern system in which there are new judicial people and legal systems are being changed, it poisons the entire system again. We must reflect on where we should be and how we might get there in a different way. The Deputy knows from our history that this is going back a very long time and it is locked in there. We must explore different ways of releasing that anxiety and emotion and achieving a sense of closure.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">I raise an issue reported in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> last weekend that 4,000 SME customers of Danske Bank face the sale of their loans to a foreign-owned vulture fund. It is a similar issue to the one we have previously raised in relation to mortgage holders. The relevant legislation is the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill. If this happens to businesses before the legislation is passed, they will be left vulnerable and exposed. If businesses have missed any payment whatsoever on loans, all they will have to rely on is their loan agreements, which are heavily stacked in favour of the lender. Viable businesses could be shut down and jobs lost. The legislation is urgent. We will happily support the passage of the Bill and the provision of time to do so. The Government has promised to fast-track it. Can the Taoiseach assure the House that the Bill will be published urgently and introduced to the House?</p>

          <p eId="para_412">The Bill is being drafted at the moment. I am aware of the considerable anxiety and concern expressed by small businesses, as is the Minister for Finance. It is a major priority of the Government and I will provide the Deputy with an update as to where it is moving. It is an issue of considerable public concern.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">On her recent appointment as Tánaiste, Deputy Burton said her top priority was low pay in the private sector. I notice that the legislation to establish a low pay commission is on the C list. Its publication is expected at some unspecified time next year. There is no indication of how long the commission will sit or how long its recommendations will take to implement, if indeed the Government accepts them. Does that not betray a lack of sincerity on the question of low pay? If the Tánaiste were sincere about dealing with this matter, would the Government not be getting on with it now?</p>

          <p eId="para_414">The Tánaiste is sincere and very genuine about this. Deputy O'Dea is aware that recommendations were made in the past for wage and pay increases in a very unstructured way. The low pay commission will have to go through a process of consultation to set up a framework for a much more scientific and modern way to deal with this. It will not just be a figure plucked out of the air. There will be a basis and a structure to it. That it is not on the A list does not mean no work is going on. I will advise Deputy O'Dea as to the preparatory works that are under way. The A list is legislation that must be processed during this particular session. The answer to the Deputy's question is that the Tánaiste is of course sincere, but the matter requires proper preparation and extensive consultation to get right.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">There are three Bills emanating from the Department of Defence which appear on the B and C lists of the legislative programme - namely, Nos. 36, 66 and 67. When will the Bills be brought before the House? Will any of them address the very serious concerns expressed at the PDFORRA conference in the last 24 hours? We are now hearing reports that 20% of members of the Defence Forces are living in poverty and in receipt of family income supplement, and that five members of the Defence Forces are sleeping in their cars as a consequence of the reorganisation inflicted on the Defence Forces by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> I welcome the fact that tomorrow we will debate the report of the Constitutional Convention on blasphemy. However, this leaves quite a number of reports outstanding. The Taoiseach has had to accept in the past that he set a number of deadlines in respect of the convention and the manner in which its reports would be dealt with. None of those deadlines has been met in so far as the Government is concerned. Can the Taoiseach assure the House that the outstanding reports will now be prioritised?</p>

          <p eId="para_420">I confirm, with regard to the last question, that a memorandum will be brought to the Government by me next week to deal with the outstanding reports which have not been debated in the House. The Government agreed yesterday in respect of the proposition that there be a referendum to deal with blasphemy, but I am making it clear that while the Government accepted the principle, it is not setting a date. A number of referendums have been proposed here, and that debate can take place tomorrow or today in relation to that aspect of it. The remaining convention reports will be the subject of the memorandum next week, and I will advise the Deputy in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> There are seven heads in the defence (amendment) Bill, which will not be published until 2015. The Defence (Amendment) Act 2011 was enacted in July 2011. In respect of the defence (amendment) (discipline) Bill, approval will be sought for the heads on other matters having regard to recent developments in military law. I cannot give the Deputy an indication of when that process will be concluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> I heard the report from PDFORRA about the difficulties members are having and of a small number reportedly having to sleep in their cars. This is a matter the Minister for Defence will obviously take seriously and look into.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">The Taoiseach has announced that this day next month we will have a new framework for appointments to State boards. Will this require legislation or will it be just another circular that will be issued and ignored? When will we be able to discuss this legislation? It sounds from what has been said publicly by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, as though the only change is that any person the Government wants to put on a State board will be required to send a curriculum vitae to the Commission for Public Service Appointments. That will then work its way back to the Minister who can ignore the process and appoint anyone from the list that comes back.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> When the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 was going through the Oireachtas, it was well flagged - the Government was well warned - that there were major flaws in the legislation which rendered it incapable of working. Reports show that there are very few insolvency declarations taking place. The Government has a Bill on the legislative programme to correct the foreseeable failures of the Act.

          <p eId="para_426"> On the other matter, a memorandum was prepared quite some time ago by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform which has now been revamped and was approved by Government yesterday. The PAS scheme on <i>stateboards.ie</i> is already <i>in situ</i> and 200 appointments were made using it. We now want all Departments to use this facility so that the public know there is one facility setting out the boards, the vacancies, the criteria and the skill sets required. In addition, the Cabinet sub-committee gave a recommendation for clearance for the public service reform propositions that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has worked on extensively. They will be published and launched by him very shortly. There may be elements of that which require legislation. I will advise the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_443">This is a day of shame for the Government and a day of fear, anxiety and outrage for hundreds of thousands of families who, for the first time in the history of the State, will be charged to access the basic human right to water, on top of all of the stealth charges and taxes that have been loaded on the people to the point where many are utterly crippled financially. The anger and outrage felt are manifest in mass meetings and protests the length and breadth of the country and we are likely to see tens of thousands on the streets before the upcoming budget is announced, demanding that the Government abolish these hateful charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_444"> If all of that is not bad enough, to add insult to injury, Irish Water, in its efforts to force people to pay this unjust and regressive tax, is also asking for PPS numbers and personal information and data on all households in the State. This has raised very serious issues and legitimate fears about the protection of personal data and what Irish Water may do with them. Let us be clear: under the legislation, Irish Water has been designated to be a private company. Therefore, people are being asked to provide PPS numbers and personal information for a private company. Interestingly, the Irish Water website has been changed in the past few days to cover up its initial policy, but it still states the information will be used for marketing purposes, shared with agents or third parties, can be transferred and processed by staff operating outside the European economic area and Irish Water suppliers. By agreeing to submit the information, people are consenting to all of the above and the use of this detailed and sensitive personal information in these ways by a private company, its suppliers and others with whom it works.</p>
            <p eId="para_445"> The ESB does not ask for or require PPS numbers and, until now, Bord Gáis did not ask for them. Why is Irish Water seeking this personal and sensitive information, about which the Data Protection Commissioner said people should be careful? Specialists and consultants in the area have described the manner in which Irish Water is seeking the information as unsupportable approaches for information. The Data Protection Commissioner has said clarification is needed. This is a serious issue about sensitive, personal information being handed over to a private company that is linking the demand for the information with allowances and charges and what people may pay. This leads many to believe they have no choice but to hand over the information. How can the Minister of State stand over and justify this? What reassurance can he give that the information will not be handed over to other bodies and parties that may abuse personal information that is the property of citizens?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Paudie Coffey)<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_446">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, in respect of which I am happy to clarify the position on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.</p>
            <p eId="para_447"> Under the Water Services Acts 2007 to 2013, Irish Water may request its customers and certain specified persons or bodies, including the Minister for Social Protection, to provide it with information in order that the company can perform its functions under the Acts. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water is responsible for public water services and can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. It also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers of Irish Water.</p>
            <p eId="para_448"> The proposed approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan that it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER recently held a public consultation process on this plan, which covered a range of issues relating to water charges and allowances. Yesterday the CER issued a determination on the water charges plan, details of which are available on its website. With charges effective from today, 1 October 2014, Irish Water is in the process of compiling the relevant data to ensure customers can be billed accurately based on the tariff structure approved yesterday by the CER.</p>
            <p eId="para_449">Throughout September, Irish Water sent application packs to nearly 2 million households which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015. Irish Water is in the final stages of issuing these packs. The application process will enable customers to confirm their details and to ensure that a correct and up-to-date database of customers exists. The pack is accompanied by a guide explaining why each piece of information is required. A media campaign has also been launched to emphasise the need to complete the application process by 31 October 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_450"> On 6 May 2014, the Government made certain decisions relating to the structure of water charges including,<i> inter alia</i>, a free allowance per household and an additional free allowance for children on the same qualifying conditions as the child benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection. As these allowances are to be funded by Government, Irish Water needs to ensure it has the appropriate and sufficient information to reflect these entitlements. The personal public services, PPS, numbers will be used by Irish Water to validate that customers are entitled to any relevant water allowances. It is important to stress that the PPS information will only be shared with the Department of Social Protection and solely for this verification purpose. This will ensure that each household receives the free allowance to which it is entitled as well as any additional allowance for children in receipt of child benefit at that address. It will also facilitate Irish Water in providing reduced charges to owners who have unoccupied dwellings. Households who do not provide PPS numbers to establish eligibility will be billed a default charge which the CER has set. In the case of late validation, any relevant allowances will be backdated 60 days prior to the date of registration.</p>
            <p eId="para_451"> Irish Water is a specified body under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by section 20 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014 and is therefore permitted to request PPS numbers to authenticate the identity of the person being provided with an allowance. Irish Water will treat applicants' personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. In complying with these Acts, Irish Water must ensure that the data is only used for the purpose for which it was collected and must also ensure that any data collected is stored securely. Irish Water has confirmed that no data will be stored outside of the European Economic Area, and Irish Water will not be selling or trading any customer data. There may be limited instances where Irish Water might need to share information with third parties with whom it has service agreements for operational reasons, for example, instances where ICT support for systems maintenance is required, and this will be done under full compliance with all data protection requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_452">It is absolutely hateful and obscene that the Minister will from today charge people for the basic human right to access water which people need to live. As if this is not bad enough, to then demand with menaces PPS numbers and other sensitive personal information is really an outrage and the Minister of State's reassurances do not convince me.</p>
            <p eId="para_453"> The Minister of State says that Irish Water has given assurances that it will not send this information outside the European Economic Area. I invite him to look at Irish Water's website which states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_454">[T]he data relating to the customer may be used for marketing purposes. Irish Water may share the customer's data with agents or third parties who act on behalf of Irish Water in connection with the activities referred to above, [which is marketing]....Data we collect ...may be transferred to a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA")....It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA....By submitting data to Irish Water, the customer agrees to this transfer or processing.</p>
            <p eId="para_455">This is updated information which remains on the website. It was changed after the uproar about this issue in the past number of weeks. The Minister of State has received some sort of assurances, which I do not trust frankly, from a company that recently sent out 6,000 letters to the wrong addresses. Even if the Minister of State was given assurances that the actual PPS numbers will not be handed on, any company can garner information from the PPS numbers which could be useful to third parties. The PPS number is a key to a great amount of information even if the PPS number itself is not handed over. It is clear from what Irish Water states on its own website and what data protection experts say, that we cannot trust a private for-profit company whose assets could be sold on in the future, with this personal sensitive information.</p>

            <p eId="para_456">Given that domestic water charging commenced today, 1 October, Irish Water requires a comprehensive customer database to be in place to ensure that customers can be billed accurately, based on the tariff structure approved by the regulator yesterday. In advance of the introduction of the charges, the Government made decisions relating to the structure of water charges and agreed to provide a free allowance per household and an additional free allowance for children, based on the same qualifying conditions as the child benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_457"> The collection of the PPS numbers allows Irish Water to confirm and validate those same entitlements to allowances for each customer. This is the significant point. I am concerned that it is reported that Opposition Deputies, possibly including Deputy Boyd Barrett, are advising people not to register nor to claim their entitlements and allowances. I am aware that some Deputies were holding public meetings about the local property tax and advising people not to pay the property tax and these people were subsequently subject to liabilities and penalties. Those very same Deputies said at public meetings that they would see to it-----</p>

            <p eId="para_461">The Government is currently examining a number of measures in preparation for its social housing strategy and wider housing policy. Securing a deposit for a house is challenging for young families, in particular, given the fall in incomes and the inability to save money.</p>
            <p eId="para_462"> One innovative response has been the rent-to-buy scheme which can effectively allow a tenant to convert a portion or a proportion of rent paid into a deposit to buy at the end of a defined period. A three-year pilot scheme was launched by Dublin City Council in 2010 and interest was strong at the time. This model should be examined as part of a future housing and social housing policy. </p>
            <p eId="para_463"> One of the key points of the rent-to-buy scheme is that obligations on both the tenant and the seller are adhered to and that timetables are met. However, I know of a case in my constituency where, unfortunately, a proportion of the Dublin City Council rent-to-buy tenancy agreements have not been met. This problem must be dealt with because the scheme is a good scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_464"> Approximately 64 tenants in my constituency are part of the rent-to-buy scheme. This scheme is available to people on the council's affordable housing list and is aimed in general at low to middle income families who do not fit the social housing criteria. Properties were viewed in September 2010 and tenancies commenced in the period from November 2010 until April 2011. The original terms of the scheme state that people who availed of the scheme were supposed to rent their property at an affordable rent, at 80% of the estimated market rent for three years. At the commencement of the contract the council set the terms for the future sale of the property. Eighty per cent of the rent paid by tenants over three years was to be deducted from the sale price of the property as agreed between the tenant and the council at the time. However, there had been a change to the scheme in September 2013 whereby Dublin City Council, without any consultation with the tenants who signed up to the rent-to-buy scheme, informed them of two changes decided by the council. They were informed that the properties would not be offered for sale at the market value agreed at the beginning of the rent-to-buy scheme and that there would be no deduction for rent paid over the term of the three years. The council had broken two significant terms of the agreement with the tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_465"> While the lack of consultation was regrettable, it is accepted that the motivation of the council was to realign the scheme with falling apartment prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_466">From the outset, the scheme should have been proofed against market fluctuations, perhaps in a way similar to that adopted by NAMA in the context of deferred payment schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_467"> At no stage during the re-evaluation process carried out in 2013 and 2014 or when the three year tenancies were coming to an end were tenants informed of any delay relating to the scheme. Everyone operated on the basis that when the three year tenancies ended, the properties involved would be offered for sale and that those tenants who did not want to proceed to purchase would surrender their properties. As a result, people put mortgage arrangements in place, saved money for deposits and incurred the usual expenses relating to buying a home. It is seven to nine months since their tenancies ended, but the city council has not offered any property for sale. I understand the council is prepared to extend rental contracts to the end of this year and then review whether the technical issues holding up the sale of the properties have been resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> As matters stand, the 61 residents of Prospect Hill, Finglas, to whom I refer are in limbo. They do not know whether the agreements to which they signed up under the rent-to-buy scheme will be honoured or whether the money they paid in over three years and expected to be deducted from the eventual sale price agreed at the outset will be offered back to them. They also do not know whether the additional rent they have paid beyond the term of the three year scheme will be taken into account in any future deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_469"> The rent-to-buy scheme is a good one, but there are a couple of problems relating to it which need to be solved. I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government contact Dublin City Council in order to discover how effective the scheme is and in the interests of addressing the issues of concern to the people of Prospect Hill in Finglas.</p>

            <p eId="para_470">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and the Government's construction strategy, Construction 2020, published on 14 May, is a blueprint for a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector. It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues, including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce. The Government has committed, under action 8 of Construction 2020, to publish a social housing strategy. This strategy, which isin preparation, will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing provision in Ireland. The strategy is being developed by my Department, with input from key personnel in the Housing Agency and the National Economic and Social Council. A public consultation process was undertaken by the Housing Agency during the summer. A wide range of submissions from key stakeholders were received and have informed the development of the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_471"> The social housing strategy will build on the strengths of the sector's key players and provide for a coherent, sustainable and reliable framework for the delivery of social housing support in Ireland. The strategy will necessarily concentrate on social housing issues, but it will also make the connection with key issues affecting the Irish housing market as a whole. It will quantify the nature of the challenge with regard to housing need, housing demand and housing supply. Based on 2013 figures, 89,800 households are in need of social housing supports. The Construction 2020 target of tripling annual housing output in the next six years further informs the scale of the challenge. A range of delivery mechanisms are being considered and the strategy will provide pathways for the delivery and financing of the increased supply of social and public housing which will be required in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_472"> In the context of the issue raised by the Deputy, Dublin City Council launched a pilot rent-to-buy scheme in 2010. This scheme was intended to provide Dublin city with a further option for dealing with unsold affordable houses. All properties under that pilot scheme have been allocated and I understand no further offers are being made at this time. The Government's 2011 housing policy statement announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2013. The review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts, which provides for social and affordable housing supply, has been completed by the Housing Agency - at my Department's request - and submitted to the Government. I anticipate that any legislative change required on foot of the review will be incorporated into the general scheme of a new planning Bill that is expected to be published shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_473">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. He is correct to state all units advertised by Dublin City Council were taken up under the rent-to-buy scheme when it was launched 2010. As stated, the scheme is an excellent one. It allows people who cannot afford to put aside money for a down payment or a deposit on a house to get onto the property ladder. In addition, 80% of the rent they pay on their dwellings for three years goes towards an eventual sale price agreed with the local authority. Effectively, this means that they can live in the property, in respect of which they are setting aside a down payment and which, I hope, they will be able to purchase in the future. It is a win-win for everyone involved. Unfortunately, the goalposts were moved and those who signed up to agreements have been informed by the city council that it does not know whether it is going to allow them to buy these units as a result of some technical difficulties that need to be ironed out, whether - if sales proceed - the market price agreed three years ago will apply and whether it will provide some waiver or recognition of the additional rent they have paid for seven or eight months beyond the terms of their original agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_474"> If nothing else, the tenants in Prospect Hill, Finglas, should be treated fairly and consulted by Dublin City Council. If an agreement is reached, they should be given recognition for the fact that have spent over three years in their apartments and that they are currently paying rent which they did not plan to pay. They do not even know whether they are going to be able to buy the homes in which they are living. Will the Minister of State ask his officials to, at the very least, contact Dublin City Council in order to discover what is happening and ensure the 61 families in Prospect Hill who signed up to the original agreements will receive answers and be treated fairly?</p>

            <p eId="para_475">Given the concerns raised by the Deputy, I will ask my officials to engage with Dublin City Council in order to examine this issue to see if any progress can be made or a resolution found.</p>
            <p eId="para_476"> In the wider context, the key focus must be on significant intervention by the State on multiple fronts in order to ensure delivery and provide an adequate supply of secure, good quality housing in sustainable communities for all citizens as the country continues on the path to recovery. In the interests of ensuring short-term supply is maximised in tandem with any new-build programme, the social housing strategy will be key and include a range of actions to maximise the supply, management and maintenance of social housing stock in the longer term. The strategy will be finalised in the coming weeks and take cognisance, in particular, of the outcome of the Estimates process.</p>

            <p eId="para_477">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for coming to the House to listen to my concerns. I am sure she will appreciate the considerable level of concern and disquiet at national and, in particular, regional level about ambulance response times and follow-up capital investment for ambulance services in the west. She should be concerned because a recent HSE report clearly outlines that the ambulance service in the west is not performing well and that its response times are considerably out of kilter with those in other regions and international norms.</p>
            <p eId="para_478"> I ask the Minister of State to accept that there is a need to accelerate investment in the ambulance service in the western region which is quite large in geographical terms. The population of the region is entitled to expect adequate ambulance response times. The Minister of State will recall that the closure of the accident and emergency unit at Roscommon County Hospital was sold to us on the basis of significant investment in the ambulance service and the emergency medical technicians who provide it. I take the opportunity to acknowledge the dedication, commitment and, above all, actions of these staff. However, I request that the Minister of State consider the state of the vehicles they are obliged to use for their work. In the context of the HSE's recent figures for response times relating to clinical status 1 - echo - I also request her to investigate their capacity to operate properly. I do not wish to bamboozle people by using terms such as "echo", "bravo", etc. Suffice it to say that when someone suffers a heart attack, he or she wants to know that staff driving the vehicle with the blue lights on top will be able to get there, assist and transport him or her to hospital. The response times in Tuam and Roscommon are a source of great concern and significantly out of step with those which obtain elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_479"> One of the underlying aspects of the support requested from the House in accepting the need to close the accident and emergency unit at Roscommon was that a world-class standard would come into being in the case of ambulance response times.</p>
            <p eId="para_480">The situation is even worse for clinical status 1, which is when the service is in life-saving mode for cardiac arrest, respiratory emergencies and so on. The trip from Galway to Tuam on a blue light can take up to one hour. There is a brand new facility lying idle in Tuam but there has never been the required investment in human resources to cover what they now call in Tuam and Roscommon the Bermuda Triangle. We have no idea where the ambulance is.</p>
            <p eId="para_481"> I call on the Minister of State to cast her mind back to the "Prime Time" programme that investigated the matter. The Minister of State might remember the National Ambulance Service representative who said that the service did not have the people or the vehicles to meet the targets and that it was time for the National Ambulance Service to accept that the targets were unrealistic unless the cuts were reversed. Will the Minister of State make a statement with respect to my observations? Then in my two-minute slot subsequently I will introduce some of the statistical details of the report of the Minister of State on response times.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_482">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and I am pleased to be able to outline some of the current developments in pre-hospital service in the region. The National Ambulance Service is working to ensure the provision of high quality and timely emergency pre-hospital care services, using all available resources as efficiently and effectively as possible. As with any pre-hospital service, development and modernisation is an ongoing process as technology and clinical standards change. A significant reform programme is under way and additional funding of €3.6 million and 43 staff have been provided in the 2014 national service plan. It is important to acknowledge that progress is being made. The single national control system due for completion in 2015 will improve our control and dispatch performance. We are continuing to develop the intermediate care service, ICS, which transports patients between facilities, allowing emergency vehicles to focus on emergency calls. The ICS now carries three quarters of the non-emergency workload. We are also moving to more efficient on-duty rostering and to develop a national rostering system. I gather this is what the Deputy was referring to in respect of the "Prime Time" programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_483"> The emergency aeromedical service is operated from Athlone by the Air Corps and staffed by National Ambulance Service advanced paramedics. The EAS provides swift transfers of seriously ill or injured patients to appropriate hospitals. I fully accept that we need to drive further improvement; no one is denying that. Two national reviews are under way for a better service for patients. This country is difficult to compare with other areas because our geographic spread is different.</p>
            <p eId="para_484"> The Health Information and Quality Authority's governance review is examining how the NAS can develop and benchmark its services with modern outcome and indicator data. The NAS has commissioned an independent capacity review to determine current and future service needs. Among the areas being examined are staff numbers and skill mix as well as resource locations. Given its rural nature and road network, the western area provides a challenge for targeted response times for pre-hospital emergency care. The NAS recognises this and has undertaken specific measures to meet this challenge. The ICS has been rolled out in the west, including at Castlebar, Sligo and Galway. Almost 50 intermediate care operatives are now in place in the west.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> There have been over 700 EAS completed missions since June 2012. One third of these have been ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction heart attacks, allowing these patients to be treated in a specialist setting within 90 minutes of diagnosis. Most of these occurred in west and northwest. I know this to be true because it happened to a friend of mine recently. This development allows ambulance crews to remain in their areas in the west, ready to respond to any other emergency calls. Additional advanced paramedics have been trained throughout the west, with the objective that each station will have an AP and to ensure the spread of APs throughout the region. Castlebar control will be integrated into Ballyshannon in order that crews can be dispatched throughout the region more efficiently and deployed across regional boundaries, as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_486"> The NAS is moving towards a more dynamic and tactical model of service delivery. The current model, where ambulances remain at a single station, will change to a model in which they are deployed from a central location and move to several sites during a shift rather than remaining at a single point until required. This will ensure greater geographical cover as well as improved response times and patient outcomes. I am confident that these reforms and reviews will lead to improvements in pre-hospital emergency care services to the benefit of people living in the west. Having said that, I agree with the Deputy that there is more to be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_487">I am pleased the Minister of State acknowledges that there is more to be done. I imagine the Minister of State is aware that there are over 84 vehicles in the National Ambulance Service that have approximately 350,000 km clocked up on their odometers. When making comparisons we should not suggest that the geography presents a unique challenge. Let us compare the region to Scotland, which has a comparable challenge in terms of population, rural isolation and connectivity. Given its geographic area Scotland is approximately as challenging as the region I live in. For example, Scotland has a comparable volume of call-outs. However, it spends twice the budget. It has a significant cohort of staff, far in excess of our National Ambulance Service. I call on the Minister of State to come back to us in future and to be prepared to examine where we are going to go in this budget in respect of the recruitment of emergency medical technicians. I call on the Minister of State to follow through with the strategic plan that, we understood, was to be rolled out in what is called the Bermuda Triangle, comprising the area from Tuam to Boyle to Castlerea. I call on the Minister of State to map out a specific element of understanding of what is required to follow through with the commitments given by the Government. There was one broken promise when the Roscommon accident and emergency unit closed, but the second broken promise was that the Government did not follow up and invest in response times, emergency medical technician staffing, ambulance bases and a modern fleet worthy of the citizens in the area. The people there have a high expectation and believe the vehicles should be up to standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_488"> I intend to come back to discuss the matter with the Minister of State again. It is something that we must work on together. We are entitled to the best of public service investment and we want to see an emergency response unit as part of our ambulance service that is fit-for-purpose.</p>

            <p eId="para_489">The recent referendum in Scotland highlighted many things, one of which was that the investment in individual citizens in Scotland is approximately five times more than the corresponding figure in either Wales or certain parts of England. We are not comparing like with like. We do not have the luxury of allocating funds to a greater degree to one area over another.</p>
            <p eId="para_490"> The NAS has sought funding for 2015 to facilitate an improvement in the ambulance service in the west and to meet capacity and HIQA review recommendations. Funding to the value of approximately €1.2 million is required to staff ambulance stations in Tuam and Mulranny on a 24 hour, seven day basis. In addition, approximately €1.7 million is required to eliminate on-call in the west. Conversion of the vacated Garda station to an ambulance station in Loughglinn, County Roscommon, has commenced and will be completed in a few weeks time. That should answer some of the Deputy's concerns.</p>

            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_491">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to address this topic. Apart from housing, the loss of medical cards for those over 70 years is the main issue that I am dealing with in my office at the moment. I imagine this is probably the case for most other Deputies as well. I need not remind the Minister of State that following the elections in May the loss of medical cards was identified as the number one reason why the Government took a trouncing. All of the attention seemed to be focused on the loss of discretionary medical cards and a decision was taken to restore them. However, what was not highlighted at the time and what is one of the biggest problems relating to medical cards is that the income limit for those over 70 years has been cut so drastically.</p>
            <p eId="para_492">The Minister of State will recall that for a number of years up to 2008 everybody aged over 70 was entitled to a medical card. When the then Minister for Health, Ms Mary Harney, announced she would introduce an income limit, there were huge protests. The leaders of the main Opposition parties at the time, Deputies Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore, were on the platform at a protest on Molesworth Street supporting the pensioners and they decried the fact that income limits were being introduced. However, they were introduced and they worked reasonably well in so far as they were set at a level that enabled the vast majority of the over 70s to retain their cards. Approximately 5% of medical card holders lost theirs as a result of that decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_493"> That was fine until last year when the Taoiseach and the then Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, supported a proposal in the budget to cut the income limits for those aged 70 again to €1,200 per week for a couple and €600 for a single person. That was bad enough, given it kicked in in April 2013, but a second cut was announced in last October's budget, which meant that in less than a year the income limits were cut twice. That resulted in a cut of €500 per week for couples and this has had a drastic impact on access to medical card cover. Members are dealing with this every day. The major difference in the income limits for those aged over 70 and those aged under 70 is gross income is used for the over 70s and no consideration is given to the medical or other expenses they incur. They are inclined to have significant medical conditions because of their age.</p>
            <p eId="para_494"> A great many of those in their late 70s, 80s or 90s are put through the mill in medical card reviews. They receive calls to provide information on their financial circumstances with many of them told they have exceeded the income limit and they will lose their medical card and, instead, be awarded a GP visit card. That is a poor consolation for an elderly person who needs access to community services because the medical card is the passport to such services, including public health nurses, physiotherapy in the case of somebody who has had a stroke, speech and language therapy, which is also important for older people, and home helps. These are key services in enabling people to remain in their homes and out of nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_495"> What is going on makes no sense whatsoever. It is wrong that the Minister of State is doing this to elderly people, many of whom are extremely ill. It also makes no sense from a financial point of view. The system needs to be changed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_496">I am glad the Deputy has raised the issue because she understands it well given she was centrally involved in the review system and what we were going to do with primary care. I will not use the official script because she understands the issue so well.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> The income limits involved are €500 per week for a single person and €900 for a couple. Nine out of ten people aged over 70 have either a GP only card or a medical card. I am glad the Deputy raised the question of access to other services and the passport into other services. We are examining how to separate access to community services, which the Deputy was involved in at the time. This is where we need to go to develop a proper community-based primary care system that does not require someone to have that passport in order that if someone needs access to a community service, it should be available or if he or she needs medical aids or appliances, they are available. Access to physiotherapy, including intensive rehabilitation, and so on should not be dependent on having a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_498"> Nine out of every ten people aged over 70 has access to a GP free of charge and their drugs bill is only €33 a week. The Deputy is correct that at this stage in life, people will more than likely have a chronic condition, even though people are living longer and are healthier, but they can still apply for a discretionary medical card where all the circumstances she outlined are taken into account and they will be treated in the same way. If one's needs are such that one cannot provide for oneself in respect of medical bills, one will be looked on favourably for a discretionary card. In reforming the system, we need to take a serious look at how people access the services they need because it is not always about access to a GP or drugs, it is also about access to community care services. That is what we need to build up and that is what we are doing now.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and I am glad it is her who did because she understands it perfectly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_500">Even in the worst days of the recession, we managed to retain the existing income limits in 2011 and 2012 and it is difficult to understand how three Ministers in the Department could allow two substantial cuts to take place. That was disgraceful at a time they were talking about improving access to medical services, especially for people with medical needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> The Minister of State referred to the GP visit card. It is not of much use to those aged over 70 because they still face substantial drugs costs and the issue is ensuring access to community services. She said nothing in her reply that indicates that work is being done in this regard. If work is ongoing, people should at least be permitted to retain their medical card until an alternative system is put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_502"> Proper access for people needs to be ensured. The Minister of State said that if somebody loses a medical card, he or she can apply on discretionary grounds. Over the past few weeks, I have dealt with several people who have serious medical conditions. I am dealing with one couple in their 80s. The husband is in hospital and the wife is dealing with her own medical conditions. They are expected to find supporting evidence for a new application. They have been told to apply using the under 70s income limits. Rather than people in those circumstances being put through the mill and expected to produce all this documentation while their cover has been removed, the Minister of State should at least introduce a system, if she is not going to ensure net income is used, whereby the medical expenses of those aged over 70 are taken into consideration. That is the key issue. If a person has substantial medical expenses, there should be a way to take them into account while considering their application using the over 70s income limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_503"> The application of income limits currently is too rigid. They are applied on a gross basis and there is no room to consider medical expenses. The Minister of State is causing huge hardship to people at a time they feel vulnerable and have serious medical conditions. It is wrong that she is putting so many elderly people through the mill like this. I ask her to give this issue her urgent attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_507">Let me tell the Deputy about those aged over 70 years. As of 1 September 2014, the number of people aged over 70 holding a medical card stood at 332,872, of whom 5,078 held discretionary medical cards. Some 23,542 people aged over 70 years had a general practitioner visit card on 1 September, of whom 628 held discretionary medical cards. It is not the case that the system is not working, although I accept that it needs more tweaking. We are working on the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_508"> The number of people with a medical card is higher than ever owing to the recession, unemployment and increased life expectancy. For this reason, we had to spread the resources available to us more thinly. People have the option of applying for a discretionary medical card and all the issues raised by the Deputy can be taken into account in the application process. Welfare officers have been instructed to help people who are applying for discretionary medical cards.</p>

          <p eId="para_509">I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to the House. I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014, which deals with an issue that has been a passion of the Minister for some time. This legislation was included in the programme for Government and has been long sought by the Labour Party. Similar legislation has been introduced on four occasions since 1999, including, on one occasion, by the Minister when he was an Opposition Deputy. Unfortunately, the legislation was rejected by Fianna Fáil led Governments on each occasion. If legislation on lobbying had been passed in 1999 or subsequently, we may have avoided some of the wrongdoing that has taken place in the intervening period which has given lobbyists a bad name.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> Yesterday's announcement by the Minister of a new process for ministerial appointments to State boards coincides with his introduction to the Dáil of the Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014. This Bill and the new arrangements on appointments are timely and interconnected in that they both deal with transparency and accountability in the manner in which public policy is practised. If all appointments to State boards had been advertised openly on the State boards portal and applications and assessments has been processed by the independent Public Appointments Service, PAS, as proposed by the Minister and agreed by the Cabinet, the shambles of the current by-election to the Seanad would not have occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> I recall an event that took place in the early 1990s when I was a new councillor in Dublin and the Acting Chairman, Deputy Broughan, was also a Labour Party councillor. At that time, Dublin City Council had responsibility for taxi plates. A professional lobbyist, who was subsequently jailed for corruption, strongly lobbied city councillors not to increase the number of taxi plates. At the time, there were between 2,000 and 3,000 taxi plates in the capital, a figure that has since increased to more than 14,000. Councillors proposed introducing a modest increase of 800 in the number of taxi plates over a three year period. We were informed by the lobbyist in question that any increase would create a tide that would engulf the entire taxi industry. The lobbying did not work and councillors persisted with their plan to increase the number of plates. However, the Taoiseach of the day subsequently intervened by effectively preventing the local authority from implementing the wishes of councillors. We all know what took place subsequently. </p>
          <p eId="para_512"> There is nothing wrong with lobbying <i>per se</i>. Most of us have spent some time this week attending meetings with various interest groups at which we listened to them make their respective cases for special consideration in the forthcoming budget. Such lobbying is beneficial to the democratic system as it ensures that no group's concerns are overlooked in the run-up to the budget. Our function, as public representatives, is to reflect the needs and concerns of our people through policy decisions and legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The value of regulation of lobbying in fostering a culture of integrity is supported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which states that "a sound framework for transparency in lobbying is crucial to safeguard the public interest, promote a level playing field for business and avoid capture by vocal interest groups". The key objective in introducing a register of lobbying is to make information available to members of the public on the identity of those who are communicating with local and national government and senior civil and public servants on public policy matters. Members of the public have the right to know who has lobbied, is lobbying and will lobby politicians and for whom and for what reason lobbying takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> The shocking disclosures by Mr. Frank Dunlop, lobbyist extraordinaire and former Fianna Fáil Government press secretary, revealed the web of intrigue, bribery and corruption spun by one professional lobbyist to secure the interests of his clients, namely, big business and developers. This was a chilling example of how a corrupt and ruthless lobbyist could poison the planning process for the entire city of Dublin. If a register of lobbying had been in place, Mr. Dunlop, his clients and their activities would have been a matter of public record. Moreover, the web would not have been spun and politicians and public servants could not have been ensnared.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> A well functioning democracy requires communication between the Government and citizens. It is important that policy makers are informed of the opinions of interest groups, representative bodies, industry and civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations and charities. While these groups can offer useful input into the decision making process, at times their aims and objectives may be at odds with the wider public interest. The Bill does not seek to prevent this flow of information into policy making or legislation but rather brings about significantly greater transparency. It is appropriate that this activity is open to public scrutiny as part of the desirable checks and balances that help to ensure any attempt to wield undue or improper influence on the conduct of policy development and decision making is discouraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Moreover, members of the lobbying profession support the introduction of a fair regulatory framework, such as that proposed in the legislation. They have expressed annoyance at the bad name their profession has acquired as a result of the actions of some lobbyists. Recently, I was lobbied by the Public Relations Institute of Ireland, PRII, which states categorically that it strongly supports the aims and principles of the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_517"> I cannot understand the reason an organisation such as the Irish Farmers' Association, the most effective lobbying group in the European Union, if not the world, is opposed to this legislation as it could only benefit from the transparency the Bill will deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> As I stated, I have been lobbied by the PRII and I am inclined to agree with it on one point. I ask the Minister to reconsider the exemption from registration provided for companies with fewer than ten employees. While I can understand the reason for introducing this provision, namely, the need to spare small companies from excessive bureaucracy, a number of companies with a small number of employees have a large turnover and exert considerable influence. I ask the Minister to note that there is not always a direct correlation between influence and size. </p>
          <p eId="para_519"> I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on introducing it. I am aware that introducing legislation on this issue has been part and parcel of his political interests for a considerable period. It is particularly welcome that the Bill is to be placed on the Statute Book at this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_520">I too congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill. It is about time action was taken to regulate and bring greater transparency to lobbying. Lobbying is part of political life and is not inherently bad. Ensuring that different voices are heard is an important function of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">However, when something like lobbying is not done openly, it undermines our democracy. Exactly the same sentiments can be expressed concerning appointments to State boards. Recent events have not cast politics or my own party in a good light. I am ashamed that my party did not move more quickly to fully reform the area of board appointments, as we promised. Old habits die hard, but now at least it would seem this old habit has suddenly died very quickly, and rightly so. It should not have had to happen this way. We should have had the courage of our convictions. That perhaps is the greater failing in recent events. The important fact to take from all of this is that in our commitment to have all board appointments now made through the public appointments system, a cultural problem inherent in the practice of politics in this country since the foundation of the State has been eradicated overnight. I do not welcome the events that brought us to this point, but such change is welcome. The Minister has moved swiftly to bring in this change. He has seen the opportunity in this crisis and I congratulate him for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> It is also welcome that we are now moving to bring some regulation and transparency to the area of lobbying. I have been lobbied on the Bill, which I have read in detail. It is an important first step. We need to move together to enact it as quickly as possible. We should use it as a foundation on which to build in order to continue to bring greater transparency and regulation to this area of political life. </p>
          <p eId="para_523"> I wish to raise a couple of points which I hope we can debate on Committee Stage in order to get further clarity on them. Under the legislation, lobbyists are required to register. However, my understanding is that the civil servant, adviser or other person being lobbied has no obligation to ask if the lobbyist is registered. Such an obligation should be put in place. There has to be a balance between the lobbyist and the person being lobbied to ensure that things are done in accordance with the new law. It is my understanding that the person can still be lobbied even if he or she knows the lobbyist is not on a register. I think that is a mistake. If that is the case, it also needs to be amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Under the terms of the Bill, categories of people included as the lobbied include Secretaries General and assistant secretaries, along with their equivalents on local authorities. I wonder if we are pitching this too high in terms of responsibilities. An assistant secretary has a huge amount of work coming across his or her desk and cannot always be on top of all the details. I wonder, therefore, if we might include one or two levels below, just as a safeguard. If they were excluded because it was felt they were not relevant for lobbyists, there should be no harm in including them.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">Excellent. I thank the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> I wish make another point already raised by my colleague Deputy Costello concerning companies with fewer than ten employees. I often get lobbied by small companies on the same issue. It has been brought to my attention that large companies might create small subsidiaries just for this purpose, if they think it is important enough. If we can find some sort of language to capture that without putting an unnecessary regulatory or financial burden on small businesses, that would be welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> As for the code of conduct, my understanding from the legislation is that the lobbyist must have regard to the code but it is not binding on them. There are no sanctions or penalties for not following the code. If there are no consequences for breaching the code then it will not be adhered to as we would like it to be. We need to ensure that it cannot be ignored. If that is for the next phase it is absolutely acceptable, but we need to find sanctions to ensure integrity.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> The HSE is not included in the legislation, but it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> My final point concerns off-book meetings, which are not covered in the legislation. A skilled lobbyist will earn his or her money in this area. They will be able to arrange an accidental or coincidental meeting because they know a particular person's habits. Irish society is so small that we know where people will be or we can guess at it. We need to do something to try to capture that as best we can, although it may not be possible. The best lobbyist, however, will be able to arrange chance encounters. Therefore, a duty-to-inform provision is required, so that if a person feels he or she was the subject of lobbying on an issue outside the formal structures of a meeting in a Department or elsewhere, he or she should have an obligation to state that. It may not be a perfect mechanism but we should try to capture that area of lobbying that will continue out of the public eye.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> I congratulate the Minister on taking this first step. When I said it was about time, it was not a criticism of the delay; a huge amount has come through in the past three years. It is great that we have seen it come about in this session and at this important time. I welcome the Minister's moves in recent days to protect the integrity of the political system and ensure that work on publicly appointed boards that receive public money is not done because of who one knows but because of what one knows and one's abilities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_532">I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House. It is timely as regards the overall reform of politics, because lobbying is a central part of politics. As Deputy Costello said, part and parcel of a Deputy or Senator's life is to be lobbied by a variety of groups. Unfortunately, because of past history, the word is synonymous with wrongdoing, although it should not be.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> The Bill addresses present shortcomings in the registration requirement and will provide the foundation for a more transparent political system. It will make both politicians and lobbyists more accountable to the public. I hope it will work towards rebuilding the public's trust in the political system, most especially this week, given the goings-on over the last few days.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> The final report of the Mahon tribunal, which covered many areas of Dublin and many former public representatives, stated that legislation regulating lobbying would be "likely to decrease the corruption risks associated with that activity by increasing transparency and accountability in the policy making process." The report went on to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_535">Such regulation would not however, adversely affect the positive role played by lobbyists in the political system. On the contrary, it could well help promote a more positive perception of that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> It is also important to note that while it is necessary to regulate lobbying, and while lobbying is often perceived as a dirty word, it can have a positive impact on political decisions, policy formation and legislative drafting. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, whose work on e-conveyancing is being televised on the Oireachtas channel. Prior to that, we spent a lot of time debating and hearing from various interest groups. That is a form of lobbying which is happening in the public domain. The Bill before us, however, will deal with lobbying that we do not see. It has gone on for decades behind closed doors and has often led to questionable decisions, particularly on planning matters. As a public representative for ten and a half years, I can attest that in the first few weeks of my career I was met by an individual in my office in Fingal County Council. This person was a one-man company representing a number of development clients or landowners. There were all sorts of commitments made, none of which was financial. That happened in 2004 at the height of public awareness of wrongdoings that had occurred in previous years in the planning process, yet it was rife. I am sure I am not the only public representative to have experienced that. It stopped a couple of years after that, but even in 2004, when there was a sea change in local government representation, it was still occurring. It is a regrettable thing in our history. We are now required to conform with international best practice by bringing forward this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> On a couple of occasions I have travelled to the United States and have been to Washington DC, including Capitol Hill. Lobbying firms are operating all around those government institutions. As a number of contributors to this debate have said, that does not make the lobbyists bad people; it is simply a way of making representations on behalf of clients or shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> Deputy Eoghan Murphy made a point about companies with fewer than ten employees. Sometimes the most effective lobbyist, as he outlined, is the individual who takes advantage of knowing about a politician's or other individual's diary to make a representation. That person might simply be one individual and not even a company. I urge caution concerning the requirement that these companies do not have to register as lobbyists.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Are we talking about a financial burden on companies that register as lobbyists? I do not believe we are. Therefore, what is the issue with ensuring everybody who makes representations, particularly to public representatives and particularly regarding the zoning of land, is required under legislation to register as a lobbyist and with ensuring the public has an opportunity to see who is registered and who they are representing?</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Section 8 of the Bill outlines the provision for the registration of lobbyists. A lobbyist must be registered before carrying out lobbying activity. When a person is lobbying for the first time, he or she must have his or her registration completed before the next return date, with three return dates being set in a year. Perhaps I misunderstand it. What we are talking about - forgive me if I am wrong - is a regime where there is no requirement on those lobbied to ask whether a lobbyist is registered or representing a firm or landowner, for example. If I am correct, perhaps we might consider this again and examine it in the next stage of the process that the Minister has mentioned. </p>
          <p eId="para_541"> Perhaps there should be an onus on individuals who are lobbied, particularly public servants and public representatives, to ask whether a lobbyist is registered. Having been a public representative for just over ten years, I see no harm in asking that question of a person who wants a piece of land zoned by councillors in my local area, for example, or a person who wants legislation changed to benefit him materially or the company he represents. I see no difficulty in that. With regard to transparency in the public domain, I do not imagine one could make a case for regarding the question I describe as onerous. </p>
          <p eId="para_542"> On appointments to State boards, I welcome the collective decision to take further steps announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, following yesterday's Cabinet meeting. I accept fully that the Minister has a very busy portfolio. As he is aware, I do a lot of work in the area of public expenditure and reform in Fine Gael, but while I accept the Minister's bona fides on his having received agreement only yesterday, I believe the reform agenda needs to be accelerated, particularly regarding politics.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_289">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_543">I am sharing my time with Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014. The word "lobbying" conjures up all sorts of images, including bribery, corruption, brown envelopes, secret decision-making, undue influence and cronyism. All these concepts are in the public mind when the word "lobbying" is used. That is not surprising at all, because the public has been made cynical by a series of issues that have arisen over recent years, including revelations from various inquiries and tribunals, and particularly because of the wholesale reneging on election promises and commitments made by all the main political parties over recent years. The current Government is operating to a policy that it opposed during the election campaign. Both Fine Gael and the Labour Party opposed it. The policy was commenced and introduced by the Fianna Fail-Green Party Government. What is being done by the current Government is the exact opposite of what it campaigned on prior to the last general election. This gives the public reason to be cynical about politics, politicians and political parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> Water charging has been introduced today, 1 October. This again leaves the public cynical, confused and angry. Water charging has been introduced by a Government containing the Labour Party, which absolutely opposed it during the course of the last general election campaign. Not only that; it warned the public not to vote for Fine Gael on the grounds that it would introduce water charges. One should remember its take on the famous Tesco advertisement. Today, however, a Labour Party Minister is introducing water charges, so it is not surprising that the public is cynical and angry about lobbying, transparency and accountability. The latter two terms have been tarnished badly over the years, including in recent weeks. The words "transparency" and "accountability" are now regarded by the public as meaning their exact opposite. The use of these terms by any politician now immediately generates unease among the public because it takes it to mean that the individual will not be accountable or transparent. A registration of lobbying Bill will be helpful, but only if every i is dotted and every t crossed and if it covers every area comprehensively and significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> Other speakers referred to the various appointments to State boards. What has occurred in this regard is totally at variance with the so-called democratic revolution that we were promised by the current Government. The new process for appointing members of State boards announced yesterday gives no certainty at all that cronyism will be outlawed. The fact of the matter is that a political decision will ultimately be made by a Minister - a politician - to appoint people to State boards. The process should obviously be overseen by the Commission for Public Service Appointments and we should ensure that representations of any kind would disqualify applicants from posts in which they are interested. The ultimate appointment must be made by some body other than the Minister, an independent body.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_290" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_547">Unelected and unaccountable.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_548">There is evidence to suggest that even where the public appointments process has been used, the vast majority of appointees have been and are connected to political parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> This legislation is certainly welcome, but we need every i to be dotted and every t to be crossed. There are obviously areas that need to be examined, and significant amendment will be needed during Committee and Remaining Stages. If a professional lobbyist, in return for payment, makes a relevant communication about a relevant matter to a person who is not a designated public official, this is not considered lobbying. If an individual who is an employer directs an employee to make a relevant communication to a designated public official solely about the implementation of a particular public policy, this is not considered lobbying.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">We need to deal with these and other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I welcome the introduction of a register of lobbyists, the monitoring of that register and the reporting of returns by lobbyists. However, there are questions to be answered about the Bill. What, for example, is meant by "in return for payment"? Does this refer solely to a financial payment? Is it possible that a person could be a lobbyist without being in receipt of a financial payment? That could and will happen. This issue must be addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_552"> On the exclusion of a business with fewer than ten employees, the Bill refers to an employer or lobbyist where a business has more than ten employees. This should be amended as I do not see any good reason an employer of a business with fewer than ten employees should be excluded from the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> I wish to refer to another area the Bill should deal with. I refer to particular categories of civil servants which do not appear to be covered by the legislation, for example, principal officers and assistant principal officers. Also, in the Bill the onus is placed entirely on lobbyists to declare their activities. This section is not strong enough. An onus should be placed on the person lobbied to disclose the lobbying.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> This legislation is important, but it will need significant amendment before enactment. We must accept from the evidence that ethics go out the window when they clash with profit and financial advantage. We need to ensure we dot every "i" and cross every "t". The jury is out on the Bill and we must see significant amendment of it before it is passed.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_555">Changing the law can change behaviour if the law is right and if there are adequate sanctions. Therefore, it is important that we have legislation that goes to the heart of some of the worst practices we have seen in Irish politics to date. The Bill can contribute to this, but the Minister should accept suggestions to improve it on Committee Stage. It is important that the Bill go as far as it can on this issue and I will put forward some suggestions in my contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> We are all aware of and many speakers have given a long list of examples of how the system can be corrupted that would not inspire one with confidence in the political system. We had the beef tribunal, the Ansbacher accounts report and the Mahon and Moriarty tribunal reports on the planning system. We also had the report on the taxi licence system. There was war about the taxi licences at the time and there are mixed views on how it played out, with taxi drivers not being too happy with the result.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> There is a huge cost to the State of corruption of the processes. Take, for example, the planning process. We only have to look around the country to see how difficult it is to provide public transport because of our dispersed population or how expensive it is to provide for water and wastewater systems because we do not have a normal settlement pattern. The provision of these facilities is not without cost to taxpayers. The problem is that we are providing facilities in the least cost effective way. When the regional authorities, the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines were put in place, behaviour changed because people had to comply with the regime. This brought an improvement. However, I am somewhat concerned about the construction sector in terms of its strength. Looking, for example, at the position of items planned for the Order Paper, there is significant lobbying, including looking for a reduction in the windfall tax, development contributions and a range of other measures. I have noted, for example, the position of particular Bills on the A list. First, we have a Bill to do with Construction 2020. I would be first to argue there is a deficit in construction, but there is a deficit also in regard to problems which have been neglected, for example, the building control Bill which proposes to regulate builders, the housing regulation Bill which will provide for the likes of the housing associations to be formalised and the planning and development Bill which will include some of the Mahon tribunal recommendations. These Bills fall way behind what is on the A list. What is on the list is precisely what the construction sector most wants to see changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> As a public representative at both local and national level, this is the second time I have experienced a crash in the construction sector. We are moving back into construction without having repaired the problems or addressed the issues involved. We are starting the process again. The Government just has a short time left in office and the important changes that should have been made before construction started again have not been made. I am concerned about the strength of the construction sector and the fact that, as a force, it may not engage again where it can because it wants to see changes made in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> I brought forward legislation that was not opposed by the Government and which sought to rebalance consumer protection in the context of planning. My legislation proposed the introduction of a national register to register bonds or development contributions and builders with a history of non-compliance. However, while it is accepted that some of these proposals will find a way into legislation, that is very far down the line. We do not seem to have dealt with this issue and I am concerned about the lobbying that continues to be carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Every day in this House we see thousands of pieces of communication, most of which are fine. They come from individual constituents who are trying to access services and facilities or informing us of what they think should be done. That is not what the Bill is about, rather it is about professional lobbying. I often wonder about individuals who ask about how they can be effective from the point of view of lobbying and I have put together a guidance document to give to people as too often there is an imbalance between professional lobbyists and individuals. These individuals are equally as entitled to have their voices heard in a proportionate way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>

          <p eId="para_562">I will show it to the Minister. One obvious piece of advice is not to arrange a march to Leinster House on a Saturday. This is a small country and we are all aware of the informal lobbying that takes place, whether in the Galway tent, on golf courses or wherever else.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">We can see through the document which was put together by TASC to map the golden circle the relationship, for example, on a small number of boards of a small number of people. While I know it relates to different legislation, it shows just what a small country this is and how difficult it is to deal with this issue because a person is getting to somebody who might have influence, yet it is not regarded as lobbying. It will be quite difficult to curtail it. We also need to look at the other areas and perhaps suggestions will be brought forward on Committee Stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_564"> With regard to the cooling off period, the county managers have been excluded, although they are no longer county managers but CEOs. Nonetheless, I most definitely believe they are a group of individuals who should be included. The cooling off period is one year, although the programme for Government stated it would be two. For a planner going to work for An Bord Pleanála, for example, it is two years that the person cannot adjudicate on something that affects the area on which they formerly worked. Two years would be a more reasonable period and is the kind of safeguard we should be putting in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> We see people who have been incredibly lucky in this country and they seem to be in the know. We are not supposed to mention names, but when one starts to look at mobile phone licences, water meters, owning hospitals and newspapers, it is very difficult not to think of one particular individual who is all-powerful. It is quite incredible how a small number of people have become so wealthy and powerful and that they have not done so without influence and having access to individuals who have power. That in itself shows the need for this legislation; not only that, it shows the need for this legislation to work and for us to make sure it is made to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> One of the areas in which I would be concerned about it being made to work is staffing levels in and the resources of the Standards in Public Office Commission in order for it to be able to follow up on issues in a meaningful way. Its members have a remit about which they complain from time to time and they are quite open about this in terms of politics. They complain about some of the functions they would like to have in order to be able to do something more substantial but which they cannot do because of the lack of resources. If we are to give them extra responsibility, we have to give them the resources they need to carry out that function. Otherwise, we will be accused of what many Governments and Parliaments in past decades have been accused of, namely, introducing plenty of legislation with not enough enforcement provisions. It is equally important that we have the resources right to ensure enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> The Bill is most definitely welcome and will move in the right direction. It can be strengthened and I hope the Minister will take on board some of the suggestions and amendments that will be brought forward following Second Stage. In the main, I am supportive.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Creed<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_568">I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Bill. The first point I would like to make is that we in this House are in a very privileged position to be elected and representatives of the people. Obviously, that honour is something we should cherish and not in any way tarnish by our activities. I sometimes very much regret the willingness within political discourse to undermine the actions and words of our political opponents in such a way as to imply incorrect motives to them. Obviously, in the cut and thrust of political debate there will be disagreements on policy and ideology, which is very acceptable. However, very often we cross the line in our efforts to make political points to such an extent that, in fact, it draws the profession of politics into disrepute. Collectively, that is something on which we should reflect.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> There are very many people who are willing to subscribe to a view that this Chamber is a heaving mass of corruption and self-indulgence. The truth is different and I acknowledge this across the political divide in regard to people with whom I would be uncomfortable ideologically. I would not second-guess the bona fides of all those sent here. It is true to say that, in all of my time here, there have been a small minority who have betrayed the public interest by promoting self-interest ahead of the public interest and, of course, we should always have adequate checks and balances and laws to deal with this. However, our willingness to undermine the profession of politics marks a slippery slope that will ultimately fracture the close links between public representatives and the public they serve. We would do well to reflect on the dangers of creating a "them and us" approach where the public's confidence in the political process - not in Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Independents, Fianna Fáil or Sinn Féin but in the process itself - is damaged. That is something on which we should reflect.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> I acknowledge this is not the perfect week or day for me to be making these points. I put up my hands and say the current debacle in which the Taoiseach is involved in respect of the appointment of a Fine Gael candidate in a Seanad by-election to the board of the IMMA is regrettable, to say the least, and has not done much to dispel the image of malpractice and cronyism. In preparing for the debate on the Bill I took to reading what some might call works of fiction, although it is interesting reading. One is the Fine Gael manifesto in 2011 and the other is the programme for Government. It is interesting to note that a lot has been achieved in the area of political reform on which our absent friends in the press gallery are very often reluctant to report, whereas they use as a stick to beat us the things that have yet to be ticked off and delivered on.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> I welcome this legislation, although I have some concerns which I will bring to the Minister's attention in the course of the debate. However, it is important to acknowledge that quite a lot has been done, while other things remain to be delivered on. One of the interesting things I found in the Fine Gael manifesto of 2011 is, in the context of the current controversy, worth reading. It states: "Vacancies for all remaining paid directorships on public boards will be advertised on the website of the Public Appointments Service, and short-lists of qualified applicants will be presented to Ministers". I welcome the Minister's recent announcement in this regard. It is something that will serve to reinforce the fact that the overwhelming majority of Members today and during the history of the State have always been and were motivated by public service. We run a risk in continuously undermining and second-guessing their motivations and by making unsubstantiated political charges that we will actually bring the profession of politics into disrepute. I suppose what I am saying is that we need to play the ball all the time, not the man, something that is at times lost here.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> As I said, I consider it to be a great privilege to be a representative in this Chamber of the people of my constituency of Cork North-West. We live in a representative parliamentary democracy. I would be very slow to introduce or support legislation that in any way undermined the interaction I have on a daily and weekly basis with my constituents, or placed any impediment between my constituents and me or between any representative here and his or her constituents in terms of their unfettered access as individual citizens to their public representatives. That has to be something that should be subject to the closest possible scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> I made reference to the question of whether this was a heaving mass of corruption or whether most Members of the House were well motivated. I believe they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> It is interesting to note that Transparency International, which is an international body of some standing, reported in 2009 that we were the 16th least corrupt nation out of 180 nations it surveyed in its index of corruption globally. That is something for which this Chamber should take a bow. However, I accept that this must be assessed side by side with the results of various tribunals of inquiry, which have put a stain on the reputation of our system of parliamentary democracy. One can go back as far as the beef tribunal, the Mahon tribunal and the plethora of incidents that have been referred to by other colleagues in this debate. We must tread very carefully in respect of that interaction that is critical to our functioning democracy and the social cohesion we enjoy, and anything that puts an impediment in the way of the link between our representatives and the public. I would be very slow to support legislation that raises a question mark about the entitlement of a constituent of mine to step into my constituency office in Macroom or any of my clinics around the constituency from Ballincollig to Charleville. That would be a flawed piece of legislation. I raise this issue in the context of the Bill because I wonder whether this will be a lobbyist's charter. If a citizen cannot walk into my constituency office unfettered, must he or she then pay money to get a lobbyist to come in? It is a very interesting time to have this debate because we are in the middle of the pre-budget season and lobbying is at its peak. Today alone I had breakfast with Teagasc and elevenses with the Irish Road Haulage Association, while tomorrow it will be-----</p>

          <p eId="para_576">Tomorrow it will be the turn of the INTO and the Simon Community, while earlier this week it was the Society of the Irish Motor Industry. I have heard from the drinks industry and the IFA. One has the whole gamut of society from the business community to the trade union movement to non-governmental organisations. They often raise general issues about which individual constituents come to me for 12 months of the year. For example, the IFA, which is probably one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the country, has had its day in Dublin and met with all of us. We jump when it says it is having a lobbying session because it is an important voice for rural communities, as are the other farming organisations from whom I have heard, such as the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association and Macra na Feirme. Very often, what happens is that subsequent to that lobbying session, the local IFA activists will come to my constituency clinic. As I understand, a particular interpretation of the legislation before the House could mean that the local branch of the IFA could no longer come to me. It would have to send its PR company or lobbyist. I see the Minister shaking his head and I hope that is correct, because that would be a real danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> I am a lobbyist and I am lobbied. That is my duty as a public representative. I am lobbied all day every day, and rightly so. If a woman comes into my constituency clinic who has a problem with the Department of Social Protection about her social welfare payment, a parent comes to me who is concerned about the number of children in a classroom or the pupil-teacher ratio, or a farmer comes to me with concerns about Common Agricultural Policy reform, I am being lobbied. That is part and parcel of what I do. I must be able to differentiate between what is appropriate and inappropriate. Ultimately, I am held to account in the most telling of fashions, and I have been on the winning and losing sides of that telling procedure, which is an election every so often. That is the ultimate form of accountability. We need to tread carefully in terms of placing impediments before my constituents in having unfettered access to me, as is their right.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> I know the other side of the argument and I understand the motivation behind the legislation. I think it is coming from a significant number - I will not say a small number - of high-profile events relating to planning corruption. As I said, I am a lobbyist and I am lobbied. I am a lobbyist when I come here. I am invariably at the back of the Chamber bending a Minister's ear. It might be the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when I am looking for something in my constituency. It might be the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in respect of the N22 bypass from Macroom. It might be any one of a range of Government Ministers. Where do I fit in? I am at the receiving end of this legislation insofar as I am one of the aforementioned people who will have legal requirements placed upon them as people who are lobbied. On the other side, I am also a lobbyist. </p>
          <p eId="para_579"> In respect of the organisations covered, could the Minister dwell in his reply on why certain organisations are not mentioned? For example, the Judiciary, the gardaí and the HSE are not mentioned. I am interested in knowing why they are not specifically mentioned in the legislation, given the very significant roles they play. The HSE would seem to be a glaring omission given the size of its budget. </p>
          <p eId="para_580"> On balance, it is a step in the right direction. I would like to be reassured by the Minister that this in no way interferes with the traditional engagement between a public representative and his or her constituents. I know there is a view out there and among our absent colleagues in the Fourth Estate, who are not listening to this debate now, that rural Deputies in particular are excessively involved in clientelism and spend too much time listening to our constituents and that the country would be far better if we did none of this menial stuff and got on with the business of fine flowery intellectual contributions in this Chamber about the important issues. I consider myself to be best informed in debates by virtue of practical experience because of the engagement I have with ordinary people - I do not use the term in any pejorative sense - whose lives are affected by the daily decisions we make. The challenge as public representatives is getting that balance right. Obviously, we must be our own moral guardians in the interim between one election and the other, when the public will adjudicate on us. I acknowledge that the actions of a small minority within this Chamber have betrayed the overwhelming commitment to public service that is manifest in all Members across all political parties.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Bannon<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_581">I am pleased to have the chance to contribute to the debate this evening. Back in October 2012, I asked the Taoiseach when we would be given a date for the introduction of this Bill. The response was that it was not possible to indicate at that time. Therefore, I am glad to see that the Bill has been published and that I am getting a chance to speak about it nearly two years later. I believe this Bill is long overdue. For far too long, lobbying in Ireland has been an unregulated activity that at times has been shrouded in secrecy. Due to the behaviour of Fianna Fáil, towns and villages throughout the country have been destroyed by over-zoning. There were reasons for that. We see the ghost estates that have been built up in some parts of the country and the cost to the State when developers walked away from finishing projects. The report of the Mahon tribunal showed what happened when vested interests, unnamed lobbyists and self-serving individuals became involved in the decision-making process. It was a great lack of transparency and accountability in the policy making process that allowed this to happen. With the publication of the report of the Mahon tribunal and its recommendations, we now have an opportunity to rebuild public confidence in policies and the business of Government. This Bill will increase the responsibility of decision makers while at the same time provide greater openness to those who want to influence public policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I do not think this Bill will impinge on general lobbyists such as the bodies and organisations outlined by Deputy Creed. It will be aimed at regulation and establishing a code of practice which will govern the conduct of lobbying, while at the same time facilitating the appropriate public scrutiny of lobbying activity. It will finally place accountability and integrity in an area of public policy where previously there was none. There are many aspects of the Bill by which I am impressed and which I welcome. However, given my short speaking time I would like to focus on a few points.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> I am pleased to see the introduction of an online register of lobbyists which will require those on it to disclose their lobbying activities at the end of every April, August and December. However, I would have liked to have seen the Minister go a little bit further with those disclosures and have them on a quarterly basis. This is important because it reveals what is happening and removes the haze of secrecy which previously existed. This Bill, when enacted, will offer much greater transparency to the process of lobbying as we will be able to see clearly who is lobbying whom and the issues they are discussing. After all, the fundamental objective of this Bill is to create greater transparency and openness. I am certain that the introduction of an online register will play a huge part in the broader process of reforming lobbying in this country. </p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I am pleased to see that the Bill provides for a cooling off period. For example, a former special advisor to a Minister will have to seek approval to lobby former colleagues during a one year period after he or she has left public service. I had hoped that could have been extended to a period of two years as this would create a more level playing field and would ensure equal access. It would also work towards reducing the image of former politicians or staff having a direct line to a Minister. </p>
          <p eId="para_585"> Finally, despite its tarnished image over the years lobbying plays a helpful role in the formation of policy. It ensures that all viewpoints can be assessed and determined upon during the legislative or policy making process. The public perception of lobbying will be enhanced and improved by the Bill. This new perception will be underlined by clear and workable guidelines for those the public elect, officials and civil servants. It is my firm belief that the Bill will foster a culture of integrity in the decision making process that has been sadly lacking for quite some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> I compliment the Minister for being in the Chamber to listen to the viewpoints of Members. The Bill is long overdue and it is important that it is passed. It was in the programme for Government. The Minister is doing a very good job in his portfolio and has introduced a lot of legislation. He is, and has always been, a forward thinker.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Stanton<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_587">I am pleased to be able to make a short contribution. I welcome the Bill. It is very important and should have been passed a long time ago. I have examined legislation in other countries. In Australia the lobbyist register requires that upon making contact with a representative or minister, a lobbyist must identify that he or she is a lobbyist, an employee, a contractor or somebody engaged by a lobbyist. I understand a person must also state whether he or she is currently listed on the lobbyist register and that he or she is making contact on behalf of a third party, the name of which must also be disclosed as must the nature of the issue involved. The inclusion of such a provision in the Bill might make for even more transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> The Lobbying Disclosure Act 1995 in the United States extended the definition of lobbyists to include those that lobby directly as well as those who hire lobbying firms. This is something which should be considered. I understand that if people contribute moneys towards lobbying activities in the United States, any organisation which contributes more than $10,000 towards lobbying activities must also be registered. We know of situations in the past where individuals were alleged to have given money to lobbyists to carry out lobbying activities, but it might be useful to examine that because one could find the organisations and individuals behind the lobbyist. </p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Section 22(1) refers to the cooling off period. It states that: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_590">A person who has been a relevant designated public official shall not—</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_591">(a) carry on lobbying activities in circumstances to which this section applies, or</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_592">(b) be employed by, or provide services to, a person carrying on lobbying activities in such circumstances, during the relevant period except with the consent of the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">There are exemptions, on which we need more clarity. We need to know the nature of the exemptions and how the decision is taken as to what they should be. In Canada the cooling off period is, I understand, six years. The cooling off period here will be much shorter and I wonder whether we need to consider extending it. The federal prohibition period in the United States is two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> As I understand it, nothing in the Bill requires a lobbyist to disclose how much he or she is being paid and from whom he or she is receiving payment. Perhaps it should be a requirement that a person should disclose by whom he or she is paid to lobby. </p>
          <p eId="para_595"> Section 13(3) states that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_596">Where the Commission consider that any information contained in an application made by a person under <i>section 11 </i>or a return made by a person under <i>section 12 </i>is inaccurate or misleading, the Commission may immediately remove from the Register the information contained in the application or return pending provision of corrected information; and the person shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as never having made the application or return unless and until the corrected information is provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">As I understand it - I stand to be corrected - there are possible fines for an offence, but anybody found to have made a misleading application should be barred from ever applying again, in addition to the fines listed in the Bill. There could be a mandatory period of exclusion before such a person could apply to be on the register again. It would be a fairly serious thing to do. Nothing in this section requires lobbyists to identify specifically who they intend to lobby. I am not sure if it is possible to change that. They are required to identify who they lobbied after the fact, but not before. </p>
          <p eId="para_598"> It is a timely Bill. It is part of the programme for Government. A lobbyist can lobby directly or indirectly, but we are examining how to make the process far more transparent and visible. There are issues in regard to cooling off periods and so on. The Bill will take a lot of activity out of the shadows. It is important that if somebody is a lobbyist and approaches a Minister, Government official or public official, he or she should identify himself or herself as a lobbyist. That should be very clear from the outset, as should the fact he or she is on the register of lobbyists and is engaged in lobbying.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> If somebody approaches a public official or a Minister and is making a case, is he or she lobbying?</p>
          <p eId="para_600">When is lobbying not lobbying or <i>vice versa</i>? We need more clarity on that. That is my contribution - I said I would be short.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_601">I thank all Members from across the House for their contributions. It was a broad-ranging and well-informed debate on an important Bill. While it is intrinsically a simple Bill, it is hard to balance - this was implicit in virtually every contribution - the proper right of every citizen, organisation and company to have its view heard and its impact and assessment valued by law makers and the Executive, which is very important, with an experience in which some people had the inside track. We use euphemisms such as "the Galway tent" to refer to the way in which the powerful could bend the ear of policy makers and have policy formulation crafted to their own interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I have been working on this area for some time as part of a suite of reform measures. It has been two years since the initial announcement and its presentation to the House but, as I indicated in my opening remarks yesterday, we have had a huge amount of consultation, formal discussion papers and a formal seminar follow-up to ensure that genuine lobbying organisations that have expressed concerns, including the IFA, can be accommodated and given to understand that they have nothing to fear in genuinely pursuing the interests of their members, which is their right. Ordinary citizens should be fully protected in their right to have their voices heard about public policy, and it is about doing this in a transparent and open way. The main goal is to establish a register of lobbying to make information available to the public on the identities of those seeking to influence public policy as well as to provide a framework for holding those engaged in such lobbying accountable for the manner in which they conduct that lobbying. No one should have any fear - and the IFA, the trade union movement, or IBEC would not have a difficulty - about being publicly identified as lobbyists. If we have that in a robust, transparent way, we might restore the tarnished view of lobbyists that many Members of the House have expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> I will comment on some of the observations made by Members during the course of the debate. I will have careful regard to all the views expressed and hope we will have a robust discussion on Committee Stage in due course. On behalf of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Fleming made a general comment relating to State board appointments. Many comments were made by various Deputies on that issue. It is not intrinsically part of the lobbying Bill, but timing is everything. I am very pleased that I secured agreement yesterday on a comprehensive revised model for appointments to State boards. One might say it was handy that I had a prepared brief on the matter, but I have had that for some time. Opportunity is a great thing and I felt we could have consensus about its presentation yesterday. I was very glad to be asked to do that by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Within a number of weeks, I will present the overarching set of guidelines for appointments to State boards to the Government for approval. I say honestly that it will be a fundamental change for the good which will be manifest over time. It will encourage many people who would not have considered putting themselves forward for State boards to go to <i>stateboards.ie</i>, look at the panoply of State boards which are available, the criteria expected for each board, say "I could do that," and send in their curricula vitae to be independently assessed by the Commission for Public Service Appointments. I disagree with those who say the ultimate decisions should not be made by elected Ministers as, whatever else we are, we are accountable to the people here. I will probably be murdered for saying so, but we often appoint judges or others who are supposed to be above reproach but who are accountable to nobody. If Ministers make mistakes, they are hauled over the coals here at least and held to account, which is as it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> Deputy Fleming referred also in his contribution to social contacts. That was a point made by others in the course of the debate today. Any contact which falls within the scope of the legislation that constitutes lobbying is covered, whether it takes place at the Galway races or, to be comprehensive, the Wexford Opera Festival. It would be captured.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> As regards the public servants who come within the scope of the Bill, as raised by a number of Members, I will have discretion as to the timing of the application to persons beyond those listed. In the first instance, those captured will be Secretaries General and assistant secretaries. It is my intention to include principal officers and assistant principal officers in due course. This will be done by way of regulation. I will have regard to the strong views expressed by a number of Members that it should happen sooner rather than later. Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to what we used to call county managers but are now chief executive officers of county councils. They will be captured from the outset by the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Deputies Fleming, McDonald and Kyne raised the issue of the cut-off point for small businesses. The issue resonated in comments made by a number of Deputies this afternoon. I said in my opening Second Stage speech that I did not have a fixed view on the matter. Listening to the views of those I have discussed it with over the last number of months, I did not want to put a burden of registration and thrice-annual reporting on small companies. Some people think it is not onerous, but it is a burden. Some of these are one-man operations - for example, a local painter and his son seeking to make an approach in respect of a new grants system for household repairs. If people feel the way I have designed it to cover companies employing more than ten people is not tight enough, I will consider some of the suggestions made by perhaps looking at company turnover. It is something we will examine between now and Committee Stage, when I will, again, welcome robust debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> Deputy McDonald commented on the period between reviews in the legislation. The legislation will be reviewed within a year of enactment and every five years thereafter. Deputy McDonald accepted the initial annual review but felt it should be every three years thereafter. I have an open mind on the matter as long as we have sufficient evidence and a robust body of information to review in the timeframe provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> Deputy McDonald referred also to the exemption applied to communications between public officials. If everything had to be captured, the sheer volume of communication between public officials would risk overloading the register. I am working diligently to ensure that other transparency mechanisms capture this sort of thing, including the very wide extension of the freedom of information provisions. I look forward, hopefully, to concluding the legislative phase of the freedom of information legislation tomorrow in the Seanad. If we pass it in the other House, that should be law. It will go a long way to addressing the concerns raised by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> Deputy Finian McGrath gave us some examples of what he termed "good" and "bad" lobbying. The aim of the Bill is to secure transparency in all areas of lobbying. We could all instance examples of what we would classify as "good" and "bad" lobbying. Deputy Ross raised the issue of judicial appointments. The Department of Justice and Equality is finalising a report on the consultation process recently undertaken on the system of judicial appointments. I have my own strong views on the matter. I was a member of the Government which initially put forward the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board system as an improvement, but we can go further. It is something we can look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> Deputy Wallace raised concerns about the influence of big business on Government decision making. The intention of the Bill is to assist in informing the public about who is contacting whom about what.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">That is what we need to know, and that will give reassurance to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> Deputy Connaughton talked about the importance of a good fit between the legislation and the political culture. I agree that is an important point, underpinned by the experience of similar legislation in other jurisdictions, and I am keen to hear the practical experience of Members regarding that. We have had a good debate about those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> I acknowledge Deputy Kenny's view that this Bill represents an important step in rebuilding public trust, which no doubt every Member of the House would agree has been sundered in recent years. A number of Deputies, including Deputy Ó Cuív, touched on the cooling off period; other Deputies touched upon that earlier. Deputies were right to say that in the original proposals I put forward and agreed in the programme for Government the cooling off period was two years. I am trying to achieve a balance in terms of what is reasonable. I listened to Deputy Fleming yesterday who suggested that there is nothing inherently bad with a senior official in, say, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine working in an export company that will advance Irish exports and bringing his or her expertise to bear. Having consulted a good deal and having regard to people's constitutional rights to work, and trying to obviate the need to pay any compensation to people for limiting their employability in legislation, which is another point that might have arisen should we have gone too far in this regard, it is a better process to hand it over to an independent, robust and trusted body like the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPOC, for it to make the evaluation whether the proposed work is a real conflict of interest. In my judgment that is the way it would be best to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> To deal with some of the points made this afternoon, I thank Deputy Costello for his warm welcome for this legislation, and that of other Deputies. He laid out the history of lobbying and our unfortunate experience. He also raised the issue of concern about limiting the legislation to impact on companies with greater than ten employees, and I will have regard to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> Deputy Eoghan Murphy again referenced the current controversy about board appointments and welcomed the new regime, which I am glad Government approved yesterday. The Deputy posed a question to me that I will reflect further on, namely, whether there should be an obligation on those who are lobbied to ask the question: are you a lobbyist and for whom do you work. I will reflect further on whether that is a valid question, but I do not want to put in a legal obligation on every Deputy in the House that every time somebody approaches them they have to say, "Stop. Are you a lobbyist?", and if they do not ask the question that somehow they are in breach of legislation. That would not be welcomed by Members of the House. The better way of proceeding is what I have set out, which is the requirement on those who wish to lobby to register on a public platform.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> Deputy Alan Farrell rightly identified the complexity of the issues before us and that are being addressed in this legislation, and spoke about the American experience. For clarity, he said there should be no limitation to those who are lobbying in regard to land zoning, and I can give that assurance. Anybody who is lobbying in regard to the zoning of land is fully registerable under these provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> Deputy Healy gave his standard revision of history relating to my party and the broken promises malarkey. My then party leader, the former Tánaiste, went on the "Late Late Show" in advance of the last election and said we would not be reversing the 2011 budget. We said that publicly in advance of the election. That is just for history. I know people-----</p>

          <p eId="para_620">Deputy Catherine Murphy made a very important point, and it is something I am very conscious of because in many ways the easiest thing to do is legislate. It is much more difficult to change behaviour or change a culture. There is a tiny minority of people whose first attitude, no matter what we legislate for, is to find a way around it as opposed to saying, "This is a cultural change". The changes we brought about yesterday regarding State appointments are cultural shifts that will have a huge impact. There are ways around everything but the suite of measures this Government has put in place - the broadening of the powers of the Ombudsman, the deepening of the powers of SIPOC, the extension of freedom of information into so many areas, the register of lobbyists - will be transformative of the political horizon. There is no doubt it will take a while to bed it in. Will it cure all ills? Of course not, but it will be transformative and I hope will be the basis for the maintenance of trust in politics into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I have already said that county managers will be incorporated. That question was posed by Deputy Catherine Murphy. She made one other point of which I want to make mention, namely, that somehow corrupt planning has provided accommodation in a dispersed way for people. It is an interesting point. In the county council I was a member of at the time, when all the Dublin controversies about corruption were rife a member of Wexford County Council stood up and said, "We'll give planning permission to somebody for a stand alone house anywhere, and the only pay-off we want is their vote". That might be a form of corruption but all of us believe that people have the right to live in rural Ireland as well. We cannot simply say that we can determine centrally where people have the right to live. </p>
          <p eId="para_622"> The funny thing about democracy is that we do not always have to agree with the decisions. The Green Party members were great believers in democracy, in the law of administration, as long as people did what they believed in, and they believed anything outside that scope was somehow a corrupt decision. Sometimes a democratic decision, impartially, without corruption coming about, gives us a result we do not like.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> Deputy Creed talked about the general view of politics and the reform of politics, and I strongly agree with him. We will see that the suite of measures we have enacted and have still to enact in our five-year term will be transformative. He makes a very important point about which I want to reassure him, that is, the right of citizens to access their Deputies. That is not to be impacted upon good, bad or indifferent by this legislation or any other legislation. It might be something many people talk about. Many people write about clientelism but I believe it is not only a very important strength of our democratic system, it is an anchoring strength. My dear friend and colleague, the Minister for Finance, is in the Chamber and he, no more than myself, will know that one can attend very important European Council meetings, come back and still have to deal, rightly, with the minutiae of one's constituency problems. That is very informing of the way we do business in this country and a unique strength of our democratic system.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Deputy Bannon talked about the two year process of bringing the Bill to this current Stage. I believe that was a good two years. A pre-legislative engagement with people is a good thing in that we are not presenting a finished package, so to speak, but setting out our thoughts, engaging with those concerned and taking on board people's concerns even before we bring a Second Stage presentation to this House. I thank the Deputy for his warm welcome of the Bill and the principles that underline it.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> Deputy Stanton talked about the experience in Australia and the United States. All of those have been carefully considered in the crafting of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">As we are culturally different and different in scale, we need a bespoke solution to problems that are unique to us. </p>
          <p eId="para_627"> I have dealt with the issue of the cooling off period.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> I thank all Deputies for their contributions and look forward to a robust debate on Committee Stage. As with all legislation, particularly reforming legislation, I will approach the debate on Committee Stage with an open mind to hear suggestions that would improve it.</p>

          <p eId="para_632">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The purpose of this legislation is to make provision for the inclusion by the ESM board of governors, in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty, of the ESM's direct recapitalisation instrument as one of the financial instruments envisaged under Articles 14 to 18, inclusive, of the treaty. This includes provision for the creation of subsidiary bodies which will implement the direct recapitalisation instrument. It also incorporates the ESM treaty, as adapted, following the accession of Latvia to the ESM on 13 March 2014, into the European Stability Mechanism Act 2012, No. 20 of 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> I will begin by outlining the Bill, as initiated, before giving more detail on the Bill and the reasons for this legislation. The Bill has six sections and a Schedule composed of two parts. </p>
          <p eId="para_635"> Section 1, "Interpretation", clarifies the references in the Bill to the board of governors, the ESM, an ESM member, the principal Act and the treaty. Section 2, "Amendment of definition of "Treaty" in Principal Act", provides that references to "Treaty" in the ESM Act 2012 are to be to the text, as amended, following the accession of Latvia on 13 March 2014. The treaty, as amended, following Latvia's accession is annexed to the Bill in the Schedule in both the Irish and English languages.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Section 3, "Provisions with respect to particular type of instrument and particular entities", allows for the powers contained in the ESM Act 2012 and the treaty to include those arising from the granting of a direct recapitalisation instrument, as well as those arising from the establishment by the ESM of subsidiary bodies or sub-entities. Such bodies may be used by the ESM to effect a direct recapitalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> Section 4, "Type of instrument to which section 3 relates", provides that the instrument referred to in section 3 is an instrument for the direct recapitalisation of a financial institution of an ESM member. Section 5, "Applications of sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Principal Act", provides that these sections of the ESM Act 2012 which deal with the legal status, privileges and immunities, exemptions from tax, as well as from authorisation and regulation by the Central Bank, to be enjoyed by the ESM shall apply also to the ESM acting through a subsidiary body or sub-entity.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> Section 6, "Short title, collective citation and construction", is a standard section defining the Short Title of the Bill. It also provides for the collective citation of the European Stability Mechanism Act 2012 and the Bill, when enacted, as the European Stability Mechanism Acts 2012 and 2014. </p>
          <p eId="para_639"> The Schedule, as I have noted, comprises the texts of the ESM treaty, as amended, following Latvia's accession as the 18th member of the ESM in the Irish and English languages, being Parts 1 and 2, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> The euro area Heads of State or Government agreed in June 2012 that it was imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns and that when a single supervisory mechanism, involving the ECB, was in place and operational, the European Stability Mechanism should recapitalise banks directly. The Single Supervisory Mechanism will come into operation on 4 November this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> The Eurogroup meeting on 20 June 2013 agreed to the main features of the European Stability Mechanism's direct recapitalisation instrument, DRI. The instrument is available for institutions the viability of which can be secured by a capital injection. In this context, the guideline provides that the instrument shall not be used for the winding up of institutions. The euro area member states reached a preliminary agreement on the operational framework of the ESM DRI on 10 June this year. This includes the draft guideline on financial assistance for the direct recapitalisation of institutions which sets out how the DRI will operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> The draft guideline agreed on 10 June 2014 includes a specific provision on the retroactive application of the instrument. Therefore, the agreement that we were active in negotiating keeps open the possibility of applying to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation. The draft guideline states the potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided by the ESM board of governors on a case-by-case basis by mutual agreement. It also states the detailed modalities for retroactive recapitalisation shall be established in the relevant decision of the ESM board of governors, that is, the euro area Finance Ministers. Establishing the DRI requires a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM board of governors, subject to completion of national approval processes, to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty. The aim is to have the process completed by November this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> An amendment to the ESM Act 2012 will be required to allow the Minister for Finance, as a member of the ESM board of governors, to pass the necessary resolutions. In short, there are three reasons for amending the ESM Act 2012 to allow for the DRI. First, the ESM was established to provide loans for member states. The DRI provides for loans for financial institutions, on the basis of an application by a member state. Second, the DRI provides that subsidiary bodies and sub-entities may be used to facilitate such investments. Third, while the ESM treaty provides for limited self-amendment, for example, in Article 19, to add to the range of financial instrument that can be used, these changes for the DRI go beyond what the Dáil approved in the ESM Act 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> The ESM Act 2012 provided for the payment of Ireland's contributions to the ESM and also made provision for the immunities included in the ESM treaty in Irish law. The ESM treaty, as it stood in 2012, was annexed to the Act. Article 3 of the ESM treaty states the "purpose of the ESM shall be to mobilise funding and provide stability support under strict conditionality, appropriate to the financial assistance instrument chosen, to the benefit of ESM Members which are experiencing, or are threatened by, severe financing problems, if indispensable to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its Member States". The key feature is that it provides for financial assistance for euro area member states. </p>
          <p eId="para_645"> Article 19 of the ESM treaty provides that the "Board of Governors may review the list of financial assistance instruments provided for in Articles 14 to 18 and decide to make changes to it". The direct recapitalisation instrument is being introduced under this article. However, as the direct recapitalisation instrument was not in existence when the ESM was adopted and as it provides for direct assistance to a financial institution, it is considered that this expands the scope of the treaty beyond what was approved by the Oireachtas in the ESM Act 2012 and an amendment to that Act to provide for the new instrument is, therefore, required.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> In addition, the draft guideline provides for the use of subsidiary bodies and entities of the ESM, including with external investment, to conduct the actual recapitalisation. While the treaty provides for ESM subsidiaries, the amendment provides for their use with the direct recapitalisation instrument. I should also clarify that the position on Ireland's capital contribution to the ESM will not be changed by this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The aim of the instrument is to preserve the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and its member states. It does so by catering for those specific cases in which an ESM member experiences acute difficulties with its financial sector that cannot be remedied without significantly endangering its fiscal sustainability owing to a severe risk of contagion from the financial sector to the sovereign. The use of the instrument could also be considered if other alternatives would have the effect of endangering the continuous market access of an ESM member.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> The Eurogroup agreed in June 2013 that an <i>ex ante</i> limit or cap of €60 billion would be set by the ESM's board of governors for the amount of financial assistance available for the DRI. It was also approved at the time that the €60 billion cap could be reviewed by the board of governors, if deemed necessary. This amount is provided within the ESM's overall lending capacity of €500 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The reasons for the cap are as follows: to preserve the ESM's lending capacity for other instruments; to provide transparency for investors; and to help to preserve the ESM's high creditworthiness. This limit strikes a balance between the necessary containment of risks for the ESM, while at the same time ensuring sufficient capacity for the instrument. In this context, it is important to recognise that the ESM's DRI is part of a broader EU response to breaking the link between banks and sovereigns. It must be viewed in conjunction with the banking union measures, particularly the bank recovery and resolution directive, the single supervisory mechanism, the single resolution mechanism and the single resolution fund. Article 14 of the draft operational guideline on the DRI, approved by euro area Finance Ministers on 10 June this year, provides for retroactive direct recapitalisation. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_650">This guideline is established without prejudice to existing ESM and EFSF programmes in which financial assistance has been provided to ESM Members who recapitalised their institutions, which could be replaced in part or in full with a retroactive application of direct recapitalisation following a decision by the ESM Board of Governors, on a case-by-case basis, by mutual agreement.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_651">The detailed modalities for such replacement shall be established in the relevant ESM Board of Governors decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">As I have stated on a number of occasions, including in replies to parliamentary questions, an application for the DRI can only be made once the instrument takes effect and this, in turn, requires that the single supervisory mechanism be in place and operational, which is expected to be 4 November this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> The ESM treaty, as adapted following Latvia's accession to the ESM in March this year, is being annexed to the ESM Act 2012, in both the Irish and English languages through this legislation, to ensure the most recent version of the treaty is associated with the Act. Latvia applied to join the ESM on 21 August 2013, arising from its imminent accession to the euro. The arrangements for its accession to the ESM were decided in accordance with Article 44 of the ESM treaty. In October 2013 the ESM board of governors which, as I have noted, is composed of the euro area Finance Ministers, approved Latvia's application to join the ESM, with the technical terms for Latvia's accession. Latvia joined the euro on 1 January 2014 and became the 18th member of the ESM on 13 March, 20 days after it had deposited its instrument of accession.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> A consequence of Latvia joining the ESM is a requirement to adapt the ESM treaty to reflect this fact. As I have mentioned, the ESM treaty provides for limited self-amendment. This includes the adaptations arising directly from the accession of a new member in accordance with Article 44 of the ESM treaty. Such adaptations are subject to the approval of the board of governors by mutual agreement in accordance with Article 5(6) of the ESM treaty. The adaptations arising from Latvia's accession fall within these provisions. These changes were agreed to by the board of governors on 23 October 2013. Since there were adaptations to the text of the ESM treaty to accommodate Latvia's accession, including to Annexes I and II of the treaty, it is considered appropriate to take the opportunity presented by the Bill to address this issue. The changes to the ESM treaty arising from Latvia's accession are as follows: the inclusion of Latvia in the list of member states; the amendment of Articles 8.1 and 8.2 to increase the total authorised capital stock and value of paid-in shares by the amount of Latvia's contribution to each; the inclusion of Latvian as an official language through a new paragraph being added to the final part of the main text of the treaty, which is set out in the ESM treaty as annexed to the Bill; and the amendment of annexes I and II to the treaty to include Latvia's contribution key and share of the capital stock.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> These changes to the annexes have been made because the technical terms of Latvia's accession to the ESM approved by the board of governors include the calculation of Latvia's capital contribution to the ESM. Latvia's ESM capital contribution key was set at 0.2757%. This means that Latvia's total capital subscription will be €1.93 billion, including €221.2 million in paid-in capital which will be paid in five annual instalments of €44.24 million each. Latvia has paid its initial instalment of paid-in capital and is expected to make the four remaining payments annually up to 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> The ESM direct recapitalisation instrument represents a core element of a much broader EU approach to the issue of breaking the bank-sovereign link, as was committed to by the euro area leaders in June 2012. This includes the establishment of the single supervisory mechanism, the bank recovery and resolution directive, the single resolution mechanism and the single resolution fund. The inclusion of the ESM treaty, as adapted, following Latvia's accession ensures the most up-to-date text of the ESM treaty is annexed to the associated legislation. As the ESM intends to seek the approval of the board of governors for the DRI in November, this legislation needs to be in place by the end of this month and it has been scheduled accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> I look forward to an informed and constructive debate and commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_658">I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the European Stability Mechanism (Amendment) Bill. Fianna Fáil will support the Bill because it is a logical extension of supporting the original ESM Bill in 2012 but for the more important reason, as indicated in the Minister's opening contribution, that it keeps open the possibility of a deal on retroactive recapitalisation for this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> This subject is deeply depressing. I refer to last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service which was a pre-legislative hearing attended by departmental officials. The prospect of Ireland accessing the ESM by means of a retroactive deal seems to be coming more remote with each passing day. Aside from that issue, for any country in the eurozone which is seeking to access the ESM and the banks of which get into difficulty, there are so many ladders to climb and hoops to jump through that it will become virtually impossible for any country to avail of the direct recapitalisation provisions, not to mention retroactive recapitalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> This must be seen in the context of the Heads of Government summit agreement in June 2012 which was heralded as a game-changer, a seismic shift, by which the sovereign state and bank debt would be separated. What we have had since is far removed from this. Even under the direct recapitalisation instrument which has been enshrined in the treaty, countries seeking to access the ESM for direct recapitalisation will only be able to do so if they themselves are unable to provide the money for the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">We are not separating bank debt from the sovereign at all. It seems that the spirit of the June 2012 agreement has been abandoned. The only reason I am supporting the legislation is that it keeps the door open to the remote possibility of a deal on retroactive bank recapitalisation for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was obliged to leave the Chamber because I wanted to put it to him that he should have taken the opportunity to confirm that Ireland will lodge an application to the ESM in respect of a deal on bank debt and retroactive bank recapitalisation as soon as the window opens, which, as he confirmed, will be on 4 November. That is just over a month away but the Minister did not see fit to come before the House and use the opportunity presented by the very Bill which makes it possible to do so to confirm that Ireland will be seeking to invoke the instrument pertaining to retroactive recapitalisation. The Minister should have done that. He made a commitment in this regard - under pressure - at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. However, I am of the view that he did not do so with any great conviction. In light of his comments and those of the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection in respect of there being various ways to skin a cat, it appears that all of the mood music from the Government is indicating that the commitment to securing a deal on bank debt is being diluted. It is with regret that I must state that this is the tone I am picking up from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> Under no circumstances should the welcome deal on the early repayment of IMF loans be seen in some way as a substitute for a deal on bank debt. We were promised a deal on bank debt in the aftermath on the agreement reached in June 2012, which, in turn, promised to separate such debt from the sovereign. A number of important questions in respect of this matter - and Ireland's strategy in terms of its investments in the banking sector - must be answered. The Minister indicated that he is examining the possibility of selling a stake in AIB to outside investors. Again, this is a further indication that there is no real commitment to securing a deal on retroactive recapitalisation. If there were such a commitment, the Minister would have awaited the outcome of an Irish application for a deal on bank debt before floating the idea that we might be prepared to sell a stake in AIB. I am of the view that it is far too early to contemplate selling a stake in the bank. AIB is in recovery but I accept that it still has some distance to travel. The long-term value of retaining ownership of the bank for the next number of years would be far greater than any short-term gain to be had by selling a stake in it. We know what happened in the case of Bank of Ireland. The sale of a stake in that institution to private investors was heralded as a great sign of confidence in the Irish economy and the banking sector. We were assured that the investors in question would retain their investment in Bank of Ireland because they were committed to the banking system here and to our economy. At the first opportunity, however, the investment was sold on at a very handsome profit for those concerned. We should not make the same mistake in the context of AIB.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> The Minister should commit the Government to applying for a deal on retroactive bank recapitalisation next month. We have not heard anything about such a commitment so far. We need to hear it and to put it up to our European partners with regard to whether they are going to honour the agreement signed two and a quarter years ago. I am of the view that a deal must be obtained in order that the position in respect of Ireland's overall debt sustainability might be improved. Despite the improvements in the overall economic picture and the very clear signs of recovery, the fact is that Ireland remains highly indebted and has a debt-to-GDP ratio in the region of 120%. That is why advancing the issue of retroactive recapitalisation is absolutely fundamental in the context of the country's future debt position. Article 14 of the guidelines makes it clear that direct recapitalisation is a matter for the ESM's board of governors to decide. This means that any decision in this regard will be entirely political in nature because the board of governors, as such, comprises the eurozone Finance Ministers. This is an issue on which the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his colleagues must follow up on a daily basis with those Finance Ministers in advance of submitting, as promised a number of months ago, an application for a deal on retroactive bank recapitalisation on Ireland's behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> In the context of the guidelines relating to direct recapitalisation and as already stated, it is depressing that countries will, in the first instance, be obliged to use their own money to the point of risking their own financial stability before the ESM will be opened to them in order that they might recapitalise their banks. The reality is that even if everything that is envisaged came into effect today and even if the forthcoming stress tests show that Irish banks need more money, the fact that we are able to borrow on the international markets at cheap rates of interest means that Ireland would not be able to access the fund. What good will it be if Ireland cannot obtain a deal in respect of retroactive recapitalisation?</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> The fund for direct recapitalisation is set at €60 billion, an amount which is far too small. As we are aware, the Irish State alone put €64 billion into its banking system. There is not any genuine commitment on the part of Europe to deliver on what was announced in June 2012. Earlier this year, Klaus Regling, head of the ESM, stated that "In exceptional cases, and by unanimous votes, there may be retroactive recapitalisation, but it doesn't seem very likely". I took issue with Mr. Regling and wrote to him seeking an explanation. When he replied in March, he refused to repeat or substantiate his claim to the effect that it is very unlikely that retroactive recapitalisation will happen and merely set out the formal context as to how the scheme relating to such recapitalisation could be invoked. In view of recent comments by the German Finance Minister and Chancellor, the Finance Ministers of other AAA-rated countries in the eurozone and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, there seems to be absolutely no commitment on the part of and very little support among Ireland's European partners in the context of having this matter addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> The Government has made matters all the more difficult in the context of the case we need to put to secure a deal on bank debt by talking up our economic recovery throughout Europe and highlighting how great we are doing. One could not blame any of our European partners for thinking that Ireland is out of the woods and does not need a deal on bank debt. Nothing could be further from the truth. This country is still exposed to very significant risks, many of which are external and beyond our control. We are extremely indebted at national level and our corporates and households are also very indebted. With a debt-to-GDP ratio still in the region of 120%, I am of the opinion that pursuing a deal on bank debt is critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> When the idea of the ESM taking shareholdings in Irish banks was first floated a couple of years ago, I inquired as to how this would work in practice. Two years on, we are still no closer to obtaining an answer to the question I posed. I was informed at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that any ESM investment in the banks would be by way of equity capital. Earlier, the Minister referred to "a loan". Will it be a loan from the ESM to financial institutions or will it be equity which may not necessarily have to be repaid? It would be of great assistance if the position in respect of this issue could be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> In the context of the various bail-in measures and the liability cascade - again, the joint committee discussed these last week - it seems that the very last thing to be accessed in the context of rescuing banks will be the ESM. Even those with deposits in excess of €100,000 above the deposit guarantee threshold will be obliged to stump up their cash and take a hit before the ESM is invoked to support banks in financial difficulties. The way the ESM is taking shape in terms of the support it can potentially provide for banks in financial difficulty is deeply disappointing. The only reason we are supporting this legislation is because it keeps the door open in the context of Ireland securing a deal on bank debt. When replying, the Minister must confirm to the House that the Government will be applying for such a deal as soon as the door is opened in the first week of November. In my view, such a deal is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> I will leave it at that. We will support the Bill and we look forward to engaging on Committee Stage. I thank the officials for the information and guidance they gave on the Bill at the pre-legislative hearing last week. The whole thing is very rushed but I acknowledge that is outside of the control of the officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> I am looking at the Bill through the prism of the Irish context. I see no likelihood that Ireland is going to be able to avail of this fund in respect of future capital shortfalls in our banks. The reality is that with the bail-in procedures in place, arrangements for depositors of more than €100,000 and the relative financial stability that this State now enjoys, the likelihood of being able to access the ESM fund for direct recapitalisation or to plug new capital shortfalls is remote. It is highly unlikely. The only potential benefit in the short term to Ireland relates to the issue of retroactive recapitalisation. That has been kicked to touch for long enough. Article 14 of the guidelines attached to the direct recapitalisation instrument is vague and rather non-committal, suggesting, essentially, that it remains a matter for the eurozone finance ministers. They have been resiling and backsliding on the original commitment ever since June 2012. At the time it was heralded in this country by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others as seismic, as representing a game changer and as being greatly positive for Ireland. At this stage people are entitled to ask whether it will ever happen. The least the Government can do is confirm that November will see a formal application from this country in order that we will know once and for all whether the bank debt will be dealt with through the retroactive provisions set out in the guidelines.</p>

          <p eId="para_672">Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil sé dochreidte nach bhfuil an tAire sásta a rá sa Dáil inniu go bhfuil iarratas ón Stát seo ag dul chun tosaigh leis an airgead a chuir an Rialtas deireanach agus an Rialtas seo isteach sna bainc briste - ní raibh siad ag feidhmiú agus níl cuid acu ag feidhmiú go fóill - a fháil ar ais ar son mhuintir na hÉireann. Mar atá ráite cheana féin, dúirt an tAire liom nuair a chuir mé ceist air ag an gcoiste airgeadais níos luaithe i mbliana go raibh sé chun a leithéid d'iarratas a chur isteach. Níl dabht ann nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag dul síos an treo sin. Ar an drochuair, tá siad ag dul síos treo eile - sé sin, na scaranna atá ag an Stát in AIB agus i mBanc na hÉireann a dhíol chuig na margaí. Dá bhrí sin, ní gheobhaidh siad ar ais ach an méid ar fiú na scaranna sin inniu, agus beidh an Stát thíos leis an méid eile den airgead a cuireadh isteach sna bainc. D'fhógair an Rialtas sa bhliain 2012 go raibh athrú mór polasaí i gcroílár na hEorpa. Nuair a tháinig siad ar ais go dtí an tír seo ó na cainteanna a bhí ag dul ar aghaidh sna uaireanta malla san oíche agus na uaireanta beaga sa mhaidin, chuir mé fáilte roimh an athrú a d'fhógair siad. Dúirt mé ag an am go raibh gá ann déileáil leis an ábhar seo go scioptha. Dúirt mé go raibh an liathróid i lámh an Rialtas, go raibh an cúl foscailte agus go raibh ar an Rialtas an liathróid a chur isteach sa chúl. Ar an drochuair, tá cúlú ar an athrú polasaí mór Eorpach le feiceáil idir sin agus an lá inniu. Tá na téarmaí atá in úsáid ag an Rialtas anois i bhfad níos laige ná na téarmaí a bhí in úsáid i mí Meitheamh 2012. I say this because I believe many people have lost faith in the Government's handling of retroactive recapitalisation. The Government has been successful in changing the mindset of a large number of people in this State, convincing them that retroactive recapitalisation should only apply to AIB and Bank of Ireland and that we have to take the Anglo Irish Bank problem and its debt on the chin. It should never have been that way. The Government came to the House with a proposal on Anglo Irish Bank bonds and tried to sell it as a major victory in terms of absolving us from the Anglo Irish Bank debt. In reality, while it brought benefits in the here and now in respect of interest payments, the full capital is still to be paid by the State, not only by this generation but by future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> When the Government returned from the talks in Europe on that fateful night in June 2012, its members were tripping over each other to go onto the national airwaves and proclaim a major victory on behalf of the people. I was asked for my opinion and the position of my party at that point. I welcomed the news. I said that those in government now had the ball in their hands, that the goal was open and that they needed to move swiftly to place the ball in the net. The reason I said that was because events change. At the time we were very much in the grip of the troika. At the time our debt was unsustainable, as it is now. At the time we had a vast deficit. That was the time to strike. Moreover, it was the time to strike because Spain had got into difficulty and that was probably the reason the policy change was promised in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> However, in the intervening months those in government have decided to take the attitude that we should leave it to them, that it will be okay on the day and that we need not worry about it. That type of <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude is a symptom of this Government when it comes to key major issues. Let us consider what happened yesterday after the publication of the letter from the European Commission concerning Apple, a company that is very much valued in this State for the jobs it provides, especially in the Cork region - it is one of the largest employers in the State. When it was pointed out time and again by me and my party that certain issues needed to be dealt with in respect of Apple's tax liability, those in government refused to listen. They said it would be okay on the day. This complacent attitude is evident in the remarks of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to the effect that the investigation was part of a wider EU investigation, but this interpretation has been revealed to be misplaced. The Government's head was in the sand and its attitude to this entire affair has damaged Ireland's reputation at home and abroad. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, tried to downplay the gravity of the probe by the Commission into Apple as recently as July this year after he received the letter. However, the detail of the letter should wake him up to the seriousness of the situation. The lengthy letter seems to build a strong case against Ireland. The Commission is clearly unimpressed by the answers it has received thus far.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> Embarrassingly - I say this as a Member of this Parliament but also as an Irish citizen - it has been revealed that either the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners sent the wrong turnover records in March before sending the correct records in May. It is well time that the Government got serious about these allegations and was honest with the public about the implications. The damage done already to our reputation is sizeable, and it has been made worse as a result of the complacency of this Government. We should not have allowed the European Commission to investigate this. We should have investigated it ourselves and we should have set matters correct, if there were matters to be corrected in the first place. This is an issue I will return to later on. I hope the lessons are learned in respect of the way we deal with multinational profits and that the calculations and negotiations will be a thing of the past. I hope the deals that went on for 16 years will be reviewed more regularly and that they will be evidence-based.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> What we have before us today is what looks like a bland technical Bill, but I fear it represents one of the biggest political failures this Government has yet brought down upon us. The raft of new legislation brought in at EU level, supposedly to bring about a more secure banking system that would prevent a repeat of the banking collapses throughout Europe, has not delivered results. Sinn Féin has always called for the European Central Bank to step up and be the lender of last resort for the euro, to be a real backstop for the currency. This would entail increased bond buying from Governments and, potentially, direct recapitalisation of banks. The balance sheets of banks needed to be examined more thoroughly and in more detail. More transparency needed to be applied. Regulation needed to be harmonised throughout Europe and bad debts needed to be written down in banks. Bondholders should have been burned. Given the transnational nature of banks, a common resolution regime must be agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">There has been progress on some of this but a lack of progress in other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Later this month, the stress tests on banks will be carried out and the results published. If Irish banks pass these tests, it will be on the backs of struggling homeowners and citizens reliant on public services and the State. As a member of the banking inquiry, I will diligently examine the events that led to such a situation. In June 2012 the then Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and the Taoiseach welcomed a decision by EU leaders to commit to separating banking and sovereign debt. The Taoiseach called it "a seismic shift" while Deputy Gilmore called it a "game changer". The Minister for Finance went on RTE radio the following morning to say he expected this to be concluded some time that autumn. It is now 27 months later and it has all gone quiet. There is no more talk of seismic shifts or game changers or the ESM stepping in and lifting the banking debt off the shoulders off the Irish people, while our debt-to-GDP ratio remains dangerously high.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> I have welcomed other moves to reduce our debt repayments, but they are drops in the ocean when compared to the potential that was there. Let us remember that refinancing debt is not the same as reducing debt. Today we are asked to support this Bill, which does not say a word about retroactive recapitalisation and the €64 billion pumped into the banks, or €30 billion if it is agreed that the former Anglo Irish Bank is off the cards. The Bill ratifies a change to the ESM treaty to provide for a direct recapitalisation instrument. The instrument contains seven little lines that say nothing new about retroactive recapitalisation. Nothing new has emerged since June 2012. The flesh has not been put on the bones of the retroactive instrument. We have before us a detailed text, even if I could not get answers about the legal status of the instrument. However, since June 2012 no further detail has been added on the issue of the retroactive use of the ESM. I question what has been happening over the past 27 months while these modalities, as they were described by the Minister, have yet to be agreed by the board of governors of the ESM. It is almost as if they do not intend the mechanism ever to be used retroactively.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> We are being asked to back this Bill without the Minister being able to answer the most basic questions about how retroactive recapitalisation would work even if the State applied for it. He failed to do so again in his contribution. When he applies to get back the money that the Irish people put into the bust banks through the previous and current Governments, will his application have to follow the same rules laid down in the instrument for direct recapitalisations in the future? Does he have any notion or hint at all about how it will work? Would he mind sharing that with the Parliament? Will the State have to subtract the moneys that would have been required at the time to bring the pillar banks up to the legal common equity tier ratio of 4.5%, as established under Basel III? When I asked this in parliamentary questions, the Minister would not answer because he said it was hypothetical. Would our application have to go through the waterfall system, as with all other future applications for direct recapitalisation? That is not hypothetical; it is a basic question that the Minister has not answered. Perhaps he simply does not know, because he has not answered that question for his colleagues over the past 27 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> We are being asked to simply leave it up to the board of governors of the ESM to make up the rules as they go along on this issue of huge importance to Ireland. The board comprises euro area finance Ministers such as Wolfgang Schäuble and Jeroen Dijsselbloem who say retroactive recapitalisation is not on the cards. By simply rubber-stamping this Bill, we are passing the ball to Mr. Schäuble and his ilk, who have their own priorities in this regard. They have shown zero indication that they are willing to look favourably on a request for retroactive recapitalisation and they have not even bothered drawing up rules for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> We were told in a broader sense that sovereign and banking debt would be separated. This was the big announcement, but the ESM failed to properly make clear the definition of what is private debt and what is public debt. There is still an onus on the State to act before the ESM steps in, and this is laid down in the guidelines. This could mean having to recapitalise the banks to a certain level or covering a chunk of the costs for years. The direct recapitalisation instrument is complex and many have questioned how it will work in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> There are also concerns that the fund is simply not large enough. Are we to believe that half the fund will be spent on Ireland? There are no straight answers available on how the relatively small fund will suffice in the event of a crisis or even how it can be topped up. The proposed banking union provides little protection to the taxpayer from a recurrence and does nothing to stimulate growth or provide opportunities for job creation. It does not go far enough to separate banking debt from sovereign debt; that lie needs to be nailed. If one of our banks gets into trouble in the future, irrespective of the difficulty we face trying to get the money back that we put in in the past, the State would have to step in before the ESM. That does not equate to separating banking debt from sovereign debt. Similarly, all the assurances given at the peak of the crisis that strict measures would be put in place to ensure a crisis of this magnitude would not be allowed to recur have failed to materialise. Any reforms have been minimal, with insufficient relief from the burden being shouldered by taxpayers. There is still the so-called vicious circle. </p>
          <p eId="para_684"> Article 8 of this instrument, which we are effectively voting on, lays out the rules to be followed in the case of a recapitalisation. From 1 January, the system will include a bail-in by creditors. In other words, the law of the land will be that bondholders are to be burned, but that will come as little relief to families filling out forms for water charges or suffering as a result of austerity, or who have seen their loved ones and their nearest and dearest forced to emigrate in the intervening months and years. The Taoiseach once said in the House: "I will not have 'defaulter' written on my head." However, the Government has introduced a Bill which, at its core, ensures that junior and senior bondholders will be burned in the future, because that is what is right. That is now accepted by the Government and every government across Europe. It is a pity the Taoiseach did not accept that principle when he took office in 2011. One of the first actions the Government took was to pay the promissory note worth €3.1 billion to Anglo Irish Bank, thereby bailing out bondholders, senior and junior, guaranteed and unguaranteed. One of the other actions the Taoiseach took was to inject €22 billion of our money into AIB and Bank of Ireland. It is a pity this legislation was not on the cards at that time or that he did not have the foresight to understand and to realise that when a bank goes bust, the creditors are dealt with and the bondholders are burned.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> We in Sinn Féin have led the charge on this for many years. We have been proved correct in that this was the right course of action but, unfortunately for many in this State, it is too little, too late. The case for retroactive recapitalisation is strong, but it will only be strong if we have a Government that is willing to stand up for ordinary people. I am concerned at recent revelations in the national media that the Government plans to sell shares in AIB, because it is simply the wrong thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The Minister's first course of action must be to state, as he did under pressure from me and other members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, that he will apply for retroactive recapitalisation. We want not only the €11 billion value of the shares of Allied Irish Banks, but also the €20 billion the State injected into that bank. If these moneys are not forthcoming, we should not sell off the bank. Why would one hold on to a bank when it is in debt and costing the country a fortune and then sell it off to vulture funds as soon as it makes profit in order that they can reap the benefits? The profits of Allied Irish Banks were achieved by increasing fees and charges, refusing to deal with families in mortgage distress and hiking up variable interest rates time and again. Profitability was, therefore, achieved on the backs of the Irish people whom the Government is about to betray again.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> Sinn Féin will introduce amendments to press the issue of retroactive recapitalisation, as we have done in the European Parliament. Unfortunately, some Irish Members of the European Parliament could not find it in themselves to wear the green jersey and support our amendment. While it is our hope that the Bill will help us recoup the people's money, unfortunately, our experience has been that the Government and European Union are not up to the job and will not help us recoup one cent. I hope I am wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> I ask the Minister to state clearly, on behalf of the Government, that the issue of retroactive recapitalisation is not dead in the water. He must spell out what he has been doing on this issue for the past 27 months. Will he seek to recoup the moneys injected into Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland to help reduce the national debt, stimulate the economy and enable young people to return to these shores and businesses that have been kept afloat in these times of austerity to flourish? These are the questions the Minister must answer. </p>
          <p eId="para_689"> It is unfair of the Government to ask Members to take a leap of faith and pass this Bill on the basis that it will be okay on the day or that he and his colleagues on the board of the European Stability Mechanism will draw up a set of rules that will allow him to apply for and possibly secure retroactive recapitalisation at some point in future. If the Government had an ounce of decency, it would have used this legislation as a lever to bring about further clarity on Ireland's application for retroactive recapitalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> Given that this instrument needs to be agreed by all the EU member states affected by it, the Minister should have asked his colleagues to explain how they could expect him to ask the Irish Parliament to enshrine in law a mechanism under which bondholders and creditors will be burned if European banks get into trouble again in future, while asking Irish people to take a leap of faith regarding the money they injected into broken banks and the hit they took on behalf of financial institutions across Europe. We have not been given any detail on whether or when an application for retroactive recapitalisation will be lodged and how any such application would be treated by his ministerial counterparts in the European Union. The Minister should immediately contact other European Finance Ministers seeking further clarity on this matter. He should request something more secure than the leap of faith required by the seven short lines which state that retroactive recapitalisation may be possible on a case by case basis. The issue is of such magnitude that it demands further clarity. Its delivery has the potential to change the fortunes of many people in this State. </p>
          <p eId="para_691"> My party will be the first to support the Government if it is sincere about pursuing an agenda of securing retroactive recapitalisation. I have not yet seen any evidence that this is the case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_692">Members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform first saw the heads of this Bill, which is quite technical, last week. I am still trawling through the detail because there is much to digest. It is important, in this Second Stage debate, to make clear to members of the public, using language they understand, what is at stake. When we speak of the European Stability Mechanism we are referring to the response of the European Union to a catastrophic crash in the European banking and financial sector which has beggared citizens here and elsewhere in Europe and for which we are still paying a terrible price.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> It is appropriate that we are discussing Europe's response to the economic crash on the day that water charges are being introduced. The reason citizens must, for the first time in the history of the State, pay to access a basic human right is that the banks and financial institutions, through greed, gambling and speculation, wrecked the European economy. Six years after the banks crashed the economy, citizens are still paying the bill and will continue to do so through water charges and other charges which they never had to pay previously. I should add that people always paid for water through taxes but must now also pay charges. The previous Fianna Fáil led Government and the current Government agreed to these charges as one of the conditions of the so-called bailout. Hard-pressed, struggling families, many of whom cannot pay their bills as matters stand, are picking up the tab for the gambling and speculation of bankers, financiers and bondholders and the abysmal failure of European Union and Irish political and regulatory authorities to prevent them from doing so in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> If it means anything, the Bill is supposed to ensure some degree of retroactive justice for the great injustice that has been done to citizens of this country and establish a mechanism that will ensure it never happens again. The Government suggested, in its famous landmark announcement of June 2012, that some retroactive justice would be done. There would be, it stated, a game changer and we would secure retroactive recapitalisation. Translated into layperson's terms, it meant that Europe would give us back some, or perhaps all, of the money citizens were forced to pump into the banks to prop them up and Europe and the political authorities in this State would establish a mechanism that would prevent it happening all over again.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> Viewed in those terms, one must ask whether the Bill will achieve either of these ends and it is absolutely clear that it will not do so. On the issue of so-called retroactive recapitalisation, we get virtually nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The matter will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The ECB board of governors will decide, but there are no guarantees that we will get some or all of the €64 billion that we - the ordinary working people and citizens of this country - put into the banks and paid for with cruel austerity for six years, as well as unemployment and emigration. Nothing in the Bill suggests there is any firm commitment to get that money back. Is there anything in it that suggests there is a reasonable chance that we will get the money back? If not a firm commitment, is there some evidence of, or room for, optimism based on the Bill? One has to say the opposite is true. Of the €500 billion firepower of this mechanism, only €60 billion - just over 10% of the fund - is to be set aside for recapitalisation of any description, whether it be retroactive or in the future. As we put in €64 billion, a lesser amount has been earmarked in the fund for recapitalisation of banks for the whole of Europe than what this country put in to save its own banking system. </p>
          <p eId="para_697"> The Minister might say - it was said at the committee - that the board of governors could decide to change the figure if we needed more than €60 billion. The fact that it has set aside €60 billion, however, strongly indicates that there is no intention of giving us back €64 billion, or even a substantial portion of that sum. If there was a serious commitment on its part to do so, the figure would be considerably bigger than it is. There is no inclination or suggestion in the legislation that we will get anything like all, or a substantial amount, of the money we pumped into the banks. That much is clear. That is why since the landmark game-changer announcements and all the rhetoric and hyperbole, we have really had nothing. All the evidence from the European Union is that it will not happen. </p>
          <p eId="para_698"> There is further evidence in the eligibility criteria to access the fund which has consequences both for our call for retroactive recapitalisation and the fund's future application or the ability of states to access it. Most people expect us to ensure ordinary citizens will not be put on the hook again. In fact, however, the so-called waterfall of access or eligibility criteria for the fund suggests the opposite. There is a very high threshold to access it. The first call - I welcome this to some extent - is on the bondholders in financial institutions. Let us remember, however, that in some of the biggest institutions about which we are talking we are the bondholders. We were forced to bail out the people concerned and become the owners of the banks. The first call, therefore, will again be on us. The second call will also be on us because after one has exhausted the 8% requirement of the institution, which amounts to only a fraction, 8% of the liabilities have to be paid by the financial institution itself from bondholders or deposits. </p>
          <p eId="para_699"> The next call is on the State which has to prove that it needs to access ESM funds only if there is a systemic risk and it has exhausted all other avenues through its own resources to bail out and recapitalise the financial institution concerned. Therefore, there is quite a high threshold to access the fund. </p>
          <p eId="para_700"> Deputy Thomas Pringle mentioned figures which he will go through later. If one looks at our bailout, in this scenario we would still be paying the vast majority. It would be paid out by us before we could seek money from the ESM. </p>
          <p eId="para_701"> We are also on another hook as we have already put €1 billion into the fund, while the total call on the State is €11 billion and possibly more because that figure can be revised upwards. It is alarming when one considers there are serious questions about the firepower capacity of this €500 billion fund for the whole of the European Union when one considers that just one bank - Anglo Irish Bank, a relatively small bank by European standards - cost €30 billion alone to bail it out. There is a serious risk that we could be on the hook for massive amounts of money if there is a crash elsewhere in Europe. </p>
          <p eId="para_702"> There is an additional point concerning retroactive recapitalisation. If this is the threshold, they are saying that in order to access the fund, one must do it primarily within one's own state. The first call might be on bondholders who, to a large extent, are us. The second call is on the State. Will they, therefore, not apply the same criteria when we ask for retroactive recapitalisation? If we seek this, they will say: "No. We think you are doing okay now. If the banks have a hole in them, we think you have the resources to do it. You have got to call on your own resources first, so we do not believe there is a systemic risk. We do not believe there is a wider risk to the eurozone, so sorry lads, you are going to have to cover the cost again, not this wonderful mechanism."</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> Like so many insurance scams, that is just what it is - a scam. One pays a high premium of €1 billion and possibly €11 billion and God only knows to what it will go up. When one makes a claim, however, they will fight it every step of the way to ensure they will not have to pay anything back. Looking at the Bill, they will certainly not even entertain any serious back-payment for the money we have already forked out and which beggared the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> The legislation is not serious either in dealing with the problem we have or the likely problems we will have to deal with in the future. Therefore, we cannot vote for it. Quite a few of us on these benches voted against the ESM and I do not think we can support the Bill for the reasons I have outlined. It is often said on the Government side of the House that we are very good at criticising, but we do not offer an alternative. We have offered an alternative and I have a few minutes to spell it out. Both here and at ECB level we must examine banks' mandates and ask what they are for. Back in 2008, in its response to the initial financial crash, the ECB spelled out explicitly that whatever states had to do to prop up the banking system, they could not divert from profit maximisation. I am paraphrasing, but that message was set out in the ECB's guidelines and that mentality has been pursued ever since. Profit maximisation is what banks seek and, according to the ECB, they should not divert from it. That is the problem and it led us into the mess in which we find ourselves and it will lead us back into it again. We have absolutely no chance of achieving retroactive recapitalisation because it is all about profit maximisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">As others and I pointed out in this House, even the Federal Reserve in the United States, the heart of capitalism, has a wider mandate than that. Its mandate includes making sure people have a roof over their heads, and employment in the jurisdiction is a key priority. It also deals with issues such as inflation. Therefore, the narrow profit-oriented mandate given by the ECB, which filters right through the banking system, is the problem and needs to be changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> Banking authorities, including the ECB and pillar banks especially, should be under real public control and their priorities should be set according to the needs of the wider economy and society. Banks are supposed to be the lubricant of the economy as a whole and to account for the general interest of citizens and economic stability rather than engaging solely in the cutthroat business of making money at all costs. The latter always puts pressure on the wider macroeconomic considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> When one sees the property bubble inflating again, one just wants to weep. Once again, property, including housing and commercial office space, are becoming subject to speculation. What will prevent a recurrence? What mechanisms are being put in place? Where is the stability mechanism to stop this madness and prevent us from treating as commodities the things and infrastructure people require in order to live, regardless of the consequences for the wider economy? Bearing these consequences in mind is required if one wants stability. None of this is in the legislation. I cannot believe, after everything that has happened, that there has been no discussion on changing the mandate, focus or priorities of banks, at both European and national levels. As Deputy Pearse Doherty stated, we are in extraordinary circumstances in which we are nursing the banks. We have nursed them back or nearly back to profitability, yet we carry the can. As soon as they start to make money again, at which time they could actually give something back to the society that has been beggared bailing them out, we will hand them back to the vultures so that what occurred can happen all over again. I find it incomprehensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> Ultimately, this is an ideological argument. It should not be, however, because there is sufficient evidence. One could argue about the merits of competition and profit and how trickle-down effects will work for all of us, but when we see where that thinking got us, I am amazed that we cannot draw the obvious conclusion that there has to be far greater public control and oversight over banks and their priorities and objectives. Instead, we are going back to square one. As this legislation clearly sets out, we could be beggared again if that happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> The only slight, marginal change is that there is a bit of a levy on the banks, so we have some money set aside in case what occurred happens again. Of course, it may not be enough, and we will be on the hook if it is not. As I stated, we are the bondholders to a large extent. Therefore, what is proposed is not good enough and I do not believe we can stand over it. It will be a shame for any Government if, in the aftermath of the awful crash and the suffering endured by this country, it fails to learn lessons and does not at least ensure that if we cannot retroactively secure justice for the people who were wronged as a result of the crisis, it will put in place structures to ensure it will never happen again. Sadly, those reassurances and structures are not in place, and we will almost certainly be going down the same road again.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_710">I thank Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett for agreeing to share some of his time with me to discuss this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> The Bill deals with the amendment of the treaty we signed up to through legislation in 2012. It is important to bear in mind that we are actually amending an international treaty that we signed up to without the approval of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> The ESM is an independent legal entity. It has legal immunity from all courts across the European Union and the world. It is not subject to regulation under any EU laws or any EU state. The body is a law unto itself, and we are amending a treaty today to give it the so-called power of direct recapitalisation of financial institutions in the euro area. We are to amend an international treaty for a very powerful secret body. Although the Minister for Finance is a director of the ESM, the ESM is not subject to freedom of information guidelines, and its meetings are secret. Its directors are bound by the privacy rules governing the institution. Thus, citizens have no means of knowing the discussions taking place within the ESM except when it decides to tell them. That is very dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> We have already paid over €1 billion into the ESM as part of our capital call. The treaty we signed up to in 2012 gives the ESM the right at any time to call for a further €10 billion from us as a nation, which sum would be paid into its capital fund. If that is not enough, it can, by its own decision, alter its requirement for capital and increase the sum infinitely. It can use the funding to leverage unlimited borrowing on the international markets at its discretion without any input from any member state of the European Union or euro area. We are bound by the treaty to amend our laws and pay capital as the ESM asks for it, without question and without considering the impact it could have on us.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The ESM is a very dangerous institution. This has all been thrashed out before, but it is important in describing the context. We have been told the purpose of the legislation is to put into effect a decision that was made by the Eurogroup in June 2012. I refer to the famous seismic shift in which it was affirmed that it is imperative to break the vicious circle involving banks and sovereigns. We have seen nothing but rowing back on that since June 2012. As said by other speakers, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste lauded the shift as a game changer that would change everything for us as a nation and put us back on track. They have rowed back continuously, right up to June 2014 when the President of the Eurogroup stated that the direct recapitalisation instrument might be activated where a bank failed to attract sufficient capital from private sources, and if the ESM member concerned were unable to recapitalise it, including through the instrument of indirect recapitalisation of the ESM. He also stated the financial assistance would be provided in accordance with EU state aid rules and the ESM member would be asked to invest alongside the ESM. Even if one gets over all the hurdles involving direct recapitalisation of one's banks by the ESM, one must go along with it and fund it in parallel.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Other speakers have mentioned the so-called liability cascade and the decision-making processes that will have to be gone through before direct recapitalisation can take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> It is useful to look at this in the context of our guarantees in regard to the banks and the bailout that took place. At that time, the estimated liabilities of the banks amounted to approximately €440 billion. If we look at the liability here, the first step is that the first 8%, at a minimum, must be provided by equity bond holders, uninsured depositors, which in our case would have amounted to approximately €35 billion. The next step is that national resolution funds must cover up to a maximum of 5%, which in our case at the time would have amounted to €22 billion. This brings us to a total of €57 billion that would be required to be invested before we could even look at using the direct recapitalisation instrument through the ESM. We have already put €64 billion into the banks, so that would leave €7 billion that could be covered by direct recapitalisation. The President of the Eurogroup says that any recapitalisation must be done in conjunction with the ESM member putting in funds. If this were done on a 50:50 basis, it would leave approximately €3.5 billion that we could expect in direct recapitalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> One could make the argument in our case that the 8% provides for equity from bondholders and uninsured depositors and that we have stepped up to the mark in that regard. However, if this happened today and we had to get access to the mechanism, we would be looking at recapitalisation of approximately €3.5 billion out of the €64 billion we invested in the banks to save them. Therefore, this direct recapitalisation is not a panacea or resolution. I think of it as a charade that the ESM has added into the treaty to make it look as though it wants to break the link between sovereigns and banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> Much of the time, we on this side of the House operate under the false idea that what the Government, Europe and the ESM want to do is to look after European citizens, but that is not the case. What the Government, Europe and the ESM want to do is to look after the banks. We on this side of the House are coming from the wrong starting point, and that is why we cannot understand what the Minister is doing here. We need to look at the Bill in the context of what the Minister is trying to achieve, which is to financialise the whole of society and Europe and make all the citizens of Europe responsible for the banks. That is what the ESM hopes to achieve. It is not about looking after and protecting citizens from financial crashes and catastrophe. It is about making citizens responsible. The ESM is the instrument being used to copperfasten that responsibility and ensure we give unlimited power to a secret body operating out of Luxembourg which has the right to access unlimited borrowing and place unlimited demands on member states to underwrite that borrowing. This is what the ESM is putting in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> We are going to rush this legislation through this House and sign up slavishly to it, quite happily, without any guarantees from Europe in regard to our banks and our recapitalisation. We might, if the Minister decides, make an application to the ESM. I expect that if he does make an application, we will be lucky to get €3 billion or €4 billion in direct recapitalisation. The suggestion has been made that this will be done through an equity swap in AIB, but in my estimation this is the level of funding we can expect to get. This estimate is as good as any that anybody else has come up with, because we have heard nothing from the Government side of the House as to what it hopes to achieve from the mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> Deputy Boyd Barrett was right in saying that the €60 billion earmarked under the ESM for direct recapitalisation is not a serious figure. It is a figure that has been chosen to sell this con to everybody in Europe - that the ESM is prepared to do this and break the link for citizens - because €60 billion would only be a drop in the ocean if any financial institution in Europe was in serious need of direct recapitalisation. The ESM could, in five minutes, decide at a board meeting to increase that €60 billion. It could be increased by an unlimited amount. However, the signal it is sending out is that this is not something it is serious about or that it seriously considers using. It is something that is being proposed as a sop to people across Europe who are concerned about the mechanism. That is the real problem with this legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Áine Collins<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_721">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The European Stability Mechanism (Amendment) Bill is necessary because of the Government's continuing efforts to deal with retrospective repayment of capital pumped into banks by Irish taxpayers. It is, from the European perspective, an effort to put in place mechanisms that will allow Europe to provide loans to financial institutions. This is intended to help avoid the huge banking crisis that Europe as a whole continues to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> The ESM was established to provide loans to member states. The direct recapitalisation instrument will be able to provide loans to financial institutions. The financial instrument deals with two issues, direct and retrospective recapitalisation. While this is welcome, it should be remembered that the requirements are quite restrictive. They require member states to contribute to any direct recapitalisation in the future. It is important to note that article 14 provides for retroactive recapitalisation. This could be decided on a case-by-case basis, by mutual agreement of the ESM board of governors. This instrument gives Ireland the option to apply to the ESM for the retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks. Nobody suggests that just because this instrument is being implemented, this will be an easy task. Such recapitalisation would require unanimous approval from the board of governors of the ESM.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> The decision on whether or when it is appropriate to make such an application must be carefully considered by the Minister for Finance. Any retrospective recapitalisation will only be considered when the potential returns to the State from the banks now and in the future have been established. Responsible and sustainable management of the public finances is a huge commitment, and this commitment is agreed in the statement of Government priorities between Fine Gael and the Labour Party. In this context, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste recently highlighted Ireland's high level of debt as a risk to the economic recovery that is now taking place. Their analysis stated that the State investment in Bank of Ireland shows that careful management and disposal of our banks' holdings can result in a reasonable return for taxpayers and the disposal of the remaining banking assets will reduce the State's excessive debt levels. The outcome of this disposal will have a bearing on when and if the Government applies to the ESM, through this instrument, for retrospective recapitalisation of our banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Recent indications from the Minister demonstrate that he is considering how best to deal with the State's shareholding in AIB and Permanent TSB, with taxpayers' shares in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks valued at €13 billion at the end of 2013. With careful management and timing, disposal of the shares could lessen the need for retrospective repayment over time. In this context, we should remember that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Government have an excellent track record to date. The renegotiation of the promissory note continues to save Irish taxpayers billions each year. The Minister's IMF negotiations will save Irish taxpayers €1.5 billion over a five-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> Apart from the direct effects of implementing this instrument in Ireland, it is designed to preserve the financial stability of the euro area as a whole by providing for specific cases when a eurozone state experiences acute difficulties with its financial sector. We have seen from the recent crisis that a mechanism is necessary to maintain fiscal sustainability in order to avoid the severe risk of contagion from the financial to the sovereign sector. To a certain extent, this is a minimalist effort to resolve a problem that should have been dealt with at the start of the euro process. The operation of the same currency in different countries with different economic activity and debt levels was inevitably going to cause problems. I hope this is the first step towards a more integrated and sustainable eurozone. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DominicHannigan" eId="spk_311">
          <from>Deputy Dominic Hannigan<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_726">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which allows the European Stability Mechanism to set up a direct bank recapitalisation instrument which will enable recapitalisation of troubled banks in member countries directly without those moneys being added to the country's national debt, which is what happened here.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">While this is a technical Bill, it could have serious implications for Ireland and the national debt in the long term. This is relevant to the discussions happening on the budget we are preparing for 2015. The growth figures we are hearing, including the most recent this week, suggest we could implement a neutral budget. However, there are still those, including the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, that suggest the Government should make the planned €2 billion adjustment. We also heard the views of our European colleagues during the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> All of this is, of course, because of concerns about the national economy and the national debt. The debt stands at just over 120% of GDP, the fourth highest in Europe. Debt levels across Europe have been rising in the years since the crisis began and in the eurozone the debt-to-GDP ratio is now at an average figure of just under 97%. Therefore, we are not alone with our problems. Of course, there are legitimate fears that if European-wide recovery does not take hold, this level of debt will harm the recovery not just of Ireland but of other European countries also. Therefore, this new instrument may give us an opportunity to do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> In Ireland there is the possibility that the fund could be used to give us retrospective recapitalisation. The FAQ document which the ESM released in June this year included the following question: "Could direct recapitalisation be applied retroactively, so that the ESM would directly recapitalise troubled banks in countries that have received financial assistance from the EFSF and ESM?" The answer given was: "The potential retroactive application of the instrument will be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement of ESM Members". Therefore, there is an opportunity for us. Will the Minister of State tell the House if Irish bank debt will be looked at under this instrument and if an approach will be made or has been made to the board of the ESM? I share the concerns expressed by other Members of the House, including the last speaker, that perhaps we will end up with not getting anything in terms of recapitalisation from the ESM.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> Our shares in Bank of Ireland and AIB are getting into the mid to late teens in billions of euro. In the coming months and a short number of years the country may well be in a position to sell off these shares, in the process realising a dividend of perhaps €15 billion or €20 billion which could be used to help to reduce the national debt and also to pump-prime capital expenditure. I say this because we may be forced to deal with the issue ourselves. I am becoming more and more convinced that at a European level it is going to be difficult to achieve unanimous agreement. I attended a conference in Rome at the beginning of this week as part of the monitoring of the fiscal compact treaty. The House may remember that Article 13 of that treaty states we will meet as a Union every six months to discuss the implications and implementation of the fiscal compact treaty. Having listened to some of our colleagues across Europe, in particular our German colleagues, I very much doubt that we will see much movement in terms of achieving a European consensus to deal with many of the issues we face.</p>

          <p eId="para_734">The potential instruments being brought forward include eurobonds, a European redemption fund and the new PADRE system, all of which were shot down one by one by our German colleagues at the conference. It seems there is a reluctance on the part of some of our colleagues in larger states across Europe to look at the idea of mutualisation of debts. They are very content to have consensus on the mechanisms we use, but we are being told that each country will have to stand on its own when it comes to dealing with the issue of national debt. I wonder whether the answer is to go down the road of selling our shares in Bank of Ireland and AIB, rather than trying to seek a consensus on recapitalisation that we just might not be able to achieve.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_735">I am delighted to contribute to the debate on the Bill, which I welcome. I have listened to some, although not all, of the debate. I want to put this issue in context, as we often discuss Bills without discussing the background and context. The context, from an Irish perspective, is that the taxpayer put €64 billion of hard-earned money into the banks. In June 2012 we sought to break the vicious cycle between the banks and sovereign debt. Accord was reached and it was agreed that, once the single supervisory mechanism was in place, the issue of bank recapitalisation, both current and retrospective or retroactive as it is now being called, could be considered. The relevant date, I understand, is 4 November.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> The role of the Government is to ensure the taxpayer gets the best financial return from the €64 billion put into the banks. How can we achieve this and what routes are available to us? One of the routes is to sell the shares on the open market. If the position of the banks is improving - this will provide us with a mechanism to do this - that is obviously one feature. Another is retroactive or retrospective bank recapitalisation through the ESM. It all hinges on Article 3 of the ESM treaty which states: "The purpose of the ESM shall be to mobilise funding and provide stability support under strict conditionality, appropriate to the financial assistance instrument chosen, to the benefit of ESM Members which are experiencing, or are threatened by, severe financing problems, if indispensable to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its Member States".</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> Furthermore, the context is also relevant in terms of breaking the link between sovereign and bank debt. The ESM guidelines state there should be support where "an ESM Member experiences acute difficulties with its financial sector that cannot be remedied without significantly endangering its fiscal sustainability due to a severe risk of contagion from the financial sector to the sovereign". In Ireland's case, we fit the criteria in that the banks were recapitalised over a number of years owing, first, to the risk to the Irish banking sector; second, to the risk of contagion to the Irish sovereign; and, third, to the risk of contagion in a European context. This has brought about a situation where Irish taxpayers have had to endure many years of austerity. I include all those who buy goods and pay VAT, despite perhaps being unemployed, not just those who are working. This needs to be recognised and it was recognised in the accord of June 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> The case I make calls for a range of measures. One aspect could be the selling of bank shares on the open market, with the taxpayer getting the money back in that fashion. It also could involve retroactive or retrospective recapitalisation or it could involve a suite of measures. We have played our part for the European Union and the euro. I note that the draft guidelines agreed to by the member states on 10 June 2014 include a specific provision relating to the retroactive application of the instrument.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">Interestingly, guidelines have been laid out for dealing with recapitalisation of banks in a current context. Guidelines have not been laid down for dealing with retrospective or retroactive recapitalisation. That is something that needs to be fleshed out. The draft guidelines state potential retroactive application of recapitalisation for financial institutions should be decided by the ESM board of governors on a case-by-case basis by mutual agreement. </p>
          <p eId="para_740"> The economy is doing well again after many years owing to policies put in place by the Government and the hard work of the people, but our debt levels are still way too high. Our debt-to-GDP ratio is approximately 120%, which is too high. The normal level at which any country should be operating is about 90%, which would be a safe level. Even though we are experiencing reasonable growth rates, I would like them to be sustainable and of the order of 3%. We are seeing significant growth in job creation and a reduction in unemployment. We see this in the live register figures which have decreased by nearly 10% in the past 12 months. We are also seeing a narrowing of the deficit and will certainly meet our 3% target by the end of 2015. The upcoming budget must clearly factor in the difficulties facing people, particularly those with young families and the elderly. What we need is a carefully planned budget. A budget is not just about the amount of money involved in terms of savings to be made and tax raised. It is also about the types of measure one brings forward. This has been lost in the budget discussions in the media and the House. It is not just about the volume and amount of money involved; it is also about how one allocates it. </p>
          <p eId="para_741"> The fact still remains that the Irish sovereign, on the basis of taking on the burden of debt from the banks, is carrying too much of the load. This is due in no small measure to the level of debt it had to take on from the banks. I go back to my key point. The legislation provides for retroactive recapitalisation. In this context, the €60 million being provided for bank recapitalisation needs to be reviewed by the ESM with a view to increasing it. We should remember that we put €64 billion into the banks; therefore, in a European context €60 billion seems very small. The date of 4 November, in terms of the single supervisory mechanism, is fast approaching. We have a legitimate case as part of a suite of measures to get money back, given that €64 billion of taxpayers' money went into the banks, some of which we have got back. Under Article 3, the €64 billion was put in at a time when Ireland was experiencing severe financial problems. At the time recapitalising the banks was indispensable to safeguard the eurozone and its member states. Come 4 November, we will have a very strong argument in a European context for putting forward retroactive recapitalisation as one of the measures to be considered, with the banks improving their financial position and being able to go to the market to get back the taxpayers' money.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">For the record, it is. As referred to, it is a non-party grouping and I am speaking in its time slot. </p>
          <p eId="para_745"> I thank the Minister of State for his attendance. I have listened to the majority of the contributions. The first point to mention is that the Title of the Bill - European Stability Mechanism (Amendment) Bill 2014 - has been framed in such a way as to almost mislead citizens across the European Union, including Ireland. The reason is that it is cobbled together complex legislation to create an illusion that stability will be promoted by it. It is so complex that the first sentence of the explanatory memorandum states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_746">The first purpose is to make provision for the introduction by the ESM Board of Governors, through Article 19 of the ESM Treaty, of the ESM's Direct Recapitalisation Instrument as one of the financial instruments envisaged under Articles 14 to 18 of the Treaty. And also through allowing for the creation of subsidiary bodies which will implement the Direct Recapitalisation Instrument.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">The latter is not even a sentence. </p>
          <p eId="para_748"> Deputy Kieran O'Donnell said he wanted to provide the background to why we were discussing this legislation and put some framework on the figures, which figures would be expandable or retractable in secrecy, as Deputy Thomas Pringle pointed out. The legislation is so unsafe that it should not even be considered seriously. </p>
          <p eId="para_749"> The matter is very simple. Seán and Mary Citizen understand, starting in 2001 through to 2008, that the domestic banking system in Ireland amounted to a Ponzi credit pyramid. This is shown in a review of the balance sheets of all licensed deposit-taking institutions, excluding the IFSC. At the outset the domestic banking system was about three times the size of national income and over five times the size of national income when the bubble burst and the Ponzi schemes crashed. We have had three reports and I would say that, at most, possibly 2,000 people have read them. However, Seán and Mary Citizen did not read them because they are written in technical language and miss the point. The first point I have made is that the domestic banking system grew at such a level through reckless funding. One cannot have reckless lending without funds which were provided recklessly using all sorts of financial prudential scales on the balance sheets of the banks which were completely ignored. </p>
          <p eId="para_750"> When it was certain that there were going to be losses in the banking system - let us forget about Ulster Bank, Danske Bank, ACC and any other foreign bank such as KBC - the Irish-owned banks and building societies had losses not of the order of €64 billion that is repeated but of about €100 billion. Some of these losses are still latent in the banks which are paralysed in carrying on effective business for the households and businesses of Ireland. They are engaging in a pattern of pretence which involves a refusal to use the option of capitalisation they were granted to restructure the loans of their clients - small businesses and households.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">That is very wrong. When the music stopped and the pyramid collapsed in 2008, to prevent an instant outflow of deposits from the banking system, a guarantee was entered into by the State and the previous Government. That guarantee, unfortunately, was based on fraudulent or false information on the balance sheets of the banks and entered into under duress, indirectly, from the euro system. There was overt and express duress when Brian Lenihan dealt with Jean-Claude Trichet. </p>
          <p eId="para_752"> What happens when a contract of insurance is entered into by persons who do not tell the truth about the risk involved in the contract? It is void. The previous and current Governments have been gutless, in the interests of the people, in not using that fact as the main justifiable reason for ensuring the secondary market holders of bonds in Irish banks covered their losses. Of the €64 billion mentioned by several people, at least €31 billion of it is gone forever. We cannot get that money back. It is not Anglo Irish Bank debt, rather it is losses. The euro system, at the point when the promissory note was created, forced the previous Government to create an asset which would be a noose around the necks of the people in the form of a sum of €31 billion or €32 billion which would be paid by them to meet the losses in that bank which had no resources to pay the secondary market speculator bondholders at the time. The euro system knew something had to be done to prevent the contagion of a financial conflagration which was on the point of happening around the world. Lehman Brothers, AIG and Bear Stearns had gone and Bank of America had to take over Merrill Lynch. Some French and German institutions were holding bonds, not just in Anglo Irish Bank but also in the other two so-called pillar banks. </p>
          <p eId="para_753"> I want to give some figures to show how out of control was the funding of Irish banks. In September 2008 Bank of Ireland had €61 billion in senior secured bonds on its balance sheet. That is reckless, crazy funding. It also had subordinated bonds. AIB had approximately €42 billion in senior secured bonds. By the time the troika came to rescue Ireland, €140 billion in funding from the euro system had materialised to pay for the exit of an awful lot of senior and subordinated bonds. </p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I only hope Seán and Mary citizen who may be listening believe I am making the effort to tell the true story behind the jargon they have been fed for the past five years. Losses of €31 billion or €32 billion for one bank alone have been converted into national debt. The forced Dáil debate and passing of the IBRC liquidation Act entailed the substitution of a promissory note for a series of what are now called promissory bonds, the balance of which is about €25 billion. They are the bonds which, if there is to be a fair spreading of the losses across the euro system, should be extinguished. I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week what would be a naive, if not stupid, front page headline that €500 million of the nominal value of Anglo Irish Bank's debt was on the point of being sold in accordance with the wishes of the euro system, that is, the ECB, as part of the figure of €25 billion. If that happens, gone will be the chances of securing a just and final settlement to heal the scar on the people of the losses of a defunct bank. If €500 million worth of bonds are sold, they will be held by third parties and will have to be redeemed in 20, 30 or 40 years. In the meantime, the coupon will have to be paid. There will be a cashflow drain on the Exchequer. </p>
          <p eId="para_755"> There has been too much smoke and mirrors, gutless posturing and self-congratulation on the part of the Government for what has been a failure to represent the people. About 1.25 million people have had their lives ripped apart and some have been taken by suicide. There have been health problems and marriage and family break-ups. Some 350,000 people are long-term unemployed on the live register. The figure was higher, at 450,000. There are 170,000 households in severe mortgage distress and arrears - at three people per household, that is 520,000 people. There are 90,000 households, or 270,000 people, on housing waiting lists. There are many more besides; these are just the base figures and if one tots them up, one will find it comes to a lot of people. </p>
          <p eId="para_756"> There was a failure to robustly make the case to the European authorities. If Ireland stated the €25 billion in promissory bonds would be extinguished, rather than sold, it would have given Mr. Draghi something to do, rather than talking about and mutualising the debt. That is what should be done if our leaders had the courage to do so. Instead, we find the two so-called pillar banks are failing to restructure the loans of their clients which originated in a credit pyramid Ponzi scheme as a result of the reckless funding and expansion of the domestic banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> Who is afraid to negotiate? What a waste of the largest Government majority in the history of the State. Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Pearse Doherty and Thomas Pringle made concrete points that I will not repeat. The European Stability Mechanism is such a complex, qualification-riddled framework that it is almost meaningless. Besides this, it is far too little. Does the Minister of State know how much Citigroup has paid in penalties, fines and settlements since the end of 2008? It has paid almost $70 billion. Does he know what the leverage of Deutsche Bank is on the most recent balance sheets? The ratio is about 50:1 on a balance sheet of €2 trillion.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">When Lehman Brothers went bust, it was just a little over $40 billion. The stability mechanism is a secret mechanism which is expandable or retractable. It is a mechanism that does not have sufficient cascade-down regulation to banking operations in Europe. It is illusory.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> In terms of the number of people whose lives have been ripped apart, I forgot to mention the 250,000 emigrants. What has been the experience of those who have remained in the country as a result of the losses? It includes water charges as a broadening of the tax base. That does not broaden the tax base, it just gives a different label to an income tax. How does the Minister of State think individuals will pay for it? Will they take some of the capital from the houses in which they live to pay it? No, it will come from income. It is the same with the property tax. What about the cuts to the numbers of carers, nurses and doctors and in schools? The Minister of State should read the article by Martin Wolf of the <i>Financial Times</i> which was published today in <i>The Irish Times</i>. He states that inequality does not work in economics. That is patently clear because inequality undermines and corrodes education systems and destroys the spending capacity of households living in normalised conditions. He is demonstrating in that short article what Joseph Stiglitz expanded on in the book <i>The Price of Inequality</i> which I gave to the Taoiseach before Christmas last year and which I asked him seriously and solemnly to read. It would be helpful in order that the right philosophy and arithmetic could be used in the budget. These are important.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> We talk about what was happening in Europe in 2008 and the bank guarantee and the consequences and destruction that followed. It was like the forest fires in Australia the year before when 300 people died. The fires were out of control. The financial system was like that. When a forest fire is out of control, one must move ahead of the fire and burn its pathway in order that it exhausts itself. That is where Ireland was. That is what happened to us. The scar is the €30 billion worth of losses in Anglo Irish Bank that is being borne by citizens today and will be for the next 40 years. I did not vote on the IBRC liquidation Bill because of all it contained, because it failed to face up to the realities and because it was brought forward here with half an hour's warning. The voting took place at 1 a.m. On the third attempt, I was paired by the Taoiseach because I did not know if it was time to stand up and be counted for a fairer society in Ireland. However, I was paired as I was not going to put my finger on a green button for it. It was wrong. The amendment Bill is a tarnished consequence. It is tarnished by the source and the origin in so far as Ireland is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> As Deputy Thomas Pringle pointed out, this is a day to use the leverage. The idea of the 2012 seismic shift is rubbish. The initiative is in our hands, but it will take men and women of courage and guts to act for the people. We will get real respect then. If one wants to broaden the tax base - it is now beginning to happen - one should ask the MNCs the profits of which have surged since 2008 to put their shoulder to the wheel of national recovery with a 3% levy. The Minister for Finance said that was not in the programme for Government when I mentioned the idea three years ago. There are many things which are not in the programme for Government that should be. Add them in; do not be feeble; do not be wimps; be men for the people, 1.25 million of whom deserve to have the Government with the largest ever majority on their side and show leadership. The Bill is unsafe and I will not support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_762">That the Bill is relatively straightforward does not mean that I will support it. In fact, I will not. There is supposed to be significant firepower available to ensure banking crises such as the ones which happened in 2008 and 2010 do not recur. However, it appears that the architecture that has been constructed around the ESM will be onerous in the event of a crisis. I remember the referendum and the near bullying of the people who were told they had to have this or they could land in the same situation again. However, the architecture appears to make it much more difficult than was anticipated to access the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> The direct recapitalisation instrument has attracted intense interest in this country. We were promised in principle that Ireland would be treated as a special case. We were unique, which, of course, was true. We made up 1% of the eurozone in terms of our population but accounted for 42% of the banking costs. That happened because we had intergovernmentalism. The European systems did not work and the institutions failed the citizens who were the main casualties. We are now looking at the result of this by way of extra taxation and services being at breaking point for the want of very small amounts of money. Instead of seeing the European Union acting as a unit, we saw an intergovernmental approach, with the French and German axis driving the system and getting what they wanted.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> We were obviously given a commitment in relation to our legacy debt. It was vague and one must question whether it was worth the paper on which it was written. It is another example of the failure of institutions in Brussels to respond to a crisis in the interests of the people. It is no wonder that people reacted as they did in the European elections. There is increasing scepticism about European institutions as a consequence of what has happened directly to people and the failure of those institutions to protect citizens when they most needed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> There has been no indication since the commitment was given that retrospective recapitalisation will ever take place; the opposite is the case. Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Finland spoke out against it and the then Commission President, Mr. Barroso, cast doubt on it. Will the Minister of State confirm that it is Ireland's intention to seek direct retrospective recapitalisation once the single supervisory mechanism comes into full operation on 4 November? Does he expect the other countries to agree? What information is available on this? We are tired of playing what has become a very long game-----</p>

          <p eId="para_767">-----and there are still more revelations to come about what happened at the time. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the recent revelations from the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Patrick Honohan, which confirmed the long-held view of most of the population that Ireland had been coerced into maintaining a full, wide-ranging guarantee of all deposits and bonds in 2010. The threat was explicit: continue to implement the full guarantee or face bankruptcy. Apparently, it was made directly to the late Brian Lenihan. We also know that it was not only a threat. I refer to the letter from Jean-Claude Trichet allegedly instructing us to assume the debts of Anglo Irish Bank in 2008. On whose behalf was the European Central Bank acting in 2008? Was it in the interests of European citizens generally or on behalf of the French, German and United Kingdom banks? I do not need the Minister of State to answer that question because it is in plain view that they were acting in the interests of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> As a result of the deeply tragic, grossly undemocratic and virtually criminal sequence of events, the population of this country, who make up 1% of the population of the eurozone, has had to shoulder 42% of the cost of the entire banking crisis, almost €9,000 per head of the population, compared to just €192 per person in other European countries, which is less than the cost of an average water bill for a single person. We are spending €9 billion per annum in servicing the debt. I accept that it is not all banking debt but includes other debts accumulated by virtue of the fact that we had to borrow. It is, however, a very large amount of money which is equivalent to the entire education budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> I was having my breakfast one Sunday morning when I heard the Minister of State being interviewed on what I believe was the Marian Finucane radio show. I nearly choked on my rashers and sausages when I heard him say we had had €40 billion of debt written off. Will he, please, tell me where it was written off because if we had done this, we would not be in the trouble we are in?</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> I have asked by way of parliamentary questions to the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, about the former Anglo Irish Bank debt that was then the promissory note that is now sovereign debt-----</p>

It has not been written off, despite the Labour Party posters during the local elections stating €30 billion in debt had been written off. It is still there and we can use all the spin doctors we like in that regard. The problem is that this year €500 million will be taken out of the economy. I cannot remember the word the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Honohan, used, but essentially it will be taken out of the system. It is €500 million this year, €500 million next year and €500 million the year after that. The figure will then increase to €1 billion and, ultimately, to €2 billion. We know what €500 million buys. It is, for example, the take in property tax. We know what €500 million would do in the health budget for this year. It is a small fortune. The crazy aspect is that it does not have to be paid back to anyone but is being destroyed.</p>

          <p eId="para_777">It is smoke and mirrors. I do not understand how a group such as the Ballyhea group, together with some Deputies, could meet the Governor of the Central Bank and do something the Government has not done, namely, ask for the money to be written off. I understand the Governor of the Central Bank is part of the ECB framework, but it is extraordinary that the members of a small voluntary group from Ballyhea in County Cork are perhaps the first to go to the ECB and formally asked for the money to be written off. If we do not ask, we do not get. Many of us questioned the negotiating stance of the Government from the word go. We could see that there was very good reason to question it. A softly-softly approach was taken in the hope that if we behaved ourselves in some way, we would be rewarded, but we have not. Governments act in their own best interests. Two powerful governments were at the centre of this issue, namely, France and Germany, which acted in their own interests in the middle of the crisis. The upshot has been that it has destroyed this country's possibility of investing to get people back to work and maintain reasonable public services, many of which are at breaking point. It has most definitely dipped into people's pockets to the point where they are fearful for the future in terms of their ability to maintain even a basic living standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> I did not support the holding of a referendum and will not be supporting the Bill. The Government must tell us directly the answer to the question I have asked of the Minister of State: is it seeking direct recapitalisation?</p>

          <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_779">I thank the Acting Chairman for facilitating me and welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. I welcome the Bill which has been designed to facilitate direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM, but I am sure the Minister of State will agree that while it is welcome, it in no way goes to achieving the separation of banking and sovereign debt we are all working towards and which at this stage is long-awaited. As other speakers stated, €60 billion is a drop in the ocean in terms of the potential capital losses banks faced during the crisis. Therefore, there will be a requirement for a much greater capital injection in due course. Otherwise, the European banking system will continue to remain exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Leaving aside the actual size of the bailout fund, the absence of a clearly defined role where elected governments can bring greater democratic accountability to the European Central Bank is a major concern. It is something that has been of huge concern to me for many years. The lack of transparency in the European Central Bank is an issue I highlighted when I was a Minister of State and I will continue to highlight it. It is something that is deeply uncomfortable for some member states, but Ireland should have a very clear position on it, something the Government does not yet have. If it requires treaty change, it is something we should be courageous enough to pursue because transparency and openness within the ECB and for member states are critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">If a bank faces a liquidity crisis, which we know was the original issue in Anglo Irish Bank and the Bank of Cyprus, the European Central Bank has a facility to allow domestic central banks, essentially, to print money to ensure the bank has enough cash to meet its liabilities. This does not improve the capital position of the bank and is supposed to be a short-term measure. The old maxim that owing the bank €100 makes it your problem, while owing the bank €100 million makes its problem needs to be extended, with an additional line that if it owes the European Central Bank €1,000 million, it is your country's problem. With the right hand, the European Central Bank has the crucial and powerful capacity to prevent a liquidity crisis, but, with the left hand, by threatening to withdraw that wall of liquidity, it can cause a capital crisis for the bank and, by extension, the member state concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> The charade of the European Central Bank operating independently of governments must come to an end because that is what it is. If this requires an EU treaty to change it, so be it. The people have a right to know what backroom deals are being done and what outside pressures are being applied by the most powerful unelected entity on the Continent. A perfect example of this is a story in <i>The Irish Times</i> this week that the Central Bank had begun the process for an accelerated sale of the Irish Government bonds it holds as a result of the promissory note deal negotiated by the Minister. The newspaper presented this as remarkably good news story because of the immediate capital gains the Central Bank stood to make from selling bonds into a market where Irish bonds had become so highly valued. The article made little mention of the fact that the interest rate the Exchequer, or the taxpayer, was paying annually on these bonds, for as long as they were held on the Central Bank's balance sheet, was coming back in a circular motion to the coffers of the State. Once sold, the burden on the Exchequer increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> I find it too much of a coincidence that this story comes out only weeks after Mr. Mario Draghi expressed a view that early repayment of the IMF bonds could be conditional on an accelerated sale of the promissory note Government bonds. This IMF deal was heralded as saving the taxpayer €400 million a year. What we do not know yet is how much more taxpayers will have to pay in debt servicing because the ECB forced the Central Bank into an accelerated sale of its Government bonds. We do not even know if this was a condition of the IMF agreement because so much of the negotiations between the Government and the European Central Bank are conducted in utter secrecy and not underpinned by legislation and a clear treaty framework. Precisely the same scenario applies to the tool created by this legislation in terms of direct recapitalisation. All of these laws will not be worth the paper they are written on as long as the European Central Bank remains unaccountable in all scenarios to elected governments but, in practice, operates secretive negotiations and enormous leverage over all countries large and small.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> In a disclosure during an election debate on television former President Nicolas Sarkozy told the French people live on television that he and Chancellor Merkel had essentially put pressure on Mr. Mario Draghi to announce a programme of long-term lending to eurozone banks. For at least for one year, probably longer, this stabilised the eurozone and prevented Spain and Italy from being forced into a bailout programme. Political intervention can have positive effects, but we need to know about this and it should be transparent. As it stands, it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> Similarly, when Mr. Draghi made his famous statement that he would do whatever it took to preserve the euro, which has provided for long-term stability in the eurozone up to today, we now know that months of private negotiations had been taking place between the ECB, Berlin and Paris. It was completely secretive, with other member states excluded, particularly those most affected by it. That is completely undemocratic and unaccountable. Small countries have the least power over the ECB, virtually none, and if their banks go bust, as we learned to great expense in this country, the sovereign takes the hit. Unfortunately, this legislation will do nothing to alter that reality. If the banks of a larger country are facing the wall, the ECB will step in to help them without great conditionality. This is <i>realpolitik</i> and the power and influence of the ECB. Unless the treaties reflect this reality, small countries will continue to bear the brunt and suffer now and in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> I will support the Bill because it is in Europe's interests and those of this country that we create a coherent European structure to bail out financial institutions that have a realistic chance of survival. We desperately need that capacity. Equally, in a single currency system, risks should be shared and mutualised, irrespective of size or the relative economic power of the country concerned. In a monetary union it is crucial that there be such burden sharing. I am not quite sure where the Government stands in that respect, but the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, made some utterances in that regard 18 months ago. I have not heard a whole lot since. My fear is that, in the absence of binding structures to define the relationship between the European Central Bank and EU member states and binding structures in treaty format, during the type of crisis scenario Ireland has experienced the little country will be the loser. As a country held in good standing across the European Union, we have a moral obligation to the people, other small member states and vulnerable and peripheral member states to fight for transparency in the ECB. I would dearly love to see someone within the Government articulate and argue that case with conviction on behalf of the people.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_787">I thank all Deputies from all sides of the House for their constructive contributions to this discussion. We have had a broad range of views expressed and I acknowledge that we have received support for the Bill from Members on all sides of the House, although not all Members, given the opposition of Deputy Peter Mathews.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> The purpose of the legislation is to make provision for the inclusion by the ESM board of governors, in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty, of the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument as one of the financial instruments envisaged under Articles 14 to 18, inclusive, of the treaty. This includes provision for the creation of subsidiary bodies that will implement the direct recapitalisation instrument. It also incorporates the ESM treaty, as adapted, following the accession of Latvia to the ESM on 13 March 2014, into the European Stability Mechanism Act 2012. It is important to recognise that the Bill represents the outcome of significant negotiation reconciling the views of countries such as Ireland, convinced of the need for such a measure, and other countries that had to be convinced that there was such a requirement. While we can argue about the amount of any fund, it is important to realise that the very existence of direct recapitalisation was certainly not a foregone conclusion and had to be achieved by successful negotiation. Ireland was to the forefront in that regard. This is the way with all European policy and applies to this measure also. Once the instrument is in place, it can be adapted, as required. The addition of this instrument to the ESM treaty that took effect in 2012 shows this.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> The draft guideline agreed on 10 June 2014 includes a specific provision on the retroactive application of the instrument. Therefore, the agreement that we were active in negotiating keeps open the possibility of applying the European stability mechanism for retrospective recapitalisation. The draft guideline states the potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided by the ESM board of governors on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement. It also states the detailed modalities for retroactive recapitalisation should be established in the relevant decision of the ESM board of governors, that is, the euro area Finance Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> I wish to address a number of issues raised by Deputies during the debate on Second Stage. I refer to the timing of an application for the retrospective recapitalisation in accordance with Article 14. I will repeat what the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has said on a number of occasions, that there is an agreement that the instrument required to give effect to direct recapitalisation, including in its retroactive form, shall be put in place in November 2014, subject to its ratification by member states. The Minister for Finance has stated also on a number of occasions that it was not possible to make a formal application to the ESM for retrospective recapitalisation before the instrument is in place as expected in November. It would, therefore, be premature to make any submission in advance of that. I have heard some criticism from some people that the Government had not made an application. As the Minister for Finance has clearly outlined we cannot make an application until the mechanism is in place and this legislation is part of the process. If all member states have ratified the instrument by November 2014 the instrument will then come into effect. We can then consider how to go about the application and the application will, therefore, not be made before November and the issue of timing after the instrument is in place will be kept under review by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> With regard to the criteria to be applied, I reiterate that the text of Article 14 provides for a decision on a case-by-case basis. The Minister has outlined to the House in his opening address today that the instrument is part of a broader EU response, including the single supervisory mechanism, the single resolution mechanism and the single resolution fund. The size of the fund must be seen in that context as another tool in that array of tools. </p>
          <p eId="para_792"> I clarify that this Bill provides for approval of the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument; it does not provide for the broader banking union measures. While it is to be expected that people would raise broader banking measures it is important to point this out. To the extent that they are referenced they apply only in so far as an application is made for the ESM's direct recapitalisation instrument.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> I also wish to clarify a number of issues in respect of the ESM. The ESM is governed by the board of governors who are euro area Finance Ministers. All the decisions of substance are made by the board of governors on the basis of mutual agreement, in accordance with Article 5(6) of the treaty. These decisions include decisions on the lending capacity, capital calls and the amount of capital stock. It is not the case that the ESM can, of its own volition, unilaterally call unlimited amounts from member states. The ESM Act 2012 sets a ceiling on Ireland's capital contribution and any change to the amount in that Act would need to be approved by amending legislation. This is an important point because Deputies raised legitimate and genuine concerns in that regard. In addition, its borrowing and lending capacities are fixed by decision of the board of governors and must similarly be changed by their decision. The ESM cannot do so unilaterally.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> The ESM's direct recapitalisation instrument represents a core element of a much broader EU approach to the issue of breaking the bank and sovereign link, as was committed to by the euro area leaders in June 2012. This includes the establishment of the single supervisory mechanism, the bank recovery and resolution directive, the single resolution mechanism and the single resolution fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> I would hate to be responsible for Deputy Catherine Murphy choking on her rashers and sausages or cornflakes or whatever else she chooses to eat on a Sunday morning but when I appeared on the "This Week" programme I made reference to the fact that our refinancing needs over the next ten years have been reduced and I outlined how they have been reduced by the extending maturities on the ESF and the EFSM loans, the interest rate reduction and the solution of the pro-note arrangement. Deputy Murphy has articulated strong views but the point I made on that programme and which I reiterate is that the promissory note deal brought us to a situation where a Minister for Finance did not have to find €3 billion upfront, each year and as we approach a budget in just two weeks-----</p>

          <p eId="para_799"> I also refer to a point raised by Deputy Creighton on the issue of the IMF early repayment and her viewpoint on the sale of bonds. These are very separate issues and this was acknowledged by ECB President Draghi when he clarified that the ECB's agreement is not required to secure the waivers on this early repayment that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in his latest round of successful diplomatic negotiation managed to achieve from his European colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> On the overall issue of retrospective recapitalisation, it is important to note that thanks to the hard work of Government and the hard work and sacrifice of the Irish people this country finds itself in a very different position to the one in which we found ourselves in 2012, when people have referenced the deal that was struck and the accord announced at that time. We now have a situation whereby our economy is recovering and growing, the bank shares of AIB and the bank value of AIB is increasing and our unemployment levels are falling. It is in that context that the Government, as a collective, will have to make a decision as to how best they take the next step to reduce the debt burden on the Irish people. That next step must be the most tangible, practical benefit to the Irish people, whether that is a matter of retrospective recapitalisation, or as Deputy Hannigan and others said, to a sale of bank shares or a stake in a bank. It is a matter for the Government to decide but it is certainly better to be in that position where we have options and tools and more of them than was the case two years' ago. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_903">Smoking places a vast burden of illness and mortality on our society with over 5,200 people dying every year from tobacco-related diseases. One in two of all smokers will die from their addiction. Standardised packaging of tobacco products will remove all forms of branding, trademarks, logos and colours. The new packets will be presented with a uniform typeface for all brands and the packs will all come in one plain neutral colour. Ireland's standardised packages will have graphic images next to warnings developed by the European Commission for member states. Government policy in respect of smoking is to promote and move forward towards a tobacco-free society. Standardised packaging is one of several measures which will be implemented to reduce smoking in our society. Education, awareness, cessation services and extending the smoking ban to other areas are among the other measures that are being progressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> As smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland, the control and regulation of tobacco products and tobacco use is a key public health objective. Standardised packaging will put tobacco products in drab unattractive packages devoid of branding other than names or promotional information. The proposals in the Bill form a suite of measures from the past, present and future designed to tackle tobacco consumption and the harm caused by smoking in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> Legislation for the introduction of standardised plain packaging for tobacco products is one of several recommendations set out in the Government tobacco control policy document, Towards a Tobacco Free Ireland, to assist in reducing the harm caused by tobacco use and ultimately achieving a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025 or a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%. Following the introduction of plain packaging measures in Australia, the tobacco industry initiated several legal challenges at domestic and international level. It was claimed that it was unconstitutional for the Australian Government to remove trademarks from packages without compensation. In August 2012, however, the Australian High Court dismissed the case and awarded costs in favour of the Australian Government. Further challenges are pending, however, before the World Trade Organization and under the Australian-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment Treaty. None of these actions has been concluded. Following the introduction of standardised packaging in Australia, many smokers complained that the cigarettes tasted differently and the tobacco industry was forced to issue a statement denying that it had changed the ingredients.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> I will outline some facts and figures on smoking. Smoking kills one in two users. Nicotine reaches the brain in seven seconds. The tobacco industry needs to recruit 50 new smokers every day simply to maintain current smoking rates. The year 2025 has been set as the target date for a tobacco-free Ireland. Tobacco smoke contains approximately 4,000 different chemicals, more than 70 of which can cause cancer. Each year, at least 5,200 people die in Ireland from tobacco-related diseases. Ireland's smoking prevalence rate is 21.5%. Some 78% of smokers started smoking before they reached the age of 18 years, while 53% started before they reached the age of 15 years. It costs approximately €1 billion per year to provide health services for smokers.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> Smoking is the single most preventable cause of illness and death in Ireland. Smokers lose an average of between ten and 15 years from their life expectancy. The tobacco sector in Ireland accounts for approximately 5,500 jobs, generating approximately €1.4 billion in tax revenue per year. Measures introduced in recent years include the workplace smoking ban in 2004, the ban on the sale of cigarettes in ten packs and the sale of candy cigarettes in 2007, the ban on point-of-sale advertising in 2009 and the introduction of graphic warnings on tobacco packaging in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children set out a list of recommendations in respect of the Bill, including the banning of smoking in cars while children are present. This will come in under the Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Bill which has already passed through the Seanad and is due to be introduced in the Dáil in the near future. This is only one of many recommendations we have.</p>

          <p eId="para_912">The Acting Chairman can indicate when I have to adjourn the debate. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. I am pleased to see the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, back in the hot seat looking after health matters. I saw a twinkle in the eye of the Minister's official I when he assumed the seat. The Minister led this campaign in respect of plain packaging on tobacco products and a host of other measures while he was Minister for Health. The statistics in respect of smoking related illnesses and deaths have been cited in the course of this debate on several occasions. In fact, they have been cited in many other debates that have come through the House over the years. This has occurred to such an extent that it is easy to lose sight of the meaning of the statistics. It is important to remember that the statistics reflect fatalities on a scale that one would normally associate with a conflict, epidemic or natural disaster. However, smoking illnesses are not natural; they are entirely avoidable and I believe that the continual efforts to reduce the use of tobacco in this country will be seen in the fullness of time as one of the most important social issues of our generation. I am proud that this Dáil, under the guidance of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has made significant progress in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">Upon the enactment of this legislation, Ireland will be poised to become only the second country in the world to introduce standardised tobacco packaging as a measure to reduce smoking. We are leading the way in an international context in the fight against an extremely harmful drug, which has long been deep rooted in our society.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_914">I wish to share time with Deputy McDonald.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> Direct provision is a blight on this State. The notion that the needs of people at their most vulnerable could be met by accommodating them in cramped, unsafe and crowded conditions is a disgrace. Asylum seekers are forced to live on €19.10 per week while awaiting a decision by the State on whether they are allowed to stay in Ireland. Direct provision is meant to provide for the welfare needs of asylum seekers and their families but it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> The Government participates in all EU directives on asylum except for Directive 2003/9/EC, also known as the receptive directive. If it abided by the directive, the State would have to permit asylum seekers to participate in the labour market. The refusal to do this has left many families in limbo, relying solely on the State's allowance of €19.10 per adult per week. It also provides a measly €9.60 a week for each child living in these horrendous conditions. What child can be cared for, fed or sent to school on €9.60 a week? The cost of raising a child in Ireland is by no means cheap and a child's well-being, both physical and mental, is not cheap. Securing a decent future for a child is also not cheap. Why then has the Government found it fit to expect parents of children in direct provision to provide for their needs, care for them and carve out opportunities for their future on €9.60 a week? This is unacceptable, wrong and shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> Most asylum seekers spend three years in direct provision. A large number have been waiting for seven years or more. Children have been born in these centres and they have lived their entire lives in the system. Their rights have been infringed upon by a State that has no positive history when it comes to the protection of children under its care. The Minister for Education and Skills recently said that children living in direct provision accommodation are being denied a "normal family life" and direct provision accommodation is "not a good system". She also noted her concern regarding access to education for children living in direct provision. Children seeking asylum are entitled to attend primary and secondary school but because they do not qualify for free fees, they cannot access third level education. This means that teenagers who complete their leaving certificate are unable to progress to college, which is shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> Why then, if the deplorable insufficiency of this system is recognised by a Minister, does the Government not act immediately to end it? The State has a duty of care to everyone living here. According to the Refugee Council of Ireland, RCI, approximately 2,000 children live in direct provision centres. That's 2,000 children whose basic needs are not being met, who are being failed by the State and whose families were forced to flee war, famine, risk of death or severe punishment and who came here seeking a better, safer life. Recently, 300 residents at the Kinsale Road reception and accommodation centre on the outskirts of Cork city organised ten days of protest seeking an end to this inhumane system. Their voices join a chorus of many and it is time the Government listened. One woman had been in the centre for nine years and was awaiting a decision on her status. She has two young children. This is horrific but this is only one case that acts to highlight the many others.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> Direct provision centres deny people the right to prepare food for themselves and their children. Access to food is a basic human right. Food is not just a form of sustenance, as every culture has a different way of eating and of preparing different varieties of food. It is a form of cultural identity and expression. Why are people in direct provision denied the right to prepare their own food, to eat fresh, healthy food and to pass recipes onto their children? Instead they must resort to buying cheap, ready to eat foods such as bread or biscuits, which is shocking. If the Government is going to force people to live in these conditions, the least they could be given is an opportunity to cook. Surely it costs more to contract a company to cook this food. This is just a further degradation of the thousands of people being failed daily by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> Cases of young people displaying signs of inappropriate sexualised behaviour, of parents being hospitalised with mental health problems, of women forced into prostitution and of single parent families having to share rooms with total strangers have all been reported to social services. As someone elected to represent my constituents in this Chamber, I am appalled and I am clearly not the only one. Ministers and backbenchers must see these cases and recoil in horror. They have the responsibility to change it. This is State sponsored social exclusion and poverty and the Government must act now. Direct provision should end and vulnerable children should be protected. The Government parties should not allow for this to be the scandal for which future Governments will be forced to apologise. Already, this may prove to be too late.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_921">We in Sinn Féin believe the direct provision system is not acceptable for anybody and should be brought to an end without delay. This system is beneficial to nobody, least of all children. It institutionalises people, damages mental health, denies families privacy and forces a lack of work on them. People living under direct provision are forced by the State to live in inhumane conditions. They have often escaped their country of origin due to persecution, intimidation and violence. They are forced to raise children in cramped conditions, with virtually no disposable income, no resources to provide their children with basics such as school books and no power even over what they feed their children. At the end of last year 1,666 children were living in this system and many have spent their entire childhoods under this regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> It is little wonder that the chief executive officer of the IRC, Ms Sue Conlan, reported in April this year that she knows of three asylum seeking children aged between 11 and 17 who have expressed suicidal thoughts. It is also little wonder that we witnessed such unrest over the summer in centres in Foynes, Athlone and Cork. In 2011, the IRC received correspondence from a family's general practitioner stating that three children were sharing one bed in one room with their parents in a separate bed. The family requested a transfer to a different hostel or for an adjoining room based on overcrowding. The council was assured that the family was provided with an additional cot and that the room met the relevant codes and requirements but the family remains in one room.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> In 2012, a concerned father reported that his children were living in close proximity to men who were not known to them and to people with "severe" mental health conditions. The children along with their family remain in this centre. In 2012, a child presented hungry to the IRC on two occasions because she said she could not eat the reheated fried food provided for lunch. She could not sleep at night due to the noise at the centre and slept in until 1 p.m., missing breakfast as a result. The child was afraid to report this due to her fear of being transferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">A woman living in the Eglinton hostel in Salthill in Galway spoke in April about her experience of the asylum system. She recounted an incident which occurred on the day a fellow resident received documentation granting permission to remain in Ireland. The woman's four year old child asked whether she and her family were also leaving the Eglinton hostel. When it was explained to the child that they had to wait for their papers the child brought some paper to her mother, gave it to her and said: "Mummy take it and let's leave." "That day I cried", she said. "I cried, I looked at the four corners of the room and I cried."</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> What makes this issue all the more distressing is that it is absolutely unnecessary. The Minister could, should she choose, abolish the direct provision system tomorrow. Direct provision does not have any legislative basis and came about as a result of a rush job by Fianna Fáil back in 1999. The system bears all the hallmarks of that era, including a complete lack of accountability and poor institutional oversight.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> We do not have to wait for the immigration, residence and protection legislation to be passed to put a stop to direct provision. The only beneficiaries of the system are the companies which receive large sums for providing the services used by those seeking asylum. If a rational view were to prevail, this money would be better spent. An issue arises with regard to the awarding of contracts for the provision of services and their procurement. Why do the contracts always appear to be awarded to the same companies and how often are they awarded?</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> In this House and throughout the country, people have rightly expressed horror and shame at the treatment of children in industrial schools and women and children in Magdalen laundries and mother and baby homes. As we speak on this subject, abuse is taking place before our eyes in centres throughout the country. We have no excuse or alibi for treating people in this way. What is needed is a reformed, robust, efficient and human rights compliant asylum process in which direct provision has no part to play.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichelleMulherin" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_928">There is no reason to become a refugee if it requires a person to exchange one set of fears for another set of fears. With this in mind, we must ask if we can honestly argue that asylum seekers in Ireland are free from fear of persecution. According to the UN refugee convention, fear of persecution looks not only to the past and present but also to the future. In short, it looks at what the future promises. Every person looks to the future not only for himself or herself but especially for his or her children. It is in fear for their future and that of their children that many have left their country of origin.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> A refugee system in which asylum seekers are held for years in what can only be described as camps creates worry and breeds fear that worse is to come. This has been affirmed in many requests I have received for intervention both in my capacity as a politician and solicitor. Many of the individuals and families in the asylum system are known to me personally.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> It is obvious that conditions in the asylum system are creating a new type of fear for refugees and their children, some of whom were born in Ireland and will no doubt grow up as Irish citizens. It is not in the interests of this country that these children should grow up with a sense that they were discriminated against because of circumstances in which they had no say. If we act now, we may avoid the experience of other countries which have been dealing with displaced persons for longer than Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> I welcome the action that is being taken in this area, including the round-table consultation that has taken place and the decision to establish a future working group. Action must be swift. We must act immediately to ensure the system deals expeditiously with people who present seeking asylum. Some of the residents of asylum centres have great talents, have much to offer this country and want to work and achieve fulfilment, as we all wish to do. The process that determines whether applicants qualify for asylum takes much too long, which is the reason many asylum seekers reside in direct provision centres. The issue must be addressed urgently to create confidence in the asylum process among citizens and asylum seekers.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> In light of the many graphic accounts we have heard of the distressing circumstances and poor standards that prevail in some direct provision centres, we should ensure families, particularly children, are looked after properly. As has been stated, we know from our history what happens when the State ignores what is being done in institutions. The speed with which changes are implemented in the asylum system will provide evidence of whether we have learned lessons from the past.</p>

        <speech by="#AnneFerris" eId="spk_342">
          <from>Deputy Anne Ferris<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_933">There is a story we have all heard before. It is about a little blonde boy with no name, although in some stories he is referred to as Peter and in others he is called Hans. The little boy lived in The Netherlands where, as we know, the land is permanently under sea level and is spared flooding only by an elaborate series of dams or dykes. The little boy, we are told, was walking home from school one day when he saw water trickling through a hole in the dyke wall. He immediately realised that if the hole was not plugged, the water would eventually breach the dam, causing death and catastrophe across The Netherlands. The story goes that the boy put his chubby little finger in the hole and saved the day. The Minister of State will no doubt forgive me for pointing out the obvious here. In terms of the issue before the House today, the Minister of State is the little boy with his finger in the dam, as his predecessors have been for decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> When it comes to European immigration the European Union is well below sea level. The opportunities and protections offered to those lucky enough to be deemed citizens of Europe are desired and envied throughout the world. At any given time, millions of people outside the Europe Union are desperately trying to get in. As a member of this club of 28 countries, Ireland shares border control obligations with other member states. We are used to thinking of the word "border" in the context of Northern Ireland. In European terms, however, our entire coastline and airports are our border. Being a member of the European club in effect means that our country is surrounded by a large legislative dyke, designed for controlling floods of immigration into Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> The difference between Ireland and the little Dutch boy is that in the fable the people in charge eventually come along to save the boy and fix the structural deficiencies in the dam. The European Union, on the other hand, has failed to address adequately the serious structural inadequacies in its immigration policy. The most tragic aspect of this is that hundreds of thousands of people who desperately need the safety and sanctuary of the European Union to escape political and social persecution in other countries have been abandoned on the high seas, sometimes literally.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> Under the terms of the unfortunately named European Union regulation, Dublin III, an application for asylum must be processed by the member state where the applicant first entered Europe. For example, if an asylum seeker arrived here via Northern Ireland, Britain or a French port, he or she must be sent back to the country in which he or she first set foot in Europe, whether the United Kingdom, France or another member state. This system causes much upset and frustration to vulnerable people in need of assistance. It is also a source of potential legal challenge and delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> All decisions made by the Irish authorities on applications for asylum are made by the public service and, therefore, open to full judicial review by the courts. Many legal challenges can take years to make their way through our clogged up courts system. Perhaps our new court of appeal will help resolve this problem. For most asylum seekers, however, both adults and children, the wait has been too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> One significant problem is that a common Europe-wide approach is not being applied to the assessment of asylum seeker applications for residency. Each country is expected to manage its own hole in the dam wall. The Opposition motion would merely have us cover the hole with sticking plaster. New European legislation is needed to allow national authorities and courts to fast-track applications using a common EU-wide methodology. Courtesy of Europe, we have a new fast-track system for processing applications for huge wind farms but no such system is in place for asylum seekers. It is time something was done to help all those in direct provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_939">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion and thank the Members of the Technical Group for raising a subject that could easily be pushed into the background and lost in the heat of other matters that come before this House and are of a more pressing nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_940"> In 1999, I was a new councillor and, like Deputy Byrne, we were on the newly formed Eastern Regional Health Authority when the direct provision system was introduced. It was brought in at that time because of an influx of asylum seekers into Ireland as the UK changed its rules on how asylum seekers were supported and treated. </p>
          <p eId="para_941"> Deputy Anne Ferris mentioned the matter on a European scale. The common travel area means that people can move freely between Ireland and Britain. We do not have a harmonised system across the EU so people can decide where they feel they might have the best opportunity as asylum seekers. The system therefore needs to be harmonised. </p>
          <p eId="para_942"> No matter what level or standard of accommodation is provided for asylum seekers, they are in limbo and will not stay there forever. At least, they should not expect to do so. The issue is how swiftly they can be processed through the initial asylum assessment, in addition to legal challenges which do occur more often than not. All those factors have to be addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_943"> I welcome the fact that on being appointed, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, visited some of the centres to see for himself the standards involved. The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has done likewise. Those in receipt of direct provision deserve better. I agree with Deputy McDonald on the issues of procurement and tendering. If current provisions for these people are not up to standard then providers, who are being paid for this service, should not be reconsidered. We have had no quality evaluation of how these centres are run. Some are good while others are bad. Some of the smaller ones seem to be better run than the others. </p>
          <p eId="para_944"> We are still faced with the issue of the length of time that people stay in these centres. We must address that matter. I hope the initial steps taken by the Minister and Minister of State will continue, so that a solution can be found. I agree with Deputy Anne Ferris that simply adopting this motion would only provide another sticking plaster, while not addressing the issue in its entirety.</p>

          <p eId="para_945">I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his appointment. Some of the things he has been saying on this issue since beginning his new job are very important. The direct provision system is a disgrace and it shames us as a nation and a people. It was one of the first matters that came across my desk when I was elected to Dublin City Council and I still deal with it weekly. It is appalling and is a form of institutional racism. We would not treat white Americans this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> One person used to come in to me who had already been ordered to be deported. Every two weeks he went to the office where they said they were not deporting him that week, so he should come back in two weeks. That has gone on for years. He knows that if he goes home his wife will be at risk, but he is saying: "Deport me. Just do something."</p>
          <p eId="para_947"> Another person was lucky to find a benefactor to sponsor his M.A. course. When the home he was in found out that he was getting this education, they stopped giving him lunch. I had to go to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to get his lunch service restored. It is disgraceful. I know the Minister of State feels the same and we need to do something about it. We cannot let ourselves get to the next general election without having addressed this matter properly. The only proper and fair way of doing it is with an amnesty. That will not be palatable to some but we should pick a period - four years or whatever it might be - and say that we have made a mistake. We need to treat these people better and tell them they are more than welcome in this country. It is amazing to see the difference for people who have come through the system and have had the chance to become Irish citizens. They are making a great contribution. </p>
          <p eId="para_948"> As a Government we will leave different legacies behind us in the four or five years we have, including economic ones. This question has to be tackled and resolved, however, and I think an amnesty is the only way to do it. I ask the Minister of State to consider it.</p>

          <p eId="para_949">I thank the Opposition Members for bringing this Private Members' motion before us, as well as the Minister of State for his interest in rectifying the situation that has existed for far too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> I want to tell the House about a little fellow I became friends with in July this year. He is seven years of age and his name is Seán Daniel. He lived in Portlaoise for six years and was moved to a reception centre in my constituency in March this year. He has severe autism, special dietary needs and still wears nappies because he has not managed toilet training yet. His mother is abused in the most horrific way. If she does not toe the line and do what certain people want her to do in the reception centre, his food is withheld from her. She has special food given on a weekly basis so that she can cook for him because his dietary needs are so severe. His food is withheld from her, however, if she does not dance to the tune of the people in the kitchen of the reception centre. </p>
          <p eId="para_951"> During the summer, she got involved in an altercation with somebody in the kitchen because of the food. A guard allegedly assaulted her. Until she was intimidated to give blood in Drogheda so that he could prove there was nothing physically wrong with him as a result of her biting him during this alleged assault, they withheld Seán Daniel's nappies. He could not go back to school in September because he had no nappies, until he got a call from the school to say that the school would give him nappies. However, the school gives him only two nappies a day although he is seven. The woman is stitching the nappies together during the daytime so that she can dry them out and put them on him tonight or tomorrow. </p>
          <p eId="para_952"> There are plenty of issues surrounding these reception centres, including the fact that people are in them for far too long. In addition there are loopholes and we do not give them any money, liberty or the ability to work. All of that is horrendous but I will leave it aside for a second. The intimidation and abuse that is happening to this woman, who is on her own with her seven-year-old severely autistic child, is an absolute disgrace. When I reported the matter to the Child and Family Agency, the lady I spoke to rang the provision centre and spoke to the manager. The manager told her: "Oh God, no, that's not true. She gets her food every week and has been getting nappies for months." The woman from the agency rang me back and said I was not to worry about it because I was being told a lie. I have been up in this lady's house - I use that word very loosely - every week since July. It is not a lie. It raises more questions because the lady in the Child and Family Agency was quite willing to take the manager's response as gospel without investigating it herself. I have reported that to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. This is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> HIQA issued draft national guidelines this week for standards in our special care units, which are units which children attend as a last resort. I appreciate what the Minister of State is doing. In the interim, however, before the Minister of State's report group comes back - please God it will come back quicker than some of our other special working groups have done - the draft guidelines should be applied to reception and integration centres. A champion should be appointed for people who are going through years of processes that we are making them go through. Somebody should be given the responsibility to be their champion to whom they can go. Right now they have nobody, so they are coming to constituency offices like mine or Deputy Eoghan Murphy's.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> The standards are appalling and there is a complete lack of care for human beings in this country. We talk about legacy issues in Ireland and say it was a different time and culture then. We say that in the past things were accepted because we did not talk about them. Today, however, we are doing exactly the same on our watch. The working group should take a wider view of the whole process. Immediate changes would make a real impact on the lives of people who are currently in limbo.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ciara Conway<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_955">The Minister of State cannot but be moved when he hears stories like those recounted by Deputy Eoghan Murphy and Deputy Regina Doherty. Parents will know that one of the nicest things is to be able to cook for one's children. These mothers, fathers and children have been stripped away from their home place and what they know because they were in fear of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">Are we saying we do not believe these people? I know I would not choose to live in one room and to have food given to me that I could not give my children. Children are finicky eaters. There is not a mother in Ireland who does not try to coax her child with one food or another. A mother in a direct provision centre does not have that luxury. If the child does not eat, he or she goes hungry. The Minister of State knows this. The malnutrition of children in the centres has been written about and reported on by the Irish Refugee Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_957"> Have we learned nothing as a country? We have another institution that is creaking along. I am very glad that Deputy Pringle has tabled this motion. The Labour Party has spoken about this matter before. Now that we are in government, I am glad the Minister of State has been given responsibility for addressing this issue, along with his colleague the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. I welcome what the Minister of State is doing regarding the round-table discussions and reporting on how we can fix the system as a whole. However, in the here and now, there are practices that the Government can no longer stand over.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> Deputy Doherty told a story about the welfare of a very ill child being played with as if in a game of ping-pong between the people trying to run the centre and the woman trying to rear him on her own in a foreign country away from her family. Such people come to my clinic every week. I refer to people who are in absolute turmoil because they do not know what is happening from week to week. Not only do they fear being returned to their own countries, but they live in fear here because they do not know when the knock will come on their door. They do not know how to plan for the weeks ahead. This brings instability to a parent and it manifests itself in the children in that they become shy, withdrawn and unable to cope in school. The children were born in Ireland and we owe them and their families an immediate solution to the kind of carry-on that is evident right around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_959"> When I refer to families, I include single men, who are often placed in big, bulging hostels. There is one in my constituency on the quay in Waterford. There are men from all over the world put into dormitory-style accommodation. Some suffer from mental health difficulties and abuse alcohol, while others do not. They live in fear. They come to my office saying they have not slept in weeks. This is no way to treat anybody who comes to our shores looking for help.</p>
          <p eId="para_960"> As with Deputy Murphy, I have seen the transformation that happens when somebody in direct provision receives a red passport with a harp on the front of it. These people have so much to offer and bring to our society and communities. They are doing so already. I do not need to be convinced of that, nor does anybody. They enrich our communities and society. I echo Deputy Murphy's call for an amnesty. As a Government, we need to close direct provision once and for all and have an amnesty for those are caught in a system of our making. Although we were not in government when the system was introduced, we are now. My God, we had better do something about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_961">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. There is merit in an amnesty-type approach at present because we simply cannot have people, and their children who were born here, in the country for so long without making a decision on their status. The problem is that we have never had a proper discussion on this. Why are there so many people in direct provision and why are they being processed so slowly? Are we looking for such a considerable burden of proof that it will never be achieved?</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> We need to work to a timescale and work out whether people's stories are genuine and whether Ireland has an obligation to take them in. We should remember that the system is not in place to take everybody in; its job is to take in the people who have absolutely no other refuge to go to. Perhaps we need to discuss this also. Do we take in everybody who wants to come here? I do not remember this discussion ever taking place. Personally, I believe we have an obligation to those souls who are crossing into Italy on a regular basis and dying of disease. We have an obligation to the Syrian people who are crossing into Turkey. Turkey has taken in more than 1.5 million people. We need to start examining this problem and being responsible Europeans. It is fine to condemn what is happening abroad, but we need to ask what we can do. The centres have probably reached their term and they need to be dealt with quickly. We need oversight.</p>
          <p eId="para_963"> I must raise the fact that the stories are not always negative. There are some really good people working in the centres. Only two days ago, I spoke to a chef who works in one of the centres. He was concerned about what we have heard and told me they were giving the residents the best of Irish food. He said he could understand the arguments of people who want to cook for themselves, but the practicalities of families cooking for themselves would make things very difficult as matters stand. Ireland is a food nation and produces food of the best quality. I am glad to say that the residents are at least getting three choices for dinner and lunch. I have to defend the food. The majority of the staff are doing the best they can to provide as good a living environment as they can.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> Now that this discussion is taking place, will we talk about the matter sensibly? Will we process people who come to our shores more quickly? Have we got the gumption to refuse people we do not want to come here? There may be people who might not be an addition to our society and might be involved in terrorism or other practices; we do not know. We need to be aware of that; it is something we cannot inflict on our people. Taxpayers' money is paying for the system. If we have a proper discussion on it, the future will be better, not only for Ireland but also for the people who seek our help.</p>

          <p eId="para_965">Nobody in this House could not be moved by the horrendous sight of the bodies of dead asylum seekers on the beaches. That so many have been sacrificed, even on the high seas, by unscrupulous human traffickers is a blight on the face of humanity. Men, women and children are being sacrificed by evil traffickers of human beings. Some of those trafficked find security in whatever land they arrive at. They are essentially searching for a better life.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> In talking of refugees, I compliment successive Irish Governments on how professionally we handle what we call the programme refugees, namely, those from Bosnia and various other countries. Programme refugees are the genuine refugees who are being facilitated through the United Nations and relocated in various countries. We do a brilliant job on their behalf. The same cannot be said about our approach to those in direct provision. I have experience of direct provision. I stayed a night in New Ross and saw the terrible problems that arose, including those of single men having to share their rooms with another person of a different nationality, and perhaps of a different religion. We saw the difficulties associated with the dietary demands of the diverse groups in the centre. This creates nothing but tension and distrust. As people have rightly said, an element of mental illness sets in.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> It is absolutely unacceptable that anybody could spend two, four, seven or eight years incarcerated in a direct provision building. What the hell is happening? Why can today's system not result in a decision in a period of less than seven to eight years? Why would anybody's case require processing over a two-year period? It is unbelievable. The Minister must ask whether the legal process is the problem. Is there an indefinite conclusion to the legal processes people can avail of?</p>
          <p eId="para_968"> It might be controversial to say this, but I believe it might be more humane for the State, rather than incarcerate a person for four, five, six, seven or eight years in a direct provision hostel, to make a decision quickly to facilitate or deport the person. There is nothing as horrendous as sitting out one's time in one of these hostels, wondering whether one's application for asylum will be accepted at the end of that time. Imagine being deported after seven or eight years. We should compare our system with what happens internationally. Surely, there are other systems throughout the world that are superior to ours. I appeal to the Minister of State to try to learn from our counterparts.</p>
          <p eId="para_969"> There are good and bad stories to be told on this issue. I am dealing with the case of a young Nigerian girl of 17 years of age, who notwithstanding the fact she is the care of the local health board, being an unaccompanied minor who had a horrendous childhood, achieved the highest marks in her school in her leaving certificate. The problem she now faces is that she has been accepted for the business, economics and social studies, BESS course in Trinity College, but because she will be 18 in December, she will be moved into direct provision God knows where. That is not a humane way to approach the issue of kids who have overcome such terrible difficulties. Ireland is her home and we must change the rules that could send her anywhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_970">I compliment the Technical Group, in particular Deputy Pringle, on introducing this important motion, which has facilitated an important and constructive debate on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_971"> Any Member who has ever had contact with asylum seekers would agree the system is in need of urgent reform. The system is a mess and people are spending too much time in direct provision centres. In some cases I have come across, people have spent up to nine years in direct provision. The conditions asylum seekers must endure in these centres are appalling and the weekly payments they receive are derisory and an insult to those in receipt of them. In many ways, this payment is reflective of an outdated and inadequate system.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> I welcome the appointment of the Minister of State to this role and was pleased to see him allocated with this portfolio because I know from what he has said here in the House and from reading some of his statements on this issue that he is passionate about the matter, has a genuine interest in making progress in this area and is sincere about dealing with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> The system as it has operated for the past 14 years is unfit for purpose. We have treated occupants of these centres in a way that can only be described as shameful. Reflection on our history suggests we should know better as many countries around the world have welcomed Irish people with open arms over the years. Therefore, we have a moral obligation to protect vulnerable people who come to our State fleeing from their country. In recent times, a light has been shone on episodes in our nation's past when networks of immoral and dehumanising institutions were allowed to prevail against a background of indifference on the part of the State. The shameful details that emerged on Magdalen laundries and, more recently, mother and baby homes have shocked the nation and ought to weigh heavily on our collective conscience as we deal with asylum seekers. That those dark institutions were allowed to operate as and for as long as they did is an indelible black mark against us as a people and a State.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> Our past failings should heighten our resolve to ensure that no such failings occur again. Regretfully, having listened to the contributions from Members on all sides, I must wonder whether we have adequately learned from our mistakes or whether we are in the process of failing another vulnerable section of society by consigning asylum seekers to a punitive existence behind the closed doors of direct provision centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> I welcome the appointment of the working group and hope it does not delay in reporting back to the Minister of State so that we can move quickly and make progress on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_978">I congratulate Deputy Pringle on bringing this important motion to the House. Many Deputies on the Government side of the House have made a compelling case for supporting this motion and having spoken to Amnesty International and other groups on the issue I will be bitterly disappointed if the motion is voted down. I will be particularly disappointed if the Labour Party Deputies vote against it.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> It has been stated on a number of occasions that the rise in asylum applications has to do with the impression that the economy is improving across Europe. The number of asylum seekers has increased. The Irish Refugee Council has stated categorically that what we are now seeing is the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War, but that the increase in asylum applications has nothing to do with an improving economy but with the horrendous and inhumane conditions millions of people suffer around the world, where human rights are non-existent, people have no religious or political freedom and there is no freedom of expression. Sentient human beings deserve a quality of life and where conditions are bad they strive to move on so as to better their lives and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> Where do these people look to to achieve this? They look to the democratic process across Europe. They look to France, England, Ireland and other European countries. They have heard Ireland is the island of 100,000 welcomes and have heard how pleasant the Irish people are. Then they arrive here and we incarcerate them. There is a large group of students outside the Dáil tonight. None of these is a refugee, but they are all carrying a sign that says "Ten years in gaol". Essentially, this is what we are condemning human beings who seek asylum in this country to. We are here talking about people who are experiencing the type of life none of us would wish to experience, even in part. During the past week, I spoke to a chap whose brother had his two hands cut off due to the warfare taking place in parts of Nigeria between Christians and Muslims. Both of his grandparents were burnt to death. People like this chap had no choice but to come to Europe, to seek a democracy like that in Ireland in the hope they would be treated with respect and dignity, but that is not happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> Civil servants should hang their heads in shame for the creation of these institutions and procedures. I know they were not introduced by the Minister of State or the previous Minister, but somebody set out the procedure for how people should live in these centres or institutions. These procedures were probably set up by somebody who never met an immigrant. That must be the case, because if they saw the conditions in which these people live, they would not prescribe those conditions. It is institutional racism.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> If a situation arose in this country where thousands of people had to leave because of political, religious or personal persecution, it would be interesting to know whether they would be incarcerated for ten years if they arrived in England, America or Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Looking ahead, what would we think if we imagined that is what might happen to them?</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> We cannot wait a year or even six months. The Minister of State must have visited some of these centres, as I have. He must have seen how children are being brought up, how they stand in line for their breakfast every morning and then stand in line for their dinner, and they do this for ten years, or from the time they can stand at three or four years of age. It is appalling and outrageous. The Minister of State should support the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_985">I thank Deputy Halligan for giving me a minute of his time and I especially thank Deputy Pringle for bringing forward this Private Members' motion. Some years ago, I visited one of these direct provision centres and I was crushed to see what was there. It was an affront to human rights, an affront to human liberty, an affront to human dignity and it has to stop. It really has to stop. It is wrong to ask people who have already been so disadvantaged and crushed to live in a timeless vacuum, with the loss of dignity and all those things to which I have just alluded. It is just plain wrong. I was deeply saddened by it and I have not forgotten it, and that was a few years ago.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_986">I welcome the fact Deputy Thomas Pringle has brought this Private Members' motion to the Chamber. It should be made clear that Deputy Pringle brought this into the legislative process a year ago but did not have the opportunity to put it on the floor of the House until this week, so it is not just an issue of responding to the circumstances and the protests of asylum seekers who have come out in the community. I applaud them for doing that and for highlighting their plight and the despicable circumstances in which they are living.</p>
          <p eId="para_987"> It seems to be the case that despite abject apologies and expressions of shame about the inhumane treatment and incarceration in the industrial schools, the mental institutions, the Magdalen laundries, the mother and baby homes and the health service in regard to symphysiotomy, where the State outsourced its responsibilities to religious institutions and then forgot about them, we now have a repeat of the situation in direct provision centres for asylum seekers. The difference is that they have been outsourced to for-profit private companies. No wonder Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness has said it is a new scandal which will bring yet more international shame and yet another apology from the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> Some 4,360 people, 1,700 of them children, are being forced to live in inhumane conditions of overcrowding, forbidden to cook their own food, with a family in one room with shared bathrooms, and people afraid to make complaints. It is an incredible situation for people to be living in this way in this country at this time. I listened yesterday to the story of the woman in Cork who protested that she was in the direct provision system for nine years with her two children, who have never seen their mother cook a family meal. It is an incredible situation. She has no idea when her application will be dealt with. In some ways it can be compared to internment without trial because people are in a situation where they do not know when their application will be processed or how long they will have to wait. It is like asking how long is a piece of string. They just do not know what is going to happen, and their children are in that situation as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> These conditions are extremely detrimental to people's mental health and the healthy, rounded-out development of children. This is recognised by the Human Rights Council of the UN, which expressed concerns about the length of time people are in centres, the limits on freedom, the impediments to family life and the prohibition on working. The EU Commission on Racism and Intolerance has called for a complete review of the system by the special rapporteur on child protection, with all the organisations in Ireland concerned with civil liberties, migrant rights asylum seekers and so on. We know the system is not fit for purpose. The question is what to do about it and to act now.</p>
          <p eId="para_990"> The Minister of State said he has set up a working group, which is an excellent first step and all of the concerned groups are involved in that. He is not expecting the first report back until the end of the year, however, and in the meantime, these people are still in the same situation. I believe some of the suggestions Deputy Pringle has put forward for things that can be done immediately should be taken on board. For example, anyone in the system for more than six months should immediately be given the right to independent living, we should conform immediately with the norm across the EU by conceding the right to work after six months to those in direct provision, and we should establish independent complaints and inspection mechanisms. All centres should provide self-catering facilities, play space and study rooms for children, which are basic human rights for children. These are immediate measures which would greatly alleviate the present problems. In the longer term, we should move to specialised reception centres, operated on a not-for-profit basis, as recommended in the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> Many Deputies have made impassioned contributions about their direct dealings with people who are in the centres. We also have a huge housing crisis and we are talking about putting people into prefabs. It is just not on. There has to be a longer-term programme to deal with the long-term issues and immediate assistance put in place to deal with the immediate effects of homelessness and the direct provision situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_992">I, too, congratulate Deputy Pringle and strongly support the motion, which puts forward an immediate solution to this issue, which is a human rights-based, humane approach to an issue which has been ignored for far too long. The nonsense that used to be put forward that Ireland is an island of a thousand welcomes has certainly long been exposed. We are a country which has been quite happy over generations to send our young and our poor people to the ends of the earth because this country was not prepared to provide them with a decent standard of living. We were quite happy to send women who had children outside marriage as outcasts to other countries and expect those people to be taken in there. We expected our citizens, whom we were not prepared to look after, to be welcomed with open arms on other shores. We would hear it constantly said, "Sure everybody loves the Irish, isn't it great? Aren't we the people who built Britain? We're great workers", and all the rest. When people come here trying to earn a living for themselves and make a better life for their families, however, it is an entirely different matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> It used to be said there was never any racism in Ireland, and there was not when there were no people from other countries who wanted to come to live here. Once they did, that situation quickly changed. The attitude of the State and the policies put in place by the State have been a huge contributor to that situation, primarily through the denial of people's right to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> I believe the issues are much more starkly posed when we look at the scenario being faced by refugees and asylum seekers. Points have been made by other Deputies about the obstacles such people have to overcome - the horror in their own country causing them to flee here. They see Ireland as a safe haven, somewhere to build a new future. However, the decision to come to Ireland can have devastating consequences. This is graphically illustrated in the case of women in particular. Women are often held in direct provision centres in close proximity, for example, to an abusive partner from whom they cannot get away. Women and girls who are pregnant and seeking asylum in Ireland, as Niall Behan from the Irish Family Planning Association said, find themselves at the intersection of two state systems that deny them basic human dignity: the direct provision system, on the one hand, and our lack of abortion, on the other, both of which have been criticised by human rights bodies as violating human rights, causing discrimination and the stigmatising of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> That was graphically exposed in the case of Miss Y, who was a resident in a direct provision centre. One would have to ask whether, had she been given access to greater support in the community, the outcome would have been different. It is the case that, because of that restriction, people have been forced to parent in a direct provision or reception centre. It is just not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> The figures are available. Thousands of people, almost 2,000 of them children, are in temporary accommodation which was intended for six months but in which they have been living for an average of four years, in many cases for seven years and in some cases for ten years. Children are growing up in these places. Imagine spending four years out of work with no possibility of getting a job. Imagine trying to raise children on €19 with no possibility of that situation being bettered. Imagine overcoming all the sacrifices to become a victim in a society which keeps one isolated.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">It is a system of State-sponsored poverty and is unjust. I do not see what we need to review. The facts are clear. Deputy Pringle has outlined the way in which we need to deal with it so we just need to implement that because all of the human rights bodies have pinpointed the detrimental effects on the health and psychology of children and adults who have lived in that situation. It is the same as the institutions of the past. It is a modern-day Magdalen laundry. Should we not be consistent? We have had all these redress schemes for the damage done to people who were institutionalised in the past. If we want to end that now, we must give an amnesty and allow people the right to work. </p>
          <p eId="para_998"> From a legal standpoint, depriving people of the right to work does constitute a violation of their privacy and right to family life. We lost an opportunity to address it in the Refugee Act 1996. We must deal with that issue now because the right to earn an income is not just about the extra income, it is about self-respect and integrating with other people. It has a social value far beyond a monetary one. One has a win-win situation here even while people are being decried as coming into this country as freeloaders. The State prevents them from working and then everybody blames them for not working. Meanwhile the attention is taken off the real people who caused the problem in the first place - the bank bailout, the speculators and the gamblers whose debts are being transferred on to the shoulders of everybody. It is a great diversion.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> We should be welcoming more people here. We should be welcoming the diversity that this brings. In 2009, we resettled two prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. At the moment, there are 79 low-risk prisoners who have been awaiting release for years because the Americans will not allow them to be released into the US. We should take more. We have nothing to be afraid of. One would think that a country called the island of saints and scholars would be glad to invite people here and give them refuge and a safe haven. What has been going on has to stop.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1000">I thank Deputy Pringle for bringing this motion forward. It is long overdue that we have a discussion. For 14 years, we have had an indefensible and shameful system for dealing with vulnerable and poor people who have come to this country looking for refuge and help. Rather than give them refuge and help, we have imprisoned them in the most appalling circumstances and left them there with no hope. Most shamefully, we have allowed children to be brought up in these conditions - conditions that no parent in this House or anywhere in this country would tolerate for a second without screaming with outrage. Yet we have deemed it acceptable or have remained silent while this has continued for 14 years. Many children will never recover from the damage inflicted on them in these centres and not just kids. It is shocking that people are incarcerated in these situations; denied the right to work, integrate and participate meaningfully in society; starved of any sort of resources; and given a miserable €19. It is no wonder that depression, suicidal tendencies and mental health problems are rampant. Recently, we heard young women on the radio saying how they felt forced into prostitution in order to supplement the miserable amount of income they were given. Of course, a certain industry is building up around all of this for certain people - not all of the people - involved in direct provision. Certain people essentially see it as just a chance to make a profit. We have allowed this to go on until now and not acted upon it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> It is even more shameful and indefensible when one considers that there has been an acknowledgement that we committed a crime against single mothers, poor working-class children and people who lived in the mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and industrial schools and public apologies have been given. Yet we inflict the exactly the same system on poor people from other countries coming to this country looking for refuge and help. It is shameful beyond belief. </p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> I welcome the tone of many speakers on the Government and Opposition side and some of the comments made by the Minister of State about the need to rectify this problem. I hope that with the expression of all that sentiment, we will solve this problem immediately because it cannot continue any longer. If we allow it to continue, we are allowing a criminal and immoral abuse of human rights - a theft of people's human rights - and the imprisonment of innocent people to continue. This is morally repugnant and indefensible so we must act. I hope the Minister of State and Government are committed to doing this. </p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> There must be an amnesty for those who have been imprisoned in this system that everybody said was dysfunctional. We have all said here that this system was wrong and rotten. Therefore, we owe everybody in the system an apology and an amnesty as compensation for putting them through that suffering. That is a minimum requirement. Otherwise saying that it was wrong and that the system was dysfunctional but not then giving an amnesty to people who had to suffer this is a contradiction in terms. As a minimum, those who have been put through this system must get an amnesty. Otherwise we are punishing people who are innocent and whom we have failed. </p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> We must say that institutionalised living - the system of direct provision - is totally unacceptable and must be abolished. We must give people who come to this country the right to work. If we have to assess their applications, they should be allowed to fully participate in society while this is being done so that they can contribute and so that no ammunition can be given to anybody who wants to claim that in some way they are sponging off the system - as obnoxious as that sentiment is. We must commit to abolishing direct provision and give asylum seekers the right to work, participate and integrate in our society. </p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> One of the Fine Gael Deputies who acknowledged that we have to move in the direction of a reform asked whether this means we should have open borders. We have emigrated all over the world and even as it stands, the Irish State is fighting for the undocumented Irish in the US to have the right to stay and work there. How can we deny any less to the people who come here looking for asylum and to escape persecution or poverty? We should allow people to come here just as we have gone to other countries.</p>

        <speech by="#TomFleming" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1006">I congratulate our two new Ministers of State and wish them well in their new roles. On 24 July 2014, the UN Human Rights Committee expressed concern about the length of time people must stay in direct provision and the lack of an independent complaints mechanism in Ireland. The Government has given some commitments and in particular, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality appears minded to reform or reconstruct the manner in which asylum seekers are hosted in Ireland. The European Migration Network study on the organisation of reception facilities for asylum seekers which was published last May notes the varied nature of supports provided to asylum seekers across the EU. The reports note the wide disparities in provision of accommodation with some countries operating systems similar to direct provision, others permitting asylum seekers to find their own accommodation and some countries not providing any or minimal financial allowances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Others set allowances near the same level as those available to citizens to ensure a dignified level of subsistence. The other important element is the complicated network of appeals systems and reviews they have to go through. There appears to be a lack of Judiciary and there is an urgent need to correct the situation, and get things moving in a better manner than is currently the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008"> Given the past record of the country on how we institutionalised individuals in industrial schools, Magdalen laundries, mental hospitals, borstals etc., we should wonder to what extent we are serious about approaching proper reform of the system rather than permitting the warehousing of asylum applicants. There is an urgent need for an in-depth review to determine what can be reasonably done to ensure respectful protection of the core social and economic rights of people who are awaiting their determination for refugee status.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> When direct provision was introduced in 1999 it was initially meant to provide shelter for six months until such time as applicants were granted refugee status or deported. The system has been unbelievably slow, dysfunctional and fragmented, and the legal process is drawn out. The average length of time for a stay in the direct provision system is three years and eight months. The statistics show that over 1,000 people have spent five years or more in the system, over 600 people have been in the system for seven years or more and a number of people have spent 13 or 14 years in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> The reality is that these people are living in conditions which are damaging to their health, welfare and general well-being. There is a need for a consultation process for all stakeholders, in particular asylum seekers currently in the system and those who were in it in the past. Children should be included in the process and we should get their opinions. It would be very interesting to hear the responses, and we may learn from them and get a better insight into the ridiculous conditions in which they live. We could see what can be done to ensure respect for and protection of the core social and economic rights of people who are awaiting the determination of their refugee claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> The Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, has stated that the treatment of children living in direct provision centres for asylum seekers is an issue of ongoing concern and needs to be addressed urgently. She said, "[I]t was wrong children in many cases were spending their lives growing up in a system that is often inappropriate accommodation intended as a short-term solution." The reality is that over 1,600 children now reside in direct provision, sharing single rooms with their families often in unacceptable situations whereby they have to share bathrooms with complete strangers. </p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> A major factor which is detrimental to asylum seekers who are students is that they are practically prohibited from participating in third level education. This is serious discrimination because as a result of their financial situation they cannot further their education. We should never lose sight of the fact that these young children are, in many cases, resident in Ireland for their lifetimes and will be citizens of the country. It is very negligent of us to give them a start in life in a manner such as this. We may have to bear the cost of this at a later date, psychologically and otherwise. It may cost the State millions of euro and it is wrong from a human rights perspective.</p>

          <p eId="para_1013">I thank everyone who has made a contribution to the debate on this important Private Members' motion. I am speaking on behalf of the Government when I say that everything that has been said over the past two days has been noted carefully and will serve to inform the discussions of the working group which the Government amendment to the motion commends to the House. I will not repeat what my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, said in his speech yesterday in support of the Government amendment, but the working group process, which is to be chaired by former High Court Judge Bryan McMahon, will afford a genuine opportunity to discuss this matter in a calm, considered and detailed way. This means that the recommendations or changes which come about as a result of this process will be evidence based, and thereby sustainable and workable for the people we all seek to represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> The Government accepts the sincerity of all of the speakers in support of the original motion. This is a debate which needs to happen. It was commenced by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and in many respects has been enhanced by the views expressed by many Deputies in the House over the past two days. The tone of the debate has been a credit to the House and all Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> Extreme views have been articulated across the floor over the past two days. It is a very emotive and emotional subject. I defy anyone not to be moved by the testimonies tabled by Members of all parties and none. All the points made require careful examination and will be carefully examined by the Government and the working group. This is why we have set up a working group comprising experts on the State and non-State side. They are the right people to conduct such an investigation. This does not mean that the process will be slow. I want to assure the House that this is not an attempt to fudge, delay or obfuscate what is a very important set of issues; quite the contrary, in fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> The Government expects the membership and the terms of reference of the working group to be announced in the very near future. Once established, the Government will request its report within a short timeframe. This is essential. It represents a genuine opportunity to examine in detail and make recommendations on an issue which has become ever more prominent in public debate over recent times. </p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> Like my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, I want change, not just as a public representative but as a human being. One of the largest direct provision centres in the country, Mosney, is in my constituency. I and my colleagues in government want to ensure that, in particular, the needs of families and children in the centre are met, not just those in centres now but also those who may arrive on our shores in the future. I want to ensure that the experience of childhood children have in direct provision centres is not the only experience of childhood they have, something which is all too frequently the case. </p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> It would be unconscionable for me and most right-thinking people to allow a system constructed along current lines to continue unchecked. As a public representative and a member of Government, when a policy is found not to be working and not in the common good or interest it has to be reviewed and we have a responsibility to act, which we accept. As a citizen and human being I have a moral responsibility to call things as they are and as I see them. There are residents in direct provision centres whom I consider to be friends. They are people who I met in very difficult circumstances and represented them over a long period of time. I see how a system like this fails people, can shatter the human spirit and can damage human dignity, about which Deputy Mathews spoke eloquently. </p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> The working group is the best place to examine the system and how we can change it to make it more humane and responsive to the needs of human beings. We owe that to the people and families about whom we are all concerned and whom we seek to represent. This House should allow the working group the time and space to do its job. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2014-10-01T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1020">I thank Deputy Thomas Pringle for moving the motion. It is something that should have been addressed a long time ago. It is disappointing that the new Government left it so long to even think about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> In June this year, a representative of the Government, the former Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, lobbied on behalf of 50,000 Irish citizens living and illegally working in the USA. He argued that these immigrants should be granted legal status so that they could be allowed to participate fully in American society. I support that appeal. However, when it comes to the treatment of asylum seekers in Ireland, no one from the Government is lobbying to grant legal status to these immigrants. Is our Minister content with the fact that the Government adopts a double standard on the treatment of immigrants? It is apparent that the Government's stance on migration is determined by the nationality of the immigrants and in which country they are immigrants. If the migration is of Irish citizens to another country, many of them helping to lower the unemployment statistics when they leave, the Government is all in favour of immigrant rights. However, here at home we have the hypocrisy of the Government withholding legal rights for asylum-seeking immigrants and their children, many of whom are Irish-born. They are placed in direct provision facilities where a process which is supposed to take months can take years. According to the Irish Human Rights Commission, it takes between five and ten years in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> Ireland and Lithuania are the only two countries in Europe to have opted out of the EU's reception directive, the law which states that if a country has not given a decision on an asylum seeker's application for refugee status within six months, it must allow that applicant to work while a decision is awaited. The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is on record very recently as saying she completely rules out any possibility of giving asylum seekers the right to work. Will she reconsider that? I do not understand why she is so dogmatic about it. Is she afraid it will cost the State money? I ask her to reconsider, as this is a very negative policy for our Government to stick with. It would make a great difference if we allowed these people the opportunity to work. It is the absence of a right to work and an opportunity to integrate into society, contribute to it and feel like a valuable, dignified human being that is the root cause of the problems around this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> The Government says the reason for the long delays in making the final decisions on asylum seekers' refugee applications or immigration status applications is at least partly the fault of the asylum seekers themselves, who ask the High Court to conduct a judicial review of every decision at every step of the process. Each judicial review can take two or more years to be completed in the High Court. However, the full truth is that the State bears much of the responsibility. The first consideration as to whether an asylum seeker should be granted refugee status comes from international law, specifically the Geneva Convention. The first stage of deciding whether an asylum seeker is a refugee involves the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The commissioner's decision can be appealed to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, the decision of which can in turn be appealed to the High Court if the way in which it was arrived at was unfair - for example, where a decision was irrational in light of the evidence submitted or where too much or too little weight was given to certain evidence. After consideration of an individual's application for refugee status fails, there are further legal ways to seek permission to remain the State, including the granting of humanitarian leave to remain, which comes from Irish law, or the granting of leave to remain based on subsidiary protection grounds, which comes from EU law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> The State chooses this fragmented approach with many stages, each of which is judicially reviewable, as opposed to the single procedure adopted by every other EU state. The State's complex method and series of steps and decisions provides many opportunities for judicial review instead of just one. Because the decisions taken by the lower State bodies - that is, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal - are so frequently ill-judged, they are easily challengeable in the High Court for failing to comply with basic rules of constitutional fairness. There is a high success rate when these decisions are challenged. Another reason the delay is attributable to the State is that it does not provide legal assistance or free legal aid at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or Refugee Appeals Tribunal stages. Thus, procedural unfairness occurs in these processes which would usually be challenged at the relevant time by an individual's solicitor. This procedural unfairness is then viewed as a weakness in the decision, which allows it to be challenged later in the High Court by way of judicial review. If the State provided free legal aid at those early stages, any issues of procedural fairness would be dealt with then and would not taint the eventual decisions arrived at.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025"> While the Government is planning to change Irish law and introduce legislation for a single-procedure system, we have yet to see the detail of the legislation. It is generally considered a positive move as it would bring us in line with the rest of Europe and would certainly be welcomed. However, this will only apply to future applicants who arrive on our shores seeking asylum. The new single procedure will not apply to or help in any way the 4,000 people currently languishing in direct provision, of whom close to 1,500 are children. Many of those children were born in Ireland but do not have the right to Irish citizenship because of the change in citizenship law after the 2005 referendum. The only fair way to deal with these asylum seekers would be to grant an amnesty giving all of them permanent residency in Ireland, save in certain exceptional circumstances such as where a person has a serious crime record. I am not talking about driving offences, which some people have been hit for. This kind of amnesty would only apply to these 4,000 applicants and would be a recognition of the fact that the State has failed them. Most of us agree that has happened. The State's conduct in this regard has been assessed by many international and human rights bodies as a serious and continued breach of human rights law. A limited amnesty would not be a burden on the economy. It is a finite number of people comprising approximately 2,000 adults and their children. It would be symbolic, dignified and a healing gesture on the part of the State and Irish society in general, which would also have a very real and practical effect on the lives of these 4,000 people. The Minister has set herself very strongly against the idea of an amnesty for the 4,000, but I ask her to reconsider that also. If fairness is to apply, she must take another look at this. I realise she is worried about the cost that may be involved, but given that it is a finite number, we should give priority to human rights, dignity and fairness.</p>

          <p eId="para_1026">I thank all Members for their contributions to the debate over the last two nights. It has been very heartening for me to hear the contributions that have come from all sides of the House in condemning the system of direct provision. It is a very powerful message to send that there is across-the-board political support for the abolition of a system that is unjust, inhumane and completely wrong. Perhaps I should apologise to some of the Fine Gael Members in the House for expecting that politically they would be slightly more disposed to a hard-line approach to asylum seekers and direct provision. It was heartening to hear some of the very emotional contributions from some Members, particularly Deputy Regina Doherty, who gave a powerful example of how a seven-year-old child was treated at a so-called reception centre. She had a slight slip when she used the words "detention centre" rather than "reception centre". That encapsulates exactly what the direct provision system is.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> I must remark that it is disappointing that the Minister with the executive power to deal with the system did not attend and contribute to the debate tonight. I have a great deal of respect for the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who is genuine in her attempts to reform the Department of Justice and Equality and the justice system. It would have helped her to be here tonight to listen to the contributions of her party and Government colleagues across the board on the direct provision system and to hear what needs to change and the political support for that. It has become clear to me over the last two nights of this debate that there is a political will to deal with this system and reform it to end direct provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">The blockages are within officialdom, the Civil Service. They are the ones who operate the system across the board. </p>
          <p eId="para_1029"> It is interesting to know, having listened to some of the contributions, what is driving the mindset that allows the direct provision system to be supported. In his contribution the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, said we could not operate a system which left us open to being targeted. I do not believe the Minister believes that statement. In the debate last night Deputy Niall Collins of Fianna Fáil said we could not be seen as a soft target. The Sinn Féin spokesperson, Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, qualified what he was saying by stating his party was not advocating an open door policy. That is the mindset of the civil servants who operate the system. They have allowed it to develop and introduced it across the State. They have put 4,300 people in a situation where their human rights are being abused on a daily basis. Their right to a family life, dignity and self-respect is being denied across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030"> The motion is very reasonable. It provides for what will probably be the outcome of the working group process the Minister has started if it is operated properly, but why wait six months, one year or 18 months? The Minister should withdraw his amendment and accept the motion to allow us end the system once and for all and bring dignity to the people suffering under it. There are no floodgates waiting to be opened. There are no hordes of asylum seekers waiting in the middle of the Atlantic to come here looking for this open door policy. This policy is the result of a mindset within the Civil Service. As mentioned by a number of speakers, it is institutional racism. It is a system that is being operated in a racist way. There is political support across the board to end it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031"> I know that the Minister does not have the Executive power and that if it was in his gift, he would do it, but he must take the political support he has received tonight, ram it down the throats of the civil servants and show them that there is the political will which they cannot hold back or resist any longer. They have to change the system and do the humane thing because if they do not, in ten or 15 years time another Taoiseach will be standing on the opposite side of the House apologising on behalf of the people for what we all know is a system that cannot continue and that will destroy lives in the future if we allow it to do so. The Minister should take the support he has received from all sides of the House tonight and tell those back in the Department that the system will change from this point on.</p>
