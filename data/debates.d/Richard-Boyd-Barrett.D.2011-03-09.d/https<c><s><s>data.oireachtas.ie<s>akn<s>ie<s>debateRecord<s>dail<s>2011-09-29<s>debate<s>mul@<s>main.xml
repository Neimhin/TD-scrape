          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The news of possible large job losses in Covidien in Athlone over the next two years is a devastating blow to the people of the midlands and, in particular, the workers and their families.  My heart goes out to the workers who are left with this great uncertainty in their lives.  Added to that is the threat of closure of the barracks in Mullingar, something the Tánaiste promised would not happen.  When the Government parties came to power, they promised a significant jobs budget and all we got was a damp squib of a jobs initiative.  Month by month, the Government presides over increases in the live register, despite net outward migration.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">Have the IDA and the Government been informed of the exact number of jobs at risk?  What steps have been taken by the Minister responsible and the IDA to save the jobs?  What proposals does the Government have to provide alternative employment to people affected by this decision across the midlands and the west?  What plans are in place to work with the employees and management of the company to organise training and reskilling of workers?  Will the IDA seek a clawback of grants paid to the company?  Can I also be assured by the Tánaiste that there is no threat to jobs in another company facility in Blanchardstown, Dublin?  Is it intended to use the underspend of €10 million at the end of the August on the Tús programme to provide more jobs and opportunities for unemployed people?</p>

          <p eId="para_24">First, I would like to express my concern about the announcement in respect of Covidien which has operated in Athlone for 30 years.  I understand the company is undertaking a transformation of its operations and that, as part of this, one of its basic products will transfer over the next two years to Thailand and it intends to offer a voluntary redundancy programme.  It is too early for the company to state how many jobs will be impacted, as it is also looking at bringing in new products and technologies to the site, which will affect the final number.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">There is no fire sale of State assets and there will be no fire sale of State assets.  There is no wholesale privatisation of State assets.  The Government is taking a strategic approach to investment in the economy.  We are doing that because I believe even Deputy McDonald will agree that there is a necessity and a priority to generate employment in the economy.  We have a number of things going for us in this country.  We have very good State companies, as the Deputy has said.  We have the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which has developed considerable expertise in the area of finance and of corporate governance.  It makes sense to take what I call a whole portfolio approach to the State companies.  That is the progressive approach that has been taken in a number of other countries.  The investment strategy, the corporate governance strategy, the obtaining of finance and the entire State shareholding in the State companies are looked at as one.  There is huge potential for investment in some areas of the economy, including communications, which the Deputy mentioned, energy and infrastructure such as water.  In all those areas, there is a requirement for additional investment and potential for the generation of employment.  It makes sense for the State to harness the resources it has available in order to invest in those areas of the economy and generate employment both directly in those areas and, through that investment, outside them.  There are two arms to the strategic approach the Government takes.  One is the total portfolio approach that is being taken to the State companies and the other is the establishment of a strategic investment fund that will use resources from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and leverage resources in the private sector in order to invest in the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">The Tánaiste knows as well as I do that the total portfolio approach can and should be taken with those companies still in full public ownership.  He knows well that the moment shareholder interests enter the equation in the semi-States, they will trump the public interest.  I imagine that is why his party's manifesto stated categorically that the party was against short-term privatisation, yet that is precisely what he is proposing to do — to cash in the chips of the semi-States.  He tells us we need to invest in jobs.  The troika has the view that that will be used to write down debt.  The Government is guilty of exactly the same short-term political thinking exemplified by the Fianna Fáilers, and an incapacity to understand that those assets and industries need to be harnessed.  They can generate employment, but they will deliver their full value in the medium and long term to the State, the citizens and the taxpayers only if they are kept in public ownership.  The Tánaiste has singularly failed to tell us what the non-strategic assets are.  He has not told us that because his plans are to go in and vandalise key strategic infrastructure.</p>

Nowhere is that problem greater than in Ireland, and the kernel of the problem is the consultancy work that has been given to auditors who are also auditing the company in question.  In other words, the same company is doing consultancy work and doing the audit, so it has a serious conflict of interest.</p>

The Government has invariably employed the big four to do consultancy work in the case of the banks, and at the same time, in many high-profile cases, they have passed the banks and given the all-clear for the solvency test.

How long will the Government continue to pay these fees when there are equally reputable — or equally disreputable — people in the second line of auditors who will do the job for much less?  Why does the Government always and invariably go, sometimes without going through the tendering process, to the big four, which are not only discredited in Ireland but are now discredited internationally and in Europe, as we will see in the coming draft regulation?</p>

The 38% increase since 2009 in the number of incidents of women seeking refuge from domestic violence is disturbing.  The HSE funds 20 domestic violence centres, with a budget of €10.5 million.  The Government is committed to implementing the national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence for the five year period from 2010 to 2014.  One of the main aims of that strategy is to respond to the needs of victims of domestic violence.  The HSE is currently undertaking a national and regional review of domestic violence service provision.  The aim of this review is to ensure that funding is allocated according to need and that the areas of high demand are appropriately resourced.  This issue is very much under active consideration by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">I have answered this question on a number of occasions.  The only decision the Government has made in respect of State assets has been to sell a minority shareholding in the ESB.  On a previous occasion, I outlined the process by which that will be progressed.  The Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are dealing with that issue and it will be done in the best interests of the country.  I expect that they will bring proposals to Government by the end of November.  When we have those proposals the necessary legislative measures will be prepared.  The whole approach to State assets, including the proceeds of any sale, is to ensure they are used in the best way to generate employment in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Of course, the Deputy has no interest in improving the situation of people who are worried about their jobs and futures and their families' jobs and futures.

          <p eId="para_218">I will not take that long.  I welcome the Bill.  While our spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Michael Moynihan, is not here because he is in Belfast meeting the Minister of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, Fianna Fáil will be supporting the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">It is a good idea to review the Bill.  The Veterinary Practice Act 2005 was the first update of the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1931, which was an enlightening piece of legislation.  It is a good idea to review a Bill every five years.  Often, even though anomalies arise in respect of Bills passed by the Houses they remain on the Statute Book for years without change.  I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have decided to update the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 and to address some of the anomalies contained therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Veterinary surgeons are a little like doctors, consultants and barristers in that everyone gives out about and criticises them saying their charges are too high and that they monopolise the animal health sector.  At the end of the day, we all need veterinary surgeons, in particular farmers, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the pet sector.  I believe they have provided us with a good service down through the years.  The Minister referred in his speech to the 250th anniversary of the veterinary profession.  I join with him in congratulating the profession, which was established in France.  The Irish veterinary sector is not that long in being but is more than 100 years old.  We have many highly trained veterinarians in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The role of the veterinary profession is important in the animal health sector.  Farming is going through a vibrant period.  The previous Government introduced the Harvest 2020 strategy, which has been taken on board by the current Minister and Minister of State.  It will drive the food industry for the next seven or eight years.  There are great opportunities for expansion and development of the food sector.  As the Tánaiste stated earlier, it is all about jobs.  There are also great opportunities in the food sector for the creation of jobs.  It is important our products are produced in a green manner.  The veterinary sector has a particular role to play in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The Veterinary Practice Act 2005 introduced many changes.    This Bill proposes to empower the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to make regulations to exclude specified practices from the definition of practice of veterinary medicine.  Certain procedures which could be interpreted as being reserved for vets or veterinary nurses will no longer be so reserved.  The Minister is hoping this amendment will provide the legal certainty for people carrying out certain procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The Department's regulatory impact analysis of the 2005 Act noted a broad and general definition of veterinary practice under the Act which is the subject of varying interpretations.  Concerns were expressed that several activities traditionally performed by non-vets may amount to a practice of a veterinary medicine under the 2005 Act.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI, heard concerns from physiotherapists and equine dentists on this matter.  It is viewed that some ancillary activities are inadvertently covered by the definition which was not the intention of the 2005 legislation and it has the potential to cause confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">A wide consultation process was held by the Department involving the VCI, Veterinary Ireland, the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, the Equine Dental Association of Ireland, the Farm Relief Service and the Irish Master Farriers Association, along with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Health.  Interested parties broadly agreed with the aim of securing greater legal certainty with regard to specified activities.  The VCI supported the aim but indicated the matter would be preferably addressed under the forthcoming animal health and welfare Bill.  Veterinary Ireland also supported this approach.  The advice of the Attorney General, however, concluded the issue was best addressed through an amendment to the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  Will the Minister explain why this approach was taken?</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Activities identified that may be excluded from the definition of practice of veterinary medicine are set out in the Department's 2011 regulatory impact analysis.  These comprise microchipping of companion animals, farriery, scanning of cattle and sheep, bovine hoof trimming, physiotherapy and equine dentistry.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">The Veterinary Council was dissolved by the 2005 Act and replaced by the VCI, a self-funding body, which comprises members reflective of broad interests including education, consumer interests, food safety and animal welfare.  Its functions include keeping registers, establishing codes of conduct, approving programmes of education and performing an investigative role in regulating the veterinary profession with the power to impose sanctions on members.  Will the Minister give an overview as to how this body is working, as we do not hear much about it?  Has it imposed any sanctions on any of its members?  I note the Minister wants to introduce certain changes in how the council works with proposals for reducing the quorums for council meetings, for example.  Does the Minister see problems with how it is currently operating or are these just minor administrative changes?</p>
          <p eId="para_227">A 2008 Competition Authority review of the veterinary sector noted a large influx of foreign-trained vets between 2001 and 2007 with up to 40% of new vets registered having qualified outside the State.  Has this figure changed since 2008?  The authority expressed a concern in its review on Ireland's reliance on other countries to produce vets for Ireland's needs.  It recommended the number of vets trained should be closely monitored to ensure no shortage arises in the future.  Will the Minister give an update on this?</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The Competition Authority also suggested some changes to the provision of non-vets to carry out bovine TB testing services or other routine procedures which would free up vets' time to deal with more complicated procedures.  It suggested the Department should consider introducing a new paraprofession of TB testers in a wider context of overall animal health.  Is the Department considering implementing these suggestions?</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The UK's Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 restricts the practice of veterinary surgery and outlines the works that can be carried out by non-vets in a list that is larger than the one contained in our legislation.  Was this legislation examined when drafting our Bill?  Will our legislation extend the work that can be carried out by non-vets?</p>
          <p eId="para_230">This Bill and the changes it will bring about have been widely welcomed.  A high-level consultation process was carried out with the different interested bodies which are quite happy with this amending legislation.  Recently, I contacted the IFA about the Bill and it had no comment to make on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">Yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner</i> carried a report on how the Animal and Plant Health Association conference was told preventive medicine used on farms increased by 25% over the past 12 months and by 64% in the past five years.

Farmers also tell me about the high costs of veterinarian services and preventive medicine used on farms.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">I was supposed to be attending the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children at 11.30 a.m.  With no disrespect to the Minister, Acting Chairman or the Dáil, I will have to leave immediately after I have made several points on this legislation.  Will the Minister communicate a response to these points in writing afterwards?</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I will keep my contribution brief and to the point.  Sinn Féin agrees with the broad thrust of the Bill and will support its passage to the next Stage.  The Bill represents a sensible way forward for agriculture.  Having just come from a meeting with the national leadership of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, I can confirm that it is content with the Bill's introduction.  As such, many of the Bill's measures must be good and I compliment the Minister of State on its introduction.  Unusually, only one and a half pages of this 28-page document addresses the Bill's main objective.  The remaining pages went through each of the sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Is there an opportunity to review the curriculum for the agricultural and animal training programmes so that we might explore more fully what can be done by unregistered practitioners?  We should not assume that the current curriculum is in a position to exploit the new opportunities that will open once the Bill is enacted.  Does the Minister of State propose some form of licensing rather than registration of unregistered practitioners working continually in the field and using non-prescribed procedures?  Will unregistered practitioners need to be covered by indemnity insurance?  It is proposed that registered practitioners be covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Will the House be supplied with the list of procedures that can be carried out by unregistered practitioners?  I have bovine bone setters and the like in mind.  Someone from the Department will examine practices elsewhere, including procedures carried out by unregistered practitioners.  Could we have access to the list of procedures that the Minister of State intends to designate as non-prescribed procedures?</p>
          <p eId="para_239">While it may not be a function of the Bill, the Department may take this opportunity to consider the monetary value associated with procedures carried out in other jurisdictions.  If we are gathering data on how procedures are designated between registered and unregistered practitioners elsewhere, we could also collect valuable data, if it is available, to set a standard fee for a veterinary procedure, if that is our intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Entering a premises without notice or warrant is a significant new power.  Some form of adjudication or redress should be available to farmers or producers who believe a registered practitioner has abused his or her powers.  Redress should not be to the High Court, as people could not afford it.  A panel or ombudsman should adjudicate on issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">It is strange that there is no requirement for practitioners working on behalf of the Government or a State agency to have indemnity insurance in respect of their official duties.  Some people will read this as meaning it is okay for Government practitioners to tell people what to do, but that the former do not need to do the same.  What is the rationale for not requiring registered practitioners on official duties to possess indemnity insurance?</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I suggested an ombudsman for people who are aggrieved by certain parts of the inspection process.  On a related note, people who apply for registration and believe they have been unjustly treated by the registration authority only have recourse to the High Court.  That court is an expensive place to attend and has a long waiting list.  If people are aggrieved by a decision of the registration body, perhaps we should consider a different form of redress, be it mediation or adjudication.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Undischarged bankrupts will still be forbidden from registering.  There has been a great deal of discussion regarding people who have been bankrupted, many through no fault of their own.  Their bankruptcies seem to hang over them like life sentences.  Perhaps we should re-examine the proposal in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Bill and the ensuing examination of procedures should be used as an opportunity to gather data that would help the Department to set standards for the fees associated with different veterinary procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Sinn Féin believes this is a good Bill and we will support its passage to the next Stage.  I apologise for needing to leave to attend a committee meeting.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomFleming" eId="spk_206">
          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_246">The Bill arises from concerns expressed regarding the definition of veterinary practice contained in the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  That Act provides a broad and general definition of the term "practice of veterinary medicine" under section 53.  However, this definition has proved to be lacking in certainty and overly ambiguous.  It potentially includes certain procedures that traditionally have been carried out by non-vets and thus leaves those practising them open to criminal sanction.  The Act sets out penalties of up to €320,000 and prison sentences for repeat offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The amendment legislation allows the Minister to define by regulation the term "practice of veterinary medicine".  Procedures that could be interpreted as being confined to vets or veterinary nurses under the existing legislation can now be carried out by non-vets.  The attempt is to provide legal certainty in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">It seems that concerns are also being expressed by the Competition Authority regarding the definition of veterinary medicine.  There is a risk that where a greater number of activities are reserved for the veterinary profession, vets would, in the absence of competition, provide a more costly service than other less qualified service providers.  This would be particularly acute for members of the farming community who should have the option of paying people with a lower level of qualification to carry out simple procedures at a lower price.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I must wonder why an Act that is only six years old should need to be amended now.  Why could this certainty not have been provided for in the original Act?  Could it be that interests wishing to preserve their privileged position had a greater influence on the passage of the legislation?  At least two Members of these Houses flagged the possible difficulty around the definition as a risk during the debates on the original legislation, but it seems that their concerns fell on deaf ears.  Time must now be taken up in the Houses to correct a previously identified problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">In preparing the Bill the Minister considered a number of possible resolutions to the problem, including voluntary agreement on codes of practice; the amendment of the 2005 Act to remove the activities concerned, although this could quickly become outdated; and allowing the Minister to make regulations to describe the procedures and define the required qualifications of the people involved in those procedures.  The Minister has opted for the third proposal.  Regulations will be adopted to define the procedures to be allowed and the qualifications and insurance the practitioner will need.  It is important that the statutory instrument used be scrutinised and brought before the committee to ensure as full a discussion as possible and that there will be no need to revisit it time and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The regulatory impact assessment has identified the types of procedures that may be excluded from the definition of "practice of veterinary medicine".  I ask the Minister, in drafting the statutory instrument, to include emergency treatments that may be required where a veterinarian is not available.  It should also include the taking of tuberculosis tests.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">It is imperative that regulatory procedures be stringent and robust.  We must, however, be careful to ensure they are not over-restrictive and cumbersome for the agriculture industry and impact negatively on the competitive aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The veterinary nursing profession plays a very important role.  The 2005 Act recognised this officially.  Subsequent to that Act, over 500 nurses have been registered to practice.  That five colleges offer approved and accredited courses is most positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I welcome the legislative measure that ensures activities and services concerning animals that have traditionally been carried out safely by non-veterinarians or nurses will not be reserved solely for the veterinary profession.  The procedures in question include farriery, equine dentistry, microchipping, physiotherapy, bovine hoof trimming and the scanning of cattle and sheep.  It is most important that the scanning of cows before calving be in the category of ordinary scanning and not extended to hormone treatment or other practices, which are happening to a minor extent.  There is malpractice in isolated cases and we need to ensure it is prohibited completely.  Quality assurance to the customer is paramount.  Any professional misconduct that would bring the profession into disrepute will have to be addressed in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Due to the ever-growing importance of agriculture and the emphasis on the quality of food, animal health care is essential.  The veterinarians perform a vital function in assisting their farmer clients in maintaining the health and well-being of their animals and minimising disease risk, which can have a significant impact on farm income.  Veterinarians play a vital role in official inspection services on the farm, and in factories at processing level where they verify the health and safety aspects of food in the interest of consumers.  It is vital that our international reputation as a provider of excellent food products be maintained to ensure economic prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I welcome the Bill in general.  It is needed to clarify many issues and I hope it will be teased out further on Committee and Remaining Stages.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_207">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_257">I wish to share time with Deputy Tom Barry.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The Veterinary Practice Act 2005 provides a very general definition of "practice of veterinary medicine", which has proved to be lacking in certainty.  It includes procedures traditionally carried out by people who are not qualified as veterinarians.  This leaves the practice of such procedures by non-veterinarians very much open to criminal sanction.  Fines of up to €320,000 or ten years in prison are set out under the relevant sections for repeat offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The Bill proposes to give the necessary power to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to make recommendations that would exclude certain aspects of the definition of "practice of veterinary medicine".  In other words, certain procedures that would only be carried out by a qualified veterinarian or veterinary nurse would no longer be reserved for these people.  It is hoped this amendment to the Act will provide proper legal certainty for such people.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The Bill will make technical amendments to the 2005 Act based on experience since it was brought into effect in 2006.  For example, the Veterinary Council of Ireland has expressed concern that some of the activities carried out by persons not qualified as veterinarians may amount to the practice of veterinary medicine under the 2005 Act.  Physiotherapists and equine dentists have expressed a view that some procedures are inadvertently covered by the definition.  This, however, was not the intention behind the 2005 Act, yet it has the potential to cause some confusion and perhaps lead to litigation.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food concludes that legal certainty and clarity are needed to allow certain procedures to be carried out and to offer services to farmers and other animal owners where a qualified veterinarian or veterinary nurse is not required and where the need to protect animal welfare comes into play.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The main purpose of the amending legislation is to make clear the definition of "practice of veterinary medicine".  When the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 came into being, it did away with the Veterinary Council.  It repealed the Veterinary Surgeon Acts 1931 to 1960 and established the Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI.  The latter's membership reflects a broad spectrum of people, with an interest in education, consumer affairs, food safety and animal welfare.  The council was given functions such as keeping registers, establishing a code of conduct and approving certain programmes of education, and it was given investigative powers in regulating the profession in addition to imposing sanctions on members.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The Minister retains the power to give general policy direction and ultimately to remove the Veterinary Council of Ireland should it fail to carry out its functions.  However, when the 2005 Act was introduced, the Minister found there were some faults and weaknesses in the disciplinary procedures and sanctions that previously obtained, and a lack of proportion in the range of sanctions offered.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The 2005 Act reformed the fitness-to-practice provision so there would be more transparency in disciplinary procedures.  It also established the Veterinary Nurses Board of Ireland and recognised statutorily the veterinary nurse profession.  This group had no legal status, which was identified as a key restriction in engaging in the profession.  The Act sets out a number of functions that veterinary nurses can carry out, but which can only be done under the supervision of a veterinarian.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The 2005 Act introduced for the first time a definition of "veterinary medicine" that means it is an offence for anyone other than a veterinarian to practice veterinary medicine.  The primary purpose of the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill is to provide clarity in the definition of "practice of veterinary medicine", as referred to in the 2005 Act.  The definition in the Act is now regarded as lacking in certainty considering that taking part in the practice of veterinary medicine without the proper qualifications is an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The vagueness of the definition has now become problematic.  With this in mind, the Minister proposes to amend the 2005 Act by inserting new provisions that would empower the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to make regulations prescribing procedures that may be carried out by non-registered persons, that is, non-veterinary professional.  The Minister would also be able to prescribe in the regulations certain requirements that would be applicable to a non-registered person carrying out a special procedure.  These could relate to training; special skills; being a competent member of a prescribed body; an obligation to consult a registered person before carrying out a procedure; having indemnity insurance; the maintenance of records; and other prescribed conditions.  In this way, the Minister can allow someone who is not a registered veterinarian to carry out a certain procedure but, for example, require a person who is performing the procedure to demonstrate certain skills and competencies or undertake specified training and be appropriately insured.  The amendment to the 2005 Act is designed to ensure persons not qualified as veterinarians can carry out certain procedures without fear of prosecution.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomBarry" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Deputy Tom Barry</from>
          <p eId="para_266">I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It broadly highlights how Ireland leads the way in animal welfare and in its practical approach to regulation.  I congratulate the Minister on his approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">This is a progressive, practical and common sense Bill which brings the experience of those working on the ground to the forefront, with the primary role of ensuring good animal health.  I have farmed for many years and I have experienced the build-up of regulation over the past 20 years.  Sometimes, we gave out about it and found it was over-burdensome.  In the Bill, the Minister clearly sets out his stall, which is that while he wants regulation he wants it to be practical.  This gives great confidence to everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I congratulate the veterinary profession on being 250 years old, which is of some note, and it is more than 100 years since the profession was established in this country.  Animal health care and the role of the veterinary profession encompasses a large spectrum, from working with farmers such as me to inspecting food in industries at a processing level.  The main goal is to ensure we have safe traceable food, because this is what the consumer demands and is entitled to.  Food Harvest 2020 commits to producing high-quality safe food at a competitive price and having robust regulatory procedures will help to achieve this goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I welcome the Minister's comments that he does not want to see regulatory procedures becoming unduly restrictive or over-burdensome on the industry.  This is very important as in the past regulations have become a bottleneck to progress.  One could state that at one stage regulation was a boom industry in itself in the State, while we had a banking sector with no regulation.  It shows how our agriculture has pushed forward and made huge strides because it had practical regulation while our banking sector went out of control and left us in the mess we are in.  However, agriculture is one of the sectors that will pull us out of this and we must be positive in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The Bill will build on the 2005 Act.  We now have more than 500 registered veterinary nurses and five colleges accredited to train them.  This shows us that we have the confidence to train people and that we know what we need to get our industry working.  It is a snapshot of the strength of Ireland's educational system; we continue to produce high-quality graduates in all fields including agriculture.  Many other countries look to Ireland's high-quality production of milk, cheeses and beef and would like to emulate what has taken us decades to achieve.  However, it is not all about rules.  It is about the industry understanding where it needs to go, having targets and respecting every layer from the farmer to the fork.  We have this environment in Ireland along with a sense of purpose about what we need to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The Bill contains procedures, such as bovine hoof trimming and scanning animals, which can be carried out by suitably trained people who do not necessarily have to be vets or veterinary nurses.  This is important because there is no point in adding additional costs to farmers or tying up the time of professionals on procedures which can be carried out by suitably trained people.  It is also appropriate that there will be proper consultation with the Veterinarian Council of Ireland before any exemptions are allowed; the Minister is bringing people with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The Bill gives us confidence in how the profession is regulated and takes into account exemptions for horses coming from abroad on short trips.  The training requirements in the Bill will be recognised throughout the EU.  I have worked with the veterinary profession for many years and have always considered its members to be highly professional in their approach, sympathetic to farmers who land in trouble and always seeking to help farmers achieve better standards.  I welcome the Bill and I thank the Minister for taking another step along the way to achieving the targets of Food Harvest 2020.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_273">I welcome the Bill, which I see as a pro-farming initiative designed to allow the farming community, many of whom have been carrying out certain procedures over many years, to do so now without fear of prosecution.  This is not to say I would in any way seek to interfere with the right to work and the payment of appropriate fees to veterinary surgeons.  However, what all of us who work with animals know only too well is that there are times when it is necessary to intercede to save livestock, although this contingency is allowed for under section 55 of the 2005 Act, or to carry out routine procedures which do not need the intervention of a professional vet or veterinary nurse, which is also allowed for under the 2005 Act but only as long as the treatment is not tied to the usual care provided by a vet.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Regulations, bureaucracy and red tape have been the ruination of many farmers.  What we are talking about in this sector is regulation gone mad.  What I want to see, and the Bill will go some way to ensuring it, is common sense and experience being allowed to direct a farmer's actions without fear of legal action.  We have seen regulations introduced by EU directives which should never have made it onto paper, let alone to enforcement.  I have milked cows by hand and taken the milk directly without any harm and I am still here today, but dare I engage in such a natural action now, the full force of directives one to 1,000 would descend upon me.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Rules and regulations affect the sale of vegetables and other farm produce, with the end result being an increased cost to the consumer and sometimes a diminished market.  Many of these products are washed or treated with products which destroy the taste and quality.  I would prefer to buy potatoes with earth on them, rather than the washed varieties, although of course I would wash them before I would eat them.  It is time we returned to sanity and common sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">This common sense dictates it is not necessary to call out a vet for simple procedures which farmers and farm workers, including me, have carried out for decades.  While the number of food animals has decreased to a marked degree in recent years, regulations have multiplied, requiring an increased need for veterinary services.  One could argue this has increased the quality of the subsequent products, but at what cost?  To some extent, I would dispute the notion of increased quality.  I know from first-hand experience as a farmer that it has been extremely expensive and frustrating to be compelled to call out a vet when I could easily carry out most day to day procedures myself as I have done previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">We must also bear in mind that the work specification for many vets has changed dramatically.  For example, the demand for services for pets has risen considerably over the years.  How much of this is driven by world-wide over-attention to the perceived needs of these pets, as opposed to necessary care, is open to question.  With celebrities making pet ownership a fashion statement and the "pampered poodle" image extending far beyond that breed, vets experience such demand in this sector that they work extremely long hours to meet requirements.  For many owners, frequent visits to the vet are perceived as essential for their pet's welfare, which is not to say that many of these visits are not urgent and necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">We must also be conscious of the very real threat of shortages of Irish-trained vets in the profession.  There was a huge influx of foreign-trained vets between 2001 and 2007.  During this time, almost 40% of new vets registered in the country came from outside the State.  The Competition Authority has recommended that this situation be carefully monitored to ensure there is no shortage in the profession.  However, according to the CAO, this year has seen an increase in demand for veterinary qualifications, with points for veterinary medicine rising to 565 from 560 and veterinary nursing increasing from 435 to 450.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I congratulate the Minister on taking the necessary steps to remove the adverse impact the 2005 Act has had on farmers.  In recognising that it was never intended that the 2005 Act would unnecessarily restrict the ability of skilled persons to care for their animals, he will remove an unnecessary restriction on farmers.  While I am aware that it is intended to adopt detailed regulations after the Bill has been enacted, I implore the Minister, Deputy Coveney, not to remove the benefit of the intended legislation by the imposition of red tape and bureaucracy.  There is not much benefit in having the supposed freedom to care for one's own animals if it means consulting a list of rules and regulations at every turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I am delighted to welcome any cost-cutting initiative for Irish farmers and in that regard I draw the Minister's attention to the cost of animal medicines in Ireland.  While veterinary fees may be near the top of farmers' expenses, medication is also a major expenditure.  The situation is extremely inequitable when compared to the cost of animal medicines in the North and in the United Kingdom.  Allied with the cost of medication, Caesarean sections are far more expensive in this country than in other European countries, with little competition between veterinary practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">It is good to see legislation that is intended as a cost-cutting measure, which will work to the advantage of farmers.  I hope the results of the legislation will be not only peace of mind but considerable financial benefit for farmers.  Measures brought in by the previous Administration have not been in the interests of farmers or vets, or indeed local communities.  There was much uproar prior to the enactment of the 2005 Act.  We all had visits from the IFA and other farming organisations which were protesting at the proposed legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The closure of Longford's district veterinary office last year, which was undertaken as a saving to the Exchequer, led to a considerable loss of employment in the county.  The beneficiary in this move was Drumshanbo, which became home to integrated services.  Westmeath was affected also due to the closure of the agricultural office in Mullingar, which was relocated to Tullamore.  With farming very much an economic backbone of Longford's economy, the new arrangements were far less efficient for farmers and were very much an erosion of people-centred rural life.  Apart from the job losses, herd owners faced considerable inconvenience and time loss due to extra travel involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Farmers in the midlands and throughout the country have faced one blow after another in recent years.  Whether it was a new directive from the EU involving considerable expense to implement, withheld or delayed grant aid, stealth taxes or planning restrictions, the farming sector has seen it all.  However, since the current Minister took office things have begun to improve.  The recent efficient 100% payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme give hope of a new era in farming.  Following on the previous staggered payments, that was very much welcomed by farmers.  I am happy that this Bill is another step in assisting rather than obstructing the farming industry on which so much of our economic recovery depends.</p>

          <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</from>
          <p eId="para_284">I am pleased to speak on the Bill, which I welcome.  It brings clarity to issues that arose following the 2005 Act, where farmers and even vets could be prosecuted.  I compliment the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on its common sense approach to practices taking place on farms at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I wish to speak on the operation of vets and the administration of veterinary drugs in the equine sector.  With Goffs in the news this week, most people are well aware that the equine sector is a major employer of people in this country, with approximately 17,000 people involved in the sector.  This year, 6,500 thoroughbred foals have been registered.  In addition, there are approximately 1,000 non-registered thoroughbred foals as well as the foals born in the sport horse sector.  Approximately 50% of the registered thoroughbred foals will end up racing.  One could ask what happens to the other 50%.  It is sad, but we must talk about the fact that many of those animals end up being slaughtered.  Horse meat is a valuable export, in particular to continental Europe.  The French market for Irish slaughtered horses is considerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The drugs administered by vets for the cure of ailments in the equine sector are not licensed.  There is a requirement relating to minimum residue levels but because the equine sector is such a small part of the veterinary-pharmaceutical industry, time is not taken to do testing on the drugs used.  As a result, there has been a derogation from the Commission on the administration of veterinary drugs used in the equine sector.  That means there is no withdrawal period for most of the drugs.  Consequently, when vets administer drugs to horses they stamp the animal's passport as "Not fit for human consumption" which affects the livelihoods of those involved in the horse breeding sector whose horses do not end up on the racecourse and cannot be used for their intended purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">There is no licence for the drugs used in this area.  Perhaps the Minister could examine the matter and address it in the regulations under the Bill or by some other means.  The meat from a horse whose passport is stamped "Not fit for human consumption" can only be used as dog food.  Both Deputy John Paul Phelan and I have equine slaughtering facilities in our constituencies which are at capacity in recent years due to the downturn in the economy.  The people who own the horses end up getting either a nominal fee or may have to pay for the animal to be slaughtered themselves.  Breeders suffer a loss of earnings as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The horses to which I refer are not bred for slaughter but for the racetrack.  One should consider the statistics involved: of the 7,000 thoroughbred foals born this year, only seven will win a group 1 race.  Only 3,500 will make it to a racetrack, which means 3,500 thoroughbred foals will end up being slaughtered before they reach their potential.  The sad part for the sector is that breeders have potential to earn much more if the stamp "Not fit for human consumption" were to be removed from the passport.  Horse meat could be a valuable export for this country.  I hope the Minister will examine the regulations.  The Bill improves the way in which livestock is looked after.  It will also ensure that Irish produce is the envy of the world because of its quality.  I would like to see an opportunity for us to export horsemeat for human consumption on the Continent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DaraMurphy" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Deputy Dara Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_289">I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  It is nice to contribute to a debate on a Bill that has cross-party support, as well as the support of the IFA.  This year marks the 250th anniversary of the establishment in France of the practice of veterinary medicine.  For over 100 years, Ireland has been producing high quality veterinary practitioners and other professionals who work in that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The veterinary industry is rarely discussed in the country at large because of the exemplary fashion in which the sector conducts itself.  We should congratulate the many people who work in what is an important part of our economy.  Farm animals provide the vital link in the farm-to-fork concept, in addition to giving the economy huge potential for the production and export of food along with the ancillary employment involved.  The veterinary industry in all its forms provides much of the regulation, checking and security consumers have when sitting down to eat Irish food produce.  For that, the industry is to be commended.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The Bill effectively concerns deregulation so that certain functions and activities that may hitherto have been seen as reserved for the veterinary profession will now be open to others.  That is in tune with the programme for Government which seeks to cut business costs generally and strengthen competition in sheltered sectors.  This concerns not just the agricultural industry, but all businesses.  As agriculture has been modernised and developed, the gap between regular mainstream business and farming has narrowed.  In both cases in recent years we have seen an onerous increase in the number of groups and bodies involved in farm regulation.  This Bill has come before the House quickly and I hope it represents just one step in the move towards reducing regulation in farming and in business generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">We must identify how we can broadly unleash the potential of high-growth sectors in the economy.  Much reference has been made to the fact that our agricultural and food production sector is currently one of the economy's shining lights.  We must also develop such potential through our third level facilities by educating foreign students here.  Ireland is renowned for its production of sporting animals and those bred for consumption.  Some years ago, the National Consumer Authority produced a study showing that Ireland is still a significant net importer of vets and other professionals in this industry.  Given that we have such strong institutions and a strong culture of engaging in all forms of livestock production, we could find ourselves exporting such talent in this area over the next ten to 15 years.  This would provide revenue for institutions and get added value from an area where currently the reverse is occurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The Bill is straightforward legislation which I welcome.  I compliment the Minister and Minister of State on bringing it before the House.  We must continue the journey towards deregulating farming and other industries.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_294">I wish to make a few points on the Bill, but because some of them have already been made, I will not dwell on them too much.  Like other contributors, I also wish to support the Bill.  It is the first time I have spoken in the Dáil when there has not been a single Opposition Member present, but I suppose they are supporting this legislation too.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I agree completely with what Deputy Anthony Lawlor said about the slaughter of horses.  In addition, Deputy Ann Phelan will be familiar with a premises in Kilkenny that is currently engaged in that business.  There has been a significant increase in the number of horses being brought to that premises and other such facilities around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">One current difficulty is that we have very small numbers in the thoroughbred sector and because of that we cannot get the drugs to be certified.  That presents a problem with the horse passport and meat being deemed as unfit for human consumption.  Perhaps the Minister can examine that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Deputy Dara Murphy spoke about veterinary education, which I also wish to address.  In yesterday's debate, the Minister outlined the changes that have taken place.  Some five or six colleges are now offering veterinary nursing courses as well as veterinary practitioner courses.  The Department of Education and Skills and third level institutions need to examine student access to those courses.  I am familiar with the cases of several vets who trained overseas, particularly in various parts of Europe, because they could not get into colleges here.  At a time when we are bringing a significant number of vets from other jurisdictions to work here, it would be appropriate to extend such courses for more Irish students who have a genuine interest in the care of animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I have traditionally supported the CAO points system, but there is more to professions involved in animal care — as with caring for humans — than just the bare points race.  If people have a genuine aptitude for such professions, it should be taken into consideration.  It is unsustainable to export Irish students to gain qualifications abroad while at the same time having to attract foreign vets to service our domestic industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Many vets in my area — I am sure it is the same in other parts of the country — have expanded their practices greatly in the last few years.  I am familiar with vets whose practices would have been solely agricultural, but who now have practices that almost entirely treat domestic pets.  With the economic downturn, however, more vets are returning to deal with farm animals as there have been obvious improvements in the agricultural economy in the past 12 months in particular.  These have coincided with a reduced number of citizens attending veterinary clinics for their pets' problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The Bill focuses on a key aspect that the Government must address across the economy in the next four or five years, which is the need to reduce the cost of professional services.  It might be argued that the terms of this legislation could be extended to other practices that may not necessarily need to be carried out by vets or veterinary nurses.  In this context, it is welcome that certain practices such as scanning and micro-chipping, farriery and others, are specifically listed in the Bill and as a result of these changes, will be permitted to be carried out by persons who are not qualified veterinary practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I ask the Minister of State to refer in his concluding comments to some points I wish to raise.  Deputy Bannon referred to the closure of veterinary offices in different parts of the country.  The veterinary office in Kilkenny was downgraded a number of years ago and there is widespread speculation that the Waterford office, which services the Kilkenny area, is due for a similar downgrading over the next couple of months.  The Minister of State may not be in a position to comment but if he is, I would like to hear his views.  Deputy Tom Barry hit the nail on the head in his contribution when he spoke about Ireland leading the way in respect of animal welfare.  We have a strong record in that regard.  Irish vets and veterinary nurses are respected across the world for their work.  The change in the legislation governing those professions is to be welcomed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughtonJnr" eId="spk_213">
          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_302">This is straightforward legislation which will clarify certain issues provided for in the 2005 Act.  I wish to make some brief comments.  I acknowledge the quality of the veterinary service in this country.  I come from an agricultural background and I have seen at first hand the commitment of veterinary professionals to their work.  They are available late at night or early in the morning and are always ready to come out when they are asked.  They play a vital role in the agrifood sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The agri-sector of the economy is doing well and exports have increased as has the income of farmers.  I come from the west and I know that the rise in farming incomes is not universal and rising costs have to be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I ask the Minister of State to comment on the cost of veterinary medicines.  I come from a farming background and I have a farming education.  I know that every farmer does everything possible to ensure animal welfare.  Farmers understand that the care given to the animals is reflected in the price paid at the mart or factory and farmers who do not commit to that level of investment will not get the returns.  There is never a situation where farmers want to skimp on these costs because it will affect the final profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">However, the cost of veterinary medicines is a significant issue for farmers.  The beef industry and the export of live cattle trade is a very important part of the sector.  Vaccinations are required for animals being sent to the factories and for those being exported on the hoof to ensure the animals are disease-free.  The vaccine is very expensive and every farmer must ensure his or her animals are vaccinated if the best price is to be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">I do not advocate the cutting of costs across the board in the agri-sector.  It has taken many years to achieve our reputation.  If we were to start cutting costs this would damage our reputation on the Continent and would have a detrimental effect on sheep and cattle prices.  However, we must understand that large profits are not being made by every farmer in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">This amending legislation clarifies what procedures may be carried out by persons who are not veterinary surgeons.  I received my agri-education at an agricultural college and many of the people who carry out these procedures were similarly educated.  We are fortunate in having many excellent agricultural colleges around the country who are providing this level of training and skills to young farmers which will all help to cut farming costs.  The colleges have a very valuable role in this regard.  Mountbellew Agricultural  College in my own area services the whole western seaboard and these colleges must be funded so as to continue this valuable training for young farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">It is acknowledged in the agri-food sector that Harvest 2020 is the goal.  This strategy will help boost production and exports of cattle, sheep and food.  I would not wish to see this policy tampered with.  While the price of cattle and sheep has risen slightly, so has the price of veterinary medicines.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to examine ways of providing subsidies to farmers in order to reduce the cost of medicines.  I know that farmers do not skimp on animal welfare.  They know well that the care of animals is vital in order to boost future profits.  It is vital for Ireland's reputation abroad that this continues to be the case but it must be understood that this is a high cost for farmers and every effort should be made to keep it cost-competitive.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnnPhelan" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Deputy Ann Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_309">I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The major difference between this Bill and the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 is that we can legislate with the benefit of hindsight.  The 2005 Act was a landmark decision and the proposed amending Bill is a progressive step towards bringing veterinary practice into the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">In 2005, it was accepted that veterinary legislation was outdated and in desperate need of reform.  The primary function of the Bill is to fully clarify the legal position in enabling the Minister to exclude specified activities from being reserved to veterinary practitioners and nurses and to fully expand the definition of the "practice of veterinary medicine".  The definition in the 2005 Act was far too vague and as a result it has been subject to varying interpretations.  Stock owners and practitioners were unhappy with the vague definition.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">The Veterinary Council of Ireland concluded that various ancillary activities were being inadvertently covered by the definition.  In the effort to protect animal welfare and safety, legal clarity is needed to define the activities that may be offered to farmers and other animal owners by service providers or non-vets when a veterinary practitioner is unavailable.  Many of these activities such as farriery, bovine hoof trimming and the scanning of cattle and sheep, are already being carried out by other service providers.  This Bill will legalise and regularise those services in the interest of protecting animal welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">There is also a growing need for competitiveness in this sector to be protected.  If a significant number of procedures are exclusively reserved to the veterinary profession, there is a greater probability that these services will prove more costly for the individual, in the absence of a competitive market.  As other speakers have noted, veterinary costs are a large factor for farmers.  As it stands, many of the veterinary practices throughout the country and particularly in Carlow-Kilkenny match the prices of their competitors for procedures such as scanning.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">On the issue of the export of horsemeat, I do not believe Irish people like the idea of their horses being eaten.  However, there is a particular problem for the horse sector.  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the very bad winter weather last year.  It was not an uncommon sight to see horses standing in two to three feet of muck with nothing for them to eat.  At that stage I asked whether we could introduce a national cull, because it was hard to watch these animals suffer in the bad weather.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">A particular problem with regard to the disposal of horses concerns the cost to the owner for the disposal of the carcass.  I will not seek a roll-back of legislation introduced in that regard because I agree we must dispose of animals properly.  However, I would like the Minister to consider other options for disposal, particularly in the case of horses.  This is also a huge problem for local authorities.  They must round up these animals and dispose of them in the correct way, which involves significant cost.  Perhaps it would be better to export these animals for meat.  This might be kinder to the animals and would be better than leaving them languishing.  With that in mind, should the reporting of specific cases of animal cruelty encountered by veterinary practitioners be made mandatory?</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Before the 2005 Act, the veterinary profession had been self-governing.  There is an inherent weakness in self regulation, but this amendment should correct that.  Major shortcomings existed regarding disciplinary aspects and the measures which could be taken to deal with them under the code of practice, with a noted lack of proportionality in terms of the range of sanctions offered.  However, the 2005 Act reformed the disciplinary proceedings, giving due regard to human rights standards.  With this Bill, a further progressive step is being taken to advance the effectiveness of the Veterinary Council of Ireland's investigative functions through authorising its officers to enter a premises other than a domestic dwelling without a search warrant.  I welcome this as it will make the investigative process more transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I would, wearing my parochial hat, like to refer to the situation in Kilkenny with regard to district veterinary offices, DVOs.  I have asked the Minister of State why the DVO in Kilkenny was downgraded and have asked him to consider having somebody from the Department attend the Kilkenny Mart in Cillín Hill rather than make it necessary for the farmers to drive to Waterford.  It would be better if one person was in Kilkenny to service the needs of the farmers on that day.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">While this is not part of the jurisdiction of the Minister of State, I would like to draw his attention to a sad fact, namely, that the incidence of suicide among vets is among the highest in the country.  While I do not wish to introduce a sad note to the  Bill, it is worth reflecting on this.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane McEntee</from>
          <p eId="para_320">Many agricultural issues have been raised here and it is crucial we follow up on everything.  We are entering a new stage of production and the need for a vet in each area is crucial.  I know as a farmer that when farming was going badly, it was just as hard on the vet as on farmers.  Vets had to wait for their money and might only get it two or three years after providing a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I am delighted with the increase in milk, beef and sheep production and that some practices are being exempted.  It is critical that some traditional family businesses, such as hoof-paring and scanning, can be continued and allowed to grow and create jobs.  Several Members spoke about the education of our vets.  No disrespect to anyone, but I am aware from my area that people could not understand some vets who came into the area.  It is a serious loss to our education system that we are not providing more vets, particularly since we are a country with such high standards.  As an illustration of just how high our agricultural standards are, I learned when at the ploughing championships that some 300 students from China are to come to Ireland next year to be educated in farm practices.  I urge all those who spoke so passionately about this issue to follow up on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The issue of the disposal of horses and their use for meat must be addressed at EU level.  I would hope this is taken up because €3,500 multiplied by 1,000 would be a significant amount.  The suggestion of a cull is a very good idea, because we will have the same problem again when the winter comes.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Deputy Browne asked why the Department decided to use the Veterinary Practice Act as a vehicle for exempting certain practices rather than the Animal Welfare Act.  The reason is simple, namely, that the difficulty that needs to be redressed results from the definition of "veterinary practice" in the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 and the problem can only be addressed through an amendment to the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">A significant number of issues and questions have been raised in this debate and it would be wrong not to follow up on these.  We must ensure the growth in agriculture continues along with best practice in the veterinary area.  I thank colleagues for their constructive participation in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">As I explained in my opening speech, the amendments proposed in the Bill can be divided into two broad strands.  The first strand derives from the relatively broad definition of "the practice of veterinary medicine" in the 2005 Act and the need to ensure that certain ancillary activities and services concerning animals, which have traditionally been carried out safely by non-vets or nurses, do not become reserved to the veterinary profession.  In this context, I refer in particular to procedures such as farriery, equine dentistry, bovine hoof trimming, micro-chipping of companion animals, scanning of cattle and sheep and physiotherapy.  The legal advice obtained by the Department is that, having regard to the existing definition of veterinary practice in the Act, there could be doubt about the status of these procedures carried out on animals, particularly in the event of legal disputes arising.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">In summary, I propose to resolve the issue by inserting provisions into the Act to enable me, under delegated powers, to make regulations to exempt certain procedures from being reserved to veterinarians or veterinary nurses.  The amendments also provide for these exemptions to be made subject to appropriate conditions, including education, training and skills, membership of specified bodies and so on.  In so doing, the process will build on existing informal arrangements in some of the areas in question and it will provide clients with a greater degree of quality assurance.  It will also facilitate, where appropriate, the specification of the parameters associated with particular procedures which can be performed by non-registered persons, which will bring a much greater degree of legal certainty to the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Clearly, in exercising these regulation making powers, I will be subject to the principles and policies which are set down in the Bill.  We can, of course, examine these principles and policies in much greater detail on Committee Stage.  The Bill also provides for formal consultation with the Veterinary Council of Ireland before any activity is exempted.  There will also be extensive consultation with the various stakeholders before any regulations are adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The second strand in the Bill relates, in summary, to changes being proposed to streamline and improve operation of the 2005 Act in light of experience since its implementation in January 2006.  In the majority of cases, the changes proposed derive from suggestions put forward by the Veterinary Council of Ireland, based on its direct experience of implementing the 2005 Act.  The proposed amendments also take account of more recent legislation governing regulation of the professions, in particular, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Pharmacy Act 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">As I indicated in my opening statement, the Department has consulted widely on the Bill and there is a general welcome among the various stakeholders that the substantive issue of the ancillary activities is being addressed.  This broad consensus is reflected in the contributions made in the debate today.  I am not particularly surprised that there is some disagreement about some of the detailed provisions in the Bill and we can deal with the issues raised on Committee stage.  The door is not closed and it is important people know that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_332">I take great pleasure in contributing to the debate.  I come from a constituency that has been very much reliant on agriculture and tourism.  The agriculture sector went through a difficult period but it has recovered.  We are competing with other interests in the context of tourism.  I grew up in Boyle, a small town, and 25 years ago, we had a thriving tourism industry based around Lough Key forest park and fishing.  Every town and village along the River Shannon was visited annually by English fishermen who fished for trout, bream and pike.  They were very much part of the community as they stayed in local pubs, bed and breakfast accommodation or hotels.  Every night they joined the locals for a few drinks and there was great interaction between everybody with conversations concentrating on fishing and football and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">My constituency stretches from Roscommon town to the Border and, at the time, the English fishermen never allowed the Troubles in Northern Ireland to get in the way of travelling here.  Every year they visited the area and they would come into my shop in the morning to buy newspapers and cigarettes but, unfortunately, we priced ourselves out of the market and a major issue emerged in regard to coarse fishing as the fish seemed to disappear.  I have raised this question over the years and no matter what anybody says, the same volume of fish is not in our rivers as before.  English fishermen now visit Holland and Denmark to fish large ponds.  We lost sight of the fundamentals of a tourism industry, as we priced ourselves out of this revenue stream.  The same happened with boating on the River Shannon.  Tourists would visit every year from Germany and Austria to hire boats from Guinness cruisers and Carrickcraft.  At the time it was expensive to do so but it was within their budget.  We again priced ourselves out of that.  Many of the boats that serviced the canal between Ballyconnell and Ballinamore have been transferred by major companies to France because we priced ourselves out of the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Lough Rynn Castle Hotel and Kilronan Castle Hotel and Spa opened in the area in recent years but we need more quality accommodation at budget prices.  I was involved in the Lough Key forest park action group many years ago.  In the 1980s, the park attracted 200,000 visitors annually and it was a major part of the local economy but it was allowed to deteriorate.  In recent years, many initiatives have been undertaken with more than €10 million spent.  However, if we had relied on the local authorities, Bord Fáilte and Coillte to think outside the box, nothing would have been done.  The European Regional Development Fund provided 80% funding for tourism facilities but the park was owned by Coillte and it could not draw down the funding because it was a semi-State body.  The local authority did not have access to the park and, therefore, I suggested that the council should take over part of the park in partnership with Coillte before applying to Brussels for the €8 million required to upgrade it.  The officials who should have been running our business did not think that this was on.  The local authority then went into partnership with Coillte.  We now have control of the park following the investment of €10 million and it attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors.  It is wiping its face but, more important, it is providing the foundation for tourism infrastructure in the west and we need more rooms to live off it.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I thank the Minister of State for his generosity in providing money for cycle and pedestrian paths between the park and Boyle town.  Cycle paths and walking routes are the way forward.  For example, if one takes a trip to Holland, one can stay in a town, cycle 50 or 60 miles the following day at a leisurely pace and then stop off for dinner before staying somewhere else.  That is the way forward in this country, particularly in the midlands, and it would be beneficial to create these routes near rivers.  Funding was also secured for a cycle path beside the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal. These were welcome developments and they have provided a new tourism product.  Many people are also driving to the new cycle path between Westport and Mulranny in County Mayo.  It is 30 km long and it is a great way to spend a day.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The OPW is in receipt of significant funding.  If its officials had been thinking outside the box over the years, they would never have allowed Lough Key Forest and Activity Park to be put in the hands of a semi-State body such as Coillte.  They should have recognised this as a major jewel in the crown in the context of our national parks and they should have taken control of it.  The reason for this is the OPW had a set budget, which it spent on the same projects, and officials did not bother thinking outside the box.  They do a great deal of good work but they have access to significant resources, which could be redistributed in consultation with voluntary organisations.   King House, the home of the Connaught Rangers, is located in Boyle.  During the Great War, many young men left the west to fight for freedom.  They had been forgotten about but King House has been converted into a museum to honour the rangers.  The house has a significant and varied past in the context of the Easter Rising and the Great War and that has been recognised.  Roscommon County Council, in particular, has invested significantly in this attraction and it is trying to maintain funding.  However, we need to think outside the box regarding how these sites are developed and operated.  An organisation similar to the National Trust could be established through which local volunteers could use the available resources because they know what is needed locally and many of them want to be part of the provision of tourism facilities in their communities.  The OPW and other bodies could work together to ensure resources are better used while involving the community because the goodwill is there.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Agricultural tourism is becoming more important.  During the Celtic tiger era, the generation of income in the agriculture industry was forgotten about. We decided we would have an economy based on international finance but effectively what we were doing was selling houses to one another, and we know where that got us.  We are now back to thinking straight and I am pleased that agriculture, and agri-tourism, is doing well but we must put greater emphasis on tourism because 200,000 earn their living from the industry.  With a little work we can increase that figure enormously.  Incentives such as the reduction in the airport travel tax are welcome as is the reduction in VAT from 13.5% to9%, which will encourage people to go out and buy a cup of coffee.  Many restaurant and coffee shop owners have telephoned me to say that VAT reduction gave them the incentive to hire extra staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">We must develop centres of excellence.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has generously given a huge grant to Lough Rynn for a rowing centre, for which I thank him.  This is an ideal lake as it is located in the centre of the country and is easily accessible from both Belfast and Dublin.  That is the type of development we need.  It has the facilities in place with the hotel beside it.  That is an exciting development and is a way of looking at a different aspect of tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">There is another opportunity I have been examining for our own forest park.  There are many thermal spas in Europe.  For those Members who do not know what they are it is where the warm water comes up from the ground.  They are in Budapest and elsewhere.  Geothermal drilling is done three or four km into the ground to reach the water and it provides electricity for the national grid.  We could examine providing water for an outdoor thermal spa, even in Dublin.  We could do something in St. Stephen's Green or the Phoenix Park.  The water is below ground.  The project may cost hundreds of thousands or millions of euro but it would be another aspect of tourism to consider.  When one travels to Budapest in the middle of winter one wonders whether to go for a pint or to the cinema but another option is to sit outdoors in one of these thermal spas and be warm.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">This is something that could attract people to this country and it would also provide electricity for the national grid.  I am aware that one company with whom I have had discussions is drilling in Newcastle, in south Dublin.  We would be providing electricity for the grid and it is something we should examine.  I am aware the Minister is open to suggestions and that he will consider this aspect.  He might also ensure it would go into Lough Key Forest Park, which is in the exciting Carrick-on-Shannon, Boyle, Drumshanbo and River Shannon tourism region.  Our transport, car hire, food and accommodation costs have come down and we must keep our eye on the ball as regards tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">We must get more flights into Knock Airport which has an excellent management team.  If the same management team was in charge of the Dublin Airport Authority we would not have the same problems and the white elephants we have now.  That team is in charge of an airport in an area that otherwise would not have an airport.  The members of the team have shown great professionalism and ingenuity in ensuring that more flights come into the country, although more flights are leaving the country as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">A great deal has been done to promote surfing in this country.  Every time I travel home from Dublin cars with surf boards on them pass me travelling back from the west or the north west.  What has happened in that regard is phenomenal.  Surfing championships were held recently in Bundoran and people came from all over the world to attend them.  Who would have thought that would happen here?  When we thought of surfing many years ago we thought of countries like Hawaii or elsewhere but they are surfing on the west coast of Ireland in their wetsuits, and they have all the rain gear also.  I am sure the Minister has done his own surfing off the west coast as well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Mitchell O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_347">I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate on tourism, an industry that is essential to the recovery of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">I welcome the contribution by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, on the Bill last weekend and commend the approach of the Department on this issue.  I am aware the Bill is merely technical in nature but I welcome the lifting of the cap on the level of advances that may be made to the National Tourism Development Authority out of the capital moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The Bill also provides us with ample opportunity to debate the issue of tourism.  It allows us to step back and take a comprehensive look at the way we plan to prioritise tourism to improve revenue streams into this country from abroad and provide a boost to the Exchequer.  Crucially, we also know that supporting tourism means supporting jobs.  There is huge potential for job creation considering how employment rich the tourism industry can be.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The Bill states that the moneys provided are to support enterprises and projects relating to the development of tourist traffic and tourist facilities and services.  I fully support the prioritisation of tourism in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">When this Government came into power, the reputation of this country on the international stage was at an all-time low.  Our international reputation would not have encouraged people to visit here, and the figures bear that out.  Tourism Ireland statistics for 2009 show that visitor numbers decreased by 12% and tourism revenue fell by 19%.  Despite that, however, I commend the work of the National Tourism Development Authority, or Fáilte Ireland as most people know it, in its efforts to boost tourism, particularly when tourist numbers here are reflective of the global economic downturn and falling trends in international tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Despite the reduction in the numbers of visitors to Ireland, recent CSO figures show that the numbers of Irish people travelling abroad are also decreasing.  Fáilte Ireland has rightly seen this as an opportunity to encourage Irish people to holiday at home and to develop the domestic tourism market.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Fáilte Ireland's tourism barometer for 2011 shows that the picture is already improving.  For example, 43% of Irish hotels, 41% of self-catering accommodation and 46% of golf clubs reported an increase in business this year compared to their figures for 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">This Government is working hard to ensure we can hold our heads high on the international stage again.  We must make Ireland an attractive place to visit once more.  The Government made a serious commitment to tourism from the outset with its €8.5 million initiative to support inbound tourism from key overseas markets.  The visa waiver scheme, for example, is an imaginative approach.  Its aim is to boost tourism.  The reduction in VAT in certain service industries was well received, bringing prices down in restaurants and hotels across the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">However, the Government can only do so much and each of us is beholden to be an ambassador for our country.  We cannot accept a rip-off culture.  Hotels and restaurants must offer good value and high standards of food and accommodation</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I hope you will forgive me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and give me one extra minute so I can extol the virtues and tourism potential of my area, Dún Laoghaire.  When I speak of the Dún Laoghaire area, I am talking about Blackrock, Killiney, Glasthule, Sandycove and Dalkey.  Yesterday, I attended a briefing on tourism in Dalkey and I was encouraged by the co-operation between Dublin Tourism and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Dún Laoghaire tourism received an unfortunate setback recently with Stena's announcement that it is to cancel the HSS winter service from Holyhead to Dún Laoghaire.  I am concerned that little attention has been paid to this issue.  I understand the route had become unviable for Stena, particularly in light of rising fuel prices.  However, the summer service must be retained so as to promote tourism in Dún Laoghaire.  Jobs are also threatened.  We must ensure that those jobs are retained so that we can have a summer service and bring tourists into Dún Laoghaire.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Local people are fighting to promote Dún Laoghaire themselves.  We know that, as a beautiful harbour town, it really has something unique to offer.  There is no point in our trying to compete for shoppers with the likes of Dundrum.  The aim is to reposition Dún Laoghaire as a marine and leisure tourist destination.  The plan for a diaspora centre is a clever one as it seeks to capitalise on the current public interest in genealogy.  As Dún Laoghaire looks to the future, it is important that we are cognisant of our past and our common heritage.  It is important, too, to remember the many people who left our shores in search of a better life.  Projects such as the planned diaspora centre serve as a reminder that, while times are hard at present, we must work together to build a better Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company, the local authority, the business association and the chamber of commerce have done commendable work.  We have restored the Metals project and put a new walkway over the DART line.  Our National Maritime Museum is undergoing refurbishment.  Dalkey Heritage Centre has ongoing events promoting the history and heritage of the area.  The Pavilion Theatre is renowned for the high standards of its dramatic and musical performances.  The recently launched Dún Laoghaire harbour masterplan has real potential for tourism, including a plan for the establishment of a diaspora centre.  Dún Laoghaire harbour wishes to reposition itself as a destination for cruise tourists from around the world and I believe this should be explored.  This summer saw numerous successful events and festivals in Dún Laoghaire which attracted international and domestic tourists in their thousands.  Examples include the Solitaire du Figaro yacht festival, the third biggest sporting event in France; the Dún Laoghaire Mountains to Sea Book Festival; the Red Bull flugtag, which brought more than 100,000 people into the town; and the first celebration of Bloomsday in Dún Laoghaire town.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">One concern, however, is how we can spread the success of such events to local traders and service providers.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">On a serious note, that kind of competition between areas is great.  We need more of it in order to bring out the best and the unique, wonderful diversity that Ireland has to offer.  That is our strongest selling point.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  We often say that a debate is important, but this one is important because tourism has stood the test of time and shown itself to be sustainable, and it is a growing industry that is reaping great rewards.  It is a clean industry and one with tangible results that spread far and wide.  It is not restricted by place or by people but can move and fluctuate around any part of the country.  I am delighted the Government has regarded tourism as important from day one.  There is great evidence of that in many of the measures we have taken to date, particularly the jobs initiative.  The specific, targeted initiatives directed at the tourism sector leave no one in any doubt about how much value the Government places on tourism.  I recognised how seriously the Government takes tourism and that it has placed it firmly at the top of its priorities when I learned of the appointment of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ring.  We do not have a harder working Minister or one with more energy — I say that in all seriousness — so I was thrilled to see Deputy Ring go into the Department.  I know the appointment is a measure of how seriously tourism is taken by the Taoiseach and the rest of the Administration.  I wish the Minister every success and hope his energy will be put to wonderful use in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">West Cork is a well-known and renowned tourist destination.  I suppose its beauty is in the place, the sights that it holds and the food, which has a strong reputation.  Without doubt, its people also represent a big attraction  That has been shown in a number of surveys by Fáilte Ireland.  When it asked visitors why they came to various parts of Ireland, the people came out at the top of the list of responses.  The friendliness and unique character of the people is our biggest attraction.  We must not lose sight of that.  The district of Clonakilty, which I represent, was recognised as the first European destination of excellence back in 2007.  We are very proud that it was the first destination in Ireland to be recognised by Europe.  A number of other destinations have been recognised since then.  I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of it but we just pipped Westport to take that coveted title.  I hope he will not hold that against us and that it will not limit our opportunities in future.  I am confident that Westport will have its day.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Notwithstanding the successes, we also have a number of challenges.  One of the biggest challenges we have identified in growing the tourism industry in west Cork to an even bigger level is the lack of infrastructure for rainy days.  As someone once said, this would be a beautiful country if we could only roof it, and that challenge continues in many areas.  In west Cork it is a constant challenge to provide indoor activities and entertainment, which are particularly important for the family-friendly holidays we need at a time when we are trying to attract more families.  We hope the budgetary process will allow for and facilitate an increase in the allocation of funding to the tourism authority, and we hope such an increase will come into play sooner rather than later.  I urge the Government to continue its efforts to grow the infrastructure that will support indoor attractions and amenities.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Price competitiveness is another area in which we have to work collectively, and we have taken steps towards that under the jobs initiative.  The industry is working hard and the hotel sector has been to the fore in cutting prices, but there are other areas where prices and competitiveness are still a challenge, such as little restaurants and cafes.  We also have the continual challenge of connectivity through our airports and getting people into the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I wish the Government every success and look forward to generous allocations to the tourism sector for the years ahead.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_371">I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to speak on the tourism industry.  Since being appointed as Minister of State in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Michael Ring has taken on his brief with passion and enthusiasm.  I thank him for taking such a special interest in County Clare.  He has visited us on a number of occasions since he became Minister.  To follow on from what Deputy Daly said, during the summer months, when I was on holiday in west Cork, I heard the Minister being interviewed on Matt Cooper's radio programme.  I want to put it on the record that the Minister played an absolute blinder in focusing on the positives of tourism in that interview.  I know Mayo and Westport are particularly close to his heart, but we should export him at every available opportunity to sell the positives about Ireland, because his enthusiasm is infectious and it would go a long way towards filling jumbo jets and ferries with people and bringing them to Ireland.  I congratulate him on the way in which he has begun his tenure in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Tourism is of vital importance to our economy.  In 2010, the total spend by overseas visitors and domestic tourists was estimated to be some €4.7 billion.  This year we have experienced a most notable and welcome increase in people travelling from Britain and North America.  Coupled with this encouraging news are the data relating to visitors travelling from European countries being up by over 17%.  This year in particular, Irish people bought into the concept of staying at home in Ireland for their holidays and in so doing gave a massive lift to the tourism industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">It is important to keep this momentum and build upon this growth.  The Bill before us today provides for that momentum to continue because it will enable the State to facilitate Fáilte Ireland continuing its programme of investment in capital expenditure on projects or enterprises.  As the fund has been reduced to just €20 million it is now necessary to bring forward this amending legislation to increase the cap.  I welcome the fact that agreement has been reached between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to establish a new legislative cap of €150 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The growth experienced in tourism was stimulated in part by the decision made in the jobs initiative to reduce from 13.5% to 9% the level of VAT that applies to labour intensive tourism services.  The halving of employer's PRSI for those on modest wages has given employers a real incentive to employ people in the tourism industry.  Over the coming months and up to the Olympics 2012 we will also see the benefit of the visa waiver programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The New Horizons tourism action plan identified in 2006 a concern that Ireland's tourism product had become somewhat tired and lacking in verve for many tourists.  This weakness is borne out by the fact that in the years up to 2009, the number of visitors to Ireland who thought the overall experience was either poor or very poor showed a significant increase.  The industry is obviously facing key challenges related to competitiveness, product renewal and innovation.  The future key to success must be value for money.  Having said this, tourism figures recently released covering the period to the end of July 2011 highlight the continued growth in overseas tourist numbers in comparison to 2010.  Overseas trips to Ireland increased by 9.4% to 1,948,800, with increases in visitors from mainland Europe, Britain and North America.  The largest percentage increase in tourist numbers, at 18% and 200,000 visitors, comes from the market designated as "other".  This indicates a lot of untapped potential around the world in markets and countries we may not have traditionally focused on when we sell Ireland as a destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I am delighted that this week in my own constituency of Clare, we had the announcement by Shannon Development that it is seeking tenders for the potential development of 120 acres adjoining Bunratty Folk Park and Castle along the lines of a theme park.  A project such as this could have a significant impact on the whole of the mid-west and western region.  The fact the lands are so close to Shannon Airport makes international accessibility easy.  It is a project that is tailor made for aspects of this Bill.  I would hope that this project will progress to the stage where Fáilte Ireland becomes involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">At a different level, but just as important in scale, we saw last week the establishment of a sea-plane service, based at Mountshannon on the shores of Lough Derg.  This is just the beginning of a service that is envisaged to link a beautiful part of east Clare with the rest of Ireland, the Aran Islands and indeed international destinations.  It is this type of thinking and initiative we should facilitate and I hope that with the provisions of this Bill we will be in a position to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I would also cite the potential regarding projects such as the provision of a pedestrian cable suspension bridge at Bishop's Island, which is located off the Loop Head peninsula just outside Kilkee in County Clare.  It is interesting to note that in this area of west Clare this summer the opening to the public of the Loop Head lighthouse has been an enormous success.  A combination of many small ideas can provide a most attractive package for a geographical area.  I would hope that this is borne in mind and that the headline projects do not take up all available funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I welcome the creation by this Government of the new Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There is an obvious link between transport and tourism which has been copperfastened with the establishment of this new Department.  I look forward to the synergy that will be created as a result of combining transport and tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Shannon Airport is the key driver of economic activity in County Clare, the mid-west and western regions.  In this regard, I welcome the invitation made by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to the boards of Shannon, Cork and Dublin Airports for their views on how they would see the airports operating independent from the DAA.  I have for a number of years advocated the path now being pursued by the Minister and have strongly suggested this approach in my discussions with him since the formation of the present Government.  The Minister is fully aware of the importance of Shannon Airport to balanced regional development.  The future of our airport is dependent on a proactive approach by Government and this initiative by the Minister clearly demonstrates that the indifference of the previous Administration in this, and so many other matters, is at an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">A new Shannon Airport, with a new dynamic, energised and committed board, will in a relatively short period of time demonstrate what can be achieved.  This board must be policy driven, with a policy which is anchored on a commitment to having a viable airport serving the needs of the region.  To meet those diverse needs we should not necessarily reject state ownership.  Any narrow vision that might suggest that Shannon is just an airport serving the narrow needs of an airport community must be rejected.  The new Shannon Airport must integrate and interface with the various interests in the region who depend on the airport for their success and survival.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Those interests include those involved in the industry, tourism, education and balanced regional development.  I look forward to further engagement with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on this issue.  Put bluntly, it has been clear now for some time that the current structure has failed our airport.  There is an opportunity now for a new and invigorating initiative for our airport which can benefit the region as a whole and  bring significant national benefits and we must not let this opportunity pass.</p>

          <p eId="para_383">I also salute the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, for his enthusiasm.  He is very passionate about his job.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The Tourism Research Forum is currently meeting in the Gibson Hotel.  There is quite a line up of speakers, including some from the IT colleges, an important area in this sector.  The courses they run in conjunction with Fáilte Ireland are vital and I hope those courses will not be diminished in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">We would all love to be a tourist on a day like today, with the lovely sunshine.  We must look at Ireland as a holiday destination for those coming from abroad and for Irish people; that is what the tourism industry is about.  Those holidays are also a source of jobs and tourism generates a great deal of revenue.  On Private Members' business this week, the Technical Group tabled a motion on jobs and the devastating effect job losses have been having on people and we all accept employment is central to economic growth.  Some of us are extremely disappointed the State is still investing funds to honour the gambling debts of unguaranteed bondholders instead of investing the money in a job stimulus programme.  I noted the Tánaiste's remarks today, however, about announcements that will be made in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Tourism provides significant employment although it is difficult to get accurate figures for this.  The Central Statistics Office gives the numbers directly employed in the hotels, restaurants, bars and catering while Fáilte Ireland's figures include those working in other aspects of tourism and the hospitality industry.  Some of them are part-time, some full-time and some of the work is seasonal.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">This Bill seeks to increase the level of funding that can be provided for Fáilte Ireland for capital expenditure projects.  The report by Fáilte Ireland, "Tourism Product Development Strategy", stated that less support should be provided for accommodation, with more investment in tourism infrastructure.  We can agree that we do not need any more hotels.  Many hotels have been proactive in providing value in the breaks and programmes they are offering, a welcome relief from the astronomical prices some were charging during the economic boom.  We need to make the same point about our restaurants, which charged ferocious prices in the Celtic tiger times when we were not getting value for money.  Those prices did a disservice to our food industry and our great array of products, including meat, cheeses, breads, jams and honeys.  The IFA's recent invitation to Oireachtas Members to sample a display of food and wares demonstrated that.  The RDS Christmas craft fair also has fantastic arrays of Irish foods and other produce.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">There is a strong rationale for continued investment in the tourism sector.  Apart from the employment aspect, it generates taxes for the Exchequer and attracts foreign and domestic revenue.  A downside of the Celtic tiger was the extent of foreign holidays and shopping trips which certain sectors of Irish society enjoyed.  We saw a decline in tourist visits here, both by Irish people and foreigners.  We did not provide value for money, with a consequent drop in revenue.  I was disappointed to see this reflected in a survey of visitors who were asked to consider their Irish tourism experience.  Very good or good value ratings fell from 62% in 2000 to 28% in 2009.  The number of visitors who rated their experience as poor or very poor increased from 12% to 40% in the same period.  The survey covered the cost of eating out, drinking and the general cost of living.  We have had a number of reports, and it is time to move on from them and take action.  Tourism numbers peaked at 7.7 million in 2007 but declined to 5.8 million last year.  I hope these figures are now on a upward trend.  Taxation revenue from tourism in 2009 was €1.3 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I was fortunate in having parents who felt it was important to see one's own country first.  We travelled the length and breadth of Ireland and became aware of what our country has to offer.  We have the most amazing natural scenery — coastlines, mountains, cliffs, lakes and rivers — in all 32 counties.  Our islands were neglected at various stages.  I am struck by how the Blasket islanders were treated.  Someone who lived there remarked to me that if a fraction of the money spent on the Blasket interpretative centre, fine as it is, had been available in the 1950s, the islanders might never have had to leave their homes.  There was also a Government attempt to move people off Tory Island.  Islands are a tourist attraction.  We see people visiting them, creating revenue for them and seeing what they have to offer.  The same is true of Gaeltacht areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">We have historical tourist attractions such as Newgrange, which is older than the pyramids, the Céide Fields, Dún Aengus, An Grianán, Gallurus, Sceilg Mhíchíl and Clonmacnoise.  Our historical tourism is extremely valuable and popular with visitors to our cities, particularly Dublin.  We have wonderful museums just outside the door of Leinster House.  The Hugh Lane Gallery and Trinity College are very near to Leinster House.  Dublin has beautiful Georgian squares, and there are two on the north side of the city.  I sometimes think politicians from abroad spend all their time on the south side of the Liffey.  There are many opportunities to travel to the north side.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">It is strange to think there were once plans to knock down Kilmainham Jail.  I appeal for the appropriate restoration of the area surrounding the GPO, Moore Street, Moore Lane and Parnell Street, which is associated with the Easter Rising.  Last week, I stood in the house in Moore Street where the leaders of the rising discussed the surrender.  It was moving to be there but appalling to see the neglect of the building.  Other restorations have been done very well.  I note the restoration of Killarney House and I do not begrudge the millions of euro spent on it.  However, I hope the locations associated with the Easter Rising will get the same attention.  I compliment the guides in historical sites.  Their training and personalities are wonderful.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Our literature has brought in cultural tourists.  They follow in the steps of Patrick Kavanagh along the Grand Canal, Oscar Wilde,  Seán O'Casey or James Joyce.  Dublin City Libraries are currently running a terrific series of events in a variety of venues in Dublin commemorating great writing.  The Four Courts will be the venue for an event called Scales of Justice, which will involve our modern crime writers such as Declan Hughes and Stuart Neville.  I should also mention our theatres.  The Dublin Fringe Festival, which is a great outlet for new talent, has just finished and the Dublin Theatre Festival is beginning.  These promote Ireland as a tourist destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Every part of Ireland has done its best in organising local festivals.  On the north side of Dublin we have the Five Lamps Arts Festival and Phizzfest.  In my own area of East Wall our forthcoming history week will commemorate Seán O'Casey who lived in East Wall and North Wall.  In central Dublin many communities are planning their Hallowe'en festivals.  I am conscious of how much we have to offer.  The Irish Film Board and the Arts Council have all contributed.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Sport is also important.  The Minister of State attended this year's Dublin Horse Show, which had a prize fund of almost €1 million.  Golf, horse-racing, surfing championships in Donegal, the Rose of Tralee Festival and the Eurovision Song Contest all showcase Ireland and do wonders for ourselves as well as for the tourist industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">A festival will be held in Cork this weekend called, Folk the Recession.  Great Irish artists will play there.  Our music is another major selling point.  Other selling points include the range of accommodation we have, from luxury hotels to caravans, self-catering accommodation, farmhouses and our famous bed and breakfast establishments.  Our weather is also a selling point.  People do not come here for the sun.  I recently met someone from one of the gulf states.  He told me that when the temperature reaches the forties and fifties in those countries, all middle and upper income people leave for Europe.  Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland could be proactive in those states.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Our transport system has improved immensely.  The coach system is excellent, although our rail system can be expensive, depending on where one is going.  Another selling point is our lack of distance.  We are never too far from anything.  In the United States, for example, one has a sense that each state has a different feeling.  One can come to Ireland and get a sense of the whole country.  We are making progress in providing facilities for people with disabilities but we cannot lose sight of this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Our current pub culture comes in for much negative criticism but our traditional pubs were places of meeting and conversation.  They were not the super-pubs which are associated with binge drinking or with stag parties and hen parties, which do not give a positive impression of Ireland.  Our biggest selling point is our people and the way we engage with visitors.  Our people will get us out of the recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I am glad to have had the opportunity to give a whistlestop tour of what Ireland means to me, as a person who holidays in Ireland, and of its attractions to other people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonHarris" eId="spk_233">
          <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
          <p eId="para_399">With the agreement of the House I will share time with Deputies Spring, Lyons and McNamara.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on Second Stage of the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2011.  While there has been much emphasis on the technical nature of the Bill, this should not undermine its purpose.  Technical changes can be very important in bringing about improvements to the services we provide for our people.  The Bill endeavours to bring about the next step in ensuring that every tool and instrument available to the State is fully utilised and harnessed.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the Government on their approach in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Since the Government took office in February it has put a number of measures in place to help domestic tourism.  Many of them have been alluded to by my colleagues.  The jobs initiative was important and the visits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama gave us an opportunity to showcase the many talents of the country and the warm welcome we can afford to international visitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The Olympic Games are to be hosted in London in 2012.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has had great success in terms of changes to visa regulations to allow people coming to the Olympics from afar to visit Ireland for a short period.  Such visitors might not take that opportunity if they were not in a neighbouring country for the Olympic Games.  The Department was also successful in getting the Olympic torch to visit this soil.  Many people would have said these things simply would not happen but the Department has delivered.  I commend the Minister for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The measures taken by the Office of Public Works to open various sites in each of our counties is a welcome development.  Allowing free admission into these sites is an incentive not alone to foreign tourists but domestic tourists such as families who wish to experience more of our country but may be prohibited from doing so owing to cost.  I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The nub of the issue — Deputy Joe Carey referred to this in passing earlier — is that this Government on taking office decided to take tourism seriously and has brought together different strands of Departments to create a real economic Department.  The new Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is responsible for all that we need to get this country back to work and to increase tourism numbers.  The results to date have been positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The former Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism was viewed and ridiculed by the media as the Department of fun.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has brought together all the necessary strands in the new Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Infrastructure, the sporting talents of this country and our ability to market that on the international stage have been brought together under one Department, which is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Fáilte Ireland recently upped its game, which I welcome.  I represent County Wicklow.  While many speakers were competing earlier about whose county is the best to visit, Wicklow is aptly, fondly and deservedly known as the garden of Ireland and as such wins that competition.  Up to recently Fáilte Ireland referred to Wicklow and other counties as being on the doorstep of Dublin.  That was the strategy for Wicklow.  People who came to Dublin on their holidays were encouraged to pop down the road to Wicklow for the day and to return then to Dublin to eat in its restaurants and stay in its hotels.  There was a real need for Fáilte Ireland to diversify and to ensure that the unique selling point of every county and region was put to work.  I am delighted with Fáilte Ireland's new Kildare-Wicklow strategy which recognises that counties within commuter distance of Dublin have a distinct identity and should be marketed in that way.  That is a positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has specific responsibility for sport.  We must put our sporting talents and achievements to work.  Following Ireland's spate of golf wins, Ryanair ran an interesting advertisement in the British media which stated "Come to Ireland Home of Golf".  It also used the term "Come to Ireland Home of Cricket" on another occasion.  We must market our country as a place for people with an interest in sport to visit.  We should go further and look to some of our internationally known sports stars to front tourism campaigns and to be the face of extending an invitation to visit Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">As I see it, the big problem for tourism at local level is a lack of co-ordination.  I was previously a member of Wicklow Town Council, Wicklow County Council, the board of directors of Wicklow Tourism and the Greystones Town Council tourism committee, all of which, including the chamber of commerce, had a view on tourism.  We need to pull all of these agencies together.  When no one in particular is in charge, things fall through the cracks.  I believe we should also put our embassies to work.  The Tánaiste must ensure our embassies market Ireland not alone as a trade destination, but as a country for people to visit.  Our embassies and ambassadors abroad, which cost us a significant amount, must be utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Culture night, held on 23 September, was a huge success in Dublin and countrywide.  Leinster House was open so that people could visit this Chamber.  In London, one can visit Westminster to see the workings of Parliament and learn about the history of the building.  A person wishing to visit Leinster House must be sponsored by a Member of the Oireachtas.  We need to address that.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I welcome the legislation and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, for introducing it.  I also look forward to continued good work on the tourism side.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurSpring" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Spring</from>
          <p eId="para_411">I commend Deputy O'Sullivan, who as a non-government Member, spoke so favourably on this issue.  It is not often one hears that on this side of the House.  I thank the Deputy for her contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">This is essentially a housekeeping exercise which gives us an opportunity also to acknowledge what tourism means.  Tourism, energy, agribusiness and micro-enterprise, TEAM, are the four pillars for the recovery of large chunks of this country.  I agree with the proposal to increase the cap on capital expenditure.  However, I do not believe it is the solution.  We have the raw product which we must market to the essential areas.  For example, Kerry Airport, which is being supported by the country, is a net contributor to the Exchequer and is vital to the promotion of tourism, yet there are 34.5 million people living within one hour's drive of airports which operate flights into Kerry Airport.  We need a strategic marketing element that attracts people here.  We have the product on many fronts.  For instance, we have what is considered the activity based tourism mecca of Europe, namely, hill walking.  It is the largest tourist activity in Europe.  We have an abundance of hill walking sites but we need to invest a little capital to bring them up to the standard of hill walking sites in Austria, Sweden and other developed areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Tourism is now the largest industry in the world.  For us to not compete and develop our product would be ridiculous at this point.  The national agencies have dialled up and are doing a better job, but they are doing it in isolation.  Trades, including hotels, restaurants and pubs, all have problems which are often regional.  I travel to meetings on tourism up and down the south west and I have been told by a group formed in the area that the agencies are not identifying what the Minister of State terms "honey pots" or working with the airlines to attract people to the region.  I met with Mr. Michael O'Leary and Mr. Padraig O'Ceidigh and asked them if they would work with us to bring people to the area.  We have developed what is termed the "Go Kerry" initiative which seeks to brand Kerry as an identity in places such as Manchester to which flights into and from Kerry Airport operate.  There are 8 million people living in the greater Manchester area.  While one can play on the diaspora, one must also play on the product.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The "Rose of Tralee" gets massive national television coverage.  The Rose of Tralee ball in Toronto, which is attended by up to 600 people, is a platform from which we can launch our country and product.  Our hill walking, golfing and fishing facilities need to be developed.  Fishing is the second largest activity in the US.  There are more people in the UK fishing on a Saturday afternoon than there are watching premiership soccer.  With a little energy, we could harness these activities.  We must work with the small agencies and groups and provide those which prove themselves credible with some financial support.  I am currently working on a concept with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, in relation to how to develop the skill set of those selling Ireland.  It is not always about capital investment; it is about developing our product, which is to be applauded.  Our product must be renewed and refreshed.  This legislation is a positive step.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">We must strive to do things better.  Ireland is the land of "cead míle fáilte".  As such, we should be spending money on marketing and training.  Everyone has a part to play.  While today we are acknowledging that in this forum, it also needs to be said across the airwaves.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, on the job he is doing in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcNamara" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara</from>
          <p eId="para_416">Like previous speakers, I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, who, as Deputy Joe Carey said, has been in Clare numerous times.  I thank him for his commitment to Clare and for furthering sport and tourism there.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">As stated by previous speakers, this is essentially a technical Bill to increase the funding cap for spending on capital tourism projects and enterprises from €65 million to €150 million.  This increase was identified as necessary in a relatively recent report by the tourism action plan implementation group.  It was stated in that report that Ireland's tourism product had become tired and was lacking in verve or bounce for many tourists.  I am glad that a number of initiatives have been taken since publication of that report, including in my constituency of Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Those in the tourism industry are increasingly realising the need to deliver greater value for money, which is beginning to happen.  There is a need, however, to develop more innovative tourism products too.  My home town, Scarriff, will have its first walking festival in October.  There are few places on these islands more suited to walking than Scarriff as it is surrounded by Slieve Aughty and Slieve Bernagh, both of which overlook Lough Derg.  Most of these lands are in Coillte plantations.  While not enough is being done by Coillte, at least the local community through this festival will do what it can to develop a walking tourism infrastructure in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Like Deputy Carey, I commend the Shannon Development proposal to develop an adventure park near Shannon Airport and Bunratty Castle.  However, I have more reservations about this project than Deputy Carey.  The way it is being dealt with only highlights the current weaknesses of the development structures in the mid-west.  Shannon Development must put this project out to tender.  While the agency has been involved in many innovative projects in the past, it has no real funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">While Fáilte Ireland receives funding to promote tourism across the country, it is not specifically tasked with developing tourism in the mid-west.  Shannon Development, on the other hand, the body tasked with promoting tourism in the region, does not have the cash to do so.  The agency has some excellent people with some excellent development plans but it has no money to put them into practice.  Now is not a time when we can afford institutional battles between various agencies.  We need a solution that works for Clare, north Tipperary and Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The post office network could also be used to develop our tourism infrastructure.  Every village has a post office in which it may be possible to provide interactive tourism information services.  For example, a basic touch-screen information point could be provided in each post office which would allow tourists to access specific local information.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Deputy Harris referred to the link between sport and tourism.  My region, along with many others, would like to tap into the tourism potential of the upcoming London Olympics.  Tourists, and even sportspeople, could visit Ireland during or in preparation for the Olympics.  Limerick university has excellent sporting facilities at which athletes could prepare for the Olympics.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Seaside towns in Clare, such as Kilkee and Lahinch, depend very much on tourism.  However, it has been suggested their swimming pools, important tourism attractions, may be closed due to lack of funding.  I appreciate funding is tight.  While the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport has secured funding for the swimming pool in Shannon, will the Minister consider extending it to Lahinch and Kilkee?  Both swimming pools are important parts of the tourism, as well as the sports, infrastructure of those towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">As we consider the sale of a minority shareholding in the ESB, it must be remembered the Shannon and all its tributary rivers and lakes are vested in the company.  Angling has much tourism potential.  However, local angling clubs around Lough Derg had to take the ESB to the steps of the High Court to force it to maintain those fisheries.  While it is now maintaining them, there is huge scope for angling-based tourism in the mid west and throughout the country.  With this legislation raising the cap on spending on tourism infrastructure a little, one area that would provide a return to the Exchequer on its investment is fishing.  Some approach with the ESB to tap into the tourism potential of the Shannon fisheries must be worked out.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">I welcome the publication of this technical Bill to increase the level of funding to be provided to the National Tourism Development Authority for capital expenditure projects.  Increasing the funding cap to €150 million will enable the authority to develop and enhance our tourism product.  I commend the Minister for bringing it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Tourism is a key priority for the Government, demonstrated already by such measures as the reduction in VAT, halving employers' PRSI and the introduction of the tourism visa waiver.  The €3 travel tax is still in a position to be suspended if the airlines reinstate cancelled routes and restore lost capacity.  While it is still in place, much of the revenue generated is being used to support inbound tourism.  Tourism is vital to our economy, not only through the jobs it provides but also as an opportunity to showcase the country on the international stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Tourism is a competitive market with our keenest competitors investing heavily in their tourism infrastructure.  Fáilte Ireland has identified that Scotland spends up to €74 million annually in public funds while Norway spends €43 million.  Some countries are taking the approach to invest in innovative tourism products such as the Guggenheim in Spain and the Eden project in England.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I have visited the latter myself which is an example of how an exhausted chalk mine in Cornwall, no longer providing mining employment, became an exciting, sustainable visitor site, creating a new and welcome type of employment.  The project is funded by various means, including significant public funding and philanthropy, and is now attracting tourists from all over the world to visit the park's biomes, attend concerts and art exhibitions and learn more about sustainability and low-impact living.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">In County Offaly, we have a wonderful example of how a harvested bog can be transformed into something new and exciting.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, will have an opportunity soon to visit the Lough Boora parkland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_239" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">

        <speech by="#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_433">Bord na Móna has worked in partnership with the local authority and other agencies to provide the Lough Boora parkland which includes lakes for fishing, trails for walking and cycling through the bog and a sculpture park which attracts international artists.  Artists come into the community and, with local help, create something thought provoking and in keeping with the landscape.  It is a haven for wildlife and is used by locals and visitors alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Like the Eden project, the Lough Boora parkland takes a site with a previous use to develop it into a different and new tourism product.  I welcome Bord na Móna's plans to expand and develop this exciting project.  Other examples in Offaly of using such sites could include using disused railway lines as walking and cycling tracks and developing and enhancing walks in the Slieve Bloom mountains, ideas which should be examined by our tourism bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Our key markets are Britain, the United States, France and Germany.  This year's figures show that the number of visitors from Britain has increased by 9.3% compared with last year's.  We should ask ourselves why people visit Ireland instead of other countries.  Research has shown that our scenery, friendly people, safe environment and cultural and historical attractions are the main reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">We have many wonderful products and attractions, but the potential of the garden visitor has not been realised.  Many beautiful gardens across the country, both large and small, have been developed over the years.  They are an attraction for specific tourists, but they have not been sufficiently marketed.  For example, 500,000 people visited the Botanic Gardens last year.  Surely this would be an outstanding location to access further information about other gardens around the country that can be visited by members of the public.  In my region, we have the internationally renowned Birr Castle and gardens in County Offaly and Heywood Gardens in County Laois.  The visitors to Birr Castle and gardens contribute €250,000 annually to the local economy in bed nights and other spend.  This is not to be sniffed at in a small area and should be encouraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Were a visitor interested in gardens, how would I learn where to access these attractions?  We are losing opportunities to highlight the presence of these wonderful attractions at international shows such as the Chelsea Flower Show and the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show in England.  Demographically speaking, visitors to these types of show are those who can stay, spend large amounts and visit during the off season.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Counties Laois and Offaly have a rich ecclesiastical history with ancient sites at Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Seir Kieran, Aghaboe Abbey, the Rock of Dunamaise and the round tower at Timahoe.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to Durrow Abbey near Tullamore, which is undergoing restoration and conservation work.  The high cross is located within the abbey, but there is a difficulty with providing safe access to the site.  I understand that Fáilte Ireland has a strategy to develop hard tourism products.  County Offaly has such a project in Durrow Abbey, but the problem arises in that it is only allowed to spend its funding on specific types of project.  We need flexibility in the provision of funding to develop this product.  Cross-departmental co-operation with national bodies and local authorities would help to solve these road blocks and ensure that, in these financially straitened times, we make good use of scarce funding and think outside the box as we continue to develop tourism projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">People visit Ireland for a variety of reasons, including our arts and theatre.  The amount of employment and enjoyment that can be gleaned from participating in these is good for Ireland and visitors.  The number of people who visit Ireland after seeing images of Ireland on the big screen, put there by film companies working here, is also interesting.  We should not underestimate the potential of attracting visitors to locations where films have been shot.  We should develop trails around areas where beautiful images of our countryside and cities have been shot.  People could have an opportunity to see them in an organised and simple way.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I have probably run out of time, but I would like to discuss other matters such as fishing and tourism officers in each county to support festivals.  We need to focus on tourism, given how much we have to offer.  Other countries would love to have what we have.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_441">Previous speakers have done their bit to promote tourism in their regions.  It was a pity there were not more people present to hear them.  I have heard great things about County Kerry, even from my two colleagues from County Clare.  I must add my bit.  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy did her bit for County Offaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, who has travelled throughout Ireland promoting tourism.  He has been an excellent ambassador for domestic tourism.  I do not know whether it is because he is in office, but the figures for the first seven months of the year look good.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Tourism is important to our economy, particularly in the middle of this recession.  The industry generates approximately €4.8 billion in business, amounting to some 5.5% of GDP.  Between full-time, part-time and seasonal employment, it employs the equivalent of 145,000 full-time jobs or one in 12 people at work at the moment.  This is an important factor.  The recent CSO figures on the number of overseas visitors are encouraging.  This is despite the fact that we have had some bad weather.  Today is beautiful and many tourists are around Dublin.  The ash crisis was a factor early last year, but we have done well, in particular in the US, UK and European markets.  There is no room for complacency and we have a great deal of work to do to increase numbers next year but we are moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">On a positive note, the Government has introduced many initiatives prioritising tourism as a key area for growth.  Consequently, there is a renewed optimism in the sector.  The reduction in VAT levels to 9%, the halving of employers' PRSI and the introduction of the tourist visa waiver for those from certain countries who have valid UK visas and want to travel on to Ireland are all having an impact on the ground.  From travelling around the country, this is evident.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">During the summer months, many tourism providers with whom I spoke painted a positive picture of tourism this year.  While the weather has been uncertain, people do not visit Ireland for our weather.  Rather, they come to Ireland for its beauty.  More than 36 million people in the US, some 11% of its population, claim Irish ancestry and most American tourists visit us to find their heritage.  I was in the US last week and was delighted to hear that the Tánaiste, who was also in the US, had presented the first certificate of heritage to Joe Hunter's mother.  Our consul general, Mr. Noel Kilkenny, attended the event and told me it made him a proud Irishman.  Mr. Hunter's mother came from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency in County Galway.  A member of the fire service, Mr. Hunter was killed on 11 September 2001.  The presentation in New York was a moving ceremony.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">This initiative is already proving a considerable success with the Irish diaspora all over the world.  It is the brain child of Mr. Gerry O'Neill, a native of Dublin living in Quin.  A good initiative, it was well supported in the US last week.  The many Americans who visit Ireland to explore their Irish heritage can generate a significant level of revenue for our tourism industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">To be parochial, Councillor Gabriel Keating drove a new initiative in County Clare this year, namely, opening up the Loop Head lighthouse, a 19th century building.  Initiated on a trial basis, more than 12,000 people have already visited the lighthouse and climbed the 74 steps to see the breathtaking views of the west Clare Peninsula.  The initiative has been a considerable success and has been extended until October.  Clare County Council, possibly working with the Minister of State, is already working on expanding the project next year.  It created five temporary jobs and was a boost to local restaurants, pubs and bed and breakfasts.  The Cuban ambassador will visit the lighthouse this weekend when she opens the Che Guevara festival in Kilkee.  The lighthouse has also been visited by a number of Chinese visitors.  The Minister of State might want to know that the Taoiseach has a family link to the lighthouse, in that his grandfather, Mr. Joseph McGinley, served as a keeper there in the 1930s.  I look forward to the Taoiseach visiting this area in the very near future and I hope he gets the opportunity to see the lighthouse.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Others Members referred to festivals and events supported by Fáilte Ireland.  The Government is providing approximately €3.8 million in this regard, which is great for every county.  Festivals are becoming very popular again.  County Clare hosted the FAI Festival of Football this year and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, attended.  There were festivities for a week.  The FAI visits the county and concentrates on youth and children.  It was a great spectacle for the region and I congratulate Mr. John Delaney on it.  The event created a great buzz in the county for the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Some of my colleagues referred to Shannon Development having sought expressions of interest to develop the 120-acre site at Bunratty Castle.  It will be a very good project.  One must reinvent tourism all the time.  Tourism and projects get tired.  One must cater for the current market.  The Bunratty project was great but needs to be reinvented.  The medieval banquets are still doing extremely well.  I hope Fáilte Ireland takes a particular interest in Shannon Development's 120-acre site because many projects could be developed there, including a diaspora centre, a theme park and, given the close proximity to Shannon Airport, an aviation theme park.  I hope funding can be found for this.  Deputy McNamara stated Shannon Development does not have funding but I am sure that, with the initiative of Fáilte Ireland, funding could be found because the project is very exciting.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">We are very fortunate that the Burren and Cliffs of Moher were awarded UNESCO-supported Global Geoparks status at the tenth European Geoparks conference, which took place recently in Norway.  This was a great boost for the Burren, which is very important to tourism in County Clare.  A total of 345,000 visitors have enjoyed the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience in the first six months of this year, representing a 19% increase on last year's figure.   Tourism is the icing of the cake for north Clare.  If the Cliffs of Moher are named as one of the seven wonders of the world on 11 November, what a bonus it will be.  I urge everybody to propose the cliffs for nomination so as to put them on the map.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Inbound access to the regions is critical.  We are lucky to have Shannon Airport in County Clare.  It is a pity the airlines did not respond to the proposals of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in the budget last year in regard to the air travel tax.  As part of the jobs initiative, this tax was reduced from €10 to €3 and the plan was to suspend the tax altogether provided an agreement was reached with airlines to reinstate cancelled routes or restore capacity.  However, to date, the airlines have not taken up the offer.  I am disappointed in that.  Approximately €8.5 million is being collected from the €3 travel tax and I very much welcome the innovative way in which this fund is being used for marketing.  Tourism Ireland, the airlines, ferry companies, tour operators and airports are now working together to encourage tourists from the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, France and Belgium to come here.  It is very important to concentrate on mainland Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I read recently that Ryanair has teamed up with Fáilte Ireland, given Ireland's popularity as a golfing destination, to provide a "golf bags fly free" offer on flights from UK airports to the six Irish airports from 1 September to 7 November.  This is very encouraging also.  I flew in from New York last Friday morning and when I was waiting for my case to arrive at the baggage carousel, I could not but notice all the golf bags.  I spoke to some staff and they told me Americans are very attracted to playing golf in Ireland in September.  This is very encouraging because we have beautiful golf courses in every county.  Last weekend, Ireland hosted the Solheim Cup at Killeen Castle.  Doonbeg and Lahinch golf courses in County Clare are worthy of mention, although I do not want to mention them all.  They all have added attractions for tourists.  It is encouraging to hear the airlines are teaming up with tourism authorities.  Aer Lingus will probably expand its scheme in the near future, providing a much-needed boost for Shannon Airport, and complement the efforts being made locally to extend the tourism season.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">We have been examining the opportunities for the Olympics tourism spin-off.  I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, is chairman of the London 2012 co-ordinating committee.  Efforts are being made with a number of countries to get some teams to stay in them, at least for some time before the Olympics.  That is important.  Access is extremely important.  County Clare can be accessed from London and the United States.  I suggest that Fáilte Ireland meet various airlines to determine whether we could extend the promotional scheme to encourage Olympics tourists to travel here after the games.  This is important also.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">There is much discussion in the media about the future of Shannon Airport.  I do not have enough time to deal with it this afternoon; suffice it to say that from my discussions with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, I noted no discussions have been had on the future of the airport.  It is extremely important to point that out.  The Minister is evaluating proposals that he has received from various stakeholders as to the best way forward for the airport.  This is extremely important.  Shannon Airport has a strong history of innovation.  Under Dr. Brendan O'Regan, the airport developed the first duty-free shop, and the first Irish coffee was invented there.  There is much history associated with the airport.  It has a big future if the correct initiatives are put in place.  I hope the Minister listens to the views of the people in the area, takes them on board and works with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Balanced regional development must be strengthened as it is extremely important.  The purpose of this Bill is to allow for the funding of tourism product development, as set out in the annual estimates provided by Fáilte Ireland.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Harrington</from>
          <p eId="para_458">I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  I am very pleased the Fine Gael-led Government has decided to increase investment in the vital tourism sector, including in my constituency, Cork South-West.  As mentioned, the primary focus of the Bill is the increase in funding to Fáilte Ireland from €65 million to €150 million.  It is not just the increase in funding that makes this Bill significant.  It and the fiscal measures introduced recently by the Government send out a strong declaration that the Government intends to focus on the tourism sector to provide much-needed employment, not just in areas such as Dublin but also throughout the regions.  Dublin has led the charge in terms of tourism revenue, particularly that generated by tourists from abroad.  However, the reality is that regions such as Cork South-West have been very strong on local tourism.  People from the east and Dublin always look to the west, south and north when going on holiday.  The sources of revenue in this regard are very much spread evenly throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The tourism project is a multi-agency effort.  Nobody expects the Minister to be at every airport greeting every passenger, for example.  That is not how it works.  However, his enthusiasm and passion for the sector have been infectious and should drive the multi-strand numerous agencies involved in tourism to up their effort and identify the advantages to the economy offered by tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Every Deputy has mentioned tourism issues in his or her constituency and I would like to focus on those which deserve attention in my area.  One such issue is access, as without access there is no tourism sector.  I acknowledge the efforts of West Cork Tourism to replace the Cork to Swansea ferry service.  This was kick-started by raising €3 million locally through pledges from 300 shareholders in the tourism and other sectors.  This type of very local effort can provide a national infrastructure to help our economy.  The West Cork Tourism co-operative and those who supported it, the Department and the Government deserve to be mentioned in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">A great example of a multi-agency approach to improve our tourism sector is the re-opening of the Mizen Head bridge which is a huge engineering feat completed with co-operation between Cork County Council, the Commissioners of Irish Lights and Fáilte Ireland.  It is up for an Engineers Ireland award and I ask everybody to look at <i>www.engineersireland.ie</i> to see what has been done and when convinced that it is worth voting for, to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The western division of Cork County Council has developed a marine leisure strategy which can be replicated throughout the country.  Marine leisure is an underutilised resource through which we can attract a huge amount of revenue.  With regard to military history tourism, one can follow a military archaeological and history trail west from Spike Island to Bere Island.  The tourism season for this can last 12 months a year as there is genuine interest in countries such as the UK in this sector.  We have overlooked it and it has huge potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Our waymarked ways and hill walking have been mentioned.  Not only do they encourage tourism but they encourage locals and actively promote better health.  The benefits of every euro spent on these is immeasurable not only to the visitors, but to locals.  Waymarked ways such as the Beara Way walk, the Sheep's Head Way walk and the Beara Breffni walk which goes throughout the country are pioneers in this regard.  It is good to see that landowners are being acknowledged; they do not receive great money but it is acknowledged that they have opened up their land-holdings to visitors.  In places such as west Cork, we can truly state the land is open and available and that people who wish to walk the hills and waymarked ways are quite welcome to do so.  This is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The arts and literature sectors are very important in areas such as west Cork, in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's county and in the Minister of State's county.  These sectors deserve great support and quite often they are overlooked in the mainstream.  However, they add a great amount to our tourism revenues and play a very important part in the social life of these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The tourism sector plays at various levels from the big stakes of large lucrative developments to complementing farming or fishing in smaller regional areas, whereby people can earn a little from the tourism sector and supplement their on-farm income.  This cannot be overestimated.  It is very important to maintain this through a multi-agency approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">We must maintain communication with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and local authorities on improving infrastructure and signage.  Locals know the shortest route from point A to point B.  When developing signage, we must assume it is for a visitor.  We must encourage better signage in association with local authorities to make it far more attractive to travel the highways.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Fáilte Ireland has moved away from supporting small-scale projects and towards larger projects such as the Volvo Ocean Race in Galway.  These larger projects are very lucrative and this is how it should go, but it should not forget the festivals in small villages and towns.  The Minister of State has a great role to play in this, not through direct funding but through the passion he has for developing these, particularly in areas which have historically had high emigration.  Many who emigrate look for an excuse to return for a week or two and these festivals will bring them back.  They will know they will meet people whom they met the year before or whom they have not met for 20 years.  While these festivals are small-scale and may not appear in Fáilte Ireland's horizon, they are very important for regional areas in my constituency and those of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The television programme "Who Do You Think You Are" has highlighted genealogical tourism, which could attract much investment and interest and this could be drawn on over 12 months of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I compliment the work done by the Minister of State to date.  His passion is without question and it has genuinely helped shape and increase the country's tourism sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_470">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  This is the first time I have spoken on tourism as a Member of the House and I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, the very best in his role.  He is doing a very good job.  I also wish the very best to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  As previous speakers mentioned, the tourism industry is vital to our economic recovery.  The initiatives taken by the Government since coming to office have highlighted that the Cabinet realises the potential for development in this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I agree with a number of the points made by Deputy Harrington, particularly with regard to genealogical tourism.  Prior to coming to the Chamber I was watching the debate on the monitor in my office.  My intern is from New England and like many from that part of the world, from throughout the United States and from further afield she has roots in this country.  She does not know where exactly these roots are, but she is determined to find out from where her ancestors left.  There is great potential in this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I also agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Harrington's comments on signage and I very much want to bring this to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Ring.  One of the few legacies of the Celtic tiger is very good road infrastructure throughout the country, with motorways from Dublin to all of the cities and other parts of the country.  However, in my part of the world significant difficulties exist with the NRA with regard to providing signage for some tourist facilities in the Waterford, Kilkenny and Carlow areas.  The NRA has rules, which are necessary as I agree one cannot have an over-proliferation of signage on the new motorways, but some leeway should be given for people investing money in providing tourism products in regional rural Ireland, such as the part of the world from which the Minister of State comes.  These areas are bypassed by the motorways but their facilities cannot in any way be acknowledged in the signage that exists on the motorways.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I am a firm supporter of the efforts of Mount Juliet to attract international golfing events to Ireland.  I have never golfed myself but I believe the potential of the industry is great and Mount Juliet is a fantastic facility.  It is allowed to have a sign on the new motorway to Waterford but other golf courses are not, and I know of one which like Mount Juliet is a private venture.  A little inequality seems to exist with regard to who is allowed signage and who is not.  Will the Minister of State work with the National Roads Authority and the tourism authorities to ensure more reasonable rules are put in place with regard to who can get signage on these routes?  I represent Carlow and Kilkenny which have always had a strong tourism industry.  I commend the Government on its efforts with the jobs initiative in particular which was aimed at targeting the tourism sector for expansion. The reductions in the VAT rates were especially beneficial but also the introduction of the visa waiver scheme.  I know from talking to people involved in the tourism and catering sectors in Kilkenny that there was a significant improvement this summer as a result of the VAT decrease.  That is acknowledged by people who work in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">I agree with previous speakers about the potential to attract major international sporting events to the country.  This week the Solheim Cup in County Meath proved to be a fantastic success.  The Ryder Cup was held in this country a few years ago and previously Walker Cup competitions were also held here.  The golf tourism sector has potential to attract vast numbers of people and expenditure in the tourism sector in the regions.  The beauty of the golfing product as a tourism attraction is that it is something that can spread throughout the country because there are quality golf courses in every county.  More must be done in that regard to attract similar events to this country in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I was pleased to hear Deputy Breen speak previously about the Olympics because that is one of the points I wish to make.  Next year the Olympics is the biggest international sporting event in the world and it will arguably never be closer to us in our lifetime.  Deputy Breen indicated that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, is chairing a committee which is aimed at attracting benefits to this country, the economy and the tourism sector given the proximity of the Olympics next year.  The visa waiver scheme was designed specifically with the location of the Olympics in London next year in mind.  There is great potential in attracting people who are coming from all over the world to the events which will be taking place in the United Kingdom.  While people are at this side of the world they could cross the Irish Sea and spend time in this country.  I refer not just to participants in the Olympic Games but to spectators.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">In the past ten to 15 years there has been significant investment in tourism infrastructure especially in the provision of hotel beds.  In my area of Kilkenny we have gone from a situation where there was limited hotel accommodation a few years ago to a greatly expanded number currently.  Previous Governments invested in the sector by way of tax relief for the building of hotels.  Taxpayers' money helped to build many of the facilities and it is important that the investment is followed up to realise the potential that exists to attract and cater for tourists right across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">A few developments which have taken place in my area in recent years are worthy of note.  I agree with what Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy said about the potential to attract tourists to this country.  She referred to garden tourism.  One of the best of the facilities which have been developed is Woodstock Gardens in Inistioge, County Kilkenny, which is near where I live.  It was developed in co-operation with the tourism authorities and Kilkenny County Council in recent years.  It is a spectacular Victorian era garden in south County Kilkenny.  There has also been a significant investment in the Castlecomer Demesne in north Kilkenny and the development of a walkway from Kilkenny city to Inistioge through the Nore valley, a walk of more than 20 km.  There is potential to extend the walk down the entire length of the Nore valley and even into New Ross and the Barrow valley.  I hope that can be considered in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">That is all I wish to say.  I welcome the legislation and the increase in funding for tourism development.  It is a positive step and I am fully supportive of it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyMcLoughlin" eId="spk_246">
          <from>Deputy Tony McLoughlin</from>
          <p eId="para_479">The aim of the Bill is simple, namely, to allow an increase in the level of funding which can be provided to the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland, for capital expenditure projects from €65 million to €150 million.  The proposal by Government to continue investment in tourism is justified based on the 11% rise in tourism numbers published last week.  The tourism industry generated €1.3 billion for the Irish economy in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">In the tourism strategy produced by Bord Fáilte for 2007 to 2013, it was envisaged that less support would be provided for accommodation but more public money would be provided for tourism infrastructure.  The strategy was soundly based on a comprehensive audit of tourism attractions, activities and events.  I emphatically endorse the policy.  I wish to concentrate in particular on the region I come from to emphasise that point and my support for the Bill.  Traditionally, the north-west region has been the poor relation in terms of tourism numbers compared to other regions.  We pale into insignificance when the numbers who travel to the south-west region are compared to the north-west region.  Many might ask why that is so.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">There are many reasons, however, the basic tourism infrastructural deficit of the north-west region has contributed to the reduced numbers for many years.  Significant spend in that regard in recent years is now addressing the problem.  In counties Sligo and Leitrim in 1990 approximately eight hotels were trading.  In summer 2011 there were 15 hotels, increasing bed numbers by more than 500 rooms.  It is prudent for those two counties to ask what more they can offer visitors and potentially to the people of the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Recently, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, visited my constituency.  I compliment him on his enthusiasm and energy.  On that occasion he spent the day in the constituency visiting many of the projects I will highlight today and many others as well.  I wish to put on record his efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Funding has been improved by Fáilte Ireland and INTERREG for a variety of projects.  They will add greatly to our tourism potential.  I refer to Glencar Waterfall and amenity, a new proposed interpretative centre at Drumshanbo Acres amenity, the approval of new walking routes in and around Sliabh an larann coupled with a number of other proposals such as the unique proposal to develop the "Ballroom of Romance" in Glenfarne, County Leitrim.  The intention is to showcase through an interpretative centre the old style ballrooms best illustrated in Pat O'Connor's film of the same name.  The success of the Arigna mining experience best demonstrates this concept with visitor numbers reaching 30,000 last year.  Other similar tourism infrastructural projects previously mentioned by me will ensure that we in the regions attract numbers for the bed nights we have available.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">It is most unfortunate that Lissadell House in County Sligo did not open its doors to visitors this year.  As I understand, that has had an adverse effect on tourism numbers for Sligo which is disappointing, but it does emphasise clearly that to maintain and grow our tourism numbers and to fill hotel beds we must continue to invest financially in hard tourism infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The development of walking and cycle routes will target a growing market.  In counties Leitrim and Sligo the tourism market has great potential to grow.  Cycling and walking specifically suits more rural areas where the potential for tourism business is difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">With the proximity of the north-west counties to the Border region it is essential that Fáilte Ireland targets its spend in co-operation with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board which I hope will continue to grow its tourism infrastructure in tandem with us on this side of the Border.  In conclusion I wish to emphasise that targeted financial investment in key areas will pay dividends and that is why that this Bill is to be welcomed.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill which, although technical in nature, has an important purpose.  It gives us a chance to discuss the overall state of the tourism industry in addition to considering the many ideas and suggestions that have arisen in the course of this debate.  Deputies have clear ideas on how the country's tourism product can be enhanced by various initiatives in their own constituencies.  Hopefully, the Minister will take on board the suggestions that are being made on both sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I acknowledge the Minister's contribution to the industry since taking office.  This was seen clearly last week when the Central Statistics Office published figures showing that overseas trips to Ireland increased by 9.4% in May, June and July compared to the corresponding period last year.  It is a great reflection on the steps taken by the Government, including the jobs initiative, reducing VAT and making the tourism industry leaner and more competitive.  Hopefully, those figures will continue to grow and consequently employment will continue to rise in the tourism sector.  It is no coincidence that those figures rose after the introduction of the jobs initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">For quite some time, I have been pushing for the development of winter tourism.  I feel we can make great progress in that regard.  From May to October, Ireland has a fantastic tourist industry but once 1 October arrives it is almost as if a tap has been turned off and the overseas visitor figures drop.  There is no reason for that to happen, however.  My vision is that Ireland can have a 12-month tourism industry which would sustain thousands of extra jobs annually.  We have everything we need to attract visitors here for fantastic holidays.  They will then tell others about their experiences, thus bringing even more tourists the following year.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">In recent years, the Scottish tourism authority has made efforts to bring people there during the so-called off-season.  We should not have an off-season here because, while it may sound aspirational, we could have a peak season all year round.  We should be optimistic and aim for that target.  Scotland focuses on the romanticism of its lakes, Edinburgh and twilight evenings with log fires in pubs and hotels.  In addition, they are focused towards the couples market.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Ireland needs to place more emphasis on that internationally.  We have the products but we need to sell them more.  Killarney's Lough Leane, in my own constituency, is just as beautiful in February as it is in July.  The wild Atlantic crashing onto Inch strand is just as beautiful in November as in May.  Likewise, Kylemore Abbey in Connemara is just as lovely in March as when I visited it in August.  These are the things we need to push.  Instead of Irish people going to the Continent for Christmas markets, they should avail of the fantastic shopping facilities in many villages, towns and cities throughout Ireland in the run up to the festive season.  Dublin and Killarney have made massive efforts in that regard, as have small towns and villages elsewhere.  Caherciveen in my constituency, for example, has made a major effort this year to prepare for the Christmas shopping period.  There is no reason people should not stay at home to avail of such facilities, and visitors may even come from abroad for the experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Once October comes we tend to see a major fall off in the number of visiting golfers yet we have a very large golf links industry.  People might not be able to play two rounds of golf in the winter months, as they do in summertime, but we should be pushing our links courses internationally, as many of them remain open all year round.  The success of Irish golfers abroad has made it easier for us to market Ireland as a golfing destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Having spoken to industry sources, however, it seems as if our Scottish neighbours are outdoing us in attracting North American golfing visitors.  We should be promoting the fantastic courses we have scattered all over the country, which are all within close driving distance of each other.  We should be pushing them on the international stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Unfortunately, Irish pubs are a dying breed but we have two choices in this respect.  First, we can allow pubs to dwindle and die, thus having a cultural shift towards the purchase of alcohol in off-licences.  Second, we could give pubs — particularly rural ones — a helping hand because they are part and parcel of the tourism product.  They are what people come here to experience.  Irish pubs are even more special in winter than in summer because they are one of the main attractions in the evenings when it is dark after 5 o'clock.  We should support Irish pubs perhaps by giving tax breaks to rural publicans who sell beer on tap.  When I asked the Minister for Finance if we could give publicans an incentive, for example by reducing VAT on sales in licensed premises, I discovered that unfortunately we cannot differentiate between those and off-licence sales.  Kegs of beer can only be sold in pubs, however, so maybe we can give publicans an advantage by cutting VAT on beer sold from kegs.  We should examine that because publicans need a break at the moment.  We should also provide tax breaks to publicans who transport customers to and from pubs, including visitors who are staying locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I acknowledge the efforts to ensure that airlines can fly more people here, thus boosting our tourism industry.  We should work hand in hand with the airlines because the nature of holiday-making has changed considerably in recent years.  There is a growing trend of people logging on to see where they can get the cheapest flights, which dictates where they go on holiday as opposed to having any particular destination in mind.  It is imperative that we co-operate with airlines where possible.  I would like to see the €3 tax abolished, as would many tourism operators, so hopefully progress can be made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">I acknowledge the efforts that have been made to date to reinstate the public service obligation route from Kerry to Dublin, which is very important to the south west.  It will be in operation from 2 November.   I call on the Minister of State, along with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to visit County Kerry on one of those flights once the PSO is back up and running.  They will be very welcome to the county, as they have been in the past.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has visited Kerry twice as Minister of State, as has the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  They have delivered good news to the county, for example, the announcement of funding for the restoration of Killarney House.  This is a very progressive decision and the people of Kerry are delighted that this outstanding building with a great history situated at the verge of the national park in the centre of Killarney town will be restored to its former glory with additional information centres, services and products available to visitors to Killarney.  I applaud the vision of the Government in providing such funding.  I also acknowledge and welcome the allocation of considerable funding for the downhill mountain bike trail in Glenflesk which is part of our growing outdoor activities industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">We need to focus our efforts on attracting to Ireland key global sports events which have massive world-wide audiences.  The Tour de France opening stage was held in Ireland in the mid-1990s and there is no reason we should not lobby for this to come again.  I invite the Minister of State to discuss this option with his counterparts in France.  My preference would be for the opening stage to begin in Killarney or in Dingle but anywhere in the country would be excellent.  The Ryder Cup competition is another event we should aim to have return.  These events attract huge audiences.  We should also consider events such as the London Olympic Games in 2012.  I welcome the changes being made to visa applications so that visitors to the UK will be able to come here also.  Further down the line, the 2015 rugby world cup will be held in England and many thousands of people will visit England for the matches.  It is hoped many of those will visit Ireland as a result of changes in the visa system.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The United Kingdom is making efforts to bring major sporting events to its shores and we should give every assistance.  England had hoped to host the 2018 soccer world cup but the bid was not successful.  In my view, the Irish Government needs to row in behind our neighbours across the water because we have benefits to gain from any opportunities availed of by them.  It is to be hoped that the 2012 Olympic Games will have a positive impact on this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">I acknowledge the efforts of the FAI for hosting the nations' cup.  Attendances may not have been as high as had been hoped but it could provide a basis for future involvement with perhaps the competition expanding to include five countries, including England, as this would give the tournament a significant boost.  I ask the Minister of State to raise this option with the FAI.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The white-tailed sea eagle has been introduced into County Kerry.  Unfortunately, some have been poisoned but others are doing very well.  Birdwatching tourism is worth millions of pounds to the local economy in the Mull area of Scotland.  We should develop such a tourism sector in this country.  County Kerry has developed the pursuits of angling and whale-watching and this sector could also be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The Gaeltacht areas provide opportunities to learn and speak our native language and we should encourage people to consider these areas as a holiday destination in the Discover Ireland marketing programme.  There is also an opportunity to develop the market by accommodating foreigners, particularly from North America, who wish to learn the Irish language.  The study of the Irish language is an established source of domestic tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">We should not take our foot off the gas when it comes to providing basic facilities.  More public toilets should be provided throughout the country and changing and showering facilities are required at beaches.  We lag behind in the provision of such facilities even when it comes to parking facilities at beaches and other venues.  Standards must be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The film industry has been a successful sector in Ireland, and productions such as "Braveheart", "Ryan's Daughter", "Far and Away", "Saving Private Ryan" were filmed here over the years and in turn had a significant impact on tourism to the country.  We need to avail of any opportunity that comes our way to showcase our country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EoghanMurphy" eId="spk_250">
          <from>Deputy Eoghan Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_506">I thank Deputy Brendan Griffin for sharing his time.  It is particularly gracious of him, given recent events in Croke Park.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Deputy Griffin touched upon a number of aspects.  He made the point of having a 12-month tourism cycle and I agree with him that this is crucial.  There is no reason not to have tourists coming to Ireland in every month of the year and in large numbers.  Attractions such as Christmas markets in small towns is one excellent suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">I wish to speak about a particular aspect of tourism, activity-based or sports tourism, where people travel to take part in sporting events around the country, whether a marathon, a half marathon or a triathlon.  Before I became involved so actively in politics, I used to participate regularly in such sporting events.  I have been to Achill and Killarney and twice to Westport.  I have also travelled to the UK and to France for events.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">This sports market sector of tourism is very significant as competitors spend a lot of money.  There is the money spent on travelling abroad to an event or travelling to a domestic event.  The kit and the registration all costs money and accommodation costs must also be catered for.  I will give an example of my own expenditure.  Last year I participated in the Gael Force adventure triathlon in Killary Harbour.  The entrance fee for the competition was €100; I spent €200 on accommodation for two nights and another €200 during the course of the weekend.  This amounts to €500 spent in Westport and only because the race was being held there.  I was accompanied by a number of friends and that resulted in €4,000 being spent in Westport.  Three of my friends had travelled from the UK so this was new money into Ireland.  The race attracted 3,000 competitors.  If each competitor spent as much as I spent that weekend, this amounts to more than €1 million into the Westport economy in one weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">This is a very lucrative event for the area of Westport and the town is to be commended on branding itself as a destination for activity events.  These events provide a new opening for tourism revenue.  Money came into the town of Westport during the Gael Force festival and this came from first-time visitors and those from abroad and also repeat visitors.  For instance, once I had visited the town I was prepared to return on further visits and a few months later I returned to compete in a 10 km adventure race called Turf Guy.  I am hoping to compete again this year.  This event will bring more money into Westport.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Competitors in these events are young with a high disposable income.  They may not have mortgage costs or dependants and they can spend their money on sporting activities.  Ireland should be marketed as a destination for more international sporting events and sports tourism as this could provide significant revenue from people with high disposable incomes who spend their money in a way that is good for them and good for the local economies.  I know the Minister of State is aware of my views but anything he can do in this regard would be very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The Volvo Ocean Race will be held next year.  I wish the Chinese-Irish team the best of luck.  I wished them well as they sailed from the River Liffey.  I applaud the initiative on the part of the tourist board and the race will be a great event for Ireland.  This is the type of event we should encourage and use to our advantage.  I attended a Diaspora Matters event a few nights ago which was to highlight our networks abroad, of which the Volvo Ocean Race is another example.  There are so many Irish people and those with Irish links living all over the world and they are all willing to become involved in related events and activities, to play a part in the renewal of the country and to help attract people to the country.  This Bill is an important measure and along with other initiatives from the Minister's Department, it is very welcome.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_513">It is amazing what one learns in this Chamber.  I am delighted to hear about all the funding allocated to County Kerry over the past months.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">Wearing my parochial hat, I look forward to Wicklow getting some funding in the months ahead.  I know my good friend Deputy Ring will not fail to deliver and that he will wear his global rather than his local hat.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I am glad to have some minutes to speak on this straightforward Bill that increases the amount of funding for Fáilte Ireland.  While tourism is one of the two great indigenous industries in this country — the other being agriculture — it has not been served well.  We have deluded ourselves over time and our standards are not sufficiently high nor do we have an integrated tourist industry.  One of the reasons for this is that those who shout loudest get action.  Therefore, the funding that has been allocated across the country has not always been allocated in an integrated manner for the common good.  I hope that under this new Government and under the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and Minister of State, Deputy Ring, a global approach will be taken on how funding is allocated.  Notwithstanding that I will certainly shout for my corner, it is important that funding is allocated with a view to an integrated product rather than towards the sector that shouts loudest.  If one looked at the allocation over the past ten or 15 years, much of it would not stand up in a value for money audit.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">This island, on the edge of the Atlantic, should be the Bermuda or Hawaii of Europe.  There are some 500 million people in Europe, most of whom have never seen the Atlantic.  We have never targeted these to the extent we should, particularly central Europeans such as the Germans, Swiss and Austrians.  Coming to the western bastion of Europe, the Atlantic, should be something to which every European should aspire.  This should be their equivalent of a trip to the Niagara Falls for Americans or Canadians and we should look at how we pitch ourselves in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I would like to raise some bugbears with regard to tourism.  These are issues that one would find have been raised in the record of the Dáil over the past ten and 20 years.  Signage is the first of these.  I was travelling to Galway recently and came to Tullamore, but could not find a sign for Galway there.  There is a big roundabout route in Tullamore which stretches for miles around the town, but one does not know whether to go through Clara, go back to Kilbeggan or where to go.  All that is needed is a simple sign indicating how to get to Galway.  I know the country fairly well and have travelled that road many times, but what is it like for somebody who has never been in the country before when he or she gets to Tullamore from the south or the east?  How can that person find the way back to the main road?  It defies logic why the signs are not there.  The same old bugbear also applies at Dublin Airport.  When one leaves the airport what does one see but a sign for Westport?  I know that all roads lead to Westport, but surely the main destinations should be signposted from the airport.  It is very difficult when one leaves the airport to see where one should go or where one should get off the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The NRA has a policy, perhaps it comes under the regulation or schedule to the legislation, that only the end point can be advertised on signs.  I do not think that even main hospitals can be signposted off motorways.  If one drives up the new N9 from Waterford to Dublin, there is nothing to indicate that one can go across to the N11 through Wicklow.  Many tourists come up from Waterford, drive up to the M50, head eastwards and then back down the N11 when they could have come off the N9 in an easterly direction earlier.  I raised this issue with the NRA, Kildare County Council and Wicklow County Council until I had a pain in my face, but nothing happened.  I will have one more bash at it and hopefully it will work out.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I do not know how many county tourism boards we have.  I go for the policy one person for one job or one person for three jobs, but not two or ten organisations for one job, because nothing happens in that case.  County tourism boards should be abolished across the country.  We have one in Wicklow and it too should be abolished.  Tourism should be co-ordinated by Fáilte Ireland or Tourism Ireland, whatever it is called now, and the local authority should have a link person to the organisation responsible.  The greatest contribution local authorities can make to tourism is to keep their signage and towns clean.  It does not take much money to keep a place clean, but it can only be done if our county managers and directors of services go out and visit the towns and tourist locations.  There should be an onus on them to go around their county once a year to take a look at what needs to be done.  Small changes can make such a difference.  Some of our towns are fantastic and I congratulate Killarney and towns like Kilkenny, Westport and Aughrim on the wonderful job they have done.  However, other towns, which will remain nameless and some of which are in my county, are a disgrace, particularly with recent dereliction.  I noticed an innovative concept in Arklow where some of the derelict buildings have been painted with attractive advertising murals.  This idea could be considered and seen as getting rid of graffiti in reverse.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">When I was first elected in 1997 I brought out a document entitled WIN, Wicklow integrate now.  This was a document on tourism which I sent to the then Minister with responsibility for tourism.  My concept was to develop a one-day and two-day tour of Wicklow.  However, nothing happened.  I hope that under the new Government we will get some positive movement.  Currently I am drawing up a document entitled 2020 vision for the greater Wicklow area.  I have decided to take this on myself because I do not have confidence in an integrated approach from the authorities.  What I am doing is sketching out the basic bones of a concept for the greater Wicklow area and I hope that by 2020 the majority of the projects identified can be completed.  No matter what village one visits in Germany or the Cotswolds, there is some attraction in it.  Each one has a rich and diverse history.  However, when one visits most of the towns in this country, this is not available and one cannot access information.  Often when one comes to a location, it is closed.  Many Irish areas have a deep, lush local history that would be of interest to tourists.  I have a draft project concept drawn up for Wicklow and intend to put it to the public for its views.  Then I will draw up a proposal that I hope, with the help of the Minister of State, will be implemented over the next number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">It is all well and good for people to be able to see the beautiful scenery in an area, but they also want to be able to do something.  They want to have coffee, read a bit of local history, fish and cycle.  The advent of cycle paths is welcome, but it is terrible when after five or six miles cyclists must get a bus or train and head off somewhere else to cycle.  This portrays the lack of integration.  We should have started with cycle paths in one location and worked out in a web process.  We should not just have isolated paths in Wicklow, Mayo and Donegal.  They should be interconnected in a web fashion.  They could follow our river banks, our disused railways and canal walks.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Every town should have an information board.  We often meet tourists in towns, whether Irish or non-nationals, who can find no information on where to go or what to do.  It does not take much effort to provide a tourist information board.  I must compliment the western seaboard which has perhaps had a hungrier approach to tourism than the eastern seaboard or the midlands.  Most places in the west have an information board.  Another hobbyhorse of mine is the rip-off.  I went to the football all-Ireland a couple of weeks ago and went into a premises where there was a very warm welcome and great approach and service.  However, once we paid over our money it was like being put down a laundry chute.  It was bang, press the button, out.  Our ejection was so abrupt that the few people I was with said they would never go back to that location.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">They praised the experience as they went through it but the way the button was pressed reminded me of the advertisement in which the lads from Longford are beamed up for a McDonalds burger.  That is what happened, except in this case one was beamed out of the premises.  It did a disservice to the industry and to the innate and warm hospitality of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Deputy Griffin alluded to alcohol and the tradition of the Irish pub.  I stopped off in Durty Nelly's a few weeks ago and I noticed the Minister of State's constituency colleague, the Taoiseach, had visited during August because there was a picture of him up on the wall.  I would like to see the Minister of State's picture up in a few locations around the country.  However, there is a downside to the change in drinking habits.  In Temple Bar and every small town and village in the country, young people are stoned out of their minds late at night every weekend having consumed naggins of vodka on a river bank before heading to the local disco and so on.  This is an epidemic and the older generation is not aware of the extent of the difficulties.  Young people visit their local supermarket or off-licence to purchase 70 cl bottles of vodka using fake identification or they ask their friends who are of legal drinking age to buy for them.  They then drink neat vodka or mix it in such a way that they drink half a bottle each before falling around the place out of their minds later in the evening.  I do not know how that problem can be tackled but, from the point of view of tourism, it is not an attractive experience for foreigners who visit the country to see young people falling around stoned out of their brain.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">When people go on holidays, they normally like to engage in an activity.  I was approached by a group of historians who are American Civil War fanatics.  The civil war trail industry in the US is worth approximately $2 billion a year.  This year is the 150th anniversary of the war and this group is teaming up with Fáilte Ireland to develop the concept of an American Civil War trail in Ireland because 11 or 12 generals who fought on both sides were Irish while 160,000 other Irish people participated in it, which is more than in the First or Second World Wars.  If that concept is developed, perhaps in conjunction with an American presidents trail through Wexford, Moneygall, Ballyporeen and a few locations in Ulster with connections to past presidents, it will attract tourists to the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Reference was made to the diaspora, an issue I have raised over a long number of years.  There are many millions of people of Irish descent in North and South America.  Following the economic forum in Farmleigh House in 2009, it was agreed that a certificate of Irish heritage should be introduced and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade handed over the first one to the mother of a deceased fireman in New York recently.  I support the principle but I caution that it is important that the research carried out into the connections people say they have with the country stand up to scrutiny.  A Kerry firm is responsible for the production of the certificates but it must be ensured the background of those who apply for them is well proofed to ensure they have a definite Irish connection.  We do not want the certificates to become souvenirs like pieces of the rock of Cashel.  They will only have a value if the qualification is thoroughly checked and authenticated.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Reference was made to using sport to attract tourists.  The hoped for success of the Irish rugby team in the weeks ahead will project an attractive image of the country and that is why it is important that people who represent the country, be it behind a bar in Kiltimagh, on the playing fields of New Zealand or in the swimming pools of Atlanta, are proud of who they are and project a good image.  Gaelic games are unique sports.  Soccer and rugby can be watched anywhere and while it is fantastic when Irish teams do well, we should be conscious of the uniqueness of our national games.  The GAA will have to step up to deal with violence in Gaelic football games on and off the pitch because modern society will not accept it.  The association could find itself in the same position as the Catholic Church and its officials could leave it too late before they realise they have a problem.  They will come under increasing threat from other sports such as rugby if they do not organise their games in a proper manner and send a message that there is no place for violence within these games.  There is nothing better than bringing a tourist to a hurling or football match but if it is peppered with violence or abuse from the line and so on, the GAA will run into difficulty.  Some people advocate that this is a unique part of the games but that is unacceptable in modern society.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">I wish the Minister of State well in his job.  I look forward to him visiting Wicklow to consider the Vision 2020 concept and we do not expect everything to be done overnight.  His heart lies in Mayo but he has travelled around since he took up office and he has been approachable at all times.  Hopefully, that will remain the case.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelRing" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Michael Ring)</from>
          <p eId="para_529">Deputy Timmins cannot complain about the recent funding from the Department because his constituency did not do too badly.  I disagree with him that those who shout the loudest get the most.  I believe that those who are prepared to put their hands in their pockets to provide matching funding do not do badly.  I come from a community and tourism region where people are prepared to put their hands into their pockets to come up with matching funding and to work with Fáilte Ireland.  The biggest factor is they work as a community on one product.  If a conference takes place in my home town and one hotel provides the facilities, the other hoteliers will support it because if the main hotel is full, their hotels might attract the overflow and, therefore, they work together as a community.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I agree with the Deputy regarding signage.  My Department has provided funding to local authorities but we still have not got this right.  We will have to sit down with the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the local authorities.  The Deputy is correct that the provision of even more signage, as has happened in some counties, has resulted in visitors being unable to identify where they are going because there is too much signage and we do not want that.  A common-sense approach must be adopted by the NRA, the local authorities and so on to make sure that when tourists arrive in the country, they know where they are going.  It is one of the complaints I get regularly.  Over the past number of weeks, I have had three or four complaints and people are saying, particularly in the Gaeltacht areas, that they cannot read the signs and we must examine this to see if we can put up bilingual signs.  It is not right that people cannot find where they are going.  I have written to the Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs to see if there is any way forward to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Many Members referred to the issue of value for money.  In 2010 a visitors attitude survey was carried out.  Prior to that 21% of respondents had said they were dissatisfied with prices but I am glad that has reduced to 13% in last year's survey.  I hope the recent cuts in VAT and PRSI will ensure a decrease in dissatisfaction among people about prices.  This year many people involved in tourism provided value for money.  I compliment the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation on encouraging their members to reduce VAT.  In 99.9% of cases, they did and they gave good value for money.  I hope we will see a further decrease and that in the next attitude survey, people will say they are getting value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Deputy Spring spoke about the regions and working with the airports and the ferry companies.  We tried to deal with the airlines.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, worked and talked on that but we did not get agreement on it but regarding the money collected from the travel tax, I compliment the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on allowing us to invest that money in tourism products.  I am glad to say we are working with the airlines and the ferry companies and are asking them to submit plans to us.  We have told them we will support them if they put up matching funding.  We are promoting the regions, supporting the cities and trying to attract people into our country.  That fund is available and I compliment both Ministers on allowing us to spend that money in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Deputy McNamara from Clare spoke about Fáilte Ireland and the Shannon Development proposal.  A total of €4 million from Fáilte Ireland was put into St. John's Castle in Limerick.  All projects are open and all counties can make an application to Fáilte Ireland.  It will assess their applications and if it believes the product is worth supporting, funding will be made available to them.  People are treated fairly but the big problem over the years has been the matching funding.  That is a problem in other areas also but it is something we must deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate today and last week and for their kind comments.  As I stated earlier in the summer, everything is not perfect in tourism but Deputy Timmins should know that we have a very good product.  We have a great country, great food and great entertainment but our best asset, which they do not have in the rest of the world, is our people.  They can talk and entertain and will welcome visitors to this country, and I am delighted that since 2008 there has been an increase in the number of visitors here.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">People will be critical of Ministers or Governments but the stimulus budget sent out the right message.  I was in America and in France.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was in Germany.  We were in Britain.  We are working very hard to try to promote the country and we do not have to be told every morning, at dinner time, at 6 p.m. and at 9 p.m. that we have a problem in the country.  We all know we have a serious economic problem but there are many positive things happening in the country and in tourism and we need to get across the message that we are open for business, that we are a good country, that we have a good product and we want people to come to our country.  I love this country and I love to see people coming here.  I like to see people getting value for money and getting a welcome, and I like to thank people for coming to the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I take this opportunity to state on the floor of the House that when I was appointed a Minister of State I asked people to consider holidaying at home this year.  The Irish people responded and I thank them most sincerely.  In April, I asked people if they were going away for two weeks to consider holidaying at home for a week or if they go away for weekends to consider staying in Ireland for a particular weekend or if they were taking a week's holidays that they might take two or three days in Ireland and then go abroad.  The Irish people responded.  They stayed at home this year.  The one thing we could not guarantee them was the weather.  Those who live here like to see some sunshine, as we had today and yesterday.  It is a pity the summer is coming so late but that should not stop people enjoying it.  The weather is good.  If they still want to take holidays somewhere in the country, there is great value available.  We have great commodities and people who will provide them with cheap beds for the night and good meals at good value.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">I compliment the people who put their hands into their pockets.  I refer to the small business people with family run hotels, restaurants and other businesses.  The backbone of our society now is the small businesses, and I want to compliment them.  In difficult times they are brave enough to work hard.  They are trying to employ people and pay their taxes.  They are also trying to make sure that we get out of the economic mess we are in, and tourism is one of the ways we can do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Over 180,000 people are employed in tourism here.  The industry brings in approximately €5 billion a year.  It is a great industry and one in which I believe we can do more.  I will be putting pressure on Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to make sure they promote the country and work with the industry.  There is great good will towards Ireland in America and in France.  Deputy Timmins should know the French people love the west of Ireland and he should not be jealous if they do not want to go to Wicklow.  They love coming to the west of Ireland, and they do not come for the weather.  They are happy to visit and see what is there.  The Americans are the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I met a man in a lift when I was on holiday in Killarney with whom I sympathised about the weather.  He said he did not come to this country for the weather.  He said when he left Kansas it was 120°.  He said he loved the weather in Ireland and he loved coming to Ireland.  We are always thinking about the weather.  We have a good country, good people and a good product.  I say to Members, and to the media, that we need to sell a bit of positivity because everything is not negative.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">This is a technical Bill and if any Member wants to put down amendments on Committee Stage we will examine them but its purpose is simple.  We are increasing the funding to Fáilte Ireland from €65 million to €150 million but that is not a guarantee that it will have the money.  It will depend on budgetary constraints but it is important because in the coming years we would have gone over the limit set in legislation by this House.  It is important that we are ready for the future because I see a bright future for tourism here and for those in the tourism industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">In a recession people start to think outside the box, and they are doing that now.  I recently attended a food fair in Westport.  People are producing.  The other day I opened a beehive business which will provide honey.  That is what we did not do for the past ten years.  We thought we did not need all of that.  We thought the tiger would never die but the tiger has died and we have to examine other ways to make a living.  We have to ensure this country survives, and people are talking about that.  They are working together as communities and seeing what they can do for themselves, their area, their community and the country.  That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I thank everybody for their positivity in regard to tourism.  As I said, everything is not perfect but we have a good product.  We are under pressure from competition in other countries but we have to sell our product.  We have a good product and good people and I have no doubt that in the coming years more people will come to this country.  The American market is looking good for this year.  It is up 17% and is looking even better for next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I chair an interdepartmental committee which is working on ways and means of trying to get people to come here during the Olympic Games in Britain next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">We have to start thinking outside the box and working together but the State cannot do everything for every area.  Individual counties must lead.  They must get the support from the State and the State should respond.  If there are people in Wicklow with ideas on projects and some money to put forward, Fáilte Ireland representatives should sit down with them and help them in any way possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Regarding tourism, I am glad the local authorities are putting people in charge of tourism because they now realise it is very important.  Every corner of the country has something to offer.  There is something in every county in every corner of this country.  If there is one job, it takes two to beat it and I have no doubt that people will start thinking outside the box and that tourism will be the way forward and will help us get out of the economic mess we are in.  I thank the Members who were positive and who came up with very good suggestions.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_255">
            <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
            <p eId="para_550">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for taking the issue.  I wish to raise the plans for the future of Portlaoise hospital, particularly with regard to the intensive care unit and the accident and emergency unit, the plans to proceed with the model 2 proposal, if any, and the implications for the maternity unit at the hospital.  I am glad the Minister for Health is here and is taking time to deal with the matter.  I note the HSE statement of 22 September states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_551">The HSE continues to work towards the full implementation of the HIQA report into Ennis Hospital and further recommendations arising from HIQA's Mallow report.  Both reports will ultimately give rise to changes in the role of smaller hospitals, which include Portlaoise Regional Hospital and...Loughlinstown hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_552">In his statement the following day, 23 September, the Minister said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_553">In July of this year I attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and made clear that Portlaoise is a Model Three hospital, and will remain a Model Three hospital.  I stated to the committee that this is Government policy and will not change.  I confirm that this remains the position.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">We have two different positions, and that is why I am raising the issue.  There is huge concern in the community, across County Laois and in south Kildare — the Acting Chairman will be aware of that — because many people from that area use the hospital.  There is also huge concern in parts of Offaly.  Staff, patients and users of the hospital are concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_555">When I and other Deputies for the constituency met the Minister in the summer, he outlined the same position.  I have to report to him that, in the second part of the meeting with the officials, they were strong in pushing the model 2 position regarding Portlaoise.  It was talked about at length.  For my part, I believe Portlaoise must retain the vital services — the accident and emergency unit, the paediatric units, both of which are new, modern and well functioning, the intensive care unit and the maternity unit, which is busy and has a huge catchment area.  Portlaoise is the second busiest hospital outside the Dublin region, with a huge throughput of patients, and it is also a very efficient hospital.  The report shows that the cost per attendance is €149 whereas the next lowest figure is €195 and the figures for other hospitals are much higher.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">I ask the Minister specifically to address maternity services.  The hospital needs a new maternity unit.  I recall a meeting with local councillors and Mr. John Bulfin in 2008, at which he stated that €8 million was being ring-fenced to provide a new maternity unit.  There has been talk that Portlaoise will be reconfigured with the Coombe, Loughlinstown and Naas.  Is there a plan in some people's heads in the HSE to transfer maternity services to the Coombe?  I hope not.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm that for me.  I ask him to address the points I have raised.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_256">
            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_557">I thank Deputy Stanley for the opportunity to clarify the situation.  I do not believe there is any difference between the two statements, to be frank.  There is an association because many of the hospitals mentioned in conjunction with Portlaoise are model 2, but I did not say that Portlaoise was going to be model 2.  I have certainly never said that.  Let us clear that up at the outset.</p>
            <p eId="para_558">I want to place on record that the Midland Regional Hospital at Portlaoise will continue to deliver a quality-driven, people-centred service to the population of the region and the people of Laois in particular.  There is no plan to reduce services at the hospital.  Lest I forget to address the Deputy's question about what is in the heads of the myriad people working in the HSE, I think he will agree I could not possibly know what is in all their heads, but I know what is in my head and I put it on the record again today.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">I remain committed to ensuring that acute hospital services at national, regional and local level are provided in a clinically appropriate and efficient manner.  In particular, I want to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely in smaller, local hospitals.  I have also made it clear that patient safety must be the overriding priority and I want patients to be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible.  Patients should only have to travel to larger hospitals for more complex services.  I do not mind stating that the battles we have had on moving what it is not safe to provide in smaller hospitals will be superceded by the battles to get what should not be provided in the bigger hospitals out of them and back to the smaller hospitals.  We will engage in these battles and win.</p>
            <p eId="para_560">In the recent past there has been much speculation regarding the future of Portlaoise hospital.  Certain reports have cited correspondence, as Deputy Stanley has done, and referred to the possibility of Portlaoise becoming a model 2 hospital, which would have implications, particularly for the emergency department.  In July of this year, as Deputy Stanley pointed out, I attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and made it clear that Portlaoise is a model 3 hospital and will remain a model 3 hospital.  I said to the committee that this is Government policy and will not change.  I confirm that this remains the case.  I might mention that I intend to develop a framework for the development of smaller hospitals that secures their future and specifies the additional services it is safe for them to provide. The framework will underline the Government's commitment to the real development of smaller hospitals and not their closure, as some people would have us believe.  It is important to point out that there are safety issues at Portlaoise and they are being addressed but addressing them does not mean it will become a model 2 hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">On the intensive care unit and critical care of patients at Portlaoise, there is currently a four bed ICU with the capacity to ventilate two patients should the requirement arise.  As Portlaoise provides both obstetric and gynaecology and paediatric services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, anaesthetic and surgical cover is required 24 hours a day, seven days a week on site.  In this regard, I am happy to confirm that it is envisaged the Midlands Regional Hospital at Portlaoise will maintain its current ICU service.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">Furthermore, a proposition to appoint a clinical director for the midlands region is currently being considered by the HSE.  A single clinical director would lead the provision of these services within the region and within the guidance of the national clinical care programmes.  In advance of that process, I wish to re-iterate that the retention of Portlaoise Hospital as a model 3 facility remains Government policy.  Accordingly, the recent speculation around the downgrading of Portlaoise hospital is not accurate and I am pleased to set the record straight.  Portlaoise remains a model 3 hospital.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_257">
            <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
            <p eId="para_563">The Minister can understand where the confusion is coming from but I welcome the reply.  In his statement he went into some detail.  Can the Minister confirm there will be a new maternity unit in the hospital?  What is the position with capital funding?  I have tried to track the €8 million for the last three years, all the way from the council chamber in Portlaoise to the floor of this Chamber and I have not been able to get any answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">I take the Minister's remarks in good faith.  The budget for the hospital is €42 million for the year.  The Minister as a medic knows that €42 million will not fund the operational costs of a busy regional hospital.  While we might have the status, will we have the funding?  I know these are difficult times financially but if we intend to retain those services, the capital costs are required for a new maternity unit and there is annual funding for the running of the hospital, which amounted to €51.5 million just a few years ago.  There are decisions to be made on this so I would like to hear the Minister's opinion.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_258" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_565">There is no provision in capital funding in the current year or next year for a maternity unit for Portlaoise that I am aware of.  I will check that with my officials and would be happy to be proven wrong.  We live in straitened times and we all know why, because of the previous Government's approach to our economic affairs.  Equally, as a doctor, I do not know that €42 million is not enough to run this hospital.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_567">I do know, however, that many of our hospitals must change the way they deliver care.  We must have far more day case surgery, we must have far more cases admitted on the day of surgery, rather than the night before and I know we need greater flexibility in our staffing and how we approach this problem.  There is huge room for improvement within our hospitals.  That is not to castigate those who work there; people must work within the system as it exists.  The Government's commitment is to change that system so we can have greater results for patients and greater numbers of patients treated safely in an appropriate setting.  We do not want to have patients being treated in Dublin who should be treated in Portlaoise and we do not want to have patients being treated in Portlaoise who should be treated by their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">The Deputy is right; there is no question of maternity services leaving Portlaoise.  There is no capacity within the greater Dublin maternity hospitals to cater for people beyond the Dublin region, even though small numbers have come from outside the catchment areas.  It is difficult, however, to assess how many but I encourage people who have uncomplicated pregnancies to go local, which is more convenient and the service is excellent.</p>

          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_261">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_569">Over the last month, Mullingar, Portiuncula and Galway University hospitals have been taken off call for ambulances due to the chaotic situation in accident and emergency departments.  At the same time, Roscommon accident and emergency operates as a minor injury clinic for 12 hours a day, seven days a week.  I do not care what name is over the door of the emergency department, what goes on inside is what is important to me and the people I represent.  The reopening of Roscommon is a simple and cost effective way to take pressure off the other accident and emergency departments and the overstretched ambulance service.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">Within four weeks of the closure of the accident and emergency ward in Roscommon, the Department of Finance approved the roll-out of a new nationwide telestroke service, which allows the use of IT for specialists in regional centres to conduct video consultations and communicate with patients and staff.  This is the sort of system hospital campaigners in Roscommon have always sought because of our unique geographical situation.  Safety, however, was never the issue in Roscommon.  Local GPs were told heart attack patients would be transferred directly to Galway University Hospital for access to the CAT lab.  They now feel they have been lied to as patients are being transferred to Portiuncula hospital, a hospital with the same facilities as Roscommon; the only difference now is that in some instances patients are waiting in GPs' surgeries for up to an hour for the ambulance to arrive.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">Even leaving these issues aside, at this point we have some of the most skilled staff in the country twiddling their thumbs while chaos reigns in other accident and emergency departments around the country.  Where is the sense in that?  There is a need to review the ambulance and hospital bypass protocols relating to Roscommon.  Why does someone who needs two stitches who was picked up by an ambulance go past the front door of Roscommon Hospital on the way to an overcrowded accident and emergency department?  Why have 300 children with minor injuries been forced, since the closure of the accident and emergency department, to travel in pain to other hospitals because staff in Roscommon have been instructed to turn them away even though Roscommon was well capable of treating them prior to July this year?</p>

          <speech by="#LukeMingFlanagan" eId="spk_262">
            <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_572">Before the election, the Minister for Health and his party promised us they would not close our accident and emergency department.  After they closed it, they told us there would not be any problems with it being closed because we would get extra ambulances and super, souped-up paramedics.  That has not happened either.  Last weekend put the tin hat on it when people were told by the media not to go to the hospital we were told to go to in order to save lives.  As someone who has dedicated his life to saving people's lives, I wonder how the Minister for Health can stand over this.  It is not unreasonable for us to have some place to go when we are sick in this area.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_263" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_573">I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue.  The urgent care centre now in place in Roscommon operates from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week and is provided by non-consultant hospital doctors with clinical governance provided by the emergency medicine consultant in Galway.  In addition, a medical assessment operates at the hospital and there is an out-of-hours GP service is in operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">The changes at Roscommon were necessitated by the serious patient safety concerns of the HSE and HIQA.  The accident and emergency service situation at Roscommon followed the publication of the authority's report on Mallow General Hospital in April 2011 and this was compounded by of NCHD recruitment difficulties.  The Deputy knows how many meetings were held with the various medical, surgical and emergency department experts to see if there was any way around this.  None could be found so my hand was forced, unhappily but without choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">Data from the HSE indicate that since the change of Roscommon's emergency department to an urgent care centre, the number of patients referred each day to other hospitals has been very low.  The most recent data for ambulance calls in the Roscommon catchment area show that less than two patients on average per day were brought to Galway and Portiuncula hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">Even fewer patients were brought by ambulance to Mullingar, Sligo or Mayo hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">While I do not accept that opening the urgent care centre at Roscommon on a 24 hour basis would address the difficulties experienced from time to time at Galway University Hospital emergency department, I am committed to ensuring that problems experienced at emergency departments in Galway and elsewhere are addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">In recent months I have established the special delivery unit, SDU, under the leadership of Dr. Martin Connor. The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  It is focusing initially on emergency departments and will be working to support hospitals in addressing excessive waiting times for admission to hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">I am also committed to the future of Roscommon and to other smaller hospitals.  There was a safety issue.  I absolutely concur with the sentiment expressed in the Deputy's question.  Why does someone needing two sutures need to go to Galway?  I ask why someone needing two sutures needs to go to hospital in the first instance.  Why is the GP not suturing?  That is what I was trained to do as a GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">With regard to media reports, it is my understanding that people were asked to stay away from Galway University Hospital unless they were acutely or seriously ill.  This was because there was such overcrowding at the hospital.  There were 32 people on trolleys on the Saturday morning.  By mid-afternoon the number had reduced to the mid-teens, by 6 p.m. it was down to ten and by 8 p.m. it was down to five.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">There are problems in Galway and Limerick and in other hospitals around the country.  There are difficulties with work practices.  Difficulties have arisen because people have not done what was asked of them.  Day surgeries that should have moved from larger to smaller hospitals, such as Roscommon and Portiuncula, did not do so.  That problem is being addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">I understand that a plastic surgery outpatient clinic began last week in Roscommon and that the first plastic surgery will take place next week, with a new plastic surgeon.  I welcome her return to Roscommon.  She is Ms Deirdre Jones and I believe she is from Roscommon originally.</p>

            <p eId="para_584">I bring the case of Mary to the attention of the Minister.  Three weeks ago she had a mini-stroke at 10 p.m.  The ambulance arrived within 15 minutes to bring her to the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar.  When the ambulance was outside Edgeworthstown, the crew received a call to say that Mullingar was no longer accepting patients.  The ambulance was turned around and the woman had to be transferred to Sligo General Hospital.  She spent two hours in the ambulance and reached hospital three hours after the time of the stroke.  This is contrary to all the publicity we see regarding fast action in relation to strokes.  That ambulance was tied up for three hours and taken out of the area for which it should have been providing cover.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">Before July, approximately 280 patients per week attended the accident and emergency department in Roscommon County Hospital.  Currently, between 40 and 60 patients per week attend the department.  Where are the other patients?  I believe they are afraid to go to their GPs for fear they will be referred to other hospitals.  Many of these people are elderly and vulnerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">The Minister gave a commitment to the Joint Committee on Health and Children that he would have an independent evaluation of the medical evidence regarding the effect on a critically ill patient of an ambulance transfer in excess of two hours.  Has that evaluation been completed and when will it be published?</p>

Yesterday, at the request of Deputy Frank Feighan, I met a group from Roscommon hospital, including some of the surgical staff and management.

          <heading>Childhood Obesity</heading>
          <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_273">
            <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
            <p eId="para_597">I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Health and thank him for the responses I have been receiving on this issue, which I have been raising since I was elected.  Having a background as a primary school teacher, the issue of childhood obesity is of great concern to me.  The problem has developed to an alarming rate in Ireland and deserves more care and attention.  Credit is due to the Minister for the establishment of a special action group to deal with this issue.  Everything needs to be put on the table and examined with regard to this problem.  The <i>Irish Times</i> recently reported the observation that childhood obesity is a ticking timebomb waiting to explode.  Apart from its financial implications and the cost to the Exchequer, which is estimated at approximately €4 billion, the effect of obesity on the physical health and psychological wellbeing of the nation is being stored away for future generations and we can no longer ignore it.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">In the United States, President Obama has given Mrs. Obama special responsibility for dealing with obesity.  In recent years in Ireland the food we have been ingesting has been increasing while our movement rates have been decreasing.  We are eating more and moving less, with the result that we are putting up weight at alarming rates.  This is leading to cardiovascular problems, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and obesity related cancers.  It also leads to people developing asthma at a much younger age.  I have a special interest in this because I am an asthma sufferer.  Endocrinologists say there is a strong link between obesity and type 2 diabetes which is now manifesting itself in the genetic make-up of society.  We can no longer ignore this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">The problem was brought to my attention when I was training to be a primary teacher and a mother told me she could not find a first communion dress for her child, who was in second class, because the child was morbidly obese.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">The problem must be tackled on a number of fronts.  The most important is education.  We must educate society as to the dangers of obesity.  Many of us were fortunate to be brought up on boiled potatoes, meat and two vegetables, but some parents do not have the skills to produce a healthy lunch and give their children the start in life that other children are getting.  I welcome recent media attention on this issue which is usually the focus of attention in January when people get involved in campaigns such as "Weigh the Nation", fitness regimes and so on.  However, by mid-February the media has forgotten about it and many New Year's resolutions have gone out the window.  I would like this issue to be tackled in the same manner as we tackled smoking, suicide and mental health awareness.  We need to address this massive problem in our country.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_274" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_601">I thank the Deputy for raising this hugely important issue.  If we do not address it we may end up the first generation to bury the generation behind it, which is not the natural order of things or what any parent ever wants to be involved in.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased with alarming speed over the past 30 or so years, so much so that the World Health Organisation calls it a "global epidemic".  The problem has been exacerbated in recent years as a result of our changing social, economic and physical environment and by a dramatic reduction in physical activity and changing dietary patterns.  It is projected that if current trends are maintained half the population of the United States will be obese by 2025.  The disease is now a major public health problem throughout Europe.  The situation in Ireland mirrors the global obesity epidemic, with 61% of Irish adults now overweight or obese.  Most worrying of all is the fact that childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in Europe, with body overweight now the most prevalent childhood disease.  Some 25% of Irish children aged 5-12 and 20% of teenagers are either overweight or obese.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">Childhood obesity is of particular interest to me.  Obesity is a condition in which weight gain has reached the point of seriously endangering health.  Some people may exhibit a genetic predisposition to weight gain but in general overweight and obesity in individuals is an excess of energy intake over energy expended.  Obesity in children is of major concern in that it causes a wide range of serious health and social consequences and increases the likelihood of adult morbidity.  The health consequences of overweight children during childhood are less clear but a systematic review shows that childhood obesity is strongly associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, orthopaedic problems and mental disorders.  Moreover, childhood obesity is linked to lower self-esteem. More than 60% of children who are overweight before puberty will be overweight in early adulthood, reducing the average age at which non-communicable diseases become apparent and greatly increasing the burden on health services, which have to provide treatment during much of their adult life.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">Earlier this year, a special action group on obesity was established, comprising key stakeholders to examine and progress a number of issues to address the problem of obesity.  Alone no single initiative will reverse the trend but a combination of measures should make a difference.  For this reason the group is concentrating on a range of measures, including actions such as calorie posting in restaurants, the introduction of a sugar tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, nutritional labelling, restrictions on the marketing of food and drink to children, the improved detection and treatment of obesity, revised healthy eating guidelines and the promotion of physical activity.  The group will liaise with other Departments and organisations as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">The Health Service Executive continues its work on many programmes and services to help prevent and treat obesity, including the provision of nutritional programmes, the roll out of national physical activity programmes, the community games and the all-Ireland media campaign "Little Steps".  Equally the Department, in conjunction with other organisations and Departments, is involved in a number of programmes that encourage the adoption of healthy lifestyles.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">The World Health Organisation recommends that no more than 10% of daily energy should come from added sugar.  It has serious concerns over the high and increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks by children in many countries.  Sugar-sweetened carbonated drinks seem to be a contributory factor to the obesity epidemic.  Research in the US shows that adolescents there now consume more calories from drink than do from the food they eat.  The Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance conducted the national children's food survey in 2005,a survey of the diets of children in Ireland aged 5-12.  Preliminary analysis shows a high intake of fat and sugar, a low intake of vitamins and minerals and high physical inactivity with 7-10 year olds spending three hours in front of a TV and-or computer screen every night.  Looking specifically at foods from the top shelf of the food pyramid, every day children consumed 17 grams of chocolate, 11 grams of non-chocolate confectionery, 12 grams of savoury snacks and 26 grams of biscuits, cakes and pastries.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">We take this problem seriously.  The Government is basing its policy on evidenced based information.  The Deputy may be aware that I recently visited the United Nations for the second ever meeting of the UN on a health matter, namely, non-communicable diseases.  Each of the nations, developing and developed, are facing huge problems in relation to their health budgets and their ability to look after their people if we do not address this serious issue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_275">
            <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
            <p eId="para_608">I thank the Minister for his reply.  I do not believe this problem will be solved by the Department of Health alone.  The Departments of Education and Skills; the Environment, Community and Local Government in terms of local authority housing location and infrastructure; and Transport, Tourism and Sport in terms of safe mobility, be it by foot or bicycle also have a role to play.  Also, our national broadcaster has a role to play in regard to the times when advertisements for particular types of food are shown.  Obviously it is in the advertiser's interest that these be shown when children are likely to be watching.  The statistics on this are startling.  It is estimated that 400,000 children in Ireland are currently obese.  We cannot ignore that.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">As a country that prides itself on being one of the world's finest food producers, I encourage the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to engage, not alone with the food industry but with the games industry on this issue.  The Minister referred earlier to the time children are spending in front of games consoles.  While children will do this perhaps the games industry has an obligation to, through its games, encourage movement in children.  There is one obvious game console on the market which encourages a lot of movement.  There is an obligation on all of us to tackle this issue.  If we bury our heads in the sand and pretend there is no problem, just as people did when they said smoking did not cause cancer, we will be only burying it for a future generation.  We have an obligation to do more than we are currently doing.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_610">I could not agree more with Deputy O'Donovan.  This is a cross-departmental and cross-governmental issue, which is the reason the meeting was held by the United Nations.  It is clear we can learn from one another.  We all know there are vested interests involved here and that when it comes to advertising, high-sugar drinks and high-fat foods should not be shown when young children are watching television.  We need to introduce regulations to deal with that issue.  Equally, the display of calories on the contents of various foodstuffs is required.  While there is some voluntary participation in this regard even that is skewed.  There is a particular well known brand of snack which states on the package that the snack contains 130 calories.  However, on reading the back of the package one finds it states in the small print that the package contains almost 500 calories, the first calorific count relating to a recommended portion.  We are conducting research on this issue within the Department and are discussing with other Departments how it can be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">Deputy O'Donovan is correct that the Departments of Education and Skills; Transport, Tourism and Sport; the Environment, Community and Local Government; Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; Health; Children and Youth Affairs; and Justice and Equality have a role to play in creating a safe environment for people.  Part of the problem is that it is much easier for parents to have their child sitting at home playing a games console or watching telly where they can keep an eye on them than it is for them to allow them out on the street to play.  However, that is not the healthy option.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">We have been in touch with Mayor Bloomberg's office.  The Deputy Mayor, Ms Linda Gibbs, is currently visiting Ireland and I hope to make contact with her tomorrow to discuss some of the initiatives they have taken in New York in relation to this issue.  We have a long way to go in terms of calorie posting and letting people know what is contained in what they are eating and drinking.</p>

          <heading>Social Welfare Code</heading>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcNamara" eId="spk_277">
            <from>Deputy Michael McNamara</from>
            <p eId="para_613">I wish to bring to the attention of the House anomaly in the social welfare code regarding the entitlement of retained firefighters to jobseeker's allowance which is affecting many of them across the country and in my constituency, Clare.  Clare has 77 retained firefighters based at Ennis, Shannon, Scarriff, Ennistymon, Kilkee, Killaloe, and Kilrush fire stations.  There is only one full-time firefighter in the whole of the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">A retained firefighter will be paid €8,000 per year, a remuneration that everyone will accept could not support a family.  The number of call-outs has also reduced significantly, so a supplementary amount the firefighters earned for call-outs is considerably down too.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">In better times, most of the retained firefighters had other employment locally.  In the current economic climate, however, unemployment is high and local jobs are not as easily available.  One condition of jobseeker's allowance, or dole as it is commonly called, is that recipients are available for work.  When firefighters are on call, they must be within 2 km of their fire station, however.  Deciding officers from the Department of Social Protection have concluded these firefighters are placing unreasonable restrictions on their availability to work, therefore not entitling them to jobseeker's allowance.  It is also somewhat unfair as there are not many jobs available in many of the surrounding areas in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">Up to a quarter of retained firefighters in Clare were getting jobseeker's allowance.  Some have been informed they are entitled to it; others, that they are not.  As they may not be called out 19.5 hours a week, they do not qualify for family income supplement.  If they leave the fire service, they will not be entitled to other social welfare payments because they voluntarily left work.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">More importantly, if they left the fire service, where would that leave an essential community service?  These men and women who put their lives on the line to provide a service to our communities are essentially being penalised by the social welfare code.  This is an obvious anomaly and contrary to what the Government wants to achieve in making it attractive to work and provide a service to one's community.  This anomaly needs to be addressed.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_278" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_618">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work to be entitled to a jobseeker's payment.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an ongoing basis is not entitled to such payment.  Unlike other jobseekers who must sign off the live register on any day on which they find work, part-time firefighters are paid a jobseeker's payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire-fighting or training.  They are, however, required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseekers payment, that is they must continue to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  In this respect, departmental deciding officers do not treat them differently to any other jobseeker.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">In applying the legislation, deciding officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality, the age and educational qualifications together with the family circumstances of the particular claimant.  The legislation does not impose any restriction or limitation on the right of a person to the opportunity to engage in the employment of his or her choice.  Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment and there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature, he or she would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">However, if there is no work available locally, the jobseeker must seek employment in the surrounding areas.  It may be necessary also to extend their availability to different categories of employment rather than confine their availability to a particular type of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">After a period of unemployment, a person must be prepared to accept any employment for which he or she is qualified.  It is a principle of the availability for work condition that a person's unemployment must be involuntary.  It is not possible for an unemployed person to hold herself or himself available exclusively for employment that is in a restricted distance from a fire station where he or she is employed as a part-time firefighter.  Such action would be taken as placing an unreasonable restriction on his or her availability to secure full-time employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">A person may be regarded as not being available for work if he or she imposes unreasonable restrictions on the nature of the employment, the hours of work, the rate of pay, the duration of the employment, the location of the employment and other conditions of employment which he or she is prepared to accept.  A deciding officer may impose a disallowance in a case where a person refuses an offer of suitable employment or where he or she imposes unreasonable restrictions on the location of the employment he or she is prepared to accept.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">Issues relating to the eligibility of firefighters for jobseeker's payments have been raised with the Department on several occasions over the years.  Taking account of the unusual circumstances of these workers and general efforts to develop and standardise our jobseeker schemes, a group has been established in the Department to examine the position of firefighters.  It will be reporting to the Minister over the coming period.  She will keep relevant Deputies informed as this issue is progressed and would welcome any suggestions they may have.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">Key to the Minister's considerations will be recognition of the valuable service which this group of workers provide to their local communities.  However, it is also important that the integrity of the jobseeker schemes be maintained.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcNamara" eId="spk_279">
            <from>Deputy Michael McNamara</from>
            <p eId="para_626">I welcome the announcement that the position of retained firefighters on jobseeker's allowance is being considered.  If declining employment that is beyond a certain distance of a fire station is considered unreasonable, the whole rural fire service becomes untenable.  It relies on men and women being available within 2 km of their fire station when on call.  We have a choice of leaving the social welfare code as it is and abandoning essential rural fire services.  To professionalise all rural services would be an expensive step for the State given the paucity of call-outs, however.  Having a full-time fire service in every small town would be prohibitively expensive.  Accordingly, the alternative would be a change to the social welfare code which is necessary in these circumstances.</p>

I want to put on record my appreciation of the brave men and women who perform this essential service for our rural communities and who often lay their lives on the line in doing so.  It is in all our interests that this is examined closely for a resolution to be found to the satisfaction of all and one which does not compromise the jobseeker scheme or the fire service.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Leo Varadkar)</from>
            <p eId="para_629">The State Airports Act 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork as independent airports.  As part of the restructuring process at the time, the boards of Cork and Shannon airports were required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.  These plans were necessary in order that the then Ministers for Transport and Finance could be satisfied as to the financial and operational readiness of the airport authorities before assets could be transferred.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">While the three State airport authorities commenced work on the preparation of their business plans, with the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, co-ordinating the process, a range of issues delayed separation.  These included the need to build up the DAA's distributable reserves, the discussion on the allocation of debt to Cork in return for the transfer of assets on separation, the negotiation and implementation of measures to address Shannon's cost base and the funding of the DAA's capital investment programme.  While some of these issues had been progressed in 2008, by then the impact of the global recession had begun to be strongly felt in the aviation sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">In December 2008, the chairmen of the three airport authorities forwarded business plans to the then Minister and drew attention to the impact of the recession on the viability of airport separation.  The Minister considered the business plans of the three airports and the opinions of the boards and accepted their overall conclusion that it would be best to defer the separation of the three airports.  He took the view that it would be appropriate to provide a reasonable period to enable the boards and management of these airports to address the significant challenges facing the aviation market at the time.  Accordingly, he decided to defer a decision on separation to 2011.  The Government agreed to this proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">Pending a decision on separation, the boards of management of Cork and Shannon airports continued to carry out devolved responsibilities in respect of the day-to-day management, development and promotion of their respective airports with appropriate accountability to the DAA.  Under these revised governance arrangements, the chairmen of the Cork and Shannon airport authorities have been appointed to the DAA board and DAA senior executives have been appointed to the boards of the Cork and Shannon airport authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">In May, I asked the boards of the three State airports for their opinions on the question of establishing Cork and Shannon as independent airports under the State Airports Act 2004.  The three airports have responded and their submissions are being carefully examined.  In the context of that examination, I am considering all available options for the future of Cork and Shannon airports.  I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on the issue before the end of the year.  The critical issue is that, with falling passenger numbers, both Cork and Shannon are loss making and would not be sustainable without the support of the DAA.  Given the current financial position of the DAA, this cross-subsidisation is not sustainable in the long term.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">I thank the Minister for his reply.  Fianna Fáil wants to see three strong State airports.  They should not be separated, as none could survive on its own.  This is not merely a profit and loss situation.  We must consider the airports from the perspective of regional development and their importance to tourism and jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">The Minister confirmed that he received the submissions from the three airports that he sought in May.  When does he intend to consider the various boards' submissions fully and when will he make a public decision?  Has he had a chance to examine the submissions yet?</p>

            <p eId="para_636">I am interested to hear that Fianna Fáil is now against the separation of the three State airports, as it was that party's original policy.  Was it properly thought through at the time?  Was there ever a realistic prospect, given the fact that Cork and Shannon airports are losing so much money every year?</p>
            <p eId="para_637">I favour separation and breaking up the DAA's monopoly, but this can only be done on a sustainable basis.  There is no point in separating the airports only to see one or two of them going bust in a short period.  Ideally, the decision must be made by the end of the year.  There is no point in appointing boards in Cork and Shannon if separation is not to proceed.  I have received submissions from Cork and Shannon airports and from the DAA.  It will take time, study and consultation with politicians and interest groups in the region before a decision can be made.</p>

          when the recommendations of the review of the proposed capital projects of metro north, BXD, the DART airport linkup and the DART underground will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_639">As the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport.  Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority, NTA, on December 2009, the implementation and development of infrastructure projects in the greater Dublin area, such as metro north, the DART underground, a DART link to the airport and Luas BXD, fall under the remit of the NTA.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">Regarding Government policy on public transport investment, the comprehensive review of capital expenditure is under way.  This review is being overseen by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and takes place against a background of new funding realities.  It is examining capital programmes and projects, taking account of their overall economic impact and job creation potential.  The level of funding available for public transport investment from 2012 to 2016 will depend on the outcome of this review.  A major consideration for transport investment during the next five years will be the need to prioritise funding to protect investment made to date and to maintain high safety standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Regarding large public transport projects in the Dublin area, the availability of funding, both from the Exchequer and private sources, will be a key consideration in the capital review, as will the contribution to transport objectives, including the potential to add value to existing services and create employment.  The outcome of the review should be available in the next few weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_642">We are still waiting on the review, but signals have been given out to the effect that metro west will not go ahead.  There is merit in the idea that at least one of these projects should not be scrapped.  The one that would deliver the most would be metro north.  More than €200 million has been spent on these projects, some €150 million of that on metro north.  This money was spent on consultants, architects, residents meetings, etc.  The Minister has attended meetings, but I have attended more meetings about metro north than anyone.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">I hope we do not go down the road of scrapping everything.  It has been hinted that the DART link-up would be a better, more deliverable and less expensive project, but metro north would deliver the most jobs, have the most impact across the city and link the north and south sides with the airport, Ikea, Ballymun, DCU and new areas with large populations, such as Swords.  Metro north would take traffic off the roads and create jobs along ancillary routes.  We are in economically difficult times, but we must continue to create jobs via capital projects like metro north.</p>

            <p eId="para_644">Metro west has not been scrapped.  It still exists as a long-term project.  The railway reservation will be maintained.  It is not appropriate to spend more money on consultants, lawyers and so on if we must repeat the process in 15 years time, given that there is no visibility as to when the project can be funded.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">I agree with the Deputy on metro north.  It is very good project and would benefit my constituency enormously.  I would love to be able to deliver it to my constituents during my term in office but it is the most expensive project by a mile and requires both private and public finances, neither of which are available, apparently, although this may change.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">We will not do anything to prevent metro north, the DART underground and the Luas BXD line from going ahead in the future.  If it is not possible for all, or any, of those projects to proceed during the term of this Government, we will ensure they get to the end-of-railway-order stage and have planning permission such that they will be shovel-ready when it is possible to proceed.  We will protect the reservations to make sure nothing gets built in the way.</p>

            <p eId="para_647">I hear what the Minister is saying.  One certainly gets the impression that money will be a big problem.  The Government is talking about raising €5 billion, some of which will go towards job creation.  I am not necessarily saying I agree with the selling off of State assets — because I do not — but I believe this project would deliver a lot of jobs and benefits to the people of Dublin.  I refer in particular to the link to Dublin Airport.  Dublin is the only major city that does not have a rail link up to its airport.</p>

            <p eId="para_648">I expressed my view previously that I would be in favour of the sale of State assets if the money could be reinvested in the economy.  I would very much like to see that reinvestment in transport projects.  If one considers the cost of metro north, for example, and to a lesser extent that of the DART underground, one will conclude that if we sold assets worth €5 billion, the only project the money would be invested in would be that project.</p>

            <p eId="para_650">The funding of public service obligation, PSO, services is governed by public transport contracts between the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the three CIE subsidiaries.  In 2011, Dublin Bus will receive, through the NTA, an estimated €72.4 million in Exchequer subvention.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">Decisions on the overall level of subvention available for PSO services in 2012 will be made following the comprehensive review of expenditure currently being undertaken by Government.  It is inevitable that, in the current fiscal environment, there will be a significant reduction in the level of subvention in 2012 and the following years.  I support a continuation of the efforts by the company to improve its efficiency and reduce the costs of providing PSO services.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_652">In 2000, the then Department of Public Enterprise produced a report on subvention.  Dublin was ranked third lowest by comparison with other cities in terms of what it received.  Its percentage was 4% while that for Bergen in Norway was 1.5% and that for Belfast was 2%.  In Belfast 98% of revenue came from fares and in Dublin 96% of revenue came from fares.  Dublin is the biggest city in Ireland and is supposed to be competing with the modern cities in Europe, yet its subvention is one of the lowest in Europe.  Other cities have modern railways, bus services and other transport services, yet Dublin Bus has experienced cuts in the order of €60 million to €70 million over recent years.  There is talk of certain projects not going ahead, yet the subvention is being cut.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">Buses will be key to transport in Dublin in the coming years.  Some 120 buses are gone.  This is not good enough and we must think outside the box.  I cannot accept that we must accept the troika's decisions in this regard such that we cannot invest in our bus and transport services.  Investment is crucial because services are at full capacity at peak times and we cannot make further cuts.  The next cuts will affect wages and staff.  Does the Minister of State believe this will be the case?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Kelly</from>
            <p eId="para_654">There are no decisions made on the subvention that will be in place in the next few years.  I have some sympathy with what the Deputy is saying about Dublin's subvention being one of the lowest in Europe.  The Deloitte report on Dublin Bus showed it was a superbly run organisation.  It offers a great service and has delivered for its customers.  The Network Direct programme has proven to be very efficient.  Noteworthy savings have been made in this regard.  Given the economic circumstances, we have no choice but to re-examine this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">The percentage of subvention has not been defined but in the next few years other efficiencies will be achieved that I hope will help Dublin Bus.  Many will be technology driven.  We recently launched various technology tools that will help improve efficiency and increase the customer base.  It is a question of doing this and then considering the cuts that will be necessary over the coming years.  We are left in an unenviable position so we will have to achieve greater efficiencies.  I am in favour of retaining as many services as possible.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_656">Dublin Bus has already lost 120 buses and this has had an impact on efficiency.  I had a meeting with Dublin Bus this morning about bus route Nos. 19 and 68.  The cuts have had an impact and people are returning to their cars.  The system is not efficient.  We will face charges of up to €1 billion over the next five years under the Kyoto protocol if we do not honour the agreement, yet we are reducing the number of buses.  Does the Minister of State not believe we should be retaining buses rather than reducing their number?  If the next level of subvention will be such that there will be cuts to wages and staff, it will have an even greater impact.  Does the Minister of State believe this will be the case?</p>

            <p eId="para_657">We will try to retain the maximum number of services.  In doing so, we will try to lower costs, drive more people onto the buses and create efficiencies so people will be more interested in using public transport.  We will exploit every opportunity to encourage this and lessen the loss of services.  Greater efficiencies are being achieved through Network Direct and there are greater interchanges.  People are getting around more quickly than before.  I have seen the reports myself and acknowledged the gains that have been made.  Not everything is perfect but progress has been made.  I am happy progress has been made.  It is our intention to achieve what we must, unfortunately, achieve over the next two years but retain as many services as possible.</p>

My Department is currently exploring efficiencies that can be achieved by bringing together aspects of HSE transport, school transport, the rural transport programme and other transport services.

The rural transport scheme is a very significant and important scheme, especially to smaller communities, from which I come myself.  The scheme is of great advantage to the less well-off, the marginalised and elderly.  It gives them an opportunity to travel that they would not normally have if the scheme were not in place.  Could the Minister be a little more specific and state when the reviews will be published?  People are worried.</p>

            <p eId="para_662">I probably come from a smaller rural community than Deputy Troy and, therefore, am very conscious of and passionate about this issue.  I fully intend to support transport services in rural areas because I know their value very much.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">The two reports will be published very shortly.  The issues that will transcend not just the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport but also other areas are being considered.  In particular, we are examining school transport, transport related to health services, particularly HSE transport, and issues pertaining to voluntary and community transport services that are being provided.  In that context, the issues transcend the Department and the need to consider this.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">The commitment is in the programme for Government and the Government is determined to deal with it in the short and medium terms.  It is a priority for the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">The rural transport scheme has provided great services in rural Ireland, which have been quite successful in some areas and less successful in others.  Many of the people who operate these services are determined to provide rural areas with good transport services.  However, it is necessary to examine how we can bring together bus services, whether provided by Bus Éireann or community or voluntary groups, and examine all other services in an area so there can be greater connectivity while we make the money we have go further.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_670">As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, therefore, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter for the NRA.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">It is the case, in the context of the capital review, that there will be limited scope to progress new road development projects in the short to medium term and the Oilgate to Rosslare scheme is one of a number of projects which have reached route corridor selection phase but which will not progress to construction for some time.  As I indicated previously, I am reluctant to cancel such projects given that they are designed for their long-term benefit to the State although I am conscious of the potential implications for development in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">For now, I think it has to be a matter for the relevant local authorities in their capacity as planning authorities to assess how best to balance development needs in the area with protecting route corridors for future road upgrades.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_673">When I challenged the county manager on this issue, he was very quick to state it was being driven by the NRA, that it had nothing to do with him and that he merely takes instruction.  I do not know how familiar the Minister is with the project, but very few people of sane mind in the county believe it should go ahead.  It is difficult to understand from where the thinking is coming given that hospital beds in Wexford hospital are closed.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">The project is to build a motorway to bypass the one already bypassing Wexford town, although there are no hold-ups worth speaking about on the roundabouts, and this is pure nonsense.  There was a fanciful notion that some day Rosslare might become a port to rival Rotterdam, but given that the five berths there are not deep enough and that it would cost €200 million to make them a sensible option for large boats I do not see it happening in the near or long-term future.  Does the Minister think this would be a complete waste of money?  If this is the case, why does the Government not make the sensible decision to abandon it now?  The notion that it might be done in 20 years has been mentioned but God knows what route might be taken then.  More than likely, at most the existing route would be expanded.</p>

            <p eId="para_675">I will travel to Wexford this evening to attend a dinner and I will speak at a conference in Rosslare in the morning so I will have two opportunities to travel the road tomorrow and have a good look at it and see what condition it is in.  There is a good case for maintaining long-term reservations.  The Harcourt Street line was maintained for 40 or 50 years and we are glad it was because we were able to build the Luas.  The same can be said about the Dunboyne and Navan line.  I would be very reluctant to cancel reservations where motorways may be built, even if it were in 30 or 50 years time.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">However, we do need planning authorities to be pragmatic, and the NRA needs to be pragmatic about planning along these routes.  Certainly, I do not believe that construction such as farm buildings, temporary structures, sheds and greenhouses should be barred along these roads if the road will not be built in a reasonable period of time.  I will have to do some work on this in the next while.</p>

            <p eId="para_677">Is the Minister stating there should not be a freeze on building along the 300 m corridor?  Depending on the NRA to have a sensible approach to this might be stretching it and asking a bit much, given that it is a self-sustaining body which is probably a little out of control at this stage.  It would cover the island in concrete if it had its way without there necessarily being any sense behind it.</p>

They should not allow a shopping centre to be built but there may be forms of low-scale development that could be permitted on these routes.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_682">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 14 and 217 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">The jobs initiative introduced a 9% VAT rate from 1 July on a range of services,  including hotels and restaurants.  The Government also halved employers' PRSI for those on modest wages.  These measures are of considerable benefit to tourism businesses, lowering their cost base and allowing them to offer a more competitive product to tourists.  The industry needs to play its part in passing on these cost reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_684">At this stage it is too early to assess the impact of these measures on either tourism numbers or on employment in the sector.  With regard to tourism numbers, we will need to consider the figures on an annual basis to assess properly the impact of the initiative.  With regard to the impact of these measures on sustaining employment in the tourism sector, the most recent figures from the CSO relate only to quarter 2 of 2011 so do not measure the impact of the jobs initiative and it will be later this year or early next year before we can properly form a view on the effect of these measures on employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">Based on these and other relevant figures, the VAT cut will be reviewed before the end of 2012 with a view to deciding if it should be continued.  Although the CSO figures are not yet available, it should be noted that a recent survey by the Restaurant Association of Ireland showed that in July and August 490 new jobs were created in the sector and attributed this in part of the jobs initiative measures and to the change in joint labour committees, JLCs.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">The growth incentive scheme, essentially a rebate scheme for airlines in return for passenger growth, is one of the three elements of an aviation package aimed at increasing tourist numbers.  The package also includes a commitment to abolish the travel tax, subject to agreement on the reinstatement of routes and the restoration of lost capacity, and a more targeted co-operative marketing of new routes from key source tourism markets.  The impact of the overall package can be measured only when data for the full year is available.  The abolition of the travel tax has been deferred pending a further review of the situation next spring.  However, I am pleased to report that overseas tourism numbers increased by 11% for the year to the end of July in comparison to the same period last year, and I have every confidence the tourism industry will exceed the targets set for this year.</p>

            <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
            <p eId="para_687">The Minister stated it is too early to state what major effect this has had and I take this on board.  How is the Minister monitoring this to ensure the savings are passed on?  I accept a large majority of people in the hospitality sector are passing them on, but some are not.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">The Minister also mentioned the operation of the growth incentive scheme.  What has been the response of the airlines to this scheme?</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_689">The measures only commenced in July.  Therefore, it will be a few months before we have the statistics from July, August and September.  That will give us a chance to judge the effect of them then.  The measures I am most interested in are jobs in the sectors concerned and tourist numbers.  I am much more interested in the reduction being passed on in terms of new jobs being created than, necessarily, it being passed on directly to consumers.  It was a jobs initiative after all.  I am pleased to see that at least in the restaurant sector employment appears to have increased.  We do not yet know about the hotel sector but we will have a good idea of that when the quarterly national household survey figures come out in a few months time.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">On the airlines, the response was not what we had expected.  Airlines welcomed the proposal to abolish the travel tax but were not prepared to commit to do anything unless other measures were introduced, including reductions in airport charges, which we could not manage.  I will announce agreements in the next few weeks on co-operative marketing.  Essentially, the money that we are continuing to draw from the travel tax will be invested in co-operative marketing with airlines and tour operators.  I will announce the details of that when it is finalised in a few weeks time.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
            <p eId="para_691">The initiative was largely welcomed by the tourism and hospitality sector.  I am interested to see how many full-time jobs it will create.  Like Deputy Troy, I would like to know if there is any indication of the percentage of businesses that have failed to pass on the savings.  I know of a few myself, as I am sure everyone else does.  Does the Government have any comeback in those instances or is it just a matter for the markets to deal with?</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_692">I do not have figures on how many of the industry players have passed on the reductions.  They are required to pass it on in law in the sense that the rate is not 13.5% anymore — it is 9% — but one cannot stop them increasing their prices by 4.5% to make up the difference.  There are many factors involved in price.  Many say, correctly, that energy prices have gone up significantly and had it not been for this measure they would have had to increase their prices but instead they have frozen them.  I am happy that the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland have called on their members to pass on the VAT reduction to consumers.  When I travel around the country, pretty much every hotel I stay in has a little sign from the Irish Hotels Federation saying it has passed on the VAT reduction.  I am not sure whether that is there for my benefit.</p>

            <p eId="para_694">I will check out the Ferrycarrig Hotel in Wexford tonight and we will find out.  The major objective of the Government in doing it was to sustain and create jobs in the sector, not necessarily to make it 4% cheaper to go to a restaurant or stay in a hotel.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_312" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_696">The Minister for Finance announced the proposed suspension of the €3 travel tax as part of a three-pronged strategy aimed at increasing inbound tourism in the jobs initiative in May.  This strategy involved not only the proposed suspension of the travel tax, but also the introduction of a new growth incentive scheme by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and more targeted and co-operative marketing of new routes from key source tourism markets by Tourism Ireland, the DAA and airlines to encourage more tourists to fly into Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">The Government made it clear from the outset that the travel tax would only be suspended if the airlines responded positively to these initiatives in terms of restoring routes and capacity.  My officials and I held a number of meetings with the main airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, to establish what new services they might introduce or reinstate to take advantage of the incentives on offer from the Government and DAA but their response was disappointing and the Government decided to retain the travel tax pending a further review next spring.  I also wrote to more than 20 other airlines currently servicing the Irish market or who may be interested in entering the Irish market informing them of the initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">I am not currently in active discussions with the airlines on this initiative but I have undertaken to re-examine it if they are prepared to introduce additional routes and capacity for summer 2012 and the airlines know that I remain open to discussions with them on this basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">In the meantime, I have the agreement of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform that a significant proportion  of the revenue  generated from the retention of the tax will be made available for a targeted co-operative marketing effort.  Tourism Ireland is finalising plans in this regard at present  in conjunction with the airlines, airports, ferry companies, tour operators and others.</p>

            <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
            <p eId="para_700">I thank the Minister.  It is disappointing that the airlines have not taken on board what the Government wanted.  It is not good news.  However, it is welcome that the €3 charge is being put into a specific fund.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, alluded to it previously when I was in the Chamber.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">The Minister referred to a significant percentage.  Perhaps he would state what percentage of the fund will be invested in tourism.  Is it intended for a specific area of tourism such as marketing or can people seek capital funding?  How long will the scheme last?  The Minister referred to going back to the airlines again next year.  If they do what he requests, will the €3 tax be abolished and the fund come to an end?  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate a little more on what the money will be spent on and specifically how much?</p>

            <p eId="para_702">I will elaborate as much as I can but nothing is finalised yet.  It is not that I am holding back information but that matters have not been fully decided yet.  The new Government found itself in the same boat as the previous one in the sense that the previous Government reduced the tax from €10 to €3, the airlines having complained bitterly about it, but it got nothing back from the airlines for it.  We offered to reduce the tax from €3 to zero but we got very little back from them for it either.  As we are not abolishing it between now and——</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_707">The approximate amount of money we will take in because we have not abolished the tax between now and the end of the year is €9 million.  Half of that is being made available to Tourism Ireland for co-operative marketing and other initiatives with airlines, ferry companies, tour operators and others.  Essentially, a call went out to those bodies to come in with their tourism and marketing plans.  Obviously they have to contribute to them.  It is not free money for an airline; it must cough up some money of its own as well.  The €4 million or so will leverage more when one includes what will come from the airlines and tour operators.  The key issue is companies must come back with a marketing plan, proposals and promotions that we consider will be of benefit and will increase tourism.  Tourism Ireland is finalising those now with a view to agreeing some but not all within the next week or so.  I will make an announcement in the House once I have the information and the agreements are signed.  Who knows what will happen next year.  Nothing has yet been decided for next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">I wish to ask a brief supplementary question.  It relates to an issue I raised when I spoke on the tourism Bill last week.  Perhaps the Minister would consider ensuring that each county has a tourism officer.  The tourism officer has been lost to Westmeath in recent weeks.  I do not mean to be parochial but it is important for each individual county to have someone designated specifically to market the tourism attractions in the area, or perhaps there could even be a regional officer.  It is worth considering using the fund for that purpose.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_709">I would rather not do that because it is just a one-off fund.  It will not be there forever so one might be able to hire someone for three or four months and then they would be gone.  I do not know what the benefits from that would be.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">I welcome the fact that local authorities take an interest in tourism.  I particularly welcome the fact that local communities and chambers of commerce take an interest in tourism and promoting their own towns and villages but there are too many players in the tourism market and I would prefer that local authorities, by and large, would concentrate on keeping towns and villages clean rather than trying to duplicate the work of Fáilte Ireland and the existing bodies.</p>

            <p eId="para_715">Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority, NTA, on 1 December 2009, the implementation of infrastructure projects in the greater Dublin area, such as the real time passenger information, RTPI, now comes under the remit of the NTA.  The authority's functions were subsequently extended by ministerial order to include provision of RTPI to the four major regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford and the contiguous areas of those counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">I have been advised by the NTA that the RTPI programme is to deliver 50 signs in Cork city by the end of this year. The other regional cities of Waterford, Limerick and Galway will follow next year.  The achievement of this target date is subject to the delivery of the interfaces which allow data from automatic vehicle location systems operated by Bus Éireann to be received by the real time system developed by ACIS technology for the NTA and its agent, Dublin City Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">Work is proceeding on testing data from Bus Éireann's AVL system for the required level of accuracy to build the confidence of customers in the system.  The authority plans to have a test sign available in October and have all signs lit in December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">As Cork is the first city for the RTPI system with Bus Éireann data, the resolution of the data and interface issues will result in a faster roll-out in the other regional cities next year.  The authority is also developing a solution which will be delivered in 2012 to allow private transport operators to relay their positional data to the RTPI system.</p>

            <p eId="para_721">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 11 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">These questions relate to the sale of the Government's stake in Aer Lingus.  The Government recently considered the various options open to it in terms of generating revenue from the sale of State assets, including the recommendations of the State assets review group in the McCarthy report.  That report recommended that the Government dispose of its shareholding in Aer Lingus "as soon as is opportune" but no decision has yet been made by the Government on a disposal of the State's shareholding in the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">In addition to the Government's recent decision to sell a minority stake in the ESB, the Government also agreed that it is prepared, in principle, to undertake further asset sales.  A process has been initiated to consider a number of potential assets in this context. The State's shareholding in Aer Lingus will be considered as part of this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">A group, led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and including my Department, other relevant Departments and the NTMA, will consider possibilities in this regard and advise the Government on the appropriate valuations to be placed on the assets in question.

            <p eId="para_725">We still do not know what the Government's position is on this matter.  That is the fundamental point.  If the sale goes ahead, will the money be reinvested in the economy or will it be used to bring down our debt?</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_328" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_726">The only definite decision that has been made by the Government on the sale of State assets is the sale of a minority stake in the ESB but there are a lot of other candidates for further State asset sales, including Aer Lingus.  A lot of work must be done first, before the Government comes to the point where it is willing to sell that stake, both in terms of scoping out potential buyers, seeing what terms and conditions they may be willing to accept as part of the sale, and also sorting out the pension deficit which is the main issue now devaluing the company.  The company would be worth a lot more if the pension deficit could be sorted out by the end of the year.  All those things have to be done first before a final decision can be made on the sale of the State's stake.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">Discussions are now under way between the troika and the Government on whether we will be allowed to reinvest the money in the economy.  It is the Government's view, and very much my view, that at least some or most of the money that can be raised from State asset sales should be reinvested in the economy — in infrastructure and jobs.  There would be a lot more enthusiasm in the Government for going ahead with State asset sales if that were the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_728">It seems fairly clear that there is an intent to sell the rest of the Government's stake in Aer Lingus.  That is a shame because Aer Lingus has served the country well as the flagship airline for many years.  In addition, it has delivered a profitable organisation.  What is probably holding up the sale of Aer Lingus at the moment is the pension fund.  That is another issue we will have to deal with but it is a shame that we are going down this road.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">We are blaming the troika and Europe for the fact that we have to get money.  The Minister said he does not even know whether, in selling the rest of Aer Lingus, we will be able to invest that money in other projects to create jobs.  We will possibly end up with Ryanair in control of our main airline, which is a shame.  A private company will be in charge of our national airline.  We saw what happened over the years when private companies took over.  They cut jobs and tended to pay a lot less to the remaining workers.  We are heading down that road now.  We had a profitable State-run institution in Aer Lingus.  It is not fully State-owned, although it should be.  I appeal to the Minister not to sell of the rest of the State's stake in Aer Lingus.  It would be a shame and should not happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_730">Aer Lingus is a private limited company and is traded on the stock market.  It is not a State-run company by any means.  It just happens to be a private company in which the State has a 25% stake.</p>

            <p eId="para_732">There is no question of Ryanair taking over Aer Lingus.  The European Commission has ruled that it may not do so on competitive grounds, and I support that.  In fact, Ryanair has expressed a willingness to sell its stake.  The Ryanair and Government stakes together make up 54% of the company, which could be very valuable and potentially of great interest to a buyer.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">The key question we have to ask ourselves about the 25% stake is what is the value to the State in retaining it.  Do we get a dividend from it?  No, we do not.  Does it give us any control of the company?  No, it does not.  We saw that when Aer Lingus pulled out of Shannon.  For example, does it allow us to hold on to the Heathrow slots?  No, it does not because one needs a 30% vote at an extraordinary general meeting to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">The issue of leave and return of employees arose in Aer Lingus where the company found itself paying a lot of money to the Revenue Commissioners because of this strange arrangement it had concerning leave and return.  I met the three Government-appointed directors of Aer Lingus on this issue and they could not tell me about it because it is a secret, even though we own 25% of the company.  That gives the Deputy an idea of how valuable the stake is.</p>

We should not have got to this point where we have allowed a private company to have more than the State's stake in what was a State-run company.  I do not think we should be selling off the rest of our State assets.  It is short-term thinking.  We have a profitable airline which has delivered great value to the Irish people, not just in terms of jobs but also in tourism and what it has given to the nation.</p>

            <p eId="para_738">It will be a great surprise to people that the State's 25% stake in Aer Lingus is what the Minister says it is.  It was sold on the basis that the 25% would protect the airline and keep it in State control.  The key benefit of having that control — I would like to hear the Minister's opinion on this — is that as an island nation we will not have to depend on a private business to run our airlines.  We need those strategic assets to run our country and should not sell them off to the highest bidder.</p>

            <p eId="para_739">Aer Lingus is a private company and so is Ryanair.  Therefore we do have private companies that control air access to Ireland.  That is already the case.  It is also the case for Britain, for example, where British Airways and British Midland are not owned by the State.  It is not that unusual and I am sure it is also the case for other island nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">It may well have been the case that at the time of the sale of the 75% stake in Aer Lingus, the remaining 25% stake was held for strategic reasons but it did not turn out that way.  We saw that when Aer Lingus pulled out of Shannon some years ago and there was nothing the then Government could do about it.  As regards the Heathrow slots, we know now that the 25% stake is not enough to block sales.  One would have to form an alliance with other shareholders to do so.  In addition, the slots are not as important as they were in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">In terms of getting information from the company, although we own a 25% stake we cannot even see the report on leave and return of employees because it is a secret which the board is keeping to itself.  That gives the Deputy a rough idea of the value of holding that stake.</p>

            <p eId="para_743">As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding of the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects including the N11-N25 Oilgate to Rosslare Harbour scheme is a matter for the NRA in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">In the overall context, the Deputy will be aware that a comprehensive review of capital spending is now under way, the results of which will form the basis for a new national development plan.  The review will also take account of new funding realities.  A major priority will be to ensure funding to protect and maintain the investment made to date and to maintain safety standards.  It is clear there will be little scope to advance, in the short to medium term, many of the infrastructural projects currently in planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">Given that the allocation of the funding referred to by the Deputy is statutorily a matter for the NRA, I will refer the Deputy's question to the NRA for direct reply.

            <p eId="para_747">The Minister will know that €2 million of taxpayers' money has been expended on choosing the route for a road we cannot afford to build.  A 300 m corridor is currently in place.  In the parish of Crossabeg alone, on the north side of Wexford town, 60 houses and 30 landowners are not in a position to move or sell their properties because of the proposed motorway.  That 300 m corridor, for all practical purposes, is sterilised and it is impossible for the people concerned to sell anything.  This is a significant problem, given that the motorway, if it is ever built, is a long time away.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">As regards the matter of the €3 million, Mott MacDonald were the consultants hired to report on the viability of building stage three of the project to reduce the corridor and they will also be doing the work.  These guys were given the €2 million in the first place and they will get the €3 million next time.  If any area is to be sterilised, the locals would prefer an area of 60 m rather than 300 m but the most favourable option would be to have no sterilisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">I understand the point made by the Minister and I agree that a shopping centre should not be permitted within this 300 m corridor — that is fair enough — but the notion that houses and land are sterilised and frozen in this chosen area is a bit outrageous when it is probable the motorway will never be built.</p>

            <p eId="para_750">I am conscious of the difficulties that arise in this case.  This is a very wide corridor of 300 m to 400 m, which if narrowed down to a more precise corridor would make life easier for many of the landowners in the area.  I can understand their predicament.  Unfortunately, there are about 20 other roads in a similar position and if I spend €3 million to narrow a corridor on each of these roads, this would cost €30 million or €40 million.  I question if this money would be well spent in narrowing a big corridor down to a smaller corridor or whether that money would be better spent building a bypass which would make life better for a whole town or whether it should be spent on road maintenance.  We will struggle to afford the maintenance costs in the coming years.  It is my judgment call whether to spend €20 million to €40 million in the next number of years to employ architects, planners and consultants to narrow corridors or to spend it on maintaining roads and building bypasses.</p>

            <p eId="para_751">I would not blame the Minister for not spending €3 million in narrowing the corridor but to be fair to the people who live in the 300 m corridor, will he agree this land should not be sterilised?  It is very unfair to leave it sterilised for such a long period of time.  There are too many citizens involved, with 60 houses and 30 landowners in this one parish and a great number of people are affected.  It is unfair to them.  This is an NRA project and the Government should decide that none of the land should be sterilised.  I would not blame the Minister for not spending €3 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_752">I do not think the area should be sterilised.  In my view, the NRA and the local authorities need to be pragmatic when it comes to planning applications in cases such as this.  Both my Department and I will need to study this aspect more closely.  It is the case in the UK that the rules are quite different and people can claim planning blight and say that the authorities there cannot hold reservations of land for such a long period, that they must either buy the land or leave the landowner alone.  We will need to do some work in that regard to see what options exist.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Michael Ring)</from>
            <p eId="para_755">The programme for Government provides that "In future sports funding should prioritise projects which further greater participation in sport on a local and national level".  I will be keeping this commitment in mind in the context of the allocation of any future sports funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">The sports capital programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city around the country.  The facilities funded range from new equipment for the smallest clubs, to regional multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.  Almost 7,500 allocations have been made since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over €743 million.  These grants continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring the provision of modern, high quality facilities around Ireland which attract more people to participate in sporting activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">Regarding the current expenditure funding for sports programmes, I can inform the Deputy that the Irish Sports Council has a statutory responsibility for the promotion and development of sport in Ireland.  One of the central functions of the council, and a key pillar in its statement of strategy, is to increase participation rates in sport.   Since its establishment in 1999, funding of almost €416 million has been provided to the Irish Sports Council towards initiating, developing and enhancing a wide range of programmes aimed at increasing participation and raising standards in Irish sport.  A further amount of €46.8 million has been provided this year.  The allocation for this year will allow the Irish Sports Council to implement the commitments in its strategic plan to increase participation in sport and to improve the levels of performance by our elite athletes in world-class competition.</p>

I was struck by the simplicity of the Sport England plan to deliver an additional 1 million people doing at least 30 minutes of sport three times a week by March 2013.  This is a target which people understand and to which they can relate.  Naturally, such a target requires a substantial plan.  Does the Minister of State think the Irish Sports Council could have a similar strategy?  Would funding be available as well as strategic and delivery timetables for increasing participation levels in sports?  What level of co-operation would be put in place with primary and secondary schools and colleges?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
            <p eId="para_759">Since this Government came into office, this Department has introduced initiatives to allocate funding to local authorities in particular.  I refer to initiatives under the sports capital programme which are to help local authorities to provide facilities in areas where sporting organisations are not established.  I refer to Mugga Parks where children can play volleyball or basketball.  The Department allocated €1.2 million to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association.  This association has provided facilities to young people over many years and may not have received sufficient funds from other sources and the sports capital programme.  The association will administer the fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">The swimming pools initiative is an upgrading of swimming pools in order to encourage more people, in particular people with disabilities, to avail of them.  The local authorities have made the applications and we have spread that funding around the country.  In all fairness to the Department, we have looked at areas which in the past may not have received the required funding.  We are targeting areas where the facilities may not exist and to which they are entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">It is hoped to publish a new strategy to outline the Government position regarding the targeting of sport so more people will be encouraged to participate.  A recent survey showed that 15% of the population do not take part in any kind of sport.  This is bad for themselves and for their health.  We would not need as many doctors, hospitals or surgeons if people would do the simple things, such as walking, cycling or such like.  We are targeting these areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_765">In accordance with the programme for Government, I recognise the need to rebalance transport policy to favour public transport. The public transport system will play a critical role in supporting a return to sustainable economic growth, the maintenance of a competitive environment for investment and addressing the challenge of climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 enabled the granting of contracts for public service obligation, PSO, services on a direct award basis to Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann in respect of existing services and on a public tender basis for new services.  The direct award contracts with the bus companies apply for five years and ten years in the case of rail.  At the end of the five or ten year period, the NTA has discretion to renew, modify or terminate the direct award provision of services following a consultation process with interested parties under which the NTA is obliged to justify its approach.  In November 2010, the NTA published new guidelines for the licensing of public bus services which set out the basis for a reformed licensing system for commercial bus passenger services in the State.  The guidelines identify commercial bus passenger services as a key part of public transport services in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">In accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government to explore the benefit to the public transport passenger of more diverse bus service provision, I will consult with my ministerial colleagues on the future options for procurement of PSO bus services once I have completed my examination of the options.</p>

            <p eId="para_768">Ideologically,  I am opposed to the way the Government handles public transport.  I believe it should be run by the State and the companies.  Up to not long ago, that was the case but, unfortunately, we have seen a drive towards privatisation, which is a problem for citizens across the board.  It is clear also that public transport has suffered badly in terms of Government subsidies and Dublin Bus is the least subsidised service in Europe.  The Minister of State has acknowledged in the past that we are under-subsidised significantly in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">Recently, there have been cuts in various routes in Dublin Bus.  Has the Minister intervened in any way to stop the cuts that have been taking place in Dublin Bus?  This is a significant issue.  Communities all over the north west of Dublin and across the city have seen huge cuts in their services.  We keep kicking the blame around and blame the transport authority and others, but the Minister of State should demand a proper transport system is delivered and not allow Dublin Bus shut down services.</p>

            <p eId="para_770">It is a benefit that the Labour Party is in government and that a Labour Party Minister of State has responsibility for public transport.  We are fully committed to public transport and maintaining public services.  This is the bedrock of what the Labour Party stands for and I hope the Deputy appreciates that.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">With regard to Dublin Bus, as I have said previously, we are looking for efficiencies and because of this there will be an issue with the PSO over the next few years.  That said, we will try to maintain services as much as possible.  No doubt there will be issues, but there are some good news stories.  There is good news with regard to technology, passenger numbers and interconnections with services like the DART.  These good news stories will help push up passenger numbers and ensure the change in the level of subvention that must take place in the next few years will be minimised.  The problem is we are facing a difficult position.</p>

            <p eId="para_772">I acknowledge the good news with regard to the DART.  There is no doubt that there has been a big increase in passengers but I have noticed that since the changes have taken place in Dublin Bus, traffic has multiplied in some areas.  This morning the traffic queues on the back roads into Finglas were very long.  This is because of the cutbacks.  Ordinary areas have been cut out of the Dublin Bus service area and people are now using their cars.  This is a negative development.  The Minister of State should talk with Dublin Bus to prevent this.  The same issue has arisen at public meetings I have attended.</p>

The changes that have taken place with regard to the network and many of the routes have seen a significant increase in passenger numbers.  There may be issues in some areas, but in others we have seen increases in passenger numbers.  We will use every avenue we can to try and get more people to use the Dublin Bus service because it is one of the most beneficial and efficient ways to travel.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Kelly</from>
            <p eId="para_778">I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 35 and 43 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">Specific proposals such as providing taxi licences to public house owners in rural areas or determining vehicle standards that apply to taxi licences are currently matters which fall within the responsibility of the National Transport Authority, NTA, which regulates taxi services under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">The NTA revoked the "nine-year rule" relating to those renewing their standard taxi and hackney licences in 2011 who had applied for their first vehicle licences prior to 1 January 2009.  The NTA also undertook a review of relevant vehicle standards for SPSVs, which has included a public consultation process.  The aim of the NTA reform proposal is to improve the quality of service, comfort and safety of all passengers and drivers and its conclusions when finalised by the NTA will, in turn, also be considered by the taxi regulation review, which I chair.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">The review of taxi regulation is examining all aspects of taxi regulation and will make specific recommendations on matters such as licensing, enforcement, vehicles standards, supply issues in rural and urban areas and future dialogue with the taxi sector.  The review will enable the necessary further reforms of the sector to allow consumers to have confidence in the taxi system, while also ensuring that legitimate and competent operators and drivers will be rewarded for operating fairly under a regulatory framework that is adequately enforced.  Good progress is being made by the review steering group and I hope to report to Government on the recommendations of the review in November.  Subject to necessary approval of the review recommendations by Government, I then expect to make an early announcement of the outcome of the review</p>

This is an important issue in terms of rural communities and how they operate and I will attend the Oireachtas committee to hear what is said.  I hope the Minister of State will give specific consideration to the issue of the problem in country areas.  I am aware there are significant problems with regard to taxi regulation and I have made a submission to the review group which I hope the Minister of State will take on board.</p>

            <p eId="para_783">I thank the Deputy for his comments.  There are specific issues with regard to rural Ireland.  The issues that relate to the taxi and hackney industry in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford do not relate to the area from which I come, where there are no taxis.  This issue is completely different.  It is about creating a service that will work in both urban and rural areas and in order to do that we must look at the whole licensing process.  We are doing that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_786">I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 204 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">Officials from my Department maintain regular contact with the ports and various shipping companies and have been kept apprised of Stena Line's most recent adjustments to its services. Stena Line, as a commercial company, has taken a decision to introduce greater efficiencies and reduce its overall operating overheads in order to continue to provide services from Dún Laoghaire.  The <i>HSS Stena Explorer</i>, operating on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route, generates most of its turnover between May and September.  This coupled with high fuel costs leaves the remaining months unsustainable.  The company will continue to operate the route on a seasonal basis and services on the route are scheduled to resume in April 2012.  Passengers and freight customers can still avail of the company’s route between Dublin Port and Holyhead.  This route is served by two vessels and the company operates a year round schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">As the <i>HSS Stena Explorer </i>is a UK flagged vessel, I have no function in regard to employment on board the vessel but I understand that the company has commenced consultations with its staff on board the vessel and those on shore in Dún Laoghaire and their trade union representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">Over recent years the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company has been restructuring its business to keep it on a sustainable financial footing and to enable the harbour to develop and operate on a commercial basis into the future. This has inevitably led to job losses.  The company has also over the past number of years pursued a twin strategy of developing alternative income streams from marine leisure and tourism related business, while also reducing its high cost base.  The company has recently published a draft masterplan for public consultation for the future development of the harbour.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_357">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_790">I appeal to the Minister to put as much as pressure as he can on Stena Line to pull back from downgrading to a seasonal service from Dún Laoghaire because the Government has committed itself to developing tourism infrastructure and if we do not have a proper year round service in Dún Laoghaire, it will make a mockery of efforts to improve the such infrastructure.  It has always been a vital route in and out of the country and I do not believe for a minute that it is unviable.  Fuel costs could be reduced by using a different ship.  The ship being used currently has particularly high fuel costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">There are also questions relating to the workforce.  The negotiations referred to by the Minister followed the company telling the entire workforce that it would be made redundant, despite saying it would maintain a service.  The workers should get a commitment that in so far as services are maintained, their jobs, pay and conditions will be maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">With regard to the harbour company, all the cost cutting is being inflicted on the workforce via job losses and demands for swingeing pay cuts.  On the other hand, there is seriously milking and abuse of expenses by harbour board directors.  I do not have time to go through the figures but I ask the Minister to look into this.  It is the subject of a later question that we will not reach but there are serious questions to be answered about board directors abusing travel expenses.  For example, one claim was for €1,300 to travel to a meeting in Dún Laoghaire from Cork.  There are eight meetings a year and now someone is claiming expenses from Dubai.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_358" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_793">I have not yet met representatives of Stena Line but I will make contact with them to put whatever pressure I can on them regarding this route but a service is provided all year round from Dublin Port, which is 20 minutes up the road.  Stena Line is withdrawing the service from Dún Laoghaire because there are not enough passengers to sustain the route, given the costs associated with operating a fast boat with high fuel costs while carrying few paying passengers.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">I was only made aware of the other issue raised by the Deputy in the past few days by his constituency colleague, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, and I was in touch with the chairman of the harbour company yesterday about it.  I understand that expenses for attending board meetings from overseas are being repaid.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_359">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_795">There is more to it than that.  This person is still on the board.  For example, according to the profit and loss account, in 2007, when the same director was living in Dalkey, he claimed €458 in expenses to travel to Dún Laoghaire eight times a year.  In 2008, when he was living in Cork, he claimed €1,300 per meeting to travel from there.  The fare for a return train journey to Cork is €71 and it costs €25 for a taxi from Heuston Station to Dún Laoghaire and probably a similar amount for a taxi in Cork.  That totals approximately €170, yet he claimed €1,300.  In February 2009, the chief executive officer used the company credit card to pay for dinner and accommodation in the Royal Marine Hotel for guests, partners and so on, even though most of them lived in the Dún Laoghaire area.  A sum of €450,000 was paid to consultants for fantastic, unrealisable plans.  This equated to a cost of €10,000 per day to a company that is losing the same amount per day but the workers are being asked to take swingeing pay cuts.  Will the Minister look into this?  It is unacceptable.  Jobs are being slaughtered while people at the top are abusing expenses.</p>

            <p eId="para_797">It is incorrect to state the company is losing €10,000 a day.  However, I would like the Deputy to send me the information he has and I will look into it because we cannot have a situation where the board of a company is behaving in one way when it expects its staff and others to make sacrifices to save the company.  I had to deal with a similar issue in the Dublin Airport Authority and I will deal with it as well in Dún Laoghaire if need be.  I ask the Deputy to forward the information because I want to know it.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">The Deputy claims €12,000 a year to travel between Dún Laoghaire and Dublin.  I am not sure how much the train costs but it is much less than that.</p>

            <p eId="para_804">Under the Sports Capital Programme, funding is allocated to sporting and to voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">€33 million has been provided in the Department's vote in the 2011 Estimates to meet payments in respect of projects which have been allocated funding under the Sports Capital Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">Over 1,000 payments were made last year to projects which were being developed across the country.  Such projects allow clubs to increase the opportunities for people to engage in sports at all levels. Since 1998, the Department has allocated over €743m in almost 7,500 separate allocations. This funding has transformed the level of sports facilities throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">In allocating this funding, special targeting and prioritisation has been given to projects in RAPID, CLAR and Local Drug Taskforce areas. In the most recent round of the SCP in 2008, these projects were permitted to have a lower level of minimum own funding available (20% for projects in CLÁR areas and 10% for RAPID and Local Drug Task Force areas in comparison with the normal 30%) towards their project, and they also received extra marks during the assessment process. Through these measures, the SCP has invested over €150 million in projects either in designated disadvantaged areas or serving these areas.  No decision has been made in regard to the timing of a new round of the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_811">I am chairing a high-level coordinating group which is identifying opportunities for Ireland that may arise across the sports, tourism, cultural and enterprise sectors from the proximity of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The group comprises representatives from the Irish Sports Council, the Olympic Council of Ireland, Paralympics Ireland, Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The most recent meeting of the group took place last  Tuesday, 27th September.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">The biggest potential benefits around the London Games have been identified in the enterprise and tourism sectors and these are being actively pursued.  Enterprise Ireland is pursuing opportunities for Irish business and the tourism agencies are working closely with a range of partners at home and overseas to maximise the tourism opportunities.  The cultural agencies are also developing proposals for a cultural programme around the Games.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">The potential to attract international athletes to train in Ireland in the lead up to London 2012 is another issue that the coordinating group is looking at.  A number of international teams have chosen the National Aquatic Centre as a training base which is a reflection of the calibre of the facility.  My Department is working on attracting other teams to train here.  A difficulty that arises in attracting teams is that the UK is offering financial incentives to international teams to train in the UK in the lead up to the Games.</p>

            <p eId="para_816">Meath County Council carried out a feasibility study for a cycle route along the Boyne Valley linking Trim to Drogheda, which was completed in early 2010.  The study estimated the cost of such a scheme to be at least €13 million, excluding potential land acquisition costs.  Given current financial constraints it would not be possible to provide such a level of funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">In terms of promotion of such initiatives, the National Roads Authority completed a scoping study for a national cycle network in 2010, and following this my Department tasked the National Road Authority to conduct a feasibility study of a cycle way from Dublin to Galway, and on to Clifden.  In addition to this, Local Authorities have been progressing projects, most notably in Mayo with the Great Western Greenway.  More recently, as part of the jobs initiative, my Department has allocated funding to the relevant Local Authorities for the development of a short off road route in Dungarvan and for an extension to the existing Royal Canal cycle route in Mullingar.  I am keen, bearing in mind the current financial constraints and the outcome of the forthcoming comprehensive expenditure review, to continue to support such projects as part of promoting cycling in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">Volunteers play a vital role in Irish sport and research has shown that sport accounts for the majority of all volunteering in Ireland.  As well as generating social value, there is an economic value of volunteering in sport, and estimates of this have ranged from over €300 million to almost €600 million annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">The commitment and hard work of volunteers is a key part of the development of sports organisations and clubs throughout the country.  Volunteerism translates into well-ordered clubs and sporting organisations that provide the environment for the nurturing of sporting talent, particularly amongst our young people.  It is imperative then that we make the best efforts to support and protect these volunteers and encourage new volunteers.  This is particularly relevant in this European Year of Volunteering.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">The Irish Sports Council provides funding and support to the National Governing Bodies of sport, many of which are volunteer based.  The national network of Local Sports Partnerships, which are also funded through the Sports Council, provide sports clubs with information on best practice and governance and operate in conjunction with clubs and volunteers to promote and develop sport in communities throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">The National Awards to Volunteers in Irish Sport were introduced in 2007 to celebrate the contribution of the 400,000 plus volunteers involved in Irish sport.  Earlier this year, I was pleased to honour eleven individuals for their voluntary commitment to sports clubs and organisations throughout the country.  The Awards programme aims to provide encouragement to existing volunteers and reach out to encourage new volunteers for the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_824">My Department has no direct control of transport costs in general but keeps under review costs arising from the services provided through our agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">Cost competitiveness is a key consideration for Ireland as an open export-oriented economy and transport is one of the many factors influencing that competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">The Government's plans to improve competitiveness are set out in the Programme for Government and place a heavy emphasis on the delivery of effective transport services.  I have also outlined my transport and tourism priorities to 2016 on my Department's website.  In addition, the Government's Jobs Initiative includes a number of measures intended to stimulate tourism by increasing the competitiveness of access transport and our tourism product.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">In the tourism sector, the Government has also introduced measures such as the VAT cut, reduced employers PRSI, and the visa waiver scheme, to support competitiveness as well as key investments to upgrade our tourism products and attractions.  Furthermore, Fáilte Ireland is currently carrying out research into state imposed costs and regulatory burden in the industry, which will help inform my Department's future policy output.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">More generally, my colleague Minister for Small Business John Perry has established the Small Business Advisory Group which provides for a dialogue between the Minister for Small Business and representatives of the small business sector on issues of concern to that sector on how to promote the economic development and job potential of the sector having regard to the current restraints imposed on the national finances and to recommend action points and follow up.  Given the predominance of SMEs in the Tourism sector, this group's work will be of particular importance to that sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_834">CIÉ and its three operating subsidiary companies are important State assets.  However, it must be recognised that they are unique semi-state companies, in that they are in receipt of significant amount of exchequer funding from the National Transport Authority in order to carry out their Public Service Obligations.  Even after this subsidy, they still recorded a loss of €53.6 million in 2010. Furthermore, there is a significant pension deficit within the Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">In this regard, I would concur with the Report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities, that stated that "having regard to the unavoidable losses inherent in maintaining a nationwide railway and uneconomic urban and rural bus services, disposal or part-disposal of the main CIÉ companies is not a realistic short-term option."  As such, I have no plans at present to privatise CIÉ or its operating subsidiaries: Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann.</p>

            <p eId="para_849">The Deputy has asked a number of separate questions, which I will address in order.  Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company's publically available annual accounts for 2010 detail that the company spent €230,000 on consultancy fees last year. As the Deputy is aware, the company is currently undergoing a major public consultation and masterplanning process in relation to the future development of the harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">The accounts also disclose the fees and expenses paid to each individual director and confirm that the company fully complies with Department of Finance Travel and Subsistence regulations. As part of its oversight of the corporate governance of the port companies, my Department has sought explanations in the small number of cases where the expenses of Directors exceed the norm. In the case of Dún Laoghaire, the company have informed my Department that this arises because one of the directors resides outside of Dublin and receives travel expenses for attending meetings. However, I understand the matter the Deputy highlights has been resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">My Department also monitors closely the financial performance of the port companies and has recently received the accounts for the first half of the year from all the port companies, including Dún Laoghaire. The details of such accounts would be considered commercially sensitive, but I can inform the Deputy that the company remained profitable during the period.  The State ports are currently structured into nine competing port companies. A review of ports policy is currently under way and I intend to publish a revised policy document as soon as possible.  The current structure of port companies will be one of the issues addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">In terms of cost savings, Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company has already cut its costs substantially. I do not see that changing the status of the company will result in further savings <i>per se.</i>  However, I am open to considering the merits and demerits of the transfer of the Port Company to Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council as part of the forthcoming Ports Policy review, though I have no specific plans to pursue this option.</p>

            <p eId="para_854">I am acutely aware that sporting organisations, like many other organisations, are facing very difficult financial challenges in the present economic climate.

            <p eId="para_855">However, my Department does not have any current funding available to it to assist organisations who have accumulated large debts or who are finding it difficult to maintain their existing level of activities.  I would point out that the Sports Capital Programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city around the country. The facilities funded range from new equipment for the smallest clubs, to regional multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">Almost 7,500 SCP allocations have been made since 1998 bringing the total allocation in that time to over €743 million. These grants continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring the provision of modern, high quality facilities around Ireland that attract more people to participate in sporting activities.  SCP grantees must give a written guarantee that facilities will be maintained in sporting use for at least 15 years. In the case of large grants this guarantee is in the form of a charge on the property where the facility is located. This guarantee is 5 years in the case of sports equipment.</p>

            <p eId="para_863">As the Deputy will be aware, tourism was specifically identified in the Good Friday Agreement as one of the key areas for North/South cooperation, and consequently it is one of the sectors on which the North/South Ministerial Council meets in Sectoral format.  The Council meets in this format in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in the area of tourism.  It also takes decisions on policies and actions to be implemented by Tourism Ireland Limited, a publicly owned limited company established to promote the island of Ireland overseas as a tourist destination.  Arrangements are being made for the next North/South Ministerial Council meetings in Tourism Sectoral format which is expected to take place in Armagh before year's end. Amongst the likely discussion items are a review of this year's visitor numbers to the island of Ireland, Tourism Ireland's Business Plan for 2012 and, major tourism opportunities North and South in 2012 and 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">In addition to North South Ministerial Council meetings, I and my Government colleagues intend to strengthen North/South relations by engaging with our counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive more widely. In that context, I hope to meet Minister Foster for an informal discussion on matters of common interest on October 5th, when she plans to visit Dublin for the launch of Northern Ireland 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">In addition to such formal or informal meetings with Ministers or officials from the Executive, I attend a range of tourism events and functions which, given that tourism is an area of North/South cooperation, are also attended by officials from the Northern Department.  Finally, my own officials continue to meet on a regular basis with their counterparts from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland to discuss areas of ongoing cooperation in tourism.</p>

            <p eId="para_873">As the Deputy will be aware, the market for air services in the EU is fully liberalised so it is a matter for carriers to decide what routes to serve; there is no scope for Government intervention in the market except through public service obligation routes and strict conditions are laid down in EU law for the application of PSOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">The Deputy will also be aware of recent initiatives by the Government aimed at increasing inbound tourism.  In the Jobs initiative in May I announced the proposed suspension of the €3 travel tax as part of a three-pronged strategy aimed at increasing inbound tourism.  This strategy involved not only the proposed suspension of the travel tax but also the introduction of a new growth incentive scheme by the Dublin Airport Authority and more targeted and co-operative marketing of new routes from key source tourism markets by Tourism Ireland, the DAA and airlines to encourage more tourists to fly into Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">Following extensive engagement with the two main Irish airlines over a period of months, the response of the airlines to these initiatives in terms of plans to restore routes and capacity was insufficient to merit the Government suspending the tax at this time but we have agreed to review the issue in the Spring.  In the meantime, I have the agreement of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform that a significant proportion  of the revenue  generated from the retention of the tax will be made available for a targeted co-operative marketing effort. Tourism Ireland is finalising plans in this regard at present  in conjunction with the airlines, airports, ferry companies, tour operators and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">Some important new routes have been announced in recent weeks which is a credit to the airport authorities involved and also to the efforts of Tourism Ireland. These include Emirates plans for a daily service from Dubai to Dublin from next January. This new link through Emirates' hub in Dubai will provide greater ease of access to Ireland from Australia as well as the emerging tourism markets in the Middle East and Asia. These long-haul markets are particularly important for Irish tourism as tourists from these destinations tend to stay longer and spend more.  In addition, Lufthansa's planned new route from Knock to Dusseldorf will be a particular boost for tourism to the Western region as Germany has been identified by Tourism Ireland as a market with considerable scope for further growth in the years ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_878">Dublin Bus will receive €72.4 million in Exchequer funding in 2011 for the provision of public service obligation services.

There are no plans to privatise the Company.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">Dublin Bus has consulted with residents, local representatives and other stakeholders in relation to their Network Direct programme before making decisions on alterations to routes.

            <p eId="para_881">The last decade has seen substantial levels of capital investment in transport infrastructure to improve our public transport network throughout the country. It will clearly not be possible to maintain this level of investment in the period ahead, given the difficult budgetary and economic challenges we now face. That is not to say however that progress cannot be made in encouraging people to make the switch from the private car to public transport. Despite the reduced sums available for capital and current expenditure, the Government will continue to prioritise the role of public transport. More targeted but less expenditure intensive measures can make a real difference.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">The introduction of real time passenger information project (RTPI) and the development of a National Integrated Journey Planner will improve the experience of users of bus public transport. In addition to these measures, the Integrated Ticketing project will soon be delivered making it easier for commuters to switch easily between bus, rail and Luas on one ticket.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">Work on quality bus corridors and green routes throughout the country will continue as a priority in the period ahead in order to allow the bus to compete strongly on journey times. An order was made last week extending the remit of the Railway Procurement Agency to the development of Bus Rapid Transit systems.  We will also continue to invest in the improvement of rail stations and bus stops to make commuting a more pleasant experience. The above are value for money measures that support the use of the overall public transport system and enhance the accessibility, convenience and attractiveness of public transport.</p>

            <p eId="para_889">A passport application for the person in question was submitted on 25 August, 2011.  In accordance with the provisions of the Passports Act, 2008, this Department must be satisfied that an applicant is an Irish citizen before issuing her with a passport.   As the applicant was born in the State in July, 2011 her entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by Section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the Act).  The Act provides that a person, who is born in the State on or after 1 January, 2005 and does not have a parent who is either an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for a passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three of the four years preceding the birth of the child.   It also provides that residence in Ireland in relation to permissions to stay in the State for studying is not reckonable for the purposes of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">This Department assesses such applications in line with guidelines provided by the Department of Justice and Equality, which is responsible for matters of citizenship and immigration.  In accordance with these guidelines, the proofs of lawful residence, which are accepted and considered in connection with passport applications, are immigration stamps in passports or the registration cards/books which are given to persons registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  These are official documents, which can be objectively verified and are relied on by the Department in the processing of passport applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">In line with the requirements of the Act, the lawful residence in the State of the applicant's mother in the four year period preceding her daughter's date of birth was examined.   The submitted evidence of immigration stamps in her passport shows that she has been resident in the State since March 2009. On this basis the total amount of residence does not meet with the statutory requirement of three years.   Moreover, all of the mother's residence, which has been authorised by immigration authorities, is for study purposes and is, therefore, not reckonable for the purposes of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">In light of the fact that the applicant's mother does not have the required reckonable residence for the purposes of the Act, her child's entitlement to Irish citizenship has not been demonstrated. The Department cannot issue a passport to her.  The applicant's mother was advised of this by the Department in a letter dated 12 September, 2011. In this letter, the Department requested evidence of her lawful residence in the State prior to 2009 which might be reckonable for the purposes of the Act or if she had evidence of her own entitlement to Irish citizenship.  No reply has been received from her in this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_898">I understand that the Deputy is interested in the ‘grace period' and its effects. The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provided for a period within which pensions are unaffected by the pay cuts introduced in that Act. This ‘grace period' was due to expire by the end of 2010.  However, it was extended to 29 February 2012 to avoid too large a number of public service retirements in 2011 and to spread the extra pension lump sum costs over a more manageable period in both 2011 and 2012.    Also, in July this year a 3 month minimum notice period for retirement was introduced for the public service. The purpose of this minimum notice period is to protect services by giving management information about the number of staff retiring in a particular area and to assist in planning how best to maintain services.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that if the individual in question retires on or before   29 February 2012 her retirement lump sum will be based on her salary prior to the salary reductions introduced by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 with effect from 1 January 2010.  If she retires on or after   1 March 2012, her retirement lump sum will be based on her salary, as reduced by the 2009 Act measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">I am also informed that the taxation of retirement lump sums from Revenue approved pension arrangements is based on the legislative arrangements in force when the lump sum is paid. The following arrangements currently apply:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_901">Lump sum amounts up to €200,000 are paid free of tax.  They are also paid free of USC.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_902">The portion of a lump sum between €200,001 and €575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%.  (This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum.)  No USC is chargeable.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_903">Any amount of a lump sum in excess of €575,000 is taxed at the individual's marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The threshold figures detailed above are lifetime limits with lump sums paid on or after 7 December 2005 aggregating with any later lump sums in counting towards those thresholds.  As with all taxation measures, these arrangements are subject to any review that might occur as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p>

        <b> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
         if in excess of 57,000 families are now in arrears with their mortgage repayments; if not, if he will provide a figure for same; his plans for families who find themselves in dire circumstances at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_906">Figures compiled by the Central Bank show that, at the end of June 2011, there were 55,763 private residential mortgages in arrears for more than 90 days.  Of the 55,763 mortgage accounts in arrears, because of remortgages, top-ups etc., the actual number of households in arrears is somewhat lower with the Central Bank estimating the household number to be of the order of 45,000.  There are a number of measures in place to assist home owners who are experiencing difficulty with mortgage repayments.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">The Deputy will be aware of the Report of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.  All of the Group's recommendations are listed in Chapter 2 of the Report which can be accessed at <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">One of the recommendations of the Group was that lenders should offer a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS) to borrowers. Under this Scheme, subject to certain criteria being satisfied, borrowers are allowed to pay at least 66% of their mortgage interest but less than 100%. Payment of the balance may be deferred for up to 5 years.  Lenders representing the majority of the market have already implemented (or indicated their willingness to implement) the Group's proposals for a DIS or a variation of it.  While the Scheme is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the Scheme will be monitored by the Central Bank to ensure compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">Since the publication of the Group's Report, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) has been revised by the Central Bank to reflect many of the Group's recommendations, including key recommendations relating to the introduction by all lenders, regulated by the Central Bank, of a standardised Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). The most significant changes in the revised CCMA include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_910">penalty interest charges may not be imposed on borrowers in arrears who cooperate with the MARP,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_911">harassment of borrowers through unsolicited communication is outlawed,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_912">borrowers in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, are allowed to come under the MARP,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_913">when determining the 12 month period the lender must wait before applying to the courts to commence legal action, the lender must exclude any time period during which the borrower is complying with the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement, making an appeal to the internal appeals board or making a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">The revised CCMA came into effect on 1 January 2011 and can be accessed at <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>.  Lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law.  With effect from 30 June 2011, lenders must have in place the requisite systems and trained staff necessary to support the implementation of the MARP.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">A working group has been established under the Economic Management Council to consider the state of implementation of the main recommendations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.  This Group has also been asked to consider and develop further necessary actions to alleviate the increasing mortgage over-indebtedness problem.  I expect that the Group will complete its work in the very near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_953">Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides, subject to certain conditions, tax relief at the standard rate of income tax (20%) as regards qualifying fees paid by an individual in respect of a third level education course including a postgraduate course.     Qualifying fees means tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the "student contribution".  For the tax year 2011 and subsequent tax years, the maximum annual relief for tuition fees (including the student contribution of €2,000) is €7,000 per course.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">The tax relief is confined to tuition fees only. Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, employer contribution or other means are to be deducted in arriving at the net fees qualifying for tax relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">An individual can claim tax relief on fees paid by him/her in respect of an approved third level course pursued by him or her and on fees paid by him or her in respect of an approved course pursued by other individuals (e.g. a son or daughter).</p>
            <p eId="para_956">A claim for relief may be in respect of a number of students — the maximum amount allowable (i.e. €7,000) applies per course rather than per claim. However:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_957">the first €2,000 of all fees claimed by an individual does not attract tax relief where any one of the students to whom the claim refers is a full time student;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_958">the first €1,000 of all fees claimed by an individual does not attract tax relief where all   of the students to whom the claim refers are part-time students.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The disregard of €2,000 or €1,000, as the case may be, applies to each claim, the subject of which may be one or more students. The general effect of this approach is that all claimants will get full tax relief on an amount equal to the student contribution of €2,000 for the second and subsequent students in their claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">The examples below are premised on a claimant who is within the tax net paying the third level fees.  Different scenarios may arise where the student pays the fees or where a parent is not in the tax net and thus could not benefit from tax relief.</p>

          the steps he has taken to protect the public interest, in the banking sector, much of which is owned by the State, or which the State has a large stake in; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [26824/11]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_398">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1012">The Deputy will appreciate that the protection of the public interest is of primary concern of this Government and steps taken in relation to banking policy have the ultimate aim of protecting that interest.  In particular I refer to the areas of the bank guarantee, recapitalization, mortgage assistance, bank remuneration and board membership.  The Exchequer, and as such the taxpayer, has benefited from the Bank guarantees.  The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 (CIFS) provided that each covered institution pay a charge to the Exchequer for its guarantee.  The sum of €760,467,567 was paid into the Exchequer in October 2010 in respect of all fees and interest accumulated under the CIFS, which terminated on 29 September 2010.  Similarly, those institutions covered under the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme (ELG) also pay a charge for the ELG.  To date, over €1,541,973,128 has been collected under the ELG as a consequence of the support provided by the State and taxpayer.  In addition to paying fees for the Guarantee, covered institutions must pay legal and other costs, charges, expenses (including VAT) from time to time incurred by the Minister in any way in connection with the giving of the Guarantee.  To date almost €4 million has been collected.  Bank of Ireland paid €214.5 million to the NPRF in February 2011 in respect of a dividend on the State's remaining preference shares.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">The Deputy will be aware that the Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR), which was carried out by the Central Bank and reported in March 2011, identified an additional capital requirement of €24 billion.  The Government has ensured that this recapitalization burden has not fallen exclusively on the Irish taxpayer.  For example, since the PCAR announcement, burden sharing with bondholders has realized an additional c. €5 billion.  In addition, private investors agreed to an investment of up to €1.123 billion in Bank of Ireland's Tier 1 capital ensuring the State's commitment was significantly reduced thus reducing the burden on the Irish public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">The recapitalisations of the banks have ensured that the State has significant equity in the banks.  As outlined in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report for 2010, the market value of the investments in the banks at 31 December 2010 was €7.6 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to help homeowners who are facing difficulty with their mortgage repayments and the Government will examine a number of proposals in relation to this commitment.  In this context, the Economic Management Council asked that further work be carried out to address the situation of over indebted mortgage holders with a view to identifying a range of responses appropriate to individual circumstances.  To facilitate this commitment, a Mortgage Group has carried out this work and its report will go to Government shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">The issue of remuneration of those working in the banking industry has been in the spotlight for some time.  In that context, the NTMA requested a review of remuneration policies and practices by each of the covered institutions.  In that regard, the institutions were asked to consider measures that could be taken to realign staff expectations with regard to remuneration and benefits in the current economic environment and financial circumstances of the banks.  The review exercise is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">The covered institutions are also engaging in cost cutting plans.  These are plans arising out of the restructuring and recapitalization programme announce in March.  The effects of these plans including the consolidation of the banks around two pillar banks made up of the merger of AIB and EBS, alongside Bank of Ireland will be to enable costs saving through shared services and economies of scale.  They are also expected to bring about cost reductions which will improve operating margins and permit the banks to better absorb funding costs which should include increases in the ECB interest rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">As part of their capital raising requirements, the pillar banks have both agreed to meet an SME lending target of €3 billion each in the 12 month period for 2011, €3.5 billion each for 2012, and €4 billion each for 2013.  The banks produce an annual SME lending plan for each of these 12 month period to demonstrate the manner in which they intend to meet the targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">A fundamental element of Government Strategy has been to restore a functioning banking system and the Government has made particular commitments to recapitalising the banks and restructuring the banking sector as part of its Programme for Government.   This radical restructuring of the banking system is designed to put our banking system on a firm footing which is essential to Ireland's economic recovery and in doing so will protect the public interest.</p>

The Teachers' Union of Ireland (TUI) lodged a claim with my Department for a substantial pay increase on behalf of the Directors of each of these Centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">Following protracted negotiations, my Department consented to an ad hoc referral of the claim to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court subsequently issued a non-binding recommendation on 9 February 2009 in respect of this claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">I regret to inform you that, notwithstanding that the recommendation was made prior to the passage of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, this Labour Court recommendation cannot be implemented in the context of Section 5(1) of that Act.  That subsection provides that where a reduction in pay was made on 1 January 2010 to a public servant's pay rate in accordance with Section 2 of the Act, the resulting pay rate may not be increased.  Section 5(1) states that: "Where a relevant provision [i.e. that sets the pay rate] is taken to have been amended by section 2- (a) a public servant whose remuneration falls to be determined in accordance with the relevant provision is not entitled to receive remuneration of an amount greater than the amount so determined, and (b) no person or body responsible for paying the remuneration of such a public servant is entitled to pay remuneration to the public servant of an amount greater than the amount so determined."</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">It should be noted that the position taken in relation to this particular Labour Court recommendation is in line with government pay policy generally.  You will appreciate that public service bodies are obliged to comply with the terms of that legislation, and indeed would be potentially liable to financial penalties, should they purport to act in contravention of its provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">In this context, I should also point out that, in accordance with the requirements under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, the Minister for Finance, Mr. Michael Noonan TD, completed a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the legislation, having regard to the overall economic conditions in the State and national competitiveness in June 2011.  The report concluded that there is a need to continue to apply the reductions provided for under the legislation.  The report is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">On 20 July 2011, an agreed statement was issued on the part of the Government and the Public Service Committee of the ICTU following the first review under the Public Service (Croke Park) Agreement.  That statement noted that as committed to in the Agreement, adjudication findings that were outstanding at the time of the Agreement will be reviewed by the parties.  The parties also noted, however, that the review, which is ongoing, will have to have regard to the terms of the Agreement, the moratorium on recruitment and promotion and the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">Accordingly, my Department is not currently in a position to implement the Labour Court recommendation of 9 February 2009 in respect of the Directors of the VEC Outdoor Education Centres.</p>

The school referred to by the Deputy has an allocation of 7 SNA posts and 49.5 Resource Teaching Hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">It is considered that, with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources, there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">I wish to clarify that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">The NCSE will advise schools early in the new school year of a process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department's policy. The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism. It will be expected that schools, before requesting a review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_1161">In general, individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care, including traffic management measures.  The issue of road safety measures outside the vested site areas of schools, such as road signage, traffic calming measures etc., is a matter, however, for the relevant Local Authority. Local Authorities have the power to decide on road safety measures outside schools and should ensure that measures are in place to protect the safety of local school children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers applied for a Summer Works Scheme grant in 2011 for improved car parking facilities. Due however to the scale of demand for funding under the scheme, it was not possible to fund all applications and the school's application was unsuccessful in this instance. It is, however, open to the school to apply for funding under future Summer Works Schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1201">The Programme for Government envisages a renewed focus on Public Service Reform. Notwithstanding developments to date, the cost of delivering public services must be reduced further, with fewer staff and tighter budgets, and the Public Service must become better integrated and more customer-focused, as well as being leaner and more efficient.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to drive, enable and support change across the Public Service and a wide range of reform initiatives are currently underway across the Public Service. A detailed action-based Implementation Plan on Public Service Reform is also currently being developed by my Department. This Plan focuses on the commitments to public service reform in the Programme for Government and priority areas from the Transforming Public Services Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">It is intended that this Plan will outline the priority actions and timelines for reform in a broad range of areas including leadership, performance, redeployment, eGovernment, shared services, procurement, legislative change, etc., as well as setting out how implementation should be driven and monitored.  I intend to report back to Government shortly on a range of these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">As part of this process, my officials have been meeting with Departments and Offices to discuss progress made to date both centrally and within individual organisations as well as how best to deliver reform on a coordinated and integrated basis going forward.  Meetings were held with all Government Departments and major Offices during the month of August and early September.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">As part of the call for submissions from the public under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE), a number of submissions that relate to Public Service Reform issues have been received. Additionally a number of submissions were received from various reform and change management organisations, some of whom have made tailored presentations to relevant officials. All relevant contributions are being carefully considered in the context of ongoing work to develop an Implementation Plan on Public Service Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_1207">I have been advised by the Labour Court that it has no record of any case involving the person in question.  I have been advised, however, of an Employment Appeals Tribunal case in which the person was the complainant.  I understand that a hearing was scheduled to take place on the 17th August 2010 but that it was withdrawn on the day.  EAT procedures provide that only a claimant or their representative is allowed withdraw a case. No determination would therefore have been made and the EAT would not have had any involvement in the making of any agreement or settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">In cases of non-compliance with decisions of the Labour Court and the EAT, a legally binding enforcement order can be sought from the Circuit Court.  However, as it appears that no Labour Court or EAT decision occurred in this case, this would not be an option open to the person in question in this instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1210">The latest European standard EN13120, which has been adopted by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), specifies strict obligations on manufacturers of looped mechanism window blinds. These obligations include the provision of a warning notice in a conspicuous position of the risks inherent from cords, chains, tape and similar items.  In addition, the standard requires manufacturers to provide within the product package a device for keeping cords, chains, tape or similar items out of reach of children, or to provide an appropriate safety device (with instructions for its proper installation and use) or to include in the product design a mechanism that shall achieve the same result.  Where the design requires a looped operating mechanism, the manufacturer shall provide the means to limit the risk, either by incorporating this into the product design, or by supplying an appropriate safety device with the product.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">Work commenced in 2010 to revise the European standard EN 13120 in order to strengthen requirements in relation to risks of strangulation by young children and Ireland has taken an active role in the working group responsible for this revision. Publication of the revised European standard is expected in 2012.  In addition, and given the specific national concerns in this area, the NSAI proposes that a national standard, more comprehensive than the European standard, will be published late in 2011 on providing guidance for manufacturers and installers as well as consumers on safe window blind products.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">This standard will include other important guidance such as information on installation, including safety aspects, as well as training requirements for installers, manufacturers and sales representatives. To this end a committee has been established by the NSAI comprised of representatives of the manufacturing and installation sectors as well as the National Consumer Agency. A draft standard was made available on August 10th last for public consultation. In light of the coroner's report referred to by the Deputy a decision was taken by the NSAI to extend the public consultation until September 30th. The intention is for a revised national Standard to be published before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">In light of the above I have no plans to introduce legislation at this time to make it illegal for manufacturers to include looped cords in window blinds. If a ban was proposed, Ireland would have to obtain the approval of the European Commission and other Member States.  I have arranged for the concerns of the Deputy, and of others raised in the House, to be passed on to the NSAI for consideration as part of its consultation.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the mid-west task force was established, following the job losses suffered in Limerick due to the closure of manufacturing by Dell computers in January 2009, charged with analysing the impact of the resulting significant job losses for the region, with making recommendations to address the resulting economic challenge, and with recommending to Government a development plan for the mid-west region; the final report was presented to Government in March 2011; when he intends to publish the final report; the reasons for the delay; and when will its actions be implemented.

            <p eId="para_1215">The Mid West Task Force was established in early 2009 by my predecessor Ms Mary Coughlan, TD, in her capacity as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Task Force produced an Interim Report in mid 2009 which set out a range of recommendations, to be addressed by a number of Ministers/Departments/Agencies, on measures to address the economic and social consequences of the job losses in the region. Ministers addressed these recommendations, particularly in the context of their Estimates for 2010. A number of updates were provided on progress in implementing the recommendations, culminating in a report setting out the full list of recommendations and the measures taken to implement them which was co-ordinated by my Department and sent to all Deputies in mid 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">I received the Final Report of the Task Force before the Summer break this year, and discussed it with the Task Force Chairman Mr Denis Brosnan in June. Its recommendations relate mainly to the programmes and structures of the industrial development and other agencies in the region. These programmes and structures are, as is the case with all Government programmes, currently the subject of an Expenditure Review which will be completed in the run-up to Budget 2012. I intend to publish the Final Report of the Task Force and the Government's response to it in that timescale.</p>

            <p eId="para_1218">I understand that the company concerned proposes to make approximately 175 of its employees redundant as a result of the loss of a major contract.  I am extremely disappointed to hear of the proposed job losses, and I am very conscious of the effect that this outcome would have, not just on the workers and their families, but also on the local community as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">While not a client company of IDA, EI or the County and City Enterprise Boards, in the event that these proposed job losses become a reality, I wish to assure those concerned, and the community, that the relevant State agencies will be available to provide all necessary support.  The priority of course, when there are job losses will be to find alternative employment or re-training for those involved at the earliest opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">Job creation is central to our economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate job creation. The Jobs Initiative announced in May focuses our limited resources on measures that offer the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation in the domestic economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies will be critical in achieving economic growth through promoting the export potential of enterprise in Ireland and driving our Smart Economy. The allocation of €508 million in funding for 2011 will ensure that the core programmes of the enterprise agencies are sustained and targeted as well as driving investment in research and development. This investment in the Enterprise Development agencies will drive recovery in the economy by facilitating the winning of foreign direct investments, the growth of indigenous exports and the creation of sustainable jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">IDA Ireland, though its network of overseas offices, continues to market Tallaght and South County Dublin for potential foreign direct investment opportunities across a range of sectors.  The area is well equipped to compete with other areas with superb infrastructure facilities at City West and Grange Castle and a Third Level Institute of Technology at Tallaght.  According to the latest figures available, there are 4,821 IDA-assisted companies across Dublin employing almost 53,000 people.  As recently as 20 September, Pfizer announced the creation 400 construction jobs as part of its investment in its biotechnology manufacturing facility in Grange Castle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">In terms of indigenous enterprise, Tallaght and South Dublin are also well served thanks to the efforts of Enterprise Ireland and South Dublin County and City Enterprise Board.  Enterprise Ireland has 367 client companies in Dublin South County employing almost 11,500 people full time and a further 1,141 people on contract or part time work.  So far this year, Enterprise Ireland has provided almost €4m in financial support to its clients in Tallaght and South County Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">During 2011, South Dublin CEB has continued to be actively involved in the economic development of Tallaght and South Dublin through the provision of both financial and non-financial support, such as advice, mentoring and training programmes, as well as direct financial assistance.  In 2010, South Dublin CEB issued grants of almost €479,000 to 31 projects.  At present, there are 1,155 jobs existing in companies supported by South Dublin CEB.  All the activities of South Dublin CEB are directed towards stimulating indigenous enterprise creation in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1226">Aetna will not cease operations in Castleisland until December this year and the facility will be in use up to this time.  It is IDA's understanding that the Company has not expressly decided to give the facility to a statutory body or local authority and that it is still evaluating options but is most likely to seek to sell the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">Since the announcement by Aetna of their decision to close their site at Castleisland, IDA Ireland has worked closely with the company to develop a prospectus setting out the skills and capabilities of the workforce and a profile of the facility at Castleisland.  Using the prospectus IDA is marketing the site to potential prospects throughout IDA's global overseas network and all of IDA's operations divisions.  While there has been some initial expressions of interest, engagement is still on-going to attract interest from genuine parties for alternative employment opportunities for the Castleisland site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">IDA Ireland's Strategy for County Kerry is:</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">To work with Local Authorities and relevant infrastructure and service providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the region;</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">To attract new Investment;</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">To progress the development of a knowledge economy so that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment;</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">To work with the existing IDA client base and to help them to further develop their presence;</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">And to provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure Shannon Development carries out the property function in North Kerry while IDA Ireland have responsibility for property in South Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">IDA Ireland promotes Kerry as part of an integrated region with access to the county population base of 139,616 as well as the expanded population of both the Mid West and South West Regions with a combined population of 935,039.  Based on the strengths of the region IDA is particularly targeting the ICT (including software), International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors.  To support this strategy, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county. IDA is also working with FAS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">IDA continues to market all available land and buildings in the County including its 12 acre Business &amp; Technology Park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, Co. Kerry.  In Tralee, IDA is also marketing the Kerry Technology Park, which is owned and managed by Shannon Development in partnership with the Institute of Technology Tralee.  In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients in Kerry to encourage them to expand their operations in the County.</p>

            <p eId="para_1305">The School Meals Programme operated by the Department of Social Protection gives funding towards the provision of food services for disadvantaged children through two schemes.  The first is the statutory Urban School Meals Scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by this Department.  The second is the School Meals Local Projects Schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  As the budget allocation for the School Meals Programme has not increased in recent years, it is not possible at this time to increase the level of funding provided to individual schools.  The application for increased funding under the School Meals Local Projects Scheme made by this school is being retained on file by the Department and may be considered for additional funding at a future date, should such additional funding for the scheme become available.</p>

Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete and return an application form to the Department.

            <p eId="para_1315">The Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  In the 2010/2011 academic year there were 25,032 participants on the back to education allowance scheme.  This represented a 20% increase on the 2009/10 academic year where the number of participants was 20,808, and 114% on the 2008/09 academic year where the number of participants was 11,646. 85% of participants originated from jobseeker's payments and 28% of these were aged under 25 years.  There are also 11,721 participants in the back to work schemes, 3.2% of whom are aged under 25.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">In December 2010 the Government agreed the extension of the employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme to end 2011 in the context of the budget and national recovery plan. Up to 16th September 2011, applications were received from 1,615 employers in respect of 2,976 employees.  1,216 employers have been awarded exemptions in respect of 1,963 employees.  Of those awarded, 12% are aged under 25.  There is also a network of Facilitators at a local level in my Department. Facilitators work with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">A new community work placement initiative, Tús, was launched in December 2010.  The aims of Tús are to provide short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  Tús will be delivered at local level by each of the Local Development Companies and by Údarás na Gaeltachta, and access to the Tús is specifically available for those under 25.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">In addition, a fully integrated nationwide range of services and supports is available to employers and jobseekers through FÁS Employment Services, responsibility for which has been transferred to this Department.  The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore and access, under professional guidance, a full range of employment and training services.  Development of the NEAP is central to ongoing development in the labour market policy area and will be progressed within the framework of a new National Employment and Entitlements Service which, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is being established by the Department.  The new service will integrate employment and benefit payment services, currently delivered by FÁS and the Department, respectively,  within the Department and will be based on a case management approach with the objective of providing a more customised and personal service to customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">These developments are complimented by measures announced recently by the Government under the Jobs Initiative and include initiatives such as JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme, which will provide 5,000 internship opportunities of 6 or 9 months in organisations in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors. Participants will retain their social welfare entitlement s and will also receive a ‘top-up' of €50 per week.  In addition, from July 2, the rate of employers PRSI on jobs paying up to €356 per week has been halved to 4.25%, up to end 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">All of the measures outlined above will support people who are unemployed in acquiring the education and skills and work experience that will assist them in returning to employment while measures such as the PRSI reduction will encourage employers to new employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1324">My Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  To this end, operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed throughout the Department.  Such reviews are supported by modern technology, the potential of which is continuously harnessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">In addition, the staffing needs of my Department are kept under constant review to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  In excess of 900 staff have been assigned to my Department since May 2008 to fill critical vacancies and additional posts that were approved to deal with the significant increase in claims for the various schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria.  For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes; medical examinations are required for some of the illness-related schemes and, in the case of certain payments, customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  In the case of the insurance-based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">One of the main impacts on current service delivery has been the increase in the Live Register.  In this context, my Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives regarding claims for jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit.  One of the most significant initiatives, aimed at reducing queuing and waiting times, involves customers attending their local office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided.  This provides for the appropriate appointment to be scheduled for the customer thus enabling certain claims to be dealt with in a single visit to the office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">Such process improvements have resulted in a significant reduction in the number and proportion of all claims awaiting a decision.  For example, there were 35,533 jobseeker claims awaiting a decision on 24th September 2011 equating to 7% of the total claim-load.  This compares favourably to 25th September 2010 when 44,279 claims or 9% of claim-load were awaiting decision and 65,245 claims or 14% of claim-load in September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">In addition, the Department's eGovernment strategy aims to support and develop customer contact channels that maximise customer service and minimise cost of delivery.   Recent years have seen significant investment in the provision of improved information and online services, resulting in increased customer awareness of their entitlements and more efficient claim processing procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">The Department's website <i>www.welfare.ie</i>, redesigned in 2008, provides comprehensive information on all the Department’s schemes and services as well as a range of online services.  These include online claiming for State Pension Contributory, Household Benefits, Child Benefit, Jobseeker’s payments and Widow(er)’s and Surviving Civil Partner’s Contributory Pension.  It is planned to extend the online claiming service in 2011/2012 to include Carer’s Allowance, Disability Allowance, State Pension (Non-Contributory) and Redundancy Payments and Insolvency Payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">The planned integration of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive, along with employment and other services from FÁS into my Department in the coming months provides further opportunity to enhance the service available to customers.  This is an important first step in the establishment of the new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES), a key commitment in the Programme for Government, which was approved by the Government in July.  This new service will provide services using a  ‘one stop shop' model of delivery where customers can avail of all employment and benefit support services through any one of a number of service channels, public office, call centre or internet.  The plan for its development and implementation has now been published.</p>

            <p eId="para_1335">State pension (transition) (SPT) is currently paid to people aged 65 who have a minimum yearly average of 24 social insurance contributions and who have retired from work.  Currently it ceases at age 66 when the claimant transfers to State pension (contributory) (SPC).<b/>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1336">As a result of legislation introduced this year, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of SPT and the standardisation of State pension age at 66.   State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028. It is worth noting that, until the early 1970s, the qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was 70 years of age.  By gradually increasing the qualifying age for State pension, people will be further encouraged to remain in employment beyond 65 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">The Quarterly National Household Survey Q4 2010 showed that the numbers currently at work drop dramatically at 65 years of age.  While 77.2 per cent of people aged 45-54 years are in employment, this drops to 64.3 per cent for 55-64 year-olds and to just 8.7 per cent  for people aged 65 years or older.  It is clear, therefore, that the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  Increases in life expectancy mean that more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  While this is to be welcomed, this has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The fundamental principle that people need to participate in the workforce for longer needs to be emphasised and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.  People who have retired before State pension age may be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment, as is the current position.</p>

            <p eId="para_1340">I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 108 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">My Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers and to utilising the potential of modern technology and available delivery channels in meeting this objective.  To this end, a new application has been developed and launched early this year which allows for the automatic issue of contribution statements where the person's record is in order and does not require investigation.  Production of a statement of contributions involves an examination of both the computerised PRSI records from 1979 and, in some cases, the earlier paper-based records from 1953 to 1979.  In normal circumstances, where the record is fully in order, statements are issued within two weeks.  However, processing of requests can take longer where further information or clarification of work periods, etc. is required. It is envisaged that this new application will be further developed to provide an on-line facility to enable an individual check their contribution record and to calculate likely pension entitlement.   It is not possible, at this point, to provide a timescale for the development of this on-line facility as it will involve complex engineering and requires a high degree of security to cater for data privacy concerns.  In the meantime, it should be noted that a statement of contributions can be requested on-line via the Department's PRSI Section at <i>www.welfare.ie.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1342">For administrative reasons, a decision was taken in May 2007 to stop providing the traditional forecast service and to replace this with the provision of a copy of the individual's contribution history along with a booklet entitled ‘Working it Out'.  The contribution history record, along with the guide, provides the customer with the information required to decide when to retire and how best to optimise their State Pension entitlement.  The change has also enabled the State Pension Section to concentrate on the primary task of processing pension claims and in implementing improvements to the service provided to people on reaching pension age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">State Pension claims are now processed in a timely manner, with in excess of 90% of these claims awarded before the customer reaches pension age.  The Department has also developed a claim initiation service whereby customers who are known to have an entitlement to State Pension are pro-actively invited to apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">There are no plans to re-establish a pensions forecasting service as the focus remains on processing pension claims in a timely manner and available resources are prioritised for this purpose.  However, the Department will continue to provide the current service (a copy of the person's record along with the information booklet) to enable customers to work out their entitlements and the network of Local Offices and Citizens Information Offices will continue to serve as points of contact to assist people in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1346">The dental benefit scheme is paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  Although the SIF had operated a surplus since 1996, this position began to change in 2009 and expenditure since then has had to be partially funded by the Exchequer.  As part of a range of cost-saving measures to ease the pressure on the SIF, the range of treatments available under the dental benefit scheme was reduced in Budget 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347">The free examination remains available to qualifying customers to encourage them to continue attending for regular check-ups and to assist in the early detection of dental-related health issues.

            <p eId="para_1384">The person concerned was awarded an invalidity pension from 24th   January 2008. On 16th   October 2009 she was called for and attended a medical examination and was assessed in-person by a medical assessor. It was decided that she no longer satisfied the medical criteria for invalidity pension.  Accordingly, her invalidity pension payment was terminated from the 5th November 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">She appealed this decision and was referred for a second in-person medical examination which she attended on 17th February 2010.  The opinion of the second medical assessor also was that the person concerned did not satisfy the medical criteria.  Following this medical examination and having considered all the evidence, the appeals officer disallowed the appeal for the person concerned. She was notified of this decision and the reason for it in writing on the 26th   October 2010.   The decision of an appeals officer is final and conclusive in the absence of fresh facts or evidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">Further medical evidence received in relation to the person concerned, having been viewed by the medical assessor, did not alter the original opinion.  It was considered that this evidence did not contain any new facts or evidence and accordingly there were no grounds to review the appeals officer's decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">If there has been a change in circumstances and the person concerned feels she would now satisfy the eligibility criteria for invalidity pension she may reapply.</p>

         if he will respect airways as public property and to ensure that ComReg engages in dialogue with PSME users against the background of the transfer of channel 69 to a newly allocated frequency range, and to implement a compensation programme for radio microphone users and a reduction in licensing rates for those such as amateur theatrical productions.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_1422">The licensing of radio microphones is a matter for the Commission for Communications Regulation (Comreg).  I understand that channel 69 (854 - 862 MHz) is one of the channels available for radio microphone use in Ireland.  At the International Telecommunication Union World Radio-communication Conference in 2007 it was agreed that channels 61 to 69 would be made available for mobile services.  Subsequently the European Commission in its Recommendation 2009/848/EC recommended that analogue terrestrial TV services would be switched off in 2012, and that the above channels should be used for electronic communications services.  This switchover will facilitate the roll out of high speed mobile broadband to communities across Europe.  In complying with this Recommendation channel 69 will no longer be available for radio microphone use.  As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland's national digital switchover strategy provides for a move to all digital TV services by the end of 2012, with the existing services in the 800 MHz band (including channel 61-69) due to be switched off at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">I understand that radio microphone manufacturers and suppliers have been aware of the fact that channel 69 would no longer be available for wireless microphone use from the end of 2012.  Regarding engagement with Programme Making &amp; Special Events (PSME) users, ComReg conducted a public consultation on this matter in April 2010.  The June 2009 decision of the UK Communications Regulator (Ofcom) to confirm Channel 38 (606 - 614 MHz) as a replacement for Channel 69 was raised during the consultation.  In light of the Ofcom decision, and noting that Ireland is a small and open economy and the potential for economies of scale of equipment manufacture and roaming of services, ComReg considered that spectrum for radio microphones should be aligned with spectrum available for radio microphones in larger European markets.   Following consideration of responses received to its consultation, ComReg's view is that it would be appropriate to use a replacement channel aligned with the UK's channel for wireless microphones and it therefore announced in September 2010 that it would make Channel 38 available on an exclusive basis for radio microphone use in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">I am advised that there will be no increase in the associated licence fees.  The current cost of a licence for the possession and use of programme making and special events equipment, including radio microphones, for an event is a €12 administration fee and €12 per piece of equipment.  This licence fee was established in 1986 and has remained unchanged since that time.  As the Deputy will be aware ComReg is obliged to recover its administrative costs for the management of such licensing schemes.  All appropriate steps for the orderly change in use of the relevant spectrum have been taken.  A compensation programme, as suggested by the Deputy, would not be appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1428">It is a matter for each local authority, including Sligo County Council, to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard both to locally identified needs and available resources. It is also a matter for individual local authorities to manage their own day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner.  I met with the Cathaoirleach of Sligo County Council and the Sligo County Manager on 20 May 2011.  At this meeting the financial position and the funding challenges facing the Council were briefly discussed with a view to further exploration between my Department and the Council of appropriate arrangements to reduce the deficit over time. There was no specific documentation in respect of the meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">In 2011 local authorities have budgeted to spend some €7bn in total between current and capital programmes.  The main sources of funding include current and capital income, grants and subsidies.  In addition, limited debt finance, including overdraft, is available to local authorities as necessary to finance their expenditure.   My Department is considering Sligo County Council's current request for an overdraft for capital and current expenditure purposes in consultation with Council officials.  A decision on this request will be made as soon as possible.  My Department considers individual overdraft requests from local authorities on a case by case basis.</p>

However, my Department approved a proposal by the Council in June 2011 to refurbish up to 53 local authority owned houses in the Cranmore estate at an estimated cost of €445,000.  Expenditure this year on Cranmore housing and on any costs arising on the O'Connell Street project will be met from the €2m allocation for regeneration.  So far, no proposal has been received from the Borough Council in relation to further improvement works to houses in the Cranmore estate.

            <p eId="para_1454">An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in November, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">The application is at an advanced stage of processing and will be finalised as expeditiously as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">I should<b> </b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1665">The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 criminalised the trafficking of persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  With regard to prostitution, the criminal law is aimed at protecting society from the more intrusive aspects of such activity from a public order perspective, while also seeking to protect prostitutes from exploitation. Under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, it is an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution.  The offence can be committed by the prostitute, the client or a third party — a pimp, for example.  It is also an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live on the earnings of a prostitute, or keep or manage a brothel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">It is not an offence, in itself, to sell sex.  In general, it is not an offence to purchase sex either. (The 2008 human trafficking legislation made it an offence to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.) Consequently, neither party to the transaction is currently criminalised.  Any proposal to amend the law in terms of criminalising the purchase of sex would require very careful examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">In 2010, the Swedish government completed an evaluation of its 1999 legislation criminalising the purchase of sexual services. Following its publication, the Dignity Project arranged a visit to Stockholm to learn more about the evaluation. The delegation included representation from my Department.  The Dignity Project was a research project funded by the EU. An inter-agency and inter-jurisdictional initiative led by the Dublin Employment Pact and the Immigrant Council of Ireland, it examined services provided to victims of human trafficking with a view to replicating best practice models in partner countries.  My Department's Anti-Human Trafficking Unit and the Garda National Immigration Bureau were partners with observer status.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">I am examining a report prepared by my department following the visit to Stockholm and which was submitted to the Attorney General's Office.  I am also examining the Attorney's advices concerning the legal and constitutional implications of introducing a ban on the purchase of sex.</p>

            <p eId="para_1726">An EU ban on conventional battery cages is due to enter into force with effect from 1 January 2012, in line with Council Directive 1999/74/EC on minimum standards for laying hens. Sanctions for non-compliance with the Council Directive are set out in national legislation, namely the European Communities (Welfare of Farm Animals) Regulation 2010 (Statutory Instrument No. 311 of 2010). My Department is working with laying hen producers and the poultry industry to ensure that the 1 January deadline is adhered to and that the phasing out of conventional systems to other systems will be as smooth as possible.  A Poultry Welfare Scheme to support this process was introduced which provides a total of €16 million to producers to assist in the conversion to enriched cages, free range or barn systems.  My Department will continue to monitor the marketing of all eggs from 1st January 2012 to ensure that they comply with all the relevant legislation.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1731">I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 to 162, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">The proposed ban on the sale of raw milk for direct human consumption is not new. Sale of raw cows milk was banned for many years (from 1997 till 2006) by my Department; and previously by most local authorities. The ban lapsed due to a change in EU legislation in 2006. In 2008 my Department undertook a public consultation regarding extending the ban to include both sheep and goats milk. Seventeen submissions were received.  Neither my Department nor the Food Safety Authority of Ireland were convinced that the submissions received provided any justification to oppose the expert advice that the extended ban should be supported in legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">My Department's dairy science and veterinary experts and the independent scientific committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland have strongly advised that there are serious health risks associated with drinking raw milk.  Disease risks include TB, Brucellosis, E. coli O157, Campylobacter and Salmonella. There have been incidents of these in Ireland and other countries in recent years. Resulting illnesses can be serious and on occasion fatal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">It is intended to bring forward a Statutory Instrument to implement the ban as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">Regulation allowing sale of raw milk for direct human consumption, on a restricted basis, would be difficult and costly to implement and would still not eliminate the serious health risks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">It is important to note in this context that the ban will not apply to making cheese using raw milk.  The cheese making process takes time and this provides an opportunity to withdraw product from sale in the event of a problem arising with the source milk.  The cheese making process also prevents growth of pathogens and in some cases encourages slow decline in numbers of some pathogens.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">A number of artisan food producers are pasteurising raw whole milk and are licensed by my Department in this regard.  These artisans are very successfully marketing liquid whole milk, ice cream, different flavoured yoghurts and artisan farmhouse cheeses.  I am advised by the FSAI that meaningful differences in nutritional value between pasteurised and unpasteurised milk have not been demonstrated and these artisans clearly show that pasteurised whole milk can be used in the manufacture of safe and quality dairy products.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">The ban will not apply either to the consumption of raw milk which has not been placed on the market — e.g. a dairy farmer drinking milk from his/her own cows. Such a ban is not possible under the law and in any event would be unenforceable.  However, it is recommended to avoid this practice for health reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">Provision of data in relation to food poisoning outbreaks is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  I have been advised by the FSAI of a number of cases of serious illness associated with raw milk in Ireland in recent years.  The FSAI recommends therefore that the sale of unpasteurised milk from all farm animals which is intended for direct human consumption should be prohibited; and advises that the most effective way to protect public health is to ensure that such milk is pasteurised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">The prevalence of TB in herds in Ireland also puts us in a different position to most other Member States in the EU where the disease has been eradicated.  It is inappropriate that Ireland should adopt the same approach to the consumption of raw milk as countries that do not have the same difficulty with TB and therefore have no associated risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">Ireland exports over €2bn worth of dairy products each year; and is the leading producer of infant formula with about 15% of the world market.  Any food scare associated with raw Irish milk could have major implications for our dairy industry.  The recent E. coli outbreak in Germany, resulting in 46 deaths, 782 cases of HUS (haemolytic uraemic syndrome, a serious kidney condition) and 3,128 known cases of VTEC, indicates the scale of possible risks associated with raw food.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">In all the circumstances I am satisfied that a ban on the sale of raw milk for direct human consumption is justified.</p>

            <p eId="para_1803">The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Almost every pre-school service in the State is participating in the ECCE programme, ensuring that it is available to children in all areas, and 63,000 children, or 94% of the eligible age cohort, availed of the free pre-school year in 2010/2011.  Figures for the academic year 2011/12 are currently being compiled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008 qualify for the free pre-school year in September 2011.  There is no provision under the programme to enrol children who are below the qualifying age;  children born in July and August of 2008 will qualify for the programme in September 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">The objective of the programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.  It is a matter for parents to decide if they wish their child to avail of the programme or if they wish to send their child to primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">A number of parents have requested that the lower age range for eligibility for the ECCE programme be reduced on the grounds that they wish to send their children to school when they are 4 years and 2 months of age or less.  The matter was referred by some of these parents to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  That Office found no reason to remove or amend the lower age range, accepting it as reasonable having regard to the various factors which apply.  However I have asked officials in my department to examine options for the further development of the ECCE programme and the matter of age will be looked at as part of this.</p>

There are additional controls on the prescribing, dispensing, supply and possession of prescription medicines which are controlled drugs.

            <p eId="para_1826">I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 and 177 to 180, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">This Government is committed to implementing <i>A Vision for Change </i>and reforming our model of health care delivery so that more and better quality care is delivered in the community which will facilitate access to housing, education and employment.  <i>A Vision for Change </i>also recognised that all citizens should be treated equally and that access to housing and employment for individuals with mental health problems should be on the same basis as any other citizen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">It is further the Government's intention that over time access to modern mental health services in the community will be significantly improved.  The  Programme for Government includes a commitment to ring-fence €35 million annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services.  In addition, as 90% of mental health needs are dealt with at primary care level, the Government is committed to developing closer links between mental health services and primary care.  It is envisaged that the provision of improved community-based services will ensure that people with mental health problems receive the treatment and after-care support needed to facilitate recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">An Assistant National Director with specific responsibility for Mental Health was appointed by the HSE in 2009 to oversee the implementation of <i> A Vision for Change.  </i> I have now asked the HSE to prepare an implementation plan, which will identify specific recommendations of <i>A Vision for Change </i>  that can be progressed over the next three years, with timelines, detailed costs, structures and identifiable person(s) responsible for driving the change including delivery on the commitments in our Programme for Government. Issues related to staffing levels particularly in community mental health teams will be examined in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">Undoubtedly, the current economic situation is having an effect on people's mental health and well being.  The impact of unemployment and the strain of financial difficulties on physical and mental health are well known.  In this regard, following consultation with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and Citizens Information Centres, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention launched the <i>‘Tough Economic Times’</i> programme in 2009.   150,000 information leaflets highlighting the practical things we can do to protect our mental health were produced for the public as well as a guidance book for organisations which advises how to prepare staff to recognise and respond to mental health related problems.  The HSE continues to deliver the mental health awareness campaigns — <i>’Your Mental Health’</i> and the <i>’Let some one know’</i>   campaign which is aimed at young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1832">The Government's policy on mental health incorporates the recommendations of <i> Vision for Change.</i>  This Government is committed to reducing the stigma of mental illness, ensuring early and appropriate intervention and vastly improving access to modern mental health services in the community. The Programme for Government states that unsuitable psychiatric institutions will be closed and patients including those with intellectual disabilities and older people in the care of the mental health services will be provided with more appropriate community based facilities.  Children and adolescents will be provided with appropriate in-patient accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">The Health Service Executive has achieved considerable progress in recent years in providing appropriate accommodation and its capital programme supports the Government's commitments as set out in the Programme for Government.  The Executive's Capital Plan 2011-2015, which is published on its website set out its planned programme including mental health infrastructure.  For example 10 x 6 bed bungalows have been provided for people with intellectual disabilities who were previously resident at St Ita's Portrane.  New in-patient accommodation for children and adolescent services has been provided — 20 beds each at Bessboro in Cork and St Anne's Galway. At St Vincent's Fairview, six child &amp; adolescent beds have been provided, a further six beds are under construction and it is planned to deliver a further eight.  Hostel accommodation is being provided at Clondalkin, Ballyfermot, Islandbridge, Crumlin, and St John's Enniscorthy.  Long term residential accommodation is under construction at Wexford, Mullingar and the accommodation provided at Ballinasloe is operational.  Acute mental health departments on acute hospital campuses are at different stages of delivery — Beaumont at construction; OLOL Drogheda at design stage; Letterkenny opened in recent days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">The Programme for Government provided for a Comprehensive Spending Review which is now well under way.  This exercise includes a review of the planned health care capital programme. The outcomes of this review will determine the health care capital allocations for 2012 and future years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1847">The Deputy will appreciate that all developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and any decisions taken by the Executive must have regard to this and the current moratorium on the recruitment of nursing and non-nursing staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">Following his appointment as Minister for Health my colleague Dr Reilly T.D. instructed the HSE to advise him of situations where it was planning to withdraw residential care for older people.  In this regard the HSE notified the Minister of the proposal to reduce the number of long stay beds at Mount Carmel, Clonakilty, County Cork.  Each HSE area, including the Local Health Office in Cork has been asked to make a rigorous examination of how existing funding might be re-allocated to ensure maximum safe service provision and the HSE proposal is being considered in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1849">As the Deputy is aware the Department is currently reviewing the provision of public residential care in the light of the need to meet national standards and regulations, local demographic pressures and public and private provision.  The review will serve for a platform for discussion and will inform the development of an overall strategy on how the HSE should continue to provide this service in future in view of current budgetary and other pressures.   The review must also be seen in the light of the wider health reform programme to which the Government is committed, and the position of social care services in a future health service.  The position in relation to individual units, including Clonakilty, will be contemplated within this review.  There is no separate review of Clonakilty proposed at this time.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_1855">The HSE has confirmed that ambulance services are not being downgraded in Cork and Kerry. In fact, the opposite is true, as stations move to on-duty status and away from on-call. This means that highly trained paramedic crews will be on site in their stations to respond to calls, rather than having to go to the station when called out. It also means that resources can be deployed dynamically, based on need and demand patterns, rather than simply by location, producing more flexibility and responsiveness. This will produce better response times for the people in Cork and Kerry and a better service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">Caherciveen will, under the new system, move to full 24 hour on-duty cover. Paramedics will be present at all times, with an on-duty ambulance during the day and an on-duty rapid response vehicle at night. The dynamic delivery model means that an on-duty emergency ambulance will be available from within the region as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">The HSE and Unions are committed to the elimination of on-call working, which has already been reduced from 44 hours to 16 hours per week.  The reduction of on call hours will continue on a phased basis, as part of the improvement of services and response times in the region. An evaluation of the service will take place after each phase in completed to identify any issues arising.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">Current evidence suggests patient outcomes can be improved by better treatment and stabilisation at the scene, followed by ongoing treatment and transport to the most appropriate centre, even if that means longer transport times.  On-duty service will enable a modern emergency response service, involving paramedics, advanced paramedics, community first responders and GP out of hour services, working together to respond to emergency situations.  This approach is consistent with international best practice and will ensure compliance with HIQA response times and quality standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">On-duty rostering is one of several service enhancements. Other developments include improved arrangements for control and dispatch, practitioner deployment and inter-hospital transfers.  All of these will allow the National Ambulance Service to provide a better, safer, more comprehensive and more efficient emergency ambulance service to the people of Cork and Kerry.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_1878">The 2008 consultants' contract includes measures to strengthen the management, monitoring and control of activity in hospitals with a view to ensuring that the level of consultant private practice within public hospitals does not exceed the permitted ratio — 20% for new consultants, and up to 30% for those who had such a level previously.  The HSE in conjunction with the ESRI has introduced a range of new measurement systems in order to meet the requirements of the contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1879">Since January 2009 each consultant is issued with a monthly public/private mix measurement report.  This documents the consultant's activity in relation to inpatient, day case, outpatient and diagnostic activity over the previous three months.  The contract provides that the employer may require the consultant to remit monies in respect of any private practice excess to a research and study fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1880">At this stage, the HSE's focus is on consultants who have been identified as engaging in as much as 50% private activity despite the passing of both a 9 month period allowed for resolution of the issue in the contract and substantial additional periods of time for remittance of private fees.  In January the HSE wrote to these consultants informing them that if they did not remit the required amount they would be required to cease private practice in respect of any segment of practice where they are in excess of the ratio specified in their contracts.  It also advised them that as employer it would reserve the right to invoke the Disciplinary Procedure specified at Appendix II of the Contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">To date the hospital managers have written to 70 Consultants who are 40% or higher in breach of their public private limits under the Consultant Contract 2008.  These Consultants were requested to provide 20% of the money owing as an initial step.  Failure to comply with the request to remit funds arising from breach of the public/private ratios would result in an instruction to cease charging private patients.  This follows the completion of the 9-month period provided to each consultant for them to resolve the issue and to query any data issues.  In many cases, the Consultant has had nearly 18 months to resolve the issue.  Non-compliant consultants had until the 15th September to rectify breaches under their contract.  A small number of consultants who failed to rectify the breach have been informed that they may no longer conduct private practice in public hospitals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1886">Programmes such as that proposed by the Deputy are a matter in the first instance for the Health Service Executive itself.  At present there is no statutory register of approved acupuncturists in Ireland; nor are acupuncturists employed in the publicly funded health sector.  While complementary therapists, including acupuncturists, are not subject to professional statutory regulation, they are subject to a range of legislation and regulation, similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law.  The Department makes available an information leaflet on complementary therapy to assist consumers in making an informed health choice — a copy is available at http:// <i>www.dohc.ie/publications/pdf/complementary_therapists_leaflet.pdf?direct=1</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1887">In line with a recommendation of the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists which reported in 2005, the Department of Health supports greater voluntary self regulation of complementary therapy, including acupuncture, which would enable a sector to speak with one voice.  The Department has already undertaken initiatives to support voluntary regulation e.g. the production of guidance for professional associations such as examples of codes of ethics and good practice, including grievance and disciplinary procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">HETAC (the Higher Education and Training Awards Council) and my Department recently commissioned a joint research project on the nature of academic validation of five specific complementary therapies including acupuncture in various jurisdictions and the criteria for identifying complementary therapies which warrant the academic validation of programmes by HETAC.  I look forward to considering the findings of this research in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_1894">Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company's publically available annual accounts for 2010 detail that the company spent €230,000 on consultancy fees last year.  As the Deputy is aware, the company is currently undergoing a major public consultation and master-planning process in relation to the future development of the harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1895">The accounts also disclose the fees and expenses paid to each individual director and confirm that the company fully complies with Department of Finance Travel and Subsistence regulations.  As part of its oversight of the corporate governance of the port companies, my Department has sought explanations in the small number of cases where the expenses of Directors exceed the norm.  In the case of Dún Laoghaire, the company have informed my Department that this arises because one of the directors resides outside of Dublin and receives travel expenses for attending meetings.  However, I understand the matter the Deputy highlights has been resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1896">My Department also monitors closely the financial performance of the port companies and has recently received the accounts for the first half of the year from all the port companies, including Dún Laoghaire.  The details of such accounts would be considered commercially sensitive, but I can inform the Deputy that the company remained profitable during the period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1897">The State ports are currently structured into nine competing port companies.  A review of ports policy is currently underway and I intend to publish a revised policy document as soon as possible.  The current structure of port companies will be one of the issues addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1898">In terms of cost savings, Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company has already cut its costs substantially.  I do not see that changing the status of the company will result in further savings <i>per se. </i> However, I am open to considering the merits and demerits of the transfer of the Port Company to Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council as part of the forthcoming Ports Policy review, though I have no specific plans to pursue this option.</p>

            <p eId="para_1901">Irish law governing recognition of foreign driving licences operates within the framework of EU driver licensing law. The essential criteria for recognition of foreign licences are, therefore, the existence of testing and licensing regimes in other jurisdictions which meet with EU standards. On this basis, Ireland has arrangements for mutual recognition of driving licences with other EU Member States, as well as with a number of other countries. This is of great importance for safety on our roads, as we need to be sure that people licensed to drive on our roads have met specific standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">In the case of the USA, where licensing is operated at State level and where not all States meet EU requirements, it is not possible to have an exchange relationship. However, the requirement of a six-month waiting period before taking a driving test in this jurisdiction is waived in the case of persons who hold a full licence in their own country. I remain open to the possibility of extending recognition to licences from other jurisdictions with whom we do not currently have an exchange relationship, provided that the necessary requirements are met.</p>

         his plans to increase the number of taxi regulation enforcement officers form the current nine officials who are under the remit of the National Transport Authority in view of the thousands of taxi vehicles across the country; his views that the use of the multi-agency enforcement teams to monitor and invigilate taxi regulations should be significantly increased in view of the success of these teams on the nights that they have been out; if he will ask the NTA to increase the number of multi-agency teams; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1907">I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 to 209, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1908">While the taxi regulation review is pressing ahead with its work under my chairmanship, the NTA retains its regulatory functions under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 including its statutory power to make regulations under section 34 of the Act. It is important that the NTA has such flexibility in the interests of being able to respond effectively to any enforcement challenges that arise in protecting the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1909">The supply and operation of taxi ranks is a key issue that is being examined  in the course of the review. The allocation of taxi rank spaces is a function of local authorities and It would be inappropriate to issue a direction to the NTA on this subject because of the role of local authorities and the difficult enforcement challenges being considered by the review steering group. However, it is an area that will have to be addressed by the review group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1910">Strengthening enforcement is a critical area for the taxi review and we are looking at how the NTA supported by the Gardaí be best deployed to target non-compliance in the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1911">In the case of compliance with the use of county stickers I have referred the Deputy's query to the NTA for a direct response on the level of compliance. If a reply is not received within 10 working days, please contact my private office.</p>

A number of road PPP projects have been successfully delivered in recent years. However the successful awarding of a major PPP contract involving private funding is challenging at any time but is particularly challenging in current circumstances where Ireland has been the subject of intervention by the IMF/EU. In view of the current circumstances the international debt funding market has been reluctant to lend funds to finance major projects in Ireland, the repayment of which is ultimately dependant on the state.</p>

            <p eId="para_1926">While there is no specific carbon reduction target for the transport sector, the sector has been contributing to reductions in these emissions.  The most recent EPA figures for greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector are for 2009, and these figures show that they have fallen from a peak of 14.33 million tonnes in 2007 to 13.12 million tonnes in 2009, representing a decrease of just over 8%.  A further decrease in emissions would be expected for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">Whilst much of this reduction in emissions can be attributed to the contraction of the economy, savings are also being made due to implemented policies and measures such as mobility management schemes, and promoting modal shift to cycling.  In particular the motor taxation and vehicle registration taxation rebalancing has resulted in a dramatic improvement in energy efficiency of new cars entering the fleet, leading to significant reductions in the associated greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1933">The sports sector is a major contributor to the economy, a contribution which includes sports tourism, ticket sales, subscriptions and the cost of playing sport, together with the purchase of sports equipment and an economic value of time given by volunteers. Sport and sport-related activities support over 38,000 full-time equivalent jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">Participation in sport can also bring benefits in terms of health and well-being which can in turn produce an economic dividend through reducing costs to the health service.  There is a very extensive financial dividend to be obtained through the success of major sporting events, particularly those with an international dimension. Through a variety of actions and investments Ireland is developing an enviable reputation as a destination to play and watch sports. Stadia such the Aviva, Croke Park, Semple Stadium and Thomond Park attract international and domestic tourists in large numbers throughout the year. The targeting of major international sporting events such as the Ryder and Solheim Cups in golf, the Volvo Ocean Race and the Irish Open golf tournament attracts tourists and also showcases the country in the best possible light.    The "Assessment of Economic Impact of Sport in Ireland" report which was prepared for the Irish Sports Council last year states that Government investment plays an important role in supporting and driving the wider economic benefits of sport.  This assessment demonstrates that there is a very significant return on Government investment and expenditure on sport in Ireland. For every €100 of Government expenditure, the Government receives approximately €149 back in the form of taxes and other income arising from sport-related economic activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1945">Chuir an t-údarás áitiúil doiciméad i dtoll a chéile le hinnealtóirí comhairligh  TSC agus leis an tSeirbhís Páirceanna Náisiúnta agus Fiadhúlra chun cás a dhéanamh maidir leis an R336 ó Bhearna go Scríb a thógáil agus é ag dul tré chuid  den cSAC eadhon Coimpléasc Portaigh Chonamara. Bhí cruinniú le hoifigigh an Choimisiúin an AE ar an ábhar seo i Mí Bealtaine na bliana seo.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">Tá an scéim fós ag céim an roghnú bealaigh agus  dhá bhealach nua faoi iniúchadh ag an gcomhairle leis an bfhéidearthacht maidir  le bóthar atá ann cheana féin a uasghrádú.  Tá súil acu go mbeidh tuilleadh comhairliúcháin phoiblí maidir leis an mbealach a roghnófar níos déanaí san Fhómhar.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">Tá athbhreithniú cuimsitheach ar chaitheachas caipitil ar siúl faoi láthair agus beidh na torthaí mar bhunús do Phlean Forbartha Náisiúnta Nua.  Beidh réaltachtaí nua maoinithe chomh maith curtha san áireamh san athbhreithniú. Beidh tosaíocht mhór ar mhaoiniú a chinntiú maidir le infheistíocht a rinneadh go dtí seo a chosaint agus a choimead ar bun agus chun caighdeáin sábháilteachta a choimeád ar bun chomh maith. Ní dhéanfar aon chinneadh ar leithdháiltí maoinithe go dtí go mbeidh an t-athbhreithniú chaipitil criochnaithe agus go mbeidh eolas ar fáil faoi bhuiséad na Roinne.</p>
