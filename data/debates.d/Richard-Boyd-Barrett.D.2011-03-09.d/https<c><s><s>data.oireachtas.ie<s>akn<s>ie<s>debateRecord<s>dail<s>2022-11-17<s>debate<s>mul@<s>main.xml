            <p eId="para_3">Ireland is resolute in its solidarity and support for Ukraine and we are honouring our commitment to help people who have been displaced by this horrendous war. More than 63,000 people who have been forced to leave their homes in Ukraine have sought refuge in Ireland, and approximately 45,000 of these people are being provided with accommodation from the State. However, this war is causing ongoing challenges such as rising energy prices, scarcity of energy supply and supply chain issues including accommodation. This is by some distance the largest humanitarian operation undertaken by the Irish State, and tourism accommodation has played a vital part in this national response. However, I recognise the growing concern among the wider tourism industry about how the amount of tourism bed stock taken out of the system for humanitarian reasons is likely to have a real impact on tourism's recovery in 2023 and beyond. In addition, hotel accommodation is not an ideal medium- to long-term solution for the accommodation needs of families, and this is why the Government is exploring a wide range of alternative options, including the rolling out of a rapid-build housing programme to provide accommodation for families fleeing the war in Ukraine. My officials have communicated these concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which is working urgently across government and with agencies, NGOs and local authorities to bring new accommodation on board so that the State's humanitarian responsibilities can be met. In addition, my Department is participating in the senior officials' group that is focusing on meeting the current humanitarian accommodation and other needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4">As the Minister is aware, the tourism sector is coming out of a very difficult few years after Covid-19 restrictions, on top of which there are the cost-of-living crisis, the energy crisis and the influx of refugees from the Ukrainian conflict. However, media reports yesterday covered the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, issuing of a report, Irish Tourism: Impact of Ukrainian Conflict. The report says that Ireland is an outlier in Europe in regard to its over-reliance on tourist beds for refugees. The report also says that almost 22% of tourist accommodation in the State is currently used by the State for refugees both from Ukraine and other parts, and that is expected to rise with the influx of refugees over the winter months. It says that the Government figure suggests 76% of Ukrainian refugees in Ireland are being accommodated in tourist facilities. As the Minister knows, we have heard other reports about the severe knock-on effect this has had on the sector. Has the Minister met with the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, to try to find a solution to this?</p>

            <p eId="para_5">I thank Deputy Munster. As I said, we are resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine. More than 45,000 Ukrainian people have sought accommodation from the State in addition to more than 16,000 international protection applicants. This compares with 7,500 at the same time last year. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's, Department has sourced accommodation for the equivalent of the population of Waterford city in the past six months. My officials have communicated concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, especially in respect of the peak period, which starts from around St. Patrick's Day onwards. I have communicated these concerns also to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. That is why I am glad my Department is represented on that senior officials' group that is focusing on meeting the current humanitarian accommodation and other needs and conveying the concerns of the tourism sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_6">About 80% of refugees have been put up in facilities outside of Dublin. That means the knock-on effect on those areas is particularly harsh when it comes to tourism. The ITIC also estimates there could be a loss of up to €1 billion in earnings and hundreds of job losses. That represents a serious threat to the industry. The Minister said the Government is looking at a rapid house building programme, but in all fairness, how long have we been hearing that? As the Minister said, the pressure will really be on in earnest in early spring. I do not get from what the Minister just said that there is a plan in place already that will be fit for purpose come the springtime to accommodate refugees fleeing conflict anywhere other than hotels. That is going to have a detrimental effect on our tourism for 2023.</p>

            <p eId="para_7">Hotel accommodation has been seen from the very beginning as a short term solution. It is not an ideal medium- to long-term solution for the accommodation needs of families. That is why the Government is exploring the wide range of alternative options, including the rolling out of a rapid-build housing programme. The use of tourist accommodation to meet humanitarian needs, while necessary in the short term, has obviously led to concerns for everyone involved in tourism, from what I have heard from engagement with the sector. My Department is represented on the senior officials' group on this issue. In addition, my Department has regular engagement with the sector representatives on a range of issues, including this. Department officials will next meet with the tourism agencies and tourism sector representatives on 6 December 2022. There is ongoing engagement with the Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and between me and the Minister, and I have conveyed the concerns of the industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">Tá sé ríthábhachtach domsa go dtugtar stádas comhionann don Ghaeilge i ngach réimse den saol, ach go háirithe i leith na craoltóireachta, a bhfuil ról ríthábhachtach aici i múnlú fhéiniúlacht agus chultúr na hÉireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> As the Deputy will recall, this issue of potential pay discrepancies between workers in Raidió na Gaeltachta and their English language counterparts, and the ongoing review by RTÉ of its grading structure, was raised during Committee Stage of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill on 26 October last. I know it is something of which Deputy Munster has been cognisant and has brought to the fore. At that time, if she remembers, I undertook to seek clarification from RTÉ on the issue and to respond to the committee. On foot of this, my officials wrote to RTÉ seeking such clarification, and in response RTÉ has provided further detail on the ongoing review process.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> I am informed that the review process involves a detailed and full evaluation of all staff roles and grades, including an assessment of the organisation's skills and requirements as a modern media organisation. I am aware that when the matter was raised with RTÉ by the Committee of Public Accounts earlier this year, at the meeting to which Deputy Munster referred, the director general confirmed that a comparison between Irish language workers and their English language counterparts was not specifically included in the terms of reference for the current process. However, it is designed to enable RTÉ to devise a simplified grading structure with fairness and transparency across all roles, including those in Raidió na Gaeltachta. The process is ongoing and is likely to be concluded in June of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009, RTÉ is independent in the pursuit of its objects, both in terms of editorial decisions and its day-to-day management and operational activities. However, parity of esteem for the Irish language is very important and, therefore, I share the Deputy's concerns to ensure there is no disparity in pay that is purely related to the language through which someone conducts their work. As such, I have written to RTÉ this week asking that it communicates directly with the joint committee to set out how this process could address the committee's concerns about the terms of employment of Irish language workers.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ImeldaMunster" eId="spk_10">
            <from>Deputy Imelda Munster<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">As the Minister said, I have raised this at several committees, including the joint committee with responsibility for media and the Committee of Public Accounts. When I raised the issue at the Committee of Public Accounts, the RTÉ representatives at that time gave a commitment to review the situation. We chased it up with them because we had got no response, and they came back eventually and said that was not happening. While I appreciate the response the Minister got, when I first raised this at the Committee of Public Accounts, it was April 2021, so I suspect they are dragging their heels. The Minister said there is an ongoing review. I would say to the Minister that we need to keep on top of this. It is discrimination, and there is no other way to describe it.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> While the Minister respects the independence of RTÉ as a public broadcaster, we certainly will not be turning a blind eye to blatant discrimination, which is what this is. I do not hold much faith in the ongoing review. I think they are giving the same spiel they gave to us in the Committee of Public Accounts, and then when we press them, there is nothing happening at all. We need to keep on top of this and not let them away with this or let them continue that practice.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CatherineMartin" eId="spk_11" as="#Minister_for_Tourism,_Culture,_Arts,_Gaeltacht,_Sport_and_Media">
            <from>Deputy Catherine Martin<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">I share the Deputy’s concern to make sure there is no disparity in pay. That is why, after Committee Stage of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, I committed to the Oireachtas joint committee that we would have follow-up discussions with RTÉ, which my officials did. I have written to RTÉ, with regard to disparity in pay which is purely related to the language through which someone conducts their work, outlining that there must be equality. While those in RTÉ, through the engagement with officials, have provided further detail on the ongoing process, I have asked them to communicate directly with the committee to set out how the process will address the pay disparity. I think we are on the same page in keeping a focus on this.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ImeldaMunster" eId="spk_12">
            <from>Deputy Imelda Munster<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_18">That is very much appreciated. What I would suggest, and we will do this at committee level, is to request detail and a timeframe from RTÉ. It is funded by the licence payer. A practice of discrimination against Irish language workers is just not tolerable. I want them to prove me wrong but, up until now, they have not given me much faith. The Minister may be able to assist the committee in looking for specific detail as to what stage the review is at, what the review entails specifically in this area to address this pay disparity, and a timeframe in which we can see this discrimination and pay disparity addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">Parity of esteem for the Irish language is very important. I have asked RTÉ in my communication with it this week that it communicates directly with the joint committee to set out this process, which I think will address what the Deputy is looking for, and set out how that process could address the committee's concerns about the terms of employment of Irish language workers. I do not wish to pre-empt what further clarity RTÉ might provide but I am more than happy to continue the engagement with RTÉ on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_22">Tuigim go bhfuil dréacht den phlean infheistíochta foilsithe ag Conradh na Gaeilge le cúpla lá anuas agus go bhfuil cóip den dréacht feicthe ag feidhmeannaigh mo Roinne. Ó tharla gur dréacht é, níl sé i gceist agam aon ráiteas a dhéanamh ina leith ag an tráth seo. É sin ráite, is féidir a bheith cinnte go leanfaidh mo Roinn ag cabhrú mar is cuí le cúnamh reatha agus caipitil a chur ar fáil faoi na cláir Ghaeilge agus Ghaeltachta ar leas foriomlán na teanga agus an phobail.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> Mar is eol don Teachta, tá infheistíocht shuntasach déanta ag an Rialtas seo sa Ghaeilge agus sa Ghaeltacht le cúpla bliain anuas. D'éirigh liom méadú 10% a fháil ar mhaoiniú d’earnáil na Gaeltachta don bhliain seo chugainn, arb ionann le €8.5 milliún de mhaoiniú breise, agus leithdháileadh iomlán de €94.2 milliún don bhliain 2023. Is ag tógáil ar an méadú a fuarthas don earnáil i 2022 atá an t-allúntas breise seo don bhliain seo chugainn. Úsáidfear an maoiniú méadaithe seo chun na héachtaí a baineadh amach go dtí seo le cur chun feidhme Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú) 2021 a fhorbairt tuilleadh agus chun pobail na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta a fhorbairt agus a chothú sna blianta seo romhainn.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Sa chomhthéacs sin, ba mhaith liom tagairt ar leith a dhéanamh don straitéis do na healaíona teanga-bhunaithe agus an plean digiteach nua don Ghaeilge atá le foilsiú roimh dheireadh na bliana. Déanaim tagairt freisin don infheistíocht shuntasach atá déanta ag an Rialtas seo i TG4 le cúpla bliain anuas, agus ardú os cionn 40% ar leibhéal maoinithe an stáisiúin le trí bliana anuas. San áireamh leis an soláthar don bhliain seo chugainn, tá €3.3 milliún chun cainéal teilifíse Gaeilge do leanaí a bhunú, rud a bhí á éileamh le blianta. Cuirfidh sé ar chumas TG4 freastal níos fearr a dhéanamh ar na pobail sin a labhraíonn Gaeilge agus deiseanna a chruthú do chainteoirí Gaeilge tríd ábhar a choimisiúnú ó earnáil na léiritheoirí neamhspleácha. Tosóimid 2023 le fuinneamh athnuaite agus le fios againn go bhfuil maoiniú breise ar fáil dúinn chun tacú le forbairt leanúnach na Gaeilge agus na bpobal Gaeltachta.</p>

Is é sin an difríocht faoin Rialtas seo. Chomh maith leis sin, thóg muid isteach Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú) 2021 ag deireadh na bliana seo caite. Tá €1 milliún ar fáil chun tús a chur le forbairtí nua ó thaobh na Gaeilge sa Státseirbhís araon le buiséad níos mó agus foireann bhreise in oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga. Go luath, beidh mé ag seoladh plean digiteach don Ghaeilge agus straitéis do na healaíona teangabhunaithe. Tá infheistíocht shuntasach á pleanáil againn sna blianta beaga romhainn. Táimid tiomanta. Nuair a fheictear ar an allúntas atá ag Údarás na Gaeltachta an bhliain seo chugainn i gcomparáid leis an méid a bhí á fháil aige trí nó ceithre bliana ó shin, feictear go bhfuil difríocht an-mhór ann.

Ní hé go n-aontaím le gach rud atá ann ach tá smaointe maithe ann agus ba chóir dúinn ar fad, san Fhreasúra agus sa Rialtas, féachaint air seo agus, más féidir linn in aon chor, cuidiú agus cur leis. Tá aitheantas tugtha don Aire Stáit agus don Rialtas as an airgead atá caite go dtí seo agus as an airgead a bheidh á chaitheamh, ach is léir ón dréacht seo gur gá i bhfad Éireann níos mó ó thaobh caiteachais Stáit de chun an coibhneas a bhí ann idir na heagrais a luaigh mé a bhaint amach arís.

Go deimhin, sheol mé an tríú tuairisc bhliantúil ar dul chun cinn an phlean ghníomhaíochta le déanaí ag Oireachtas na Samhna i gCill Áirne. Tá sé le feiceáil go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh, go háirithe leis an bpróiseas pleanála teanga.

            <p eId="para_31">Tá an cheist seo cosúil leis an gceist a chuir an Teachta Munster. This question is similar to that raised by Deputy Munster. It relates to the need for pay parity for Irish language workers in RTÉ and asks the Minister to report on her engagements in that regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Catherine Martin<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_32">.As I set out in my response to Deputy Munster on the issue of potential pay discrepancies between workers in Raidió na Gaeltachta and their English language counterparts, RTÉ is currently undertaking a wide-ranging review of its staff grading structure. I am advised that this process involves a root-and-branch evaluation of all staff roles and grades, including an assessment of the skills needs and requirements of the organisation. It is designed to enable RTÉ to devise a streamlined grading structure with fairness and transparency across all roles, including those in Raidió na Gaeltachta. The review is ongoing and I understand it is likely to conclude in June next year. Deputy Munster asked for clarification in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> Tá sé ríthábhachtach domsa go dtugtar stádas comhionann don Ghaeilge i ngach réimse den saol, ach go háirithe i leith na craoltóireachta. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá ról ríthábhachtach aici i múnlú féiniúlacht agus chultúr na hÉireann. It is of critical importance to me that the Irish language is given equal status in all spheres of life, but particularly in respect of broadcasting, which serves such a crucial role in shaping Irish identity and culture. I would therefore share the Deputy's concerns with regard to ensuring there is no disparity in pay that is purely related to the language through which a person conducts his or her work. I am aware the Committee of Public Accounts has raised its concerns on this matter with RTÉ directly and that RTÉ has committed to providing an update to that committee in due course. As the Deputy will recall, the issue was also raised with me on Committee Stage of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> As I stated to the Deputy's colleague, issues relating to staffing and remuneration are operational matters for RTÉ and I am mindful of its statutory independence in these matters, as set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009. Nevertheless, my officials have engaged with RTÉ to seek further clarity on the matter and will continue to monitor the progress and outcome of the review process in the context of the Department's corporate governance oversight of RTÉ. Notwithstanding this, I consider it necessary and important for RTÉ to address comprehensively the concerns raised by the committee in respect of the pay of Irish language workers, and I have written to RTÉ asking that it respond to the joint committee in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as an soiléiriú go bhfuil sé i gceist an tuairisc mar gheall ar na gráid phá in RTÉ a bheith críochnaithe ina iomláine i mí an Mheithimh an bhliain seo chugainn. Is drochlá é, it is a sad day when the State broadcaster has two different levels of pay for the same work. The work of many of those within Raidió na Gaeltachta is probably at a higher level than those on the equivalent. For instance, presenters at Raidió na Gaeltachta are not just presenters; they are also researchers, producers and journalists. There is often an additional burden on those working at Raidió na Gaeltachta. I heard what the Minister said and I welcome her support for the enshrinement of equal pay for equal work within all State sectors, including Raidió na Gaeltachta and RTÉ.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">As I outlined in my replies to the Deputy and to Deputy Munster, both of whom I thank for raising this important issue, parity of esteem between the Irish and English languages is vital and so I share the Deputy's concerns in respect of any disparity in pay purely related to the language through which a person conducts his or her work. Although we have been told the ongoing review is not specifically designed to address any disparity in the remuneration of Irish language workers at RTÉ compared with their English language counterparts, the current review process is examining all roles in the organisation. While RTÉ has provided further detail on the ongoing process, I have written to ask it to address the specific concerns of the committee, to communicate with the joint committee, and to set out how the process will address pay disparity. I do not wish to pre-empt any further clarity RTÉ might provide but I am happy to engage further with it on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">This issue has not been in gestation for the past year or so; it has been growing for several years, to the frustration of those working within the Irish language media sections of RTÉ.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">The specific complaint relates to Raidió na Gaeltachta in particular, which is a national broadcaster, yet its workers are treated as second-class workers. Will the Minister, in any of the communications she will have in the future, ask RTÉ whether it will retrospectively address the unequal pay for unequal work that has happened over the years at Raidió na Gaeltachta?</p>

            <p eId="para_39">As I said, I have to emphasise that this is a matter for RTÉ, given its statutory independence. My Department has no role in the day-to-day administrative or operational functions of RTÉ and, therefore, I cannot direct it in matters relating to staff remuneration. It is vital, however, that there is parity of esteem between both languages. There should also be transparency and clarity on the grading of and, by extension, remuneration for workers, regardless of the language through which their work is conducted. That is why I asked RTÉ to provide greater clarity and address Members' concerns regarding the remuneration of Irish-language staff and how this process will achieve this. On the Deputy's specific question, it would be more prudent to await the outcome of the review before I jump to any conclusions. I will assess where we are when I see that review.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">My role and that of my departmental officials in tourism lies primarily in the area of national tourism policy development and in securing resources to assist the tourism agencies, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, in implementing that policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> With regard to specific expenditure by Fáilte Ireland from its Exchequer funding allocations, such decisions are an operational matter for Fáilte Ireland, as the national tourism development authority. Neither I, nor my Department, has any role in decisions by the authority regarding its operational funding priorities and related expenditure. On future funding, Fáilte Ireland is unable to commit to any funding at this time as there are currently no schemes open for application. Fáilte Ireland has, however, pledged its full support to the company that will be charged with steering the development of King John's Castle going forward. Indeed, a Fáilte Ireland representative will sit on the board of the newly-formed company.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> The Limerick City and County Council takeover of King John's Castle has been a big step forward for the success of the castle and the implications for the wider tourism economy will be far-reaching. As the council only took ownership in April, I am advised that the focus for the summer season was to steady the ship operationally first. King John's Castle had a very successful summer that was full of events, including high-profile concerts, encouraging visitor feedback, and high-profile media coverage nationally and internationally. Fáilte Ireland continues to support King John's Castle through a number of enterprise supports, including, but not limited to, saleable experience and digital that delivers. This is against the backdrop of continued investment in Limerick by Fáilte Ireland, including funding, which will develop a thematic city quarter cluster approach to introduce visitors to each distinctive area of the city and link existing visitor attractions to supporting experiences.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> From a wider perspective on tourism capital investment, I look forward to seeing the delivery of projects that will support a tourism sector that is sustainable from environmental, social, and economic perspectives. Fáilte Ireland's priority areas for tourism capital investment include the development and enhancement of tourist attractions and activity-based tourism to provide the type and quality of experience that visitors are seeking. Our overall tourism product offering has led to Ireland being recognised internationally as a year-round, high-quality tourism destination in both urban and rural settings.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">I thank the Minister for her answer and acknowledge the important separation between her role as Minister and Fáilte Ireland. King John's Castle in Limerick is a truly iconic structure. The word "iconic" has been overused and abused down through the years but it absolutely applies to King John's Castle, which is at the heart of Limerick city. I know that Limerick people would welcome the Minister to King John's Castle at an appropriate time in the future. As she said, the impetus in the past few months has been to steady the ship in order to successfully manage the handover from Shannon Group to Limerick City and County Council. The evidence of the past few months indicates that has been very successful. I think the Minister and I would both wish Limerick City and County Council continued success. I look forward to further support. I also acknowledge her words that Fáilte Ireland is pledging full support to the council in its endeavours.</p>

It has pledged full support to the company that will be charged with the development and steering of it. As the Deputy agreed, the company has had quite a successful summer in steadying the ship, with those wonderful events and concerts and high-profile media coverage, which is good, not just for King John's Castle but the wider area. I am quite happy to visit King John's Castle and undertake other engagements in Limerick; I can chat to the Deputy about that. I will link in with my officials to see where that can be arranged in the diary. I look forward to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">I thank the Minister. I ask her to consider a visit to King John's Castle and the wider Limerick and mid-west area. There are many amenities there. I know she has visited already. Her officials will obviously liaise with the council as to when the appropriate time might be to visit King John's Castle. We look forward to that.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> On the broader issue of sustainable tourism she mentioned, Limerick and the mid-west has fantastic potential that she will be very keen to develop. One project that has been uppermost in my mind in the past number of months, which has been progressed by our colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is the rail line to Foynes. This will initially be used for rail freight but there is great potential, particularly with the Ryder Cup coming up in Adare in 2027, to open a new station there. I am not asking for any commitments but certainly that all Cabinet Members - I see the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, looking at me - and the Minister be aware of the potential for a train station in Adare, especially as we lead up to the Ryder Cup because we will have to move approximately 100,000 a day when that competition takes place.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">As the Deputy said, the tourism offering in Limerick is vast and within the development of our new national tourism policy, where some consultation is now happening with stakeholders, there will be public consultation in the new year. We are looking to put sustainability at the heart of tourism. That includes all-year-round tourism and driving it out in order that visitors do not just arrive at the capital city for a few days but explore the regions. That is significant. Our greenways, as we have in Limerick, and blueways or waterways, are key to that.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> On Foynes, we have the Foynes Flying Boat &amp; Maritime Museum, which has received €1.5 million from the rural regeneration development fund. We should also consider everything that has been done regarding outdoor dining facilities and funding for the Limerick greenway. As I said, there is significant potential there. On Adare, the Ryder Cup 2027 will be massive for Limerick. I look forward to that and to engaging on it. Fáilte Ireland sees the massive potential in that, as does Tourism Ireland. It is being talked about worldwide at every event members of those bodies attend.</p>

            <from>Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_56">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The basic income for the arts, BIA, pilot was a key priority for me as Minister with responsibility for arts and culture. I see this scheme as an important intervention to support the arts sector recover after the devastation wreaked by the Covid pandemic. Covid clearly highlighted both the precarious nature of working in the arts but more so, it shone a light on the importance of the arts for us all. It is well established that artists suffer from precarious incomes. The scheme will research the impact of providing the security of a basic income on the creative practice of artists and creative arts workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> The pilot was also the number one recommendation of the arts and culture recovery taskforce, which I established in 2020 to examine ways in which to help the arts recover post-pandemic. I was very pleased to have been able to deliver on this recommendation with the first payments on the scheme being made to recipients two weeks ago. A total of 2,000 recipients are being paid €325 a week for three years while 1,000 control group members are being paid €650 per year to engage in the data collection. The scheme will cost €35 million per year and €105 million in total. A total of 1,992 recipients have received their payments to date. A small number of participants have decided not to accept their place on the scheme and these places will be reallocated shortly. It will be weighted in such a way that they will be treated in the same way as the 2,000 original applicants were selected.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> The research will examine over a three-year period the impact of a basic income-style payment on artists and creative arts workers. This research element is a hugely important part of the pilot scheme. The scheme recognises that there is a vast body of often unpaid or underpaid time that goes into the making of the creative work that we as a society enjoy. The ambition of the scheme is that by providing the security of a basic income, artists and creative arts workers can focus on artistic work and be in a position to increase their earnings from their creative practice as a self-employed artist or creative. I have established the scheme very firmly as a research project so that an evidence base can be developed around the impact of the policy. The scheme is a randomised control trial that consists of two groups of randomly selected people. The treatment group will receive the basic income while the control group will not receive it. Analysis of the results will involve a comparison of averages between the two groups. As the groups have the same characteristics at baseline and are large enough to be a statistically representative sample, any difference arising during the trial can be assumed to have been caused by the policy. I am very grateful to all the applicants who agreed to participate in the control group. Being able to compare and track their careers against those who will receive the BIA will be essential in demonstrating the impact of the payment on artists and their creative practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> Participants will be surveyed at least twice a year and will keep a journal so they are in a position to give accurate data. Focus groups, interviews and seminars will also happen to collect more qualitative data on how the scheme is impacting participants' lives. Baselining research information has been received from recipients who have accepted their place on the scheme so that research has already kicked off. Research findings on the impact of the pilot on the individuals and their practices, the sector and ecology of the arts in Ireland will form an important part of the pilot. Data on income and earnings, time use, work and job quality, well-being and mental health will be collected using a longitudinal survey every six months plus focus groups, interviews and art form specific research topics.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> The Government wants to give recognition to the value of the arts and the role of creative practice in Irish society. That is what this pilot scheme is all about. It is about addressing the earnings instability that can be associated with the intermittent, periodic and often project-based nature of work in the arts.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> I believe that the BIA pilot scheme is a once-in-a-generation, transformational measure in the funding of the arts in Ireland. It makes a strong statement at home and abroad about the value that Ireland as a nation places on artistic practice both for its intrinsic value and in terms of our personal and collective well-being and also in terms of its importance to our identity and cultural distinctiveness on the global stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">This is very important if you want an experiment. That is why it is a pilot scheme. I wish it well. I have raised points previously and will continue to feed them in. Hopefully, those points will be addressed as the pilot continues. What will happen with the underspend from this year because the introduction was delayed and artists did not receive payment as expected in April? The money allocated for this year was €25 million. Will this funding be re-purposed within the Department, for example, for a hardship scheme or other schemes or will it just carry over and be added to the €35 million that has been allocated in the budget for next year? I presume it is additional funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">A total of €25 million was allocated for this year because we knew we would not have a full year of basic income and that it would take time to get the randomised process up and running to do the engagement. I welcome and appreciate the Deputy's constructive engagement throughout this process. He has been very supportive of this scheme, which I think comes from his and his family's direct experience of the arts. All will get the full three years of payment. That is guaranteed regardless of when it started. It is a three-year project. It started on 29 August 2022 and will be a three-year project. My plan is for the savings in 2022 will be re-purposed and we will give further consideration to that but it is guaranteed to be €35 million per year and to be a full three-year project.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I understood it was €35 million. I was referring to the funding that needs to be re-purposed and if it will be re-purposed for artists because it was set aside for artists in particular. The Minister knows from the 9,000 plus artists who applied for this that there is a demand so hopefully the Minister will be able to re-purpose and possibly focus on those who were unsuccessful or those who are down on their luck.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> My other question relates to August 2025, when the pilot ends and if that becomes a cliff edge. Will the research and the report be produced in advance of that cliff edge so the Department can recalibrate the scheme or ensure people are aware of the end of the pilot? Will it continue to allow for the findings and research to take effect?</p>

            <p eId="para_67">It is my plan to re-purpose. The details will be available shortly. It will support artists, energy supports they need and the issues that affect the arts, like any other sector. In respect of 2025, the research piece is ongoing. We already have the baseline from the participants who received their payment. Something will be published every six months so we will see the benefits and impact of it as it is ongoing so it will not be the case that suddenly in August 2025 we will have the effect of this. We will have that continuous assessment from the control group and the 2,000 successful applicants.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Jack Chambers)<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_71">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 15 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> While Government support for larger sports projects was previously provided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, the largescale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF, was launched in 2018 to provide an open and transparent system for applying for such funding. The first call for proposals was confined to national governing bodies of sport and local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> Following a detailed assessment process, the first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately €86.4 million has been allocated to 33 different proposals. These initial allocations include funding for eight swimming pool projects. Details of all applications made and grants awarded are published on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">It should be noted that the allocations were announced in January 2020 just prior to the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic obviously gave rise to significant financial challenges for all grantees with many of them having to reprioritise their own expenditure plans due to reductions in their income streams. In more recent times, the high level of construction inflation has also presented considerable challenges for grantees. In view of these issues, it was considered timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants and meetings with all grantees have now taken place. It is encouraging that, based on these discussions with grantees, 22 of the 33 projects should be in a position to draw down funding in 2023. Accordingly, I expect to see significant progress on many of the LSSIF projects in the short to medium term and so there is unlikely to be any savings in the relevant subhead next year to allow a reallocation of funding. I am also aware that progress has been made by a number of grantees in securing additional sources of funding outside of the LSSIF process.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> Dealing specifically with new swimming pool projects, work has commenced on the development of the first national swimming strategy based on a vision to provide everyone in Ireland with an opportunity to swim. The working group tasked with the detailed work of preparing the strategy is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives from relevant national governing bodies, NGBs, and stakeholders. An extensive consultation process has been undertaken across both stakeholders and the public and work is ongoing on the analysis of this after a very large number of responses were received. It is hoped to finalise the new strategy in the coming months and it will further guide future swimming pool investment policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> In the medium term, I will continue to explore all options to assist those large-scale projects that have not progressed to date. In this regard, I am continuing to engage with my Government colleagues and officials have also been liaising with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to make the case for further funding for the LSSIF. Securing additional funding will also allow the consideration of a new call for LSSIF proposals, as well as advancing the current design projects to construction stage. </p>

          <speech by="#PadraigOSullivan" eId="spk_41">
            <from>Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_77">It is welcome to see that €6 million has been drawn down by those 33 projects, as the Minister of State has alluded to. The fundamental point here, though, is that regarding many of these larger organisations, and the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, comes to mind immediately, it is well documented that they are fairly cash-strapped now and are incapable of progressing many of these applications without some kind of a review and a leg-up. It is, therefore, great to see that this engagement has happened. I would be grateful if the Minister of State could provide a timeline regarding when he thinks these negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform might conclude.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> I am thinking of one project in particular that is especially time-sensitive and which I have spoken to the Minister of State about previously. I refer to the FAI centre of excellence in Glanmire. It received planning permission about seven years ago. Time is ticking on this project and we must see if we can get it off the ground. It may not be in the guise we initially envisaged but at least work might be started on it. This project is particularly time-sensitive and the planning permission for this project will lapse in the next two to three years. I welcome hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_79">We are continuing to engage with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In fairness, the FAI, and I can send a note to the Deputy specifically on the engagements regarding the project in Glanmire, is advancing and is the lead applicant for the Donegal Community Stadium for Finn Harps. We expect drawdown to happen there and, hopefully, there will be further progress on this in the coming months. The FAI is, therefore, advancing certain projects. It has also helped and is assisting many clubs in grassroots communities to draw down the record level of funding we gave in the sports capital and equipment programme. I will revert to the Deputy on the specifics of the project he referred to, which I know is important in Cork. As I said, we are continuing to engage. As we have increased drawdown potential, we expect two thirds of these projects to commence next year, which is significant progress compared with where we were at this year. We are conscious of the level of ambition that exists, the need in respect of certain projects that still have a funding gap and this is the basis of our engagement. I do not have a timeline for when this will conclude.</p>

            <p eId="para_80">It is welcome that there is ongoing engagement with organisations like the FAI and that they are progressing some projects. I emphasise the importance of the centre of excellence in Glanmire. It will be a project that will cover most of Munster. Especially now that Cork City has been elevated back into the League of Ireland Premier Division, it is imperative that, in conjunction with the FAI, we continue to develop the facility there. As I said, if it does not take the guise or the form we originally planned or envisaged, then some level of development can still take place. The only real outstanding question I have concerns the possibility of the funds not being drawn down on any project, be it in Glanmire or anywhere else. Will the Minister of State confirm what will happen to the money? Will it be ring-fenced for sport in that area and region, will it return to the Minister of State's Department or will it go to other outstanding projects?</p>

            <p eId="para_81">I agree with what was said about Glanmire. Turning to the issue of clubs and organisations establishing and building major or minor sporting facilities, one of the issues that arises is the availability of land and sites for these projects. We are hoping to build many houses. As a former Minister of State in the Department of Justice and Equality, I am concerned about antisocial behaviour if we build more and more houses but no sporting facilities and infrastructure as part of this endeavour. Will the Minister of State agree with me that this is something that must be looked at and reviewed urgently and that we need to start ring-fencing land for sporting facilities, such as swimming pools, soccer pitches, football pitches, running tracks and so on?</p>

            <p eId="para_82">I thank both Deputies for their questions. Turning to the comments from Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan first, I am conscious of the importance of the centre of excellence in Glanmire. It was great to see Cork City returning to the Premier Division. I look forward to the club's success next year. I am also conscious of the importance of having proper training facilities for the next generation of footballers. A sympathetic view is taken in respect of timelines and projected funding. This is very much done on a collaborative basis between my Department and the applicants. There is no specific cliff edge for the removal of funding. I encourage continued engagement between applicants and the Department. This is the nature of how these matters are dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> There is an issue in certain parts of the country concerning land. Through the development plan process, it is incumbent on local authorities to ensure land is allocated for recreational use. Many local authorities are doing that. Our role is to facilitate grassroots and local authority applications to fund specific projects. As a Department, we are not presently in the space of purchasing land or owning a significant land bank for the provision of sports facilities. Good sustainable planning ensures this community development piece is aligned with housing supply. We must ensure that this is a core focus in any major plans in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_88"> I have been very heartened by the response rates to the consultation, which are testament to the increased popularity of swimming and the critical role it can play in terms of our physical health and mental well-being. Work is ongoing on the analysis of the very large number of responses received to ensure that the strategy encompasses all of the issues raised and views expressed to the greatest extent possible. Thousands of submissions were made as part of the public consultation. </p>
            <p eId="para_89">That is being dealt with through each submission. It is important where we have that scale of input from communities that we use that to the benefit of a positive national swimming strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> We had hoped to conclude it by year end and work is ongoing to bring it to a conclusion. However, I also want to make sure we get it right and it may be into early next year before it is concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> We are keen on matching the ambition and vision that is there with the pop-up pools we have established in certain areas where there is a deficit of swimming pool infrastructure. We are looking to partner with Swim Ireland continuously on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_92"> There are new innovative ways that we can deliver opportunities from a water safety perspective for communities across the country and this strategy will encompass all of that when it is published.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">I congratulate the Minister of State on finally getting this off the ground because it has been promised for quite a number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_94"> Maybe the Minister of State could tell the House what is his ambition for and vision of this strategy. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that schools are finding it difficult to provide swimming which is part of the curriculum, especially if they have to travel fairly long distances to get to a swimming pool and if there is a cost involved in that which they find it difficult to meet. There is also class time lost in many instances. Will this strategy include some form of national analysis of locations of swimming pools and the need for swimming pools in certain areas? Can the Minister of State be any more definite with respect to when this strategy will be published and concluded?</p>

            <p eId="para_95">We expect it to conclude early next year, more than likely. I had hoped to conclude it by the end of the year but 6,000 responses were received. As the Deputy will be aware, there are many consultations done in communities with often less than 100 responses in many instances. That shows the scale of the interest. We expect it to conclude early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> On the question of the deficits of infrastructure, we have a separate piece of work ongoing with Sport Ireland to map and match every piece of sporting infrastructure across the country so that one can quickly see where there are specific deficits within communities where there might be long commuter times. That must have a parallel role in how we invest our capital resources that where there is a specific deficit we can address that through funding streams going into the future. That is an important strategic piece of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_97"> We are keen as well to deliver new swimming opportunities. We have the traditional model, which is to build a big leisure centre in certain areas where there are then longer commutes for people. The pop-up pools have been a great example where one can bring a piece of infrastructure into a community that brings water safety and swimming lessons for communities that have never had the opportunity to have that, apart from a long commute. They are the types of new models of delivering infrastructure which we are examining. That is one element of it but there are other examples that Swim Ireland is working on. We are engaging with them on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_98">I come from one of the fastest growing towns in the country, Midleton in east Cork. Recently, there was a feasibility study carried out on the need for a swimming pool in the area. Part of the problem is trying to find a site. Part of the problem is to get the local authority to buy-in to it. The population growth is projected to be significant. There is a local group established to put this forward but it is running into all kinds of obstacles. Can the Minister of State offer them any assistance, guidance or advice as to how they can proceed with the putting in place of a swimming pool in a large area which is to grow significantly in the next number of years in the two instances of finding a site and encouraging the local authority to support it as well, which is crucial?</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> That comes back to my original point that if one cannot find land and if the land is not zoned for it, one cannot go ahead and do anything. We need a national statement from the Minister of State on this matter directing local authorities to be proactive in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">We need to see local authorities deliver more swimming opportunities for local communities. That is why we also have to look at different models of delivering that infrastructure. There has been a reluctance amongst local authorities to build the traditional leisure centre model and that is why the pop-up pools have been an enormous success. They have been in Donabate and in west Wicklow. There is one in Tubbercurry in Sligo presently.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> Swim Ireland is looking at new models and ways to partner with communities and with local authorities on delivering new types of infrastructure which deliver the participation benefit and deliver the community benefit when it comes to the deficit of infrastructure that is there. That model is being assessed. It is obviously being piloted currently. They are partnerships between local authorities, communities and Swim Ireland, with the State purchasing some of the pop-up pools as well. That is an example that I would encourage local authorities to examine and assess where there is a deficit of infrastructure. The feedback has been extremely positive in communities that have had the pop-up pools.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> There are additional examples, beyond pop-up pools, in terms of above-ground modular examples which we are exploring with Swim Ireland which are more cost-effective but deliver the participation benefit. That is all part of the national swimming strategy that we are examining, as I say, looking at different capital types which will deliver the capital benefit when it comes to swimming pools.</p>

            <p eId="para_108">I propose to Questions Nos. 13, 20, 41 and 51 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme, SCEP, is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country. Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over €1.15 billion. The programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday, 1 March 2021 and by the deadline, a record 3,106 applications were submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> Approximately 1,000 of the submitted applications were for equipment-only projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of €16.6 million were announced in August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over €143.8 million were announced on Friday, 11 February 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_112"> Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision. The deadline for submission of capital appeals was Monday, 4 April and 146 appeals were received. Consequent allocations on foot of successful appeals amounting to €6.14 million were announced on Tuesday, 31 May. The total allocation of €150 million for capital projects, and €166.6 million for the round in total, represents the highest level of allocation ever made under the SCEP.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> The priority immediately is to advance the successful applications, which number almost 2,900, under this round to formal approval and grant drawdown stage. This requires detailed ongoing engagement with all grantees.</p>
            <p eId="para_114"> Following completion of the appeal process, my Department commenced a full review of all aspects of the previous round of the SCEP. A draft review has now been completed and I and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, expect to be in a position to publish it shortly. Any recommendations arising from the review will be reflected in the next round and while there are always elements that can be improved, I do not envisage any major changes to the terms and conditions of the highly successful 2020 round. Following publication of the review, I will announce the exact timing of the round in the coming weeks. It is hoped to have the actual application process open early in the new year for the next round.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">I thank the Minister of State for his response in relation to this important programme. We understand the importance of sport to communities around the country and it is imperative to fund it. Money spent on sport is money saved on healthcare down the road.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> Certainly, the 2020 sports allocation programme has been hugely successful and I commend the Minister of State on his efforts in relation to the national fund of over €166 million that was allocated for both equipment and sports capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">The Minister of State mentioned the draft review of the 2020 programme is under way. When does he expect it to be published? Will it be before the end of the year? The potential timing for 2023 is important because many sporting organisations that did not apply before March 2021 are eager to apply in 2023. I would appreciate an update on this.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">I join other Deputies in asking similar questions. When will the next round of sports capital grant funding be out? I acknowledge the enormous success of the previous round and its benefit. It is fabulous as a local representative from Cork East to see the projects under way in a number of sports clubs. We are looking forward to welcoming the Minister and Minister of State from the Department at some stage. It is important that we get an indication of when the next round will come down the tracks. Many clubs have prepared projects under the Covid-19 restrictions. They would like to get a picture of when the next round will come up for debate, discussion and application. We all look forward to it. I commend the Minister and the Minister of State on behalf of many very happy clubs undertaking projects at present. I thank them for all the work they and the Department have done.</p>

            <p eId="para_119">I thank Deputies Dillon and O'Connor for their questions and remarks. We expect the review to be published by the end of the year. It is pretty much ready. We will have to consider it and then it will be published. It should be ready very shortly. I appreciate the question asked by Deputies O'Connor and Dillon on the importance of planning for the next round and the level of ambition in communities when it comes to sports capital and equipment programme. This is why we are anxious to advance a further round. We expect it to open early next year. This is why it is important for clubs, whether or not they have received funding, so they can continue to have phased progress of their ambition for their clubs and communities. This will build a more active society as younger people and those of all generations participate in sport. We are ambitious to advance this. As I have said, we will make a formal announcement when we have an exact timing on it. We expect it to be early next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">I appreciate the response of the Minister of State. Certainly in my constituency, more than 99 sporting organisations and schools benefited from the fund. In total €4.8 million was allocated through the sports capital programme. More than €470,000 was allocated through the sports equipment programme. This is a significant contribution to sport. Given the record number of applications I commend the Department on the information, presentation and support they give to applicants who are not familiar with the process in respect of doing the paperwork and forwarding the required quotations. I look forward to the programme opening in 2023. It is very important and I thank the Minister of State for his response.</p>

            <p eId="para_121">The questions we are asking this morning are to get a picture of when we will know about the next round of sports capital grants. As I outlined earlier, it is very important that we have forward planning. The Government, I hope, has slightly more than two years left prior to the next general election. I would love to be in a position while we are in government be able to visit, with my constituency colleague, Deputy Stanton, the sports clubs in our constituency to ask what help and assistance they want with sports capital grants. We are very proud to see the impact of the project the Government undertook with the previous sports capital grants programme and the equipment grant programme. They have been superb. It would be fantastic to get an indication of when the next round will be brought forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_122">There is great teamwork in our constituency. It is great to be able to work with a colleague like that. I want to bring the Minister of State back to the question of sites. We have enthusiastic clubs and whether they are building sports fields or getting a lawn mower, the grant can make a big difference to them. I say well done to the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials. The issue now seems to be how we can give money and not how we cannot give it. The philosophy and vision have turned around in a big way. Many clubs cannot find a place for a sports field, running track or swimming pool, as I said earlier. In many communities, clubs do not have the wherewithal or finance to get started. As part of the review, will the Minister of State have a look at how clubs and communities can be assisted, particularly clubs from more disadvantaged areas that will really find it difficult? Perhaps local authorities do not see this as a priority. Will the Minister of State look at this and take it on board as an issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_123">I thank all three Deputies for their remarks. I will respond to Deputy Dillon first. I have close roots in Mayo and the people there have huge pride in supporting the county. It is great to see the level of interest in grassroots participation there. I also agree that we have an excellent team in the Department in Killarney. They are very proactive in engaging with clubs and communities and providing them with assistance. It is great to see the teamwork and collaboration through sport between Deputies O'Connor and Stanton. As I have said previously to Deputy O'Connor, we expect it to be open very early next year. That is as good a signal as possible to clubs that they can plan ahead and work on their next level of ambition. For some clubs, this will mean following through on their existing allocation. Others will want to apply again. Some did not come in on the previous occasion as people have said. It is to give them this opportunity. Deputies O'Connor and Stanton come from a proud sporting community where many people successfully participate in many sports for their county and country.</p>
            <p eId="para_124"> With regard to land, local authorities need to use their open spaces to partner with clubs and communities. They can apply on behalf of clubs when it comes to specific proposals. We are very flexible in trying to ensure they can do this. The sports capital equipment programme will not become a land purchasing programme because that would totally undermine grassroots investment in facilities and infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_153">I am committed to tackling disadvantage through high-quality early learning and childcare that is affordable and accessible. The early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, which enjoys uptake rates in excess of 95%, has removed barriers to accessing preschool education. Data from the Growing Up in Ireland survey show that more than 60% of low income families would not have been able to send their child to preschool without this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_154"> In addition, the national childcare scheme, NCS, through a combination of universal and targeted subsidies as well as sponsorship arrangements for vulnerable children, is substantially reducing the out-of-pocket early learning and childcare costs for families. The highest levels of subsidies are available to families on the lowest incomes. Record numbers of children of more than 93,000 are currently benefiting from the NCS. Some 38,000 more children are benefiting now than this time last year. Moreover, the number of providers offering the NCS has increased by more than 10% as a result of the contractual conditions underpinning the new core funding scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_155"> Evidence attests to the effectiveness of the NCS. Recent OECD data show that Ireland's performance in supporting families and particularly lone-parent families with the cost of early learning and childcare is markedly improving, with the country having the greatest reduction in early learning and childcare costs to families across the EU over the period 2019-21. In 2021, net childcare costs as a share of the households net income for lone parents on low income fell below the EU average. The data do not take account of significant enhancements I introduced to the NCS under budget 2023 that kicked in from 1 November last, nor do they include the impacts of core funding and the freeze.</p>
            <p eId="para_156"> In line with a commitment in First 5, officials in my Department are progressing the development of a new strand of funding, tackling disadvantage, whereby services will be provided with a proportionate mix of universal and targeted supports to support children and families accessing their services. Officials will soon engage with stakeholders on this work and pilot the provision of a hot meals programme in early learning and childcare as one potential support.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">The final comment about the new strand of funding is very important. I tabled this question because we were contacted last week by people when they heard the announcement of €54.5 million in funding to tackle disadvantage. While the funding is welcome, talk of a garden at the Bloom festival angered some people. I am talking about a very good and committed early learning and early years sector that has been very much engaged and that welcomed the core funding. Some of these people have been at this for years and are among those we spoke about when there was a welcome change in the hours for ECCE and when schools hours were taken into account. Will the Minister expand on the new strand of funding? Is it separate from the €54.5 million? Some very good and positive people with great solutions are engaged in this. It would be really beneficial for the Department to speak to them if there is to be engagement with the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_160">The sum is not linked to tackling disadvantage. It is separate from that. We have a work programme. I recognised the issue of wraparound hours very early on and, in fairness, the Deputy raised it with me. We acted on it in our first budget. The two most recent budgets have focused on core funding and the delivery of NCS investment, which, I think we all agree, is welcome. We need to work on two other issues of priority for me, that is, the tackling disadvantage strand and seeing whether we can broaden the access and inclusion model, AIM. They are very important issues. My officials will be engaging with relevant stakeholders including many of the people about whom the Deputy has spoken with regard to how we can properly design the tackling disadvantage strand and how it will operate.</p>

            <p eId="para_161">I welcome what the Minister said about AIM, even though it was not part of the question. The service is vital and we often hear asked whether it can be expanded. There is a need in some sectors and it depends on the area. There is considerable disadvantage in some areas where parents of 90% of the children attending may not be in employment and there are various issues. Additional funding is very important. Elements of the core funding are very welcome, but some people think that the older model, the community childcare subvention plus, CCSP, may have been slightly more beneficial for the disadvantaged. Is there a way to combine or look at additional funding for disadvantage? That is the answer. Is there a timeframe for when it will be commenced? The Minister may have spoken about one and I missed it. Is the hot meals programme the Minister spoke about a pilot project? We would welcome such a pilot in Carlow-Kilkenny if the Minister wished to try a pilot out there.</p>

            <p eId="para_162">The hot meals programme is a pilot, but I do not think we will be able to universally apply the programme in its first year. Hot meals are provided where children are in services for the full day. However, this programme will look at children in sessional services such as three-hour services to make sure that they get a hot meal such as breakfast or lunch. I referenced AIM because it has targeted levels of support, recognising that not every service needs the same level of support. Our tackling disadvantage scheme will be closer to that than the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, model. The DEIS model is kind of all or nothing whereas AIM recognises some children in some schools need considerable support and others need some support. We should design our disadvantage scheme in that way. We will work on it over the coming year. There is more work to be done. The scheme is not ready to roll out right now but the work is starting. It will be a valuable addition to our supports for services and especially for children.</p>

            <p eId="para_165">In announcing the formation of Government, the Taoiseach announced his intention to have the co-ordination of disability-related issues handled by a Minister for the first time. The location of disability equality policy, which had previously been in the Department of Justice, and specialist community-based disability services in a single Department will facilitate strategic policy development, including implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which Ireland ratified in 2018, as well as the significant reforms envisioned under the transforming lives programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">Under the convention, and following the transfer of the equality function, my Department is both the national focal point and the co-ordinating mechanism for implementation of the UNCRPD. Consolidation of the disability function represents a significant opportunity to progress further the realisation of the convention in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_167"> This is a significant transfer of functions, both from the point of view of improving services for persons with a disability and from the perspective of both Departments. My priority has always been to ensure that the transfer can happen in a seamless and effective way so that services are maintained and enhanced and all appropriate governance and financial arrangements are properly put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_168"> At this time, our two Departments, working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, are finalising financial governance arrangements, which were the final elements that needed to be addressed. We will look to bring a memo to Government shortly to finalise the date.</p>
            <p eId="para_169"> As I said, it is a significant transfer of functions. A budget of €2.4 billion is transferring from the Department of Health to my Department, with the responsibility for many crucial services, such as residential services and children's disability network teams. All of those will continue to be operated by the HSE but accountability will be within my Department. It has taken too long. We all recognise that. We are close to the end of that process now and to a situation where it will fully transfer to my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_170">I thank the Minister. I concur with everything he has said about why we are doing this. The reality is that it is hugely disappointing, as it was mooted to happen last July, then September. I found out that it had not happened when the Minister's Department appeared in front of the Committee of Public Accounts and I was informed it was not any closer because there were still things to be ironed out. I met CHO 5 last week. It contains the children's disability network team in my area. It is haemorrhaging staff because of the lack of organisation. I keep hearing that there is no issue with funding. It is extraordinary to hear that there is no issue with funds but that we do not have the staff. The staff that we do have within CHO 5 have come to the conclusion that the CDNT does not work. That is concerning because there are myriad problems. There is a haemorrhaging of staff and patients are on waiting lists of up to three years.</p>

            <p eId="para_171">I share the Deputy's frustration. She is on the Committee of Public Accounts. One of the key reasons that this has gone slowly is that after this transfer, for the first time, the HSE will be reporting to two masters. It will be accountable to the Department of Health for €20 billion of its budget and to our Department for €2.4 billion. I want to be able to ensure that, in next year's budget, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I get an extra €50 million to get people out of residential care. I want to be able to ensure that I can see where that money goes within the HSE and where we get an outcome from it. The Deputy wants to see that too in the Committee of Public Accounts. Up to this point, it has not been clear how that line of sight will be put in place. We want to put that in place so that when the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I advocate for those improvements, we can see the delivery. It is slower. I share the Deputy's frustration but I believe we are close to achieving that and will see that transfer soon. I may speak about CDNTs in my next reply because I know that is important to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_172">There is a specific issue involving a mother of three children. They are all autistic, one severely so. He is only 11. She is the mother of 15-year-old twins but the 11-year-old is essentially ruling the roost. This mother is a lone parent. She needs co-ordination of all the services but there is nothing. She does not have anybody. She should have a co-ordination officer. She is dealing with three children. She has CDNT, child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, Tusla and doctors, but she is engaging with none of them because she does not have the energy or mental capacity because her 11-year-old has great need of services and she is not getting them. The CDNT is not able to provide them. There is complete failure in the system. My concerns are not about money because their concerns are not about money, but about staff to provide the services. It does not hold that there is no concern about money because if we were paying enough, we would have the staff. It may not be quite as simple as that but it should be.</p>

            <p eId="para_173">The Deputy is correct that staffing is a key issue but I also think engagement with parents and how the relationship between the HSE and parents is managed is an issue. In far too many areas, whether in Wexford or Dublin 15, there is an intensely confrontational environment. Parents have become frustrated because they have been let down. We need to change that. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I have been working on this progressing disability services roadmap. We recognise that CDNTs are in place and that they work in parts of the country but not in other parts, primarily because of the staffing issues. This has been led by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in particular. She has prioritised getting staff in the short term as well as in the long term so that we have a better supply of occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and psychologists coming in. That will involve looking at college places and master's degree courses in the long term and, in the short term, getting these skills added to the critical skills list was an important step taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. She has changed the system so that some UK, Welsh and Northern Irish qualifications can be recognised foreign qualifications here so that those people can practise here. All of that will be set out in the roadmap.</p>

The context of this question is the rapid expansion of such properties, given the massive increase in the number of international protection applicants and people arriving in the country under the temporary protection directive.</p>

            <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_176">A commitment was made in the programme for Government to replace the current system of accommodation for international protection applicants with a new model based on a not-for-profit approach. As the Deputy knows, I published a White Paper on Ending Direct Provision in February last year. This White Paper outlines the new model of accommodation, particularly the supports that will be offered to applicants for international protection. It was the result of an extensive engagement process across Government and State agencies and also with former residents of direct provision centres and NGOs active in that sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_177"> The Government intends for HIQA to monitor international protection accommodation service, IPAS, centres against national standards as part of transitional arrangements for moving to the new model. It is important that compliance with the national standards should be measured through on-site assessment. Independent monitoring is a vital tool for the adequate provision of accommodation supports. This will enable the Government to evaluate the current state of play critically and make informed improvements as needed. HIQA's experience and expertise in the area of inspections is extensive, which is why we chose it.</p>
            <p eId="para_178"> Ahead of commencing inspections of all permanent centres, HIQA will conduct a series of pilot inspections. It is envisaged that the first of these pilot inspections will take place before the end of this year. That will begin the process of HIQA building up its own expertise regarding how the inspection of international protection accommodation centres will begin. The full roll-out of the programme will start early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_179"> We have engaged extensively with HIQA over the last years. It wants an additional budget and additional staff to undertake this additional role. That has been secured. We have also worked with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure that there is a clear legal basis for these inspections to take place. In the meantime, as the Deputy knows, centres continue to be inspected three times each year, twice by officials from my Department and at least once by QTS, an independent inspection company.</p>

            <p eId="para_180">I thank the Minister. Our obligation to vulnerable people does not change. I know that some of these centres were temporary rather than permanent but some temporary centres have been in operation for four years. It is clear that many people will be in these centres for a long time. I was glad to hear the other day that people who are living in tents in the Tralee area will be moved. I am not sure whether they have been moved yet. There are different categories. People who are living in tents should be subject to inspection as well as those who are lucky enough to have own-door accommodation. I am glad that the roll-out will commence before the end of the year. It is welcome because, having met with the Irish Refugee Council, it had serious concerns about the most vulnerable international protection applicants, particularly children.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">As the Minister knows, many of the properties would fail the most basic of standards. Adherence to the legally binding standards for permanent operators has not been perfect either. It has all been very <i>ad hoc</i> to date. The experience in the United Kingdom gives rise to great concern.</p>

            <p eId="para_182">The Deputy indicated that many of the properties would fail standards. Let us see how these inspections proceed because, as I said, HIQA will be supporting the properties it engages with in terms of setting out what the standards. There is going to be a supportive process to ensure that properties we are providing meet the standards HIQA is monitoring.</p>
            <p eId="para_183"> The Deputy is correct that everyone in tented accommodation will be moved out of it in the next few weeks. That is something everyone will welcome. Some 310 people have been in tented accommodation over the past number of months. As well as the reassurance provided by having HIQA involved in an inspection process of the direct provision centres, I have also discussed bringing in additional inspection support with my Department. Perhaps we will beef up the independent inspectorate company operation we use at the moment in recognition of the fact that a much larger number of centres are being used for accommodation right now in the context of both international protection and Ukraine. We need to ensure that we have the capacity to get out to see what is happening and to proactively and responsibly engage in respect of issues that arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_184">I thank the Minister for the reply. We welcome the not-for-profit approach recommended in the White Paper and will give the Minister every support in trying to move to that model. There has obviously been much outsourcing of this accommodation. It is not ideal that some accommodation providers are listing categories of people they will take and categories of people they do not want to take. The Department should perhaps be stronger. In light of the amount of remuneration the providers are obtaining, their preconditions should be limited as much as possible. If there is going to be this level of outsourcing, albeit mostly temporarily, the State must ensure accountability and proper standards. Humane treatment makes this possible and it is to be hoped the inspections will ensure compliance as opposed to perhaps uncovering some uncomfortable truths that may be out there.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">That is why it is important that the Department has the capacity to proactively undertake inspections in respect of international protection accommodation and accommodation for people from Ukraine and to be able to react where a complaint is raised in order that we can go out and respond to it. That is why, as well as bringing in HIQA, I am also looking to further extend our inspection capacity. That can provide a degree of reassurance to everybody.</p>
            <p eId="para_186"> As the Deputy says, we have very significant reliance on the private sector now. That is a consequence of the war in Ukraine and the subsequent impact it has had on the numbers of international protection applicants arriving in Ireland. The Deputy is right that it is not ideal and not the situation we want to be in. One of the things I will be looking towards, especially on the international protection side of things, is increasing State capacity to accommodate people and increasing State accommodation where we have absolute control over the type of accommodation and the standards being delivered. We are particularly looking at the type of phase 1 reception and integration centres outlined in the White Paper.</p>

            <p eId="para_189">I am cognisant of the potential impact on the tourism industry arising from the number of contracts my Department has entered into to meet our responsibility to provide accommodation to beneficiaries of the temporary protection directive and international protection. Regular meetings take place between my officials and the relevant Department and Fáilte Ireland to share learnings and discuss ideas as we continue to respond to the challenge of procuring enough accommodation to meet demand. My Department is grateful for the support of those in this sector in responding to date to this unprecedented challenge. The tourism sector has been magnificent in the support it has offered. Communities across the country have welcomed those from Ukraine in their time of need.</p>
            <p eId="para_190"> My Department is very aware of the concerns shared by some communities regarding the absence of tourists in some areas, now and into the future, and the consequent impact on local spending. To respond to these and other issues, we continue to work alongside Fáilte Ireland and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media as part of the whole-of-government response to the crisis in order to ensure that key stakeholders have a place in terms of the senior officials group and are able to engage with us on accommodation solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_191"> As the Deputy knows, the Government is committed to delivering accommodation solutions beyond serviced accommodation, including delivering the refurbished buildings strand, the forthcoming new vacant homes call and modular accommodation. We must recognise - and the Deputy referenced it - that all of this is happening in the context of a war in Europe. This is the biggest humanitarian challenge Europe has faced since the Second World War and the biggest humanitarian challenge our country has ever faced. Even though it might not get top billing on the news every night, 6,500 civilians, tens of thousands of soldiers and 400 children have been killed in Ukraine. That is why we are experiencing these difficulties. We should always bear that in mind in our discussion of these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_192">Rather than potential issues happening, these are real issues that are already becoming a crisis. Some 76% of hotels are being used. Yesterday, there was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on a report by the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, which states that the tourism industry is warning of a potential €1 billion cost if refugee numbers in hotels and bed and breakfasts continue to rise. It was also reported industry will call on Government to reduce the proportion of tourism accommodation being used to house refugees from Ukraine and elsewhere to between 12% and 15%. Has that call been made? If so, has it been communicated to the Department? The Minister stated that there has been engagement, so I would like to know if that call has been made. This is an absolute crisis. Real issues are there already - not potential ones. One of the most, if not the most, important economic sectors is being radically undermined by the wholesale takeover of hotels. As indicted in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the report notes:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_193">... the Republic is 'an outlier' in Europe in the depth of its reliance on tourism beds for refugees, and warns the reduced capacity for tourists is damaging the industry [...] Currently, it says, almost 22 per cent of tourism accommodation is used by the State for refugees from Ukraine and elsewhere. Itic wants this cut to 12-15 per cent ...</p>
            <p eId="para_194">Would the Minister be in favour of that? That would be a proportionate and fair response. There are limitations to everything, unfortunately.</p>

            <p eId="para_202">The Deputy is right that it is good for us to be clear on these things. I accept that there is a challenge for the tourism industry here. I absolutely understand it. We are looking to diversify where we are accommodating displaced persons from Ukraine. That is why we are bringing modular accommodation, vacant homes and the refurbishment of homes into play. That will operate to support diversification and a move away from the reliance on hotel accommodation. Work in this regard is ongoing. It is important to remember that the reason this pressure is being put on the tourism sector and other sectors is because women and children are dying in Ukraine each day. All over Europe, there is pressure happening as a result of this war.</p>

            <p eId="para_203">On the figure I gave of 76% of all Ukrainian refugees being accommodated in tourism facilities, that figure was supplied by the by the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC. On the overall point, does the Minister believe it is right when March comes around and when the hotel beds and accommodation will be needed that we will have a situation where we could have more people and more than likely will have more people homeless? The Minister is talking about helping people but he is not helping them if they are going to end up with nowhere come March. That is not helping people. It is all well and good and the Minister can give the political rhetoric and the message - I am all for helping by the way - but we are being overrun. The figure is expected to rise to 70,000 refugees by winter time. Where are they all going to go? We are all compassionate people here but we need to get real and there needs to be a sense of proportion and a reasonable response that does not create a crisis and there is a crisis in the making here.</p>

            <p eId="para_204">I thank the Deputy. It is indicative of the real fears which Ukrainians have that they will make this journey here irrespective of the uncertainty of the accommodation situation they will have when they arrive here. It is indicative of their fears for themselves and for their families that they do so because they are in a wartime situation. There are missiles falling on civilian targets all over Ukraine and that is why people come here, even if they end up in tented accommodation in Gormanston or sometimes sleeping on camp beds, and see that as a preferable choice. We have to bear that in mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_205"> On the figure mentioned by the Deputy, I had thought that she had said 75% of all hotel beds were being used. My apologies for that as I misinterpreted what she said. The figure on the total number of hotel beds is 22% to 23%.</p>
            <p eId="para_206"> Undoubtedly there is pressure here, as there is in other parts of society but there is pressure on every European country right now. President Vladimir Putin is using refugees as one of the weapons in his war to try to unsettle us and undermine support for Ukraine and we cannot allow him to win in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_209">I thank the Deputy for this question. The operational challenges in responding to conflict are very significant and all Departments and agencies contribute to meeting the welfare needs and integration of Ukrainian displaced persons into communities. As a country, we have responded well in assisting those and we will continue to work across Government to do that. As the Deputy will know, the Department of the Taoiseach chairs a senior officials group, SOG, who meet weekly to consider all issues to do with the accommodation and the wider supports for Ukrainian displaced persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_210"> At the Citywest hub, the Departments of Justice and Social Protection both have officials in place and have that initial engagement in the provision of PPS numbers and a letter. The Department of Social Protection has a dedicated webpage for those arriving under the temporary protection directive. The information is comprehensive and addresses public services, income supports and getting a payment, and is available in both Russian and Ukrainian.</p>
            <p eId="para_211"> There are HSE personnel on site in Citywest and they assist with medical matters for both Ukrainians and international protection applicants on site. There is also a whole-of-government website dedicated to information for Ukrainians arriving here.</p>
            <p eId="para_212"> Local authorities are playing a major role, are standing up emergency rest centres around the country and have organised the Ukraine community fora around the country in bringing together statutory services on a countywide basis so that they can support Ukrainians living there. They have also been very involved in the pledged process in moving Ukrainians living in that particular area into pledged accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_213"> We also had engagement with the Department of Defence in securing sites for additional accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_214"> On international protection, we work closely with the Department of Justice. The International Protection Office makes a determination on international protection applicants and Tusla, which is an agency within my Department, will work closely with, in particular, unaccompanied minors, be they from Ukraine or from another country who are seeking the help of the international protection system.</p>

            <p eId="para_215">That is a nice high-level overview of the situation but does not relate significantly to the reality on the ground. There are big problems. For example, in Ballybofey, the asylum seekers being housed there have no GP services available to them because they have no PPS numbers. There were moved up to Donegal without these numbers having been applied for, which means that they are using hospital and ambulance services because are no doctors available. That is a shocking situation for them to be in. This is also happening with Ukrainian refugees in Buncrana and Carndonagh where they are using ambulance services because they have no doctors available. Very quickly, word goes out to the community that the refugees and asylum seekers are getting better access to these services, but that is because they have no access and have to use the services this way.</p>
            <p eId="para_216"> We then have a situation also where schoolchildren will be receiving school transport and these services are not meeting the needs. We also had a case in Killybegs recently where somebody had to support and pay for the school transport to enable the Ukrainian children to attend school.</p>
            <p eId="para_217"> There may be high-level agreements which are working well at that level but it does not seem to be translating down to the ground and that needs to be addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_218">I will follow up on the specific issue of the PPS numbers. I have always recognised that the scale of the challenge and increase in international protection, IP, numbers is putting pressure on the system. One cannot have that number of people arrive in a country in a crisis situation without pressures. There will be times when the system will not work as quickly as it should. I understand that and it causes frustration both for those Ukrainian and international protection applicants who are not receiving services as quickly as they should. It creates frustrations for everybody else as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_219"> If we look at the situation in Berlin, thousands of people are being housed in tents there, for example, because that is a pressure that is being put on there. I spoke to the Scottish Minister and they are also under very significant pressure there. Scotland is a country which wants to support people, unlike, perhaps, other parts of the United Kingdom. There are and will continue to be pressures and we will continue to work across Government on how best to identify and rectify them as we go on. Where Deputies raise these issues with me, I will do my best to smooth them out.</p>

            <p eId="para_220">I understand that there will be pressures because of the unprecedented situation but there are also pressures for people trying to live in the areas and it is very difficult for international protection residents and Ukrainians who are coming here. A basic thing like a PPS number allows them to get a medical card and GP services in an area. This is very basic and nobody should end up in an area who does not have a PPS number. Surely, with computerisation and everything else, PPS numbers can be issued to people reasonably quickly. I received a response back from the HSE saying that it expects that it could take months before a PPS number will be registered and given to these people, which means that it could take months before they can apply for a medical card. When they apply for a medical card it may then, equally, take months before that medical card will be granted. That is untidy and should not be happening. I know that there are difficulties but I do not believe that those things should be presenting difficulties. I thank the Minister.</p>

I am happy to look into that and to see what we can do to expedite the process in that particular situation. Following up on this issue, and I do not need to tell the Deputy this, but the reason we are under pressure is because of the scale of the war and of its ongoing nature. Many of us in this House thought that our response would be a short-term one over a number of weeks. That is not the case and even when we see Ukrainian forces in the ascent in many parts of the country, we continue to see Russia’s ability to target the civilian population. I am not a dad but we can think about any mum and dad making the calculation as to whether they will go back, want to go home and re-establish their family. If there is a risk of a missile or drone landing, however, one can see why many will make the calculation to stay here, difficult as it is.</p>

            <p eId="para_226">Together for Better is the new funding model that supports the delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good. It was recommended by an expert group, adopted by the Government, and has been widely welcomed by representative groups advocating for parents, children, the workforce and providers. To date, 93% of providers - well over 4,100 - have signed up. Of those, 984 are in the Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_227"> While the large majority of representative groups and individual providers have embraced core funding, I am disappointed that one group has co-ordinated a campaign which includes calling on services to close ECCE provision on certain days. While only a small proportion of providers took part in those closures, they are not warranted considering the level of State investment taking place now. I offered to meet this group on the condition that further closures would be called off, and that offer still stands.</p>
            <p eId="para_228"> One of the primary demands put forward by this group is that services see an increase in the capitation from €69 to €76 per child per week for the ECCE programme, but that level of increase is already available through core funding. Core funding will now provide, at a minimum, €78.75 per week for those who sign up to core funding. There appears to be some objections to the idea of public management that is linked to the new model. In particular, there is opposition to the fee freeze and some of the requirements of financial and operational transparency.</p>
            <p eId="para_229"> The new funding model was designed with extensive stakeholder engagement. Since core funding was announced, my Department has hosted eight meetings of the early learning and childcare stakeholder forum and frequent meetings with provider representative groups on core funding. I have attended many of the stakeholder forum group meetings. I met with a number of representative groups over the summer and I meet regularly with individual childcare providers in my constituency and throughout the country. The city and county childcare committees have been working intensively to support services and parents. I am fully committed to working with sectoral representative groups in continuing to deliver for the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_230">I thank the Minister for that fulsome reply and the genuine approach he is taking to this issue. Like anyone in this Chamber, I very much welcome the Together for Better model but I do have a concern. The Minister mentioned that 93% of providers have taken up the model, but that is not the case in my constituency, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where the uptake is 81%. There is an issue there and it needs to be addressed, regardless of who is co-ordinating what. I humbly ask that the Minister consider meeting childcare providers without any preconditions. Let us just have those discussions and see if we can address those key concerns. The people who are suffering, from my point of view, are those who are coming to my clinics and contacting my office. They are the parents and guardians who rely on these brilliant services and who have to take days off work, completely change their schedules or cancel medical appointments. They do not want politics; they want a solution.</p>

            <p eId="para_231">We are up to 85% takeup of core funding now in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. That is continuing to grow, which is very positive. I know that is still slightly below the national level, but it is still a very significant level of takeup. The Deputy spoke to the disruption to parents and to children's learning from these closures. Again, I just do not believe they are necessary. I am always open to working with people. I have engaged extensively throughout Covid. My Department was extremely reactive in respect of Covid, bringing in the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, for the entire sector without any preconditions. We will look to support the sector with increased energy costs through the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS. We are very reactive. We want to support the sector. We recognise the massive underinvestment that has taken place over decades. We are responding to that. In one budget this year we have provided an additional €346 million. I hope the sector recognises my bona fides and the Government's intention to support all three elements: parents, providers and staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_232">I welcome the marginal increase in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area, but we have to reflect on the fact that this sector is very diverse. There is no one size fits all. I say that as someone who has kids in the sector and a wife who has been a Montessori teacher for more than a decade, usually with small independent providers. There are many issues at play with the one-size-fits-all model. General costs in Dublin are different from those in the rest of the country. We have spoken at length this morning about rising costs in respect of utilities and everything else. I have a major concern, however, that when we do not have maximum buy-in and when services are not specifically located and targeted where there is such a lack of buy-in, it takes an element of the goodness away from what the Minister has said is an amazing achievement, that is, this massive increase in funding that is so long overdue and welcome. However, it is proving very difficult in my constituency. I have dealt with providers and parents and talked to the children who go to these services. When there is this lack of joined-up thinking, sadly, it just undermines what is a wonderful initiative by the Minister and the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_233">It is a diverse sector and we want to continue that diversity. That is why we are looking to put the ECCE programme on a statutory basis. That way there will continue to be a strong role for ECCE-only providers because that is what some parents want.</p>
            <p eId="para_234"> In respect of the slightly lower sign-up rate in the Deputy's area, and indeed in my area, ultimately, many of the providers remain in the private sector and they make a determination as to whether they contract with us. We are not going with a takeover model. We are allowing them to make their own determinations. I believe we have made core funding as attractive as possible. It will mean services will get significantly more investment this year than last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_235"> There are, however, some conditions and I will stand over those conditions absolutely. We need the fee freeze and we need transparency. We are putting €1 billion into this sector. We need to understand the books, we need to understand how that is actually delivering for services, and we need the fee freeze because, without it, the additional money we are putting into the NCS will be eroded by subsequent fee increases.</p>

            <p eId="para_239">It is indeed a good follow-up. In budget 2023, I introduced major reforms to the national childcare scheme, NCS, which will substantially improve the affordability of early learning and childcare for families. I secured additional funding of €121 million to be allocated to the NCS from 1 January of next year in order that all families accessing registered early learning and childcare will receive a minimum hourly subsidy of €1.40 off the cost of early learning and childcare. The increase in the minimum hourly subsidy from 50 cent to €1.40 aims to reduce the average co-payment paid by families to providers by 25%. This means up to €3,276 off the annual cost per child. Prior to the change being brought in, up to €1,170 was met by the State. With the changes being brought in, up to an additional €2,106 per annum will be taken off the cost of childcare for each child. The exact reduction in costs will be unique to each family. It will depend on their personal circumstances and their early learning and childcare needs. From 2 January 2023, any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy under the NCS will see an increase in the level of subsidy they get. The largest increase will be seen by those on a reckonable income of €60,000 and above. All families with reckonable income of €26,000 and above will see some level of increase. Families with reckonable income of €26,000 and below are already on the highest level of subsidy under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_240"> The fee freeze in place in more than 93% of services availing of core funding gives families greater certainty as to what they will be charged and ensures these increases in the NCS subsidies will not be absorbed by fee increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_241"> Through a combination of these measures, I am working to ensure high-quality early learning and childcare is accessible and affordable to all, regardless of means. I know many providers have raised issues with the complexity of the NCS. We have brought together a user subgroup of the early learning and childcare stakeholder forum to start going through some of those issues whereby childcare providers themselves have access to officials in my Department and Pobal so we can start trying to clarify some of those technical issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_242">The Minister's answer was perfect. I have absolutely no follow-up on the direct answer. However, when I was having a cup of coffee this morning with other parents after the drop-off, the questions were a little more granular. When will they see the impact of the change? What will the dates be? What will it amount to, not necessarily annually? Many of these people are getting by week by week, month by month.</p>
            <p eId="para_243">The cost-of-living crisis faces everyone, including those who have children in the early years sector. I would appreciate by way of a supplementary answer if the Minister could perhaps delve into the details of when parents will see more money in their pockets and genuinely feel the impact of what are absolutely groundbreaking changes to the provision and funding of childcare that are long overdue and so welcome. When I meet them for coffee next week, I want to be able to say dollar and cents when they will feel this difference.</p>

            <p eId="para_244">That is a fair question. They will feel it in January. That is when the NCS changes will come in. There was some discussion on whether we should phase them in and go from 50 cent to €1 in January and a bit more later on, but the whole thing is coming in from January. That is good for parents in that they will get the immediate benefit of what is on average a cut of 25% from January 2023. It is also good for providers, because when we increase the NCS subsidy, it causes additional work for providers. They have to change the amount they charge to every family on their books and that is complicated. Doing that once means they only have to change it once. It also means that, from January, parents will see that very significant investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_245"> It is important to say that the difference each parent will receive will be different. I have always spoken about an average 25% cut. Even advocating and communicating this is complicated because parents have different charges and different needs, but on average we are going to see a 25% cut. That is going to be very beneficial to parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_246">I think of my own daughter's preschool costs with 12 kids who have completely separate childcare needs. No household looks the same anymore, thankfully, but equally, the outgoings and what they need differ. Not to be negative because that genuinely is not the intention, but I will bring it back to my geographic concern that those of us, like the Minister, who represent Dublin constituencies will not see the material and educational benefit that perhaps will be seen by other constituencies with lower costs to providers and lower costs for parents in simply getting kids to childcare facilities and in the impact of their commute. Is that going to be taken into account? Is there definite outreach? Again, I look at my constituency being behind the national takeup of the overall scheme. How can we offset that to make sure there is relative equity throughout the regions in the provision of this new scheme?</p>

            <p eId="para_247">I believe some providers held off. Originally, we had an 89% national takeup. That is now up to 93%. As Deputy Richmond pointed out it was originally 81% in our constituency and now is up to 85%. That is marginal but it is moving in the right direction. This is just year 1 of core funding. Originally for year 1, when budget 2022 was announced, we had €207 million for core funding. Now for year 1, after this year's budget, it is €259 million. Even in the first year we grew the pot. I already have agreement for year 2 for an extra €28 million. One of the things that money is going to be used for is that the three-year qualification rule before a person can get the graduate subsidy will be removed. We are looking to grow the pot and do things to make core funding more attractive. I believe that, as providers see that core funding has delivered successfully and see the commitment of the Government to continue to support services, more services will sign up and we will see those numbers grow both nationally and in Dublin areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_250">I thank Deputy Durkan. As the Minister with responsibility for children, I am committed to upholding the best interests of the child in all situations. As the Deputy knows, Ireland held the presidency of the Council of Europe this year. One of the priorities chosen for the Irish Presidency was the theme of Hear our Voices and a particular focus on youth engagement. As part of this, I hosted a conference in October focusing on the rights and the determination of the best interests of the child in parental separation and in care proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_251"> Ireland is currently undertaking a number of major reforms that aim to improve the experience of children and families involved in family court proceedings. I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, to ensure children's best interests are at the centre of her Department's proposed family court reforms.</p>
            <p eId="para_252"> I have also recently overseen the enactment of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2022. In September I commenced section 4 of that Act which reflects the intent of Article 42A of the Constitution by confirming that, in any care proceedings under the Child Care Act, the court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration. The main purpose of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2022 is to extend and regulate the guardian <i>ad litem</i> system for children involved in childcare proceedings. The provisions of this Act are intended to enhance the rights of children and the capacity of the courts to make the right decisions in helping children and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_253"> Importantly, my Department is also reaching the end of a lengthy and in-depth review of the Child Care Act 1991. The Child Care Act, which is not childcare as we were just discussing, is legislation that looks to promote the welfare of children who do not receive adequate care and protection within the home. We have listened carefully to the concerns and suggestions of stakeholders, including children, and we have looked at international best practice. I hope very soon after our return from the Christmas break to bring the heads of a Bill to the Government to revise and update that Act. That is another opportunity for us to make sure that the best interests principle is ingrained in all elements of childcare proceedings in the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_254">I thank the Minister who I know to be a caring and conscientious Minister, as I would expect. However, there are circumstances at the moment where the interests of children are not being protected. The Minister referred to the courts and the need for the influence of Tusla there. In some cases throughout the country, Tusla has been prevented from giving evidence or influencing anything that might happen and has been disallowed in the context of its right and obligation to protect the interests of children where children’s interests are anything but to the fore. More especially, Tusla is also prevented by virtue of an <i>in camera</i> rule from giving evidence or taking action to protect children. I have no doubt cases will come to public attention in future that will show this up to a greater extent.</p>

            <p eId="para_255">I recognise Deputy Durkan's own interest in and commitment to this issue. We have discussed it before. There is a real opportunity now due to the work the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is doing on the family courts. There are two elements to that. There is the physical element whereby family law cases should not take place in the normal District Court alongside licence renewals and minor assaults. Family law cases should be heard in a separate place or at least at a separate time to take some of the stress away from parents, children and everyone involved. In regard to the policies that are taking place within the family courts, the Deputy is correct in saying that the <i>in camera</i> rule creates some element of a veil in regard to what happens in proceedings relevant to children. That is why the works of such groups as the family law reporting system led by Dr. Carol Coulter is so important in giving us an understanding on an anonymised basis of what is happening within the family courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_256">The Minister's knowledge on the subject is obvious. I welcome the legislation being brought forward by the Minister, Deputy McEntee. It is not before time. The problem, however, is that there are a number of children and their parents who are already victims of the system, where mothers are prevented even from meeting with the children and are subject to the most appalling hardship and disregard in regard to the children's rights and entitlements and the mothers' own rights. They have important maternal rights. At this moment, these rights are being abused. I have seen evidence to the effect that Tusla cannot decide what it should do because it is prevented from following its own conscience and responsibilities by the <i>in camera</i> rule.</p>

            <p eId="para_257">As Deputy Durkan knows, I cannot speak to the details of the specific cases and he is not asking me to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_258"> We had that very useful conference in terms of the best interests of the child principle. In particular, that was very relevant because the conference was about using that principle in the types of cases the Deputy is talking about. Tusla, my Department and the Ombudsman for Children were present, and it was a very good opportunity to get a common understanding and a better understanding of the approaches that need to be taken to vindicate the best interests of the child. Hopefully, as the Minister, Deputy McEntee, brings in her reforms as to where these cases take place but also the processes around them, we can start to better weave in the best interests principle in all court cases going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_260">Following on from the Minister's previous reply, my question is in regard to what will be the extent of the HIQA inspections that are to be carried out before Christmas and how many of the centres will be inspected. In the meantime, I want to know what staff are Garda vetted, whether they have any child protection training and whether there have been reports of assaults in those places. Should we be concerned?</p>

            <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_261">As the Deputy is aware following our earlier discussions, we are working with HIQA to implement the commitment for HIQA to monitor International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, centres against national standards adopted in 2019 and in effect since the beginning of 2021. Planning is well advanced on this process. Detailed work is being undertaken by my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, to provide the necessary legal basis for HIQA's monitoring role. The aim is that this will be done by means of regulation by statutory instrument.</p>
            <p eId="para_262"> As part of the development of the inspection process, HIQA established an advisory group comprising members from my Department and other stakeholder organisations. My Department holds monthly meetings with HIQA to advance this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_263"> Ahead of commencing inspections of all permanent centres, HIQA will conduct a series of pilot inspections and it is envisaged that these pilot inspections will take place before the end of the year. As I said, early next year we will be looking for the overall process of inspections to be rolled out. IPAS accommodation centres are currently subject to regular unannounced inspections both by departmental officials and by the independent inspectorate company that I spoke about earlier.</p>
            <p eId="para_264"> People working in international protection accommodation would require to be Garda vetted because many of these centres would have children present.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pa Daly<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_265">I thank the Minister for the reply but the devil is in the detail. Does the Minister know how many pilot schemes will be rolled out before Christmas? I know the Minister mentioned unannounced inspections but when does he propose that all of the centres, which are in effect permanent, will be subject to regular HIQA inspections or when will they all have been inspected? The Minister said the staff would be required to be Garda vetted but are those working there actually Garda vetted? Is the Minister saying that all the staff currently there are Garda vetted?</p>
            <p eId="para_266"> The report on the accommodation crisis prepared by the Irish Refugee Council states that health, child safety and child protection are paramount. This is one of the greatest concerns, especially given the week we have had, and the protection of children is very important. How many inspectors are there? Primarily, I want to nail down the exact number of pilot schemes and find out when all centres will have been inspected. Can the Minister guarantee that all of the staff are vetted?</p>

            <p eId="para_267">My understanding is that all staff working in centres should be Garda vetted but I will come back to the Deputy on that because I do not want to say something on the record that I cannot 100% stand over. We do not know how many HIQA pilot inspections are planned to take place. Again, these pilot inspections are to give HIQA an understanding, once it rolls out the full scheme of inspections in the new year, of how they will work and how they will operationalise. Again, I can come back to the Deputy with further information on that point.</p>
            <p eId="para_268"> All centres that exist at the moment are inspected twice a year by officials from my Department and once a year by the inspectorate company, QTS. These are a mix of announced and unannounced visits, and it is particularly important that we have those unannounced visits to ensure that, at all times, standards are as they should be.</p>

            <p eId="para_269">The particular concern is about minors, young people and those who are of disputed age, some of whom may have serious medical and physical conditions. Has the Minister been notified about assaults of any type in any of the centres or has that come to his attention? Are all unaccompanied minors given a social worker or placed in local authority care when they are in the centres? The staff should be Garda vetted, and the Minister will come back to me in that regard. Do any of the staff receive child protection training in advance of or concurrent with Garda vetting?</p>

          <speech by="#RodericOGorman" eId="spk_138" as="#Minister_for_Children,_Equality,_Disability,_Integration_and_Youth">

            <p eId="para_270">There have been assaults in international protection centres and when there is an assault, my Department would be notified. Obviously, it is initially a matter for the Garda. If someone under the age of 18 is involved, either as a victim or a perpetrator, then Tusla would be involved as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_271"> In terms of the question about child protection, again, it is my understanding that child protection training is part of the necessary processes that are undertaken. Certainly, centre managers would require child protection training in terms of the level of engagement they have with families. Again, I am on my feet in the House now but I can come back to the Deputy with the detail in terms of an assurance on Garda vetting and with clarity in terms of which members of staff receive the child protection training.</p>

            <p eId="para_278">I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 110, 121 and 124 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_279"> The National Action Plan for Childminding 2021-2028 commits to opening the national childcare scheme to childminders at the earliest possible opportunity, although it will be necessary first to develop and introduce childminder-specific regulations and to give childminders adequate time and support to meet regulatory requirements. The Childcare Support Act 2018, which provides a statutory basis for the national childcare scheme, specifies that only Tusla-registered providers are eligible to participate in the national childcare scheme. The restriction of public funding to Tusla-registered providers helps ensure that funding is only provided where there is assurance of the quality of provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_280"> Childminders who are currently minding four or more preschool children, or seven or more children of any age, are already required to register with Tusla and can already access the increased subsidies for parents announced in budget 2023. While only a small number of childminders are currently registered with Tusla, it is intended that the national action plan for childminding will result in the opening up of the national childcare scheme to a much wider cohort of childminders.</p>
            <p eId="para_281"> The overall objective of the national action plan is to improve access to high quality and affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare through childminding. To do this, the action plan sets out an incremental and supportive pathway to reform. Phase 1 of the national action plan, which began in 2021, is expected to take two to three years to complete. Phase 1 includes: development of new, childminder-specific regulations that are proportionate and appropriate to the home environment in which childminders work; development and roll-out of new, bespoke training for childminders; amendment of primary legislation to enable childminders to register with Tusla; and re-examining the funding and financial supports available for childminders.</p>
            <p eId="para_282"> A steering group was formed in September 2021 to drive and monitor implementation of the commitments in the national action plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_283">The steering group is chaired by my Department and includes representation of childminders, parents and other key stakeholders. The steering group is supported by four advisory groups, membership of which also includes representation of childminders, parents and stakeholders. The steering group provides strategic direction for the national action plan, drawing on the advice of the advisory groups. It advises my Department on policy, as well as regulatory and budgetary measures to ensure effective implementation, and it monitors risks and identifies measures to mitigate those risks. The steering group is required to submit an annual progress report to me. I am looking forward to receiving its first annual progress report in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_284"> Since coming into office, I have been committed to seeing this process through. A great deal of work still lies ahead. This is a complicated matter. There are thousands of individuals who are doing valuable work supporting parents, families and children. We want the parents using those services to be able to avail of the NCS but we need an element of regulations and some guarantees in terms of quality and basic standards. We are seeking to design appropriate regulations. We cannot apply to childminders the regulations that we apply to service-based childcare. We have to make it attractive for them to come into that process. That is why we are working closely with representative bodies to explain what we are doing, get a sense of which regulations can or cannot apply, and seek to roll that out. We are seeking to make it attractive and get childminders signed up. Once they are signed up and registered with Tusla, the parents who use them will be able to start to draw down the NCS. </p>

            <p eId="para_285">I want to pick up on the Minister's final point. I get that this is complicated. There is no square peg in a round hole when it comes to childminders. It is often the case that when childminders are being used, it is because there are no other suitable childcare options. There could be many good reasons for that, such as the size of a family, work patterns or kids being at different stages of education. Putting a 12-year-old or an 11-year-old into afterschool care is not really desirable but, equally, leaving such a child at home alone is not feasible.</p>
            <p eId="para_286"> The Minister can correct me if I am wrong. Phase 1, which involves two to three years for developing the regulation, kicked off in September 2021, so we are looking at September 2023 or September 2024 before it is completed. The crux of my question is, when will parents currently using childminders who are not in the situation the Minister mentioned in terms of minding more than four or seven kids and already being registered with Tusla genuinely be able to make the most of what has been an expansive and welcome shift in funding when it comes to childcare models? Can the Minister provide specific dates in that regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_287">The very small number of parents who are using childminders registered with Tusla are able to avail of it already. The Deputy stated that the first phase is set out until 2024. I have asked my officials to see if we can condense that phase as much as possible. I am conscious that many parents using childminders will see the support that parents using centre-based care are getting and will justifiably ask why they are not being supported too. I have asked the officials to work to get those regulations in place more quickly. I cannot give guarantees, however, in respect of the sign-up of childminders because they have to opt to undertake this regulation process. We are making it a simpler process. We are going to make it as attractive to them as possible but, ultimately, they have to make the determination. The childminder representative groups say there is an element of fear in the context of being regulated. We are seeking to do this in a processed way but not rush it because if we rush it, there may be a risk of losing people from even engaging.</p>

            <p eId="para_288">If legislative change is required, the whole House would get behind that to enact it as quickly as possible, although not in a rushed manner, of course. That is welcome. It goes to the nature of child minding. It is quite an <i>ad hoc</i> profession. It is not necessarily a role a person enters directly; it is something that many people fall into and it becomes a good fit because it is flexible. This comes to the crux of getting people to sign up. My late mother did it for four or five years. It fit around where she was in her professional career. There is a need to be flexible to make it attractive to people who decide it suits them because they have their own children. Let us be frank, it is generally women who are taking up these roles. Although speed is of the essence when we are designing regulation, a level of flexibility aimed at childminders will ensure that parents who avail of childminders will be able to get the best bang for their buck as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_289">The Deputy is correct that many people - it is primarily women - who enter childminding do so on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. What we are talking about here, however, is that when the <i>ad hoc</i> basis is supported by State money through the NCS and we are providing a subsidy towards that, we have to have guarantees in terms of the quality of provision. There has to be something of that kind when it come to any investment of State money. That is why we need this regulatory framework. It is designed around the reality of childminders. As I stated, we are not transporting what we use for centre-based regulation; it will be quite different and it will be simplified. It does need to be in place, however, if we are to offer support under the NCS. It is about designing that as quickly as possible and, as I stated, I have asked the officials to do so. There has to be consultation in that process, however. Childminders are a diverse group. We work closely with Childminding Ireland but the child-minding ecosphere is much broader than that and it is difficult to reach all elements of it. We are working to do so, however. We are working to get those regulations done as quickly as possible. Once that is done, we will work to sign up those who wish to sign up and make the NCS available to the parents who are using their childminding services.</p>

            <p eId="para_292">Foster care is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians. Approximately 89% of children in care are currently being cared for by foster carers, enabling them to live in a safe, secure and stable home environment. Foster care provision in an Irish context can be described as general foster care or relative foster care. In the case of general foster care, this can, in turn, be provided by foster carers who are engaged directly by Tusla, or by foster carers who work with private foster care agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_293"> Non-statutory foster care agencies are governed by the same legislation, regulations and standards as statutory foster care services provided by Tusla. Tulsa, through its alternative care inspection and monitoring services, is responsible for the monitoring of private non-statutory foster care agencies, in compliance with the national standards for foster care of 2003. In addition, HIQA undertakes regulatory inspections of the non-statutory foster care agencies, and the findings of these inspections can inform governance and regulatory activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_294"> I am fully conscious that over-reliance on private providers in any context brings with it certain inherent risks. In this context, the Deputy may be aware of the relevant commitments on this issue in Tusla's strategic plan for foster care services for children and young people from 2022 to 2025. As part of recommendation 3 of the plan, Tusla has committed to reviewing the use of private foster care providers and developing a clear scope for the use of such agencies. In addition, I welcome Tusla's commitment in recommendation 3 to examine the potential for using private foster agencies for specific placement types with more robust service level agreements to reference the rates of fostering allowance and support services for foster carers. As I stated, I very much welcome the commitments within the plan in respect of the use of private foster care agencies, in addition to the numerous other commitments in the plan to improve foster care services for children and young people in care across all models of foster care provision.</p>

            <p eId="para_295">I am asking the question because a reply we recently received to a parliamentary question illustrated that up to 6 August this year, €19 million was spent on private services and 485 children, or 9.3%, were placed with non-statutory fostering agencies, that is, the private for-profit agencies. The figures released yesterday in respect of Tusla and the high turnover of staff further indicate that something is not working in the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_296">We do not want a situation where children are going into these private fostering arrangements. One situation I have across a lot, and I have had a number of good conversations, in fairness, with Tusla regarding it, is where family members, particularly grandparents, want to foster. There is some sort of breakdown or it just does not seem to be working. It is not that such family members are deemed ineligible but they do not seem to qualify. They are trying to keep the children within the family and a home environment but they do not always qualify for the payment. That is very difficult, particularly if people are at an age where they have retired, their family is raised and they are not necessarily going to be working again. We need to try to examine this because it is clearly not working at present. I apologise to the Acting Chair for going over time. </p>

            <p eId="para_297">Tusla is doing a very significant piece of work on the whole area of alternative care. It is bringing forward three key documents, namely, the document on residential care that was published a couple of months ago, the foster care plan we talked about that has just been published, and a document on aftercare. These are the three core elements of alternative care. It might be useful to dedicate a sitting of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, once the third document has been published, to a discussion all three documents. There are real challenges for Tusla. The foster care plan is very important in respect of Tusla recognising there are challenges regarding its recruitment and retention of staff and its support of foster carers. I attended the Irish Foster Care Association, IFCA, conference two weeks ago and spoke about my determination to address a number of issues regarding the weekly rate foster carers are paid and other issues around mileage allowances, the availability of the back to school allowance and the like. It is those things that make it a little more difficult for each foster parent. It is about seeing how we can address those issues as quickly as possible.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_298">The joint committee looked at the issue of foster care. I cannot remember if the Minister has appeared before it regarding this topic but I think we have potentially slotted him in at some point. He should expect an invitation. The committee has looked at this issue and has not finished all its hearings on it. I definitely agree there needs to be a more joined-up approach and thinking because the other side of it is we have people we can potentially keep out of the foster care system. That is ultimately what we want to see. We should consider tying in the home support services Tusla runs with the school liaison service and so on. We always need to tap into services, such as school completion, for which I am a big advocate. That is also part of it, when we are trying to avoid the foster care system at all costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_299"> When we looked at this issue at the joint committee, Senator Ruane made some very good points about supports for families who do not want to see their children go into foster care. Maybe something has happened in their lives and they are trying to get back on the right track but they are not always given the level of support they may need. A piece of work needs to be done on how we bring it all together. It always worries me that we may take the privatisation road when we do anything. Going down the route of private, for-profit agencies is not where I would like to go. I do not think the Minister would like to see us going down that road either.</p>

            <p eId="para_300">I would certainly be happy to engage with the joint committee on this issue. We can continue to be reasonably proud as country that when children are taken into care, 89% of them go to foster care rather than residential. That is a strong proportion compared to other European countries. We want to avoid any child going into care but where it is necessary, it is good that it is in a family home and, as the Deputy said, it is foster care by relatives. We need to support those foster carers. Having engaged and spoken with IFCA - I will meet another group soon - I know it does not feel sufficiently supported. I outlined at the IFCA conference the steps taken by the Government and my Department to do more, including my engagement with other colleagues. The Tusla plan puts a clear roadmap forward for how we can better support foster parents. As I said, I am happy to engage with the joint committee and hear what the Deputy has heard regarding what steps we can take.</p>

            <p eId="para_302">I raise a subject similar to that referenced in a previous question.

            <p eId="para_303">As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the delivery of child protection and welfare services is a matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. The Children First Act 2015 provides for a number of key child protection measures, including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, providing for mandated reporting of child protection concerns and improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children. Under the Act, mandated persons are required to report child protection concerns at or above a defined threshold to Tusla. Mandated persons are people who have contact with children or families or both and who, because of their qualifications, training or employment role or both, are in a key position to help protect children from harm. Organisations classed as providers of relevant services under the Act are required to undertake a risk assessment and develop a child safeguarding statement setting out the procedures in place to manage any risk identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_304"> The Children First Act operates side by side with the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children. The guidance sets out how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the general public and professionals to Tusla and what organisations need to do to keep children safe. If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, the concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website. If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, An Garda Síochána should be alerted without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_305"> Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by An Garda Síochána or by Tusla but, in the main, both agencies work together in such cases. Tusla has an out-of-hours emergency number for An Garda Síochána, which provides advice based on the circumstances and can also identify whether a child of concern is listed on the child protection notification system, CPNS, a Tusla-owned secure database that lists children who are considered to be at ongoing risk of significant harm.</p>

            <p eId="para_306">I thank the Minister for the extended nature of his reply and his understanding of the issue. In the past couple of days, I received notice from Tusla to the effect that I would not be allowed to attend a case conference because there was an objection. That was a surprise because my only interest in it was to ensure that the rights of the child and parents were preserved. Over the years, like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I have attended the Royal Courts of Justice and most other courts, including the family law courts, to give evidence on behalf of what I believed were deserving cases. I was always welcomed and I did not lose in my intervention either. The position now remains for Tusla to exert itself in such a way as to ensure that, without doubt, we are absolutely assured of its intention to preserve and assert, in all circumstances, the rights of the child in these particular circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_307">I am sure the Deputy will understand that I am reluctant to comment in the House on the specific details of a case I am not at all familiar with. I am happy to engage with him should he wish to give me an update. Unlike him, with his degree of experience, I have not attended a Tusla conference as an elected representative so I am not quite sure what the processes and procedures are there. I am happy to discuss this further with the Deputy, if he believes it is necessary.</p>

To be told by an organisation of the State, with specific powers on behalf of the State to protect specific people, in this instance, children, I was amazed at such a response.

          <p eId="para_310">More than two years ago, 18 distraught families learned that their children's organs had been sent to Belgium for incineration without their knowledge or consent. The South/Southwest Hospital Group was to complete and publish a report on the incidents at Cork University Maternity Hospital with the involvement of the affected families. In September 2020, the Minister for Health encouraged families to participate in the review. He stated, "the hospital group has committed to completing it by early November." It was not even commenced until April of the following year and promised again for November last year. It is now November 2022 and there is still no final report. A commitment was given that the families would get a draft copy of the report by the end of September at the latest. This morning, however, we learned that these families have been locked out of the process and that they will not get a first look at the report. That is shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> Sparked by that incident, an audit of organ retention and disposal practices was commissioned by the HSE. That report examined multiple hospitals and was completed far in advance of the report into Cork University Maternity Hospital. It found that similar unethical practices were taking place in Limerick, Drogheda, Galway, Tullamore, Portiuncula and Crumlin. Worst of all, it found that a single consultant named by "RTÉ Investigates" earlier this year, but known as Consultant A, was responsible for a significant amount of this malpractice. This is made worse by the fact that Consultant A had previously been removed from his duties at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin in 2007. At some point, the HSE recommissioned Consultant A's services.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> In the 13 years since the publication of the report to which I refer in 2009, successive Governments have promised to legislate and have failed to do so. The devastating consequences of this failure for parents and families should be obvious to us all. Last July, in response to Teachta McDonald in this House, the Taoiseach made three commitments to the families affected by these failures. The first was that the bereaved families affected by the scandal at Cork University Maternity Hospital would be given access to the report without further delay. That has not happened. The second was that the HSE audit would be published. The audit was delayed by six months and had to be forced out of the system by means of a freedom of information request. The third was that the Government would publish the human tissue Bill this autumn. That has not happened either.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> I have three clear questions for the Tánaiste. Will he compel the HSE to give the families access to the report this week? They have been calling for this for years. They have been promised it time and again. We cannot continue to fail them. Who is responsible for the governance failures leading to Consultant A being rehired? Who was responsible for auditing his practice and what accountability will there be for the failure in that regard? Will the Government finally publish the human tissue Bill this month, without delay, in order to prevent incidents such as those to which I refer from happening again?</p>

          <p eId="para_314">I thank the Deputy for raising this very sensitive matter and for his ongoing interest in it on behalf of the 18 families affected. The matter has been discussed in the House previously. Once again, I express my deep sympathy to the families in Cork who have experienced the tragedy of losing a child and who then had the devastating experience of learning that their children's organs were disposed of without their consent. That was wrong. It is hard to fathom the hurt this incident must have caused to the families affected. It is an extremely distressing situation that should not have occurred and that has only added to their distress and grief.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> While it is not appropriate for me to comment on individual cases, I recognise the families affected for sharing their deeply personal stories in order that other families do not have to go through what they experienced. The Department of Health is advised that the HSE, the South/Southwest Hospital Group, Cork University Hospital and Cork University Maternity Hospital have apologised to the families concerned and very much regret the incident. The Minister for Health, his Department and the HSE are committed to ensuring that there is learning across the health service to prevent a recurrence. The HSE advises that the systems analysis review being undertaken by the hospital group has concluded and that the final report is being prepared. We will respond to any recommendations. The HSE advises that the report is being finalised and will be shared with the families in the coming weeks. I am not sure if we have powers of compellability in that regard, but we are assured by the HSE that the report will be shared with the families within the next few weeks. I understand that the delay in the completion of this review has been very upsetting, but it is essential that correct processes are followed in order to ensure the facts of the case can be established and shared with the families affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Dignity and respect for parents who have experienced the loss of a child are of paramount importance. In that context, the human tissue Bill is on the priority list of legislation for the Government. Among other matters, the Bill will introduce a regulatory regime for the conduct of post mortems in hospital settings. Given recent events, the general scheme of the Bill has had to be amended to encompass certain aspects of coronial post mortem activities. The draft Bill is being finalised and it is intended that it will be brought to Government for approval at the end of this month.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">The delays on the part of the Government and the HSE over the past two years in respect of this matter have caused major hurt and distress to the families involved. What is happening is simply not good enough. I have met some of the families involved and am aware that they believe they are being stonewalled. The Tánaiste says they will get sight of the report in a couple of weeks' time, but similar promises were made in the past. The families were promised that they would get sight of the draft report. That is being reneged upon. If the Tánaiste says that the families will get sight of the final report in a few weeks' time, that needs to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Thirteen years on from the 2009 review, Britain and other countries have put in legislation similar to the proposed human tissue Bill for which we are still waiting. There can be no excuse for that delay. We have had previous commitments in this regard. Only a few months ago in this House, the Taoiseach said that the legislation would be forthcoming in the autumn. The Tánaiste is now saying it will be by the end of the year. That needs to happen, and the promises made today in this Chamber by the Taoiseach need to be followed through on.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">The delays with this inquiry and many other inquiries are impossible to defend. I can only imagine the frustration people experience when these inquiries, which you think will last six months, go on for more than six months and last a year or two years. That is very hard to defend. When we challenge the people carrying out the inquiries as to why this is the case, they often say that the matters involved were more complicated than they thought in the first instance and that things came up that they had to look into. That is very difficult to defend from any point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> I understand that the draft report will also be the final report. Essentially, they are the same. However, I could be wrong about that. I am told that the report will be shared with the families in the next few weeks. I appreciate that they will not believe that until it happens, particularly in view of their previous experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> Once again, I am informed that the human tissue Bill will be before the Cabinet by the end of November. It is long overdue. The proposal for this legislation may even go date as far as the Madden commission under the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney. It is that long ago. The legislation is well overdue, and we need to get it done.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">On Tuesday and yesterday, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of the Spiritans and the horrific abuse of children perpetrated at Blackrock College. At that one school alone, we are now learning of the horrific scale of the abuse that was perpetrated. It was revealed yesterday that 25 of the 120 boys in the class of 1979 have reported abuse. That is a staggering 21%. We know that 300 individuals have come forward disclosing abuse perpetrated upon them, and yet just three of the 77 Spiritans with allegations against them have criminal convictions. The scale of this is staggering.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Deputy Ó Ríordáin, others from the Labour Party and I have been in contact with many of the survivors who have come forward. I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment, in response to my question on Tuesday, that we will have a debate on this matter in the House next week. This is welcome. I also welcome the apology from the Spiritans announced yesterday morning, as well as the announcement that the order will establish an independent process to provide a forum for survivors of abuse to come forward. I salute, as we all do, the bravery of those individuals who have already come forward and made public disclosures. Their courage in doing so has enabled others to step forward too.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> We believe, however, that we still need to see an independent inquiry take place, not only to uncover the extent of the abuse perpetrated not just by the Spiritans within one school, but, as it now seems, by other orders in other schools that have not yet been the subject of an inquiry and that have not yet, necessarily, come into the public domain. We have seen other schools named today. We also know that such an inquiry must be survivor-led. It must seek to review the extent of the abuse and, crucially, the existence of institutional cover-ups in individual schools and by particular orders. It should also seek to examine the role of the State and, in particular, its failures and what it could and should have done to prevent abuse in schools where the teachers were paid by the State and the schools were receiving significant public funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> We are all very conscious of the complexity of establishing such an inquiry. It may, for example, need to be done in a modular fashion. Clearly, we need to hear more from survivors. I welcomed the Taoiseach's indication that he would meet with survivors. We must also consider current concerns. I spoke yesterday about current issues and a person against whom serious allegations of abuse have been made and who continues to live on the grounds of Blackrock College. I am not going to name the individual. The matter with the Garda, as it should be. The reality is that this is not just an historical issue. Not only are perpetrators still living who have evaded any sort of sanctions to date, but there are those currently in leadership roles in particular schools who have been in those posts for so long, many decades in some cases, that it is very difficult to believe they did not have knowledge of the abuse that was being perpetrated there. In advance of next week's debate, therefore, what preliminary thoughts does the Tánaiste and his Government have on how this matter can be investigated by the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_326">I thank the Deputy again for raising this important issue. On Monday, I had a chance to listen to the radio documentary. It was very compelling. I pay tribute to the bravery of all those who participated in it. If people do not tell their stories, then it is very hard for us to take actions against people who carry out abuse and prevent it from happening in future. I recognise their bravery in coming forward and participating in that documentary.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> This is a matter that the Government is very concerned about. The cruelty and pervasive nature of the allegations is truly shocking. In the first instance, my thoughts are with the survivors who have bravely told us their stories. Parents must be able to send their children to school in the knowledge that they are not only receiving the best education they can but that they are also in a safe environment. This is true for the vast majority of schools in our State. I understand that a restorative justice process has now been put in place by the Spiritans, which is very welcome. A debate on these issues is scheduled for next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> As the Taoiseach said earlier, the Government is going to give this matter further consideration, particularly regarding the most effective way to have a victim-led inquiry to allow us to unearth what happened at Blackrock College and other Spiritan schools, specifically who knew what and how they acted, if at all. We just do not know yet the best form of inquiry or what form of inquiry should take place. We are very conscious of the length of time that some inquiries take. We wish to ensure this is undertaken in the right way. This is extremely important for the survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> I again encourage anyone who has been the victim of sexual abuse, in school or elsewhere, to contact the Garda. The Garda has extensive powers of investigation. It can carry out arrests, interview people and seize documents and devices. This can lead to prosecutions and perpetrators being punished. In many ways, this is much more powerful than many other forms of inquiry.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">I thank the Tánaiste for his response. I endorse his comments and his encouragement of anyone who has been the victim of sexual abuse, in school or elsewhere, to report that matter to the Garda. I would also be glad to engage constructively with the Tánaiste and the Government on the structure of an inquiry. Survivors have contacted me to express their view that an inquiry and a process should engage, in particular, in ensuring that safeguards will be put in place to ensure that abuse like this will not happen in the future, cultural changes that will have to be made in different institutions, radical changes in systems of governance and, crucially, supports for survivors and victims. I look forward to a further debate on that..</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> I stress again that this is not just an historical issue. People are still currently in leadership roles, in particular in Blackrock College, who have had continuous ongoing involvement with that college for 40 years. I am well aware that one individual, currently in a key leadership role, was told of specific abuse allegations in 2002 and has in the past decade been approached by other survivors who have been told by him to go away and not return unless they have proof and a solicitor with them. These are current issues and not just historical ones, and survivors do want to see them addressed by us as legislators and by the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">It is fair to say there is broad consensus across the House that we do need an inquiry into these matters and that it should be victim-led and survivor-led. As we all know from our own experience of inquiries that have been initiated by the Government or this House, getting the form of the inquiry right is very important, as is getting the terms of reference right. Inquiries can range from non-statutory ones, such as that which led to the Scally report, which I think people would see as a good model, albeit in very different circumstances, to statutory inquiries, which can also be a very good model but that can take a long time. One thing we must bear in mind is that we do not want to do anything that might compromise any Garda inquiries or any prosecutions. It is possible to have an inquiry without doing this, but we need to have regard to the possibility that it might interfere with Garda inquiries, prosecutions or civil cases. We must ensure we do not make any mistakes in this regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Verona Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_333">I am extremely concerned about the new proposed residential-zoned land tax. I am in favour of a vacant site tax that encourages developers or those sitting on residentially-zoned land to engage in the process of development. I have reviewed the guidance from the Revenue on the tax in the last week and, in short, I was shocked. This tax is now a revenue-raising measure, as opposed to a tax that is designed to encourage stakeholders to develop land.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> We have had a plethora of reports in recent months indicating that viability is now the key issue in housing. Commencements of developments continue to fall as a result of unviable permissions. Development plans have been adopted outside of Dublin and they continue to force developers to apply for permissions that are not viable. The planning regulator has advised the Minister on a number of locations to rezone lands to high density, rendering them unviable. The Tánaiste's Minister has adopted these changes knowing the effect will be to render the zoned lands undevelopable. If the Tánaiste does not believe me, then he might check with his own councillor, Anthony Barry from Carrigtwohill.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> Willing developers trying their best to develop lands are being delayed for years by the dead hand of Government. What I mean by this is the dysfunctional planning departments in many county councils that are understaffed, the basket case that is An Bord Pleanála and the crazy zoning and house calculation targets set by the planning regulator. The planning process can take up to five years from the date of zoning and this is assuming the lands are serviced. It now can take up to eight months to get a preplanning meeting in County Wexford and I am sure it is the same with other local authorities. It takes a year to design a scheme, a year to get a decision, a further year, and possibly more, to get it approved by the board, if it was functioning, and another year to get a project through judicial reviews. During this entire process, the Government will have collected five years of land tax before development can be commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> Any tax such as this should provide reliefs for all of the above circumstances. The Government's tax does not. There should be a viability relief provision in the tax. The Exchequer already takes 52% of the cost of every new house. The Government is now proposing to possibly add up to 15% more to this figure by way of applying this new residential development land tax. The Government has also brought in a pyrite levy. Young people are at their wits end trying to buy houses. How can they ever expect to afford a home when the Government keeps applying taxes that are simply going to be passed on to the poor misfortunate first-time buyers? This is the death nail in the coffin of housing, if it continues.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">I thank the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The residential zone land tax will raise revenue. Any tax raises revenue. However, that is not the primary purpose of the tax. Its primary purpose is to make sure that where land is zoned for housing, it gets developed for housing. We are all aware of the need for additional housing in the State and the fact that much land that is zoned for housing is not being developed. That is the purpose of and the thinking behind the tax. It is a response to the severe housing crisis that our citizens face. I might be wrong about this - and I will check up on it - but my understanding is that the tax will not apply if reasonable efforts are being made to develop land. It is not that houses or apartments have to be built on the relevant land tomorrow but that those involved must enter into the process of applying for planning permission, etc. I will double-check on that. I agree that it would not be fair to impose the tax on somebody who is making reasonable efforts to develop land for housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> It is worth pointing out that a landowner can request that land be dezoned. We accept that people have private property rights and that land might be in a family for generations and they may not want to develop it. Under the legislation, it is possible for someone who does not want land to be developed to request that it be dezoned. The latter then allows us to zone land elsewhere that can then be developed for housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> I very much agree with the Deputy that we need to make sure that our planning departments are properly resourced. The same goes for An Bord Pleanála. We will build approximately 28,000 new homes in Ireland this year - more than any year in over a decade - but we need the figure to be much higher than that. We need to build well over 30,000 homes next year. Part of that is making sure that planning departments are properly resourced.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">I listened to the Tánaiste's response. He is a great supporter of the US Republican Party. Listening to him, what comes to mind is Ronald Reagan's assertion that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: "I'm from the government and I'm here to help." There is nothing that the Government has done to help. Every time it seeks to give help to first-time buyers or do anything in respect of housing, everything just gets worse. Something has got to give.</p>

          <p eId="para_343"> I will check with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on the issue of reliefs. This is a tax that I agree with. Land that is zoned for housing should be developed for housing and people should not hang on to it. If they want to dezone land, that is fair enough. If, however, land is zoned for housing, it should be developed for housing. I do not agree that the tax should apply if somebody is making reasonable efforts, has applied for planning permission, etc. I will definitely follow that up with the Minister for Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">We have read over the past week that insurance companies in Ireland made €159 million in profits in 2021. In 2018, the figure was €130 million. There has been a substantial increase. It is not that I am against companies making profit. In fairness, the Government brought in changes to help in respect of the insurance debacle relating to this country. It is alarming when one gets an email that the insurance companies seem to be picking and choosing and doing their own thing. I received an email from a young person who was approved for a mortgage and who did the right thing at a time when 20% of people missed having smear tests. The person in question went and had a smear test. Irregularities were found but everything was sorted. She was approved for a mortgage but the insurance company has informed here that she cannot get health insurance or mortgage protection. This person, who did not want a social house and who had obtained mortgage approval and was doing her own thing, is being held back.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> An estate in Ballaghaderreen that was built 40 years ago has never had a problem with water, flooding or anything else. I checked with Roscommon County Council and there was never a problem. The council could see nothing in any way that could affect the estate. I checked the Office of Public Works's one-in-100-year and one-in-1,000-year maps. Lo and behold, an insurance company decided randomly to get a Dutch company to look at the estate to which I refer. People will probably find out that it also looked at other estates throughout the country. Some genius, as part of a desktop exercise, decided that there may be a risk of flooding down the line and the residents of the estate can no longer get insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> While I recognise some of what has been done by the Government over the past number of years in respect of insurance, what more can we do to try to put manners on the insurance companies in the context of some of the things they are doing? Can the Tánaiste talk to the Central Bank about this matter? What these companies say is that unless everything is 100%, they will not insure people. That is not what insurance is for. If you crash your car, you draw your insurance. The premium might go up a small bit, but you still get insurance. A person who did the right thing in the context of her health and who obtained mortgage approval will not now be able to draw down the mortgage because of the rules being implemented by her insurance company. What can the Government do to help the people to whom I refer, as well as those who are affected by insurance companies just pulling something out of a hat? There is no way of disproving what they are saying to the effect that there may be a flood risk somewhere down the line. What can the Government do in respect of this matter?</p>

          <p eId="para_348">Like the Deputy, I understand that insurance companies have to make a profit. If they do not make a profit, they cannot operate or function. If the latter were the case, there would not be any insurance companies or insurance policies and there would certainly be no competition. Obviously, they should be making reasonable rather than excessive profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> It is encouraging to have seen motor insurance come down a lot in recent years. I am not happy that house insurance is still going up. We had expected that when price walking ended, the loyalty penalty would be removed and prices would fall. In general, prices have not fallen. Despite the considerable efforts we have made around employer liability and public liability, premiums are pretty flat. I want to see them fall.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> In terms of the reforms that are under way, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is bringing in new legislation in respect of duty of care in order to rebalance the responsibility when it comes to entering a premises. This will mean that people have a little more responsibility not to injure themselves or get injured. That legislation should be done in the next few months. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Calleary, is bringing through the Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022, which will allow more cases to be settled before the board and to discourage people from going to court in certain circumstances. We think that will help to bring down premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> I chair the Government group on insurance. We have good engagement with the insurance industry - the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming, is engaged in that as well - and with the Central Bank, which is the regulator.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">I thank the Tánaiste. The Tánaiste comes from the health sector. The person to whom I refer did not have cancer. Irregularities were found. Everything was cleared up, but there is now that little doubt. It is difficult to hear someone say that she wished she had not gone for the smear test before she went for her mortgage because now she is in trouble for what she did. We are encouraging women to make sure that they go for these tests. With this person, everything is sorted but, because there was an irregularity, she is not able to get home protection and cannot draw down her mortgage. I welcome what the Tánaiste said, and I will give him the details of the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> There is also the other aspect I am seeing in the context of housing estates. I gave one example of houses that were built 40 years ago. No Government body, be it the local authority or the Office of Public Works, has ever red-flagged the estate in question as being one where there could be trouble. However, an insurance company has decided overnight that it cannot insure the residents' houses in respect of flooding. That is a damnable situation for those who have not had any problem whatsoever for 40 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">The news today that charges on most toll roads are to increase to their maximum level from 1 January is another blow to workers and families. It comes on top of the record fuel prices that motorists are paying. As the Tánaiste knows, workers and families are struggling to get by and these toll increases will really hurt commuters. Tolls disproportionately impact those living in rural areas who are forced to use a car because public transport is not an option. During the pandemic the taxpayer had to step in and pay the toll operators millions. Now, due to these gold-plated Fianna Fáil-era contracts, motorists will be forced to fork out even more. Last month the M3 toll operator alone announced a profit of €11 million. These firms are not struggling to get by. Will the Government engage with the operators? Has it asked them to forgo this hike?</p>

          <p eId="para_360">I thank the Deputy. I am informed the setting of tolls is not a Government decision. It is a statutory function of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, although there are some procedural differences between the two public roads, which are the M50 and the Dublin Port tunnel, and the eight PPP roads. Obviously, news of the increase is not welcome. The M50 toll is in my constituency. The Deputy can imagine that many people travel south and north and pay that toll not just every day but twice a day. This is very unwelcome. As is required by legislation, TII will shortly publish details of the proposals in the national media prior to their introduction. From the Government's point of view, we can take it up with it at that point. I do not want to make a commitment I might not be able to honour. The power to decide the toll levels does not lie with the Government. It lies with TII.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">I want to return to the issue of women’s healthcare and the CervicalCheck screening programme. On Tuesday we all spoke in tribute to Vicky Phelan and remarked on the extraordinary legacy she has left and the huge work she did for women's healthcare in her lifetime. On Tuesday, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach committed to ensuring the speedy passage of the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 to require mandatory open disclosure and restorative meetings between women and their consultants. This is very welcome. The Tánaiste identified some of the very positive outcomes as a result of the Scally report. More accurate ways to examine the smear tests are now in place and funding has been allocated for a new laboratory in the Coombe hospital to reduce the need for outsourcing. Many of us have been contacted in recent days not just about the Scally report and those changes but also about the 2019 rapid review report of Professor Brian MacCraith looking at the delays in issuing cervical screening retest results to a large cohort of women and their doctors. Will the Tánaiste confirm that the findings of the MacCraith review, which were accepted entirely by the HSE, as we know, have now been implemented along with the Scally report recommendations so that no more women will face the sort of delays that led to such adverse outcomes in the past?</p>

          <p eId="para_364">It is disappointing the Minister for Health is not here because I was hoping for an answer to this question. I want to raise the issue of Miley McKee again. I raised it three weeks ago. Miley is a 12-year-old girl from Greystones. She has been waiting two years and four months for her scoliosis treatment. She has a curvature of more than 100° and is in constant pain. As a GP, the Tánaiste knows the impact having a curvature of that degree would have on a child. She has been waiting since August 2020. She was meant to have her operation in September. It was cancelled because there were not enough paediatric nurses to look after her after the operation. A tracheostomy nurse was required. When I asked Children's Health Ireland this week how many tracheostomy nurses it has, it quite flippantly replied that it has a large number of tracheostomy trained nurses in Temple Street hospital. Why is it not using one of that large number of tracheostomy nurses to make sure that Miley gets the operation she needs? She is in constant pain. I do not say this lightly. This is actually child abuse. When will Miley have her operation?</p>

          <p eId="para_365">I am very sorry to hear about Miley's experience. I was not aware of the case, although I appreciate Deputy Whitmore has raised it previously. As the Deputy knows, wait times for scoliosis have improved and reduced in the past year or so, but often there are individual cases and very complex cases that take longer because of the number of different specialists that need to be involved. I do not really want to comment on individual cases for these reasons. Perhaps I can let the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, know the Deputy has raised it again and ask him to come back to her directly.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">When the moratorium on gas and electricity disconnections was announced for the winter, pay-as-you-go customers were excluded. There are 340,000 such electricity meters in the State and 117,000 such gas customers. If we exclude a certain crossover and perhaps some holiday homes, we are safe to say the households excluded from the moratorium probably comprise more than 500,000 people. This issue was highlighted in the Dáil and there was a subsequent furore, debate and controversy. Some concessions were forced as a result of this. The financial penalties for switching from pay-as-you-go to bill pay were removed. Some energy companies that previously had no hardship funds introduced hardship funds. However, there is still no moratorium despite the fact that the official start date of the moratorium, 1 December, is just two weeks away. What guarantee will the Tánaiste give to pay-as-you-go customers that they will not and cannot be disconnected this winter?</p>

I know it turned out to be quite complicated given the nature of bill pay being different from pay-as-you-go. As the Deputy acknowledged, there are no disconnections at certain times such as weekends. We were trying to make it easier for people to move from pay-as-you-go to bill pay without having to pay €160. I am not sure where it ended up. I know the Department with responsibility for energy was doing some work to try to find a solution for the very reasonable issues Deputy Barry has raised.

          <p eId="para_368">The Government must explain to the public what it is doing to address the dangerous staff shortages in our health service. The situation has gone beyond crisis point when midwives in Tipperary University Hospital have issued a warning that staff shortages are causing risks to the safety of women and their babies. INMO members working in the maternity department have formally written to the management at the hospital stating they cannot be held accountable or responsible for any adverse event that might occur. We have reached an alarming situation where nurses in the hospital are in fear of being blamed for unfortunate outcomes caused directly by gross understaffing. The greatest asset of any organisation is its people. The provision of healthcare simply cannot function safely without sufficient staff. The serious staffing problems at Tipperary University Hospital's maternity unit need to be addressed urgently.</p>

Approximately 130,000 or 135,000 people work in our health service, which is more than ever before. There are 81,000 nurses and midwives, which is more than ever before. We have never had more doctors or consultants working on our health service than is the case now. This, of course, comes against a backdrop of a rising population, increasing medical needs and a move towards shorter hours and more part-time work. We are doing everything we can to recruit and we are seeing some success in this regard.

The islanders and landowners are anxiously awaiting the cable car works completion, which has been put off due to inclement weather. I spoke to the islanders and landowners there in the past week. They have had no way on or off the island for almost two weeks. The temporary ferry service put in place has not been able to travel due to inclement weather, leaving no access to the island.

This will be Thomas's brother's fourth Christmas in St. James's Hospital if a residential placement is not secured for him. He frequently leaves the hospital and makes his way home, causing much anxiety for himself and his family. Gardaí are frequently asked to intervene. I received a response from the disability services that states "mental health services have agreed to work with us around sourcing an accommodation solution that will enable him to live away from the family home with appropriate supports". That is dated 19 August 2020, and he is still waiting for that permanent care. I am asking for an intervention at the highest level to ensure this young man gets a permanent placement in residential services as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">The process involved in getting approval for major hospital developments is both contracted and convoluted and includes multiple stages, many times with significant delays at each stage. The reality is these delays make it very difficult to provide good quality services because of overcrowding and inadequate buildings. The second factor often overlooked is that, with building inflation costs running at a high level, the longer the delays, the more it costs the taxpayer and the less we get in results. What steps is the Government taking to reduce the whole process and streamline it so that we actually get things built in this country rather than talking about and planning them forever?</p>

          <p eId="para_378">We discussed this at the Cabinet subcommittee on health on Monday, trying to figure out and carry out a review into how we might be able to speed up capital development in the health sector. The Deputy will be painfully aware that the development of an emergency department and of maternity and paediatric services in University Hospital Galway seem to be going on forever, which is extremely frustrating. There are similar examples in other parts of the country. However, there is a balance to be struck. Anything that is done more quickly with less review and scrutiny is more likely to go wrong, and we have seen this happen in other health projects. We are carrying out a review into the public spending code and whether we can reduce the number of steps and hoops a project has to get through to be built. I understand the Deputy's point that delays cost money.</p>

They cannot benefit from the €600 energy credit because they do not have an ESB meter registered in their name. They get their electricity from the supply park operator. I have raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who promised to get back to me.

I know both Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Ryan, are trying to work out a solution through energy bills or the social welfare system. I agree we need to sort this out. The intention was that every household would receive €600 in energy credits. A family or a person living in a mobile home, which is their principal primary residence, are a household. We have to find a way to fix this. I appreciate the Deputy's frustration in raising this issue three times. We will find a way.</p>

The Tánaiste will be aware of this from his background in the medical profession. People are piling into hospital emergency departments and this is adding to the problems of these units, which are regularly raised in the Chamber.

Bearing in mind what Deputy Ó Cuív said earlier, I am realistic and I believe these new elective hospitals will be five or six years in planning, design and building. That is not good enough, so we need interim solutions as well. We already have elective hospitals, for example, Cappagh hospital, the Eye and Ear Hospital, and in Croom, which could potentially do more. There is a very successful surgery hub in Tallaght that has helped to reduce waiting lists dramatically. We need to have a parallel track, including elective hospitals, but it will be close to 2030 before they are up and running, so we need to have other solutions as well.</p>

I believe the IPPN conference is happening today, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, will be there and will engage with the IPPN. It has made some good suggestions to which we need to give good consideration. I am told that much of the shortage is linked to this move away from the HDip to a two-year masters, which has knocked out the best part of a year's supply.

Is it with the EU or the Government? There is no certainty as to whether the horticulture sector can survive going forward. There are no adequate levels or sources of peat, or rather there are, but people are banned from accessing them. What has this Government got against the horticulture sector and why is the sector being made to carry the burden of unworkable environmentally incoherent policies? What actions will the Government take to address this crisis which is deepening by the hour? Peat is being imported from tens of thousands of miles away which is increasing the carbon footprint. What actions will the Government take for this sector?</p>

          <p eId="para_397">The Government has been taking this issue very seriously. It is a challenging situation that emanates from the fact that pretty much all the commercial peat extraction that is happening in the country is operating without licence or authorisation. That has been the situation for many years. As a result, we have come up against a situation whereby the industry has not been regularised and is finding it very challenging to become regularised. Along with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, I have been working on a recently commissioned report undertaken by Mr. Séamus Boland of Irish Rural Link to assess the number of bogs in the country of under 30 ha to see whether there is potential in that regard. I also commissioned planning expertise advice from two eminent professionals to help companies guide them through the planning process. However, there is no getting away from the fact this is difficult and challenging. My Department is engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to try plot a way forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">In the programme for Government, the Government has committed to holding constitutional referendums on at least three matters: extending the franchise in the presidential elections to Irish citizens outside the State, housing and Article 41.2.1° with regard to women in the home. I am also interested in a referendum on the Unified Patent Court which is urgent. Will the Tánaiste tell me whether there is a plan to hold any of these referendums in the coming six months or year?</p>

          <p eId="para_399">We have not agreed dates for any of those referendums as of yet. It is fair to say that none of them will happen within six months. It takes a bit of time to plan for a referendum. My Department has begun the process of planning for the referendum on the patent court, which will happen no later than the local and European elections of 2024. We do not have dates for the referendums. We will need to have dates because a number of them probably should happen next year but it has not been agreed by Cabinet yet.</p>

          <p eId="para_400">The increase in tolls during the cost-of-living crisis is an absolute disgrace. The Government owns the M50 and the East-Link Bridge, and yet we see the tolls for these increase at a time when people are paying higher prices for cars and fuel and to service their cars. The research Aontú carried out shows the commuter has already paid €1.2 billion for the M50 toll in the past nine years. The commuter has paid for this infrastructure ten times over at this stage. The traffic congestion in our cities and towns is an absolute disgrace and people are now paying extra tolls for the joy of sitting in traffic for three hours. The Tánaiste said it was not the Government's responsibility. I understand that the Tánaiste, when he was Minister for Transport, was behind the development of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which is responsible for this through the Minister for Transport. The M50 and the East-Link bridge are the Government's infrastructure. It could scrap those tolls now if it wished.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">These toll increases and their scale are very unwelcome. I am not happy about them at all. The M50 toll bridge is in my constituency and many people travel north and south through it twice per day. I am not happy with the toll increases at all. It is a statutory function of TII, not a Government decision, but we will take it up with TII when it publishes the details of the proposal, as required by legislation. I do not want to make a promise I cannot keep but I want make it very clear this came as a surprise to Government - it certainly came as a surprise to me - and we are not happy about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_402">It has been reported that the Government is one of the leading voices seeking to exempt financial asset managers and institutional investors from the scope of the corporate sustainability and due diligence directive under discussion by the EU. This is highly significant because financial institutions, assets and institutional investments have some of the highest greenhouse gas emissions in the world. If the reports are true, this would be a retrograde step by the Government in a week when its Ministers are at COP27 to signal their support for climate action and tackling greenhouse gas emissions in the face of a global crisis. Is the Government seeking to exclude financial asset managers and institutional investors from the scope of the EU corporate sustainability and due diligence directive?</p>

          <p eId="para_404">The Government has a very strong ambition to decarbonise the taxi fleet and it has in place a grant for taxi drivers to do so. This week, however, many taxi drivers who have applied and were approved for the grant and placed orders for e-vehicles have received notification that the grant will be cancelled and they will have to reapply next February, and that is because the vehicle cannot be licensed in this calendar year. However, the Deputy will know there are significant delays in the supply of vehicles. It makes no sense for people who have applied once to have to apply again. Some of them are in contractual relationships to buy those cars and now they have no certainty around the grant. All of this is due to a detail within the Government scheme. I ask the Tánaiste to raise this with the Minister for Transport and do everything he can to put a bit of reality to a scheme that makes a very positive contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">That certainly sounds strange and I doubt it was what was intended. I will certainly take it up with the Department of Transport.

          <p eId="para_406">The HSE and the Department of Health management has eye-watering salaries and the perpetual luxury of learning lessons. In the week of Vicky Phelan's death we learned there has been no retrospective review of cervical slides for the past four years, despite recommendations to do so. This morning we learned that Tusla has spent €400,000 - nearly half a million - without tender, on a company managing information that is being withheld from the people it is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> The lessons supposedly being comfortably learned are being lived extremely painfully by the citizens. My young constituent, Jack, was hospitalised with Covid - the same infection - for the third time in Crumlin hospital. This young non-verbal boy with Down's syndrome and additional multiple needs was left on a trolley for two days and two nights. This is an unacceptable trauma for Jack and his mam, Aisling. It is hard to imagine we are doing trolley counts now in children's hospitals. Where is the infection control for a child with Covid on a trolley? How many other children were put at risk because Jack was treated so disgracefully? Spare us the comfy lessons. Where is the real action plan for a functioning health service in this Republic?</p>

          <p eId="para_408">I am very sorry to hear about the experience of Jack and Aisling, but we have done trolley counts in children's hospitals for a long time now, perhaps ten or 20 years. Thankfully, it is a much less common experience than in our adult hospitals but it happens in the winter period in particular. A new children's hospital is under construction and, in a few weeks' time, I will able to tell the Deputy that it will be open next year. I look forward to being able to say that and to see it happening. Contrary to what has been said, if you take the entire bed complement, including the day beds, there has been a significant increase in capacity. It will be in addition to the satellite units in Blanchardstown and Tallaght and will make a big difference for the better.</p>

        <speech by="#HelenMcEntee" as="#Minister_for_Justice" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Minister for Justice (Deputy Helen McEntee)<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_409">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. Community safety is about people being safe, and just as importantly, feeling safe. We want visitors to Dublin to be able to enjoy our vibrant, historic capital city. We want the people who live in it to experience it as a friendly, safe place to bring up their families and go about their lives. We want those who work in the city to have peace of mind that Dublin is a safe, welcoming place to do business. I think we all agree with those statements. To achieve this, it is vital that we have a shared approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> As Minister for Justice, I am acutely aware of the effect that crime and antisocial behaviour can have on the quality of life for all communities. As an individual, I am well aware of the impact that crime has on individuals. An Garda Síochána will always be there to respond to local concerns and high-visibility policing is key to ensuring everyone in our capital city feels safe and is safe. While policing is of course central to public safety, there are many other factors which contribute to people feeling safe as they live, work and visit Dublin. Building stronger, safer communities is a collective responsibility across all of Government, our local authorities and State agencies. On a practical level, it means having adequate public lighting and infrastructure and ensuring simple things, such as rubbish being collected regularly from our main thoroughfares. It means examining whether emergency services are appropriately located. I am aware that Dublin City Council is undertaking an audit of emergency services in the city centre, which is welcome. This collaborative approach is further reflected today by the participation of my Government colleagues from other Departments, including the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> Our community safety policy focuses Government services on prevention and early interventions. To be clear, we will always support communities and people who want and deserve to be safe on their streets. Communities which need our help will get it. People who deserve to be punished will be punished. The most effective way we can improve community safety over the longer term is through the empowerment of local communities, combined with support from the State. However, as Minister for Justice, I will always focus on resources and support An Garda Síochána to ensure we have a policing response in which people in Dublin have confidence. Along with the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, I regularly discuss and engage with the Garda Commissioner and his team on issues of safety, not just in Dublin but across the country. I have spoken with Angela Willis, assistant commissioner for the Dublin metropolitan region, about this issue in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> I have visited our front-line Garda stations such as Pearse Street and Store Street to hear the first-hand perspectives of gardaí there on their work and to thank them, because our gardaí do fantastic work, although they might not always get credit for it. I have also listened to and spoken to business owners and residents in Dublin city.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> A number of ongoing enforcement operations are in place that are aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour. As the House will be aware, Garda Operation Citizen commenced on 22 October 2021. Operation Citizen aims to reassure the public that Dublin is a safe place to live and work through high-visibility patrolling and community engagement. Operation Citizen achieves these aims through increased patrols of the city centre, including 100 Garda members patrolling each weekend evening. These increased patrols are supported by members from the Garda public order unit and other specialist units, specifically assigned to the city centre. There are also Garda members assigned specifically to patrol the River Liffey boardwalks and their environs at night.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> Operation Citizen is not an isolated response. It works in tandem with a number of different operations currently ongoing in the city centre. These include Operation Saul, which aims to provide a safer environment for commuters who are travelling in the Dublin metropolitan region, and Operation Spire, which is part of an ongoing strategy by gardaí in Store Street aimed at targeting anti-social behaviour and drug dealing on O'Connell Street. To support Operation Citizen further, a property located at 13A Upper O'Connell Street is currently being redeveloped as a Garda station to enhance the high-visibility policing service in Dublin city centre. The new station will have a public office for members of the public to seek support and report crimes and to provide support to victims of crime when they come in.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> It will serve as a hub which on-duty gardaí can report to directly without the need to return to their designated station, as well as being the parade location for Operation Citizen. It will be where members meet, go through what they will do for the day, and the place from which they go about the operation. This new station will increase the visible presence of An Garda Síochána on O'Connell Street and enhance the ability of the gardaí to respond efficiently to criminal activity. In advance of the completion of refurbishment works for the new station, a high-visibility Garda command vehicle has been placed on O'Connell Street and has been manned. Additionally, members assigned to Operation Citizen are proactively engaging with as many businesses operating in the city as possible each week.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> I believe the efforts of An Garda Síochána, supported by my Department, are having an effect. Since Operation Citizen started last year, more than 7,000 arrests have been made and over €6 million worth of suspected illegal drugs have been seized. I am pleased to note that in October 2022, Dublin city centre was awarded purple flag status. This award, which is an international accreditation, recognises Dublin's excellence in its management of the night-time economy. Dublin is one of 40 cities in Europe that have attained the purple flag status. Among the criteria considered in granting this award are crime rates and the willingness of people to go into the city centre after dark. It is a positive reflection on our city overall.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Protecting our communities and reducing anti-social behaviour is, as I have said, a priority for me and all of Government, so it requires a whole-of-Government response. A key part of this is the ongoing support of the Government for An Garda Síochána, including an unprecedented budget of €2.14 billion, which was allocated this year. This level of funding will support recruitment of up to 1,000 new Garda members and an additional 400 Garda staff in 2023. Coupled with further reassignments of gardaí to operational front-line policing and the continued roll-out of the new operational model, with its focus on community engagement, I am confident that An Garda Síochána will continue to protect communities, combat anti-social behaviour and help to ensure that Dublin's city centre remains a safe place for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> The most effective way that we can improve community safety over the longer term, as I mentioned, is through the empowerment of local communities, combined with support from the State. This is where community safety partnerships come into play. Our new local community safety partnerships will form a core part of how we implement this collective responsibility to make our communities safer for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">They provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns. Membership of the partnerships will be broader than that of the existing joint policing committees and will include residents, community representatives, business and education sector representation, relevant public services including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda Síochána and local authorities, as well as members of the local council. Three pilot local community safety partnerships have been established, as well as the Drogheda implementation board that followed on from the north inner city task force. We have independent chairs and full-time co-ordinators appointed to each of the pilots, including in Dublin's north inner city. Each partnership is in its first year of operation and is currently undertaking engagement work with the local communities in its area. In Longford the partnership's plan is already published and in the inner city and Waterford, the partnerships are moving in that direction. They have started much of the work and put a lot of plans in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> The safety needs of every community are different and those who understand those needs best are the community themselves. This morning I was just outside Dundalk, where all the community safety partnerships, combined with those already in operation in the North, as well as the Drogheda implementation board, came together for the first time to share their knowledge and experience. It is clear the model we are putting in place and the one already in place in the North is working. It is very effective and brings communities together, while addressing the fact each community is different and requires a different response. That it is supported by Government is an important part of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> Another key support from my Department that will support these partnerships is the community safety innovation fund, CSIF. Launched in April, the fund redirects money that is the proceeds of crime, having been seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau and others. This was called for for some time. My colleagues, Deputies Richmond and O'Dowd, along with many of our local councillors and a former chief superintendent in Louth, Christy Mangan, have consistently called for money that has been taken from criminals to go directly back into communities so we can show there is a direct link between the seizure of proceeds of crime and improving community safety outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Last month, I announced the allocation of funding for 22 projects under the CSIF. The interest in the fund was even better than we could have anticipated. We received 124 applications from groups in our communities that want to make a real difference and are working on new and innovative ways to protect and improve their local areas. Based on the high quality of proposals received, I believe the successful projects have the potential to have a real impact on their respective communities. Where these projects work, I want them to be replicated in other communities across the country. I encourage those who did not receive funding this year to apply again. The budget has gone from €2 million to €3 million for next year and I intend for that funding to continue to increase. I am especially pleased to note six innovation projects in the Dublin region received funding this year, including the community safety wardens project around Wolfe Tone Square in Dublin's north inner city, and a number of projects focusing on improving outcomes for young people. In addition, a proposal to extend the community safety wardens proposal to cover O'Connell Street and surrounding areas is currently being finalised and this will be expanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Youth justice is about ensuring we can support and work with our young people and trying to put resources in place before things get to an even more difficult situation where prison is often the only resort. Improving outcomes for our young people and diverting those most at risk away from crime must be a key response to antisocial behaviour in Dublin and across the country. An additional allocation of €6.7 million was provided in budget 2022 and another €2.5 million in 2023 to ensure the delivery of key objectives in the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027, in particular the expansion and deepening of the services offered to young people by the youth diversion projects, which are fully funded by my Department. These projects provide an invaluable support to complement the work of An Garda Síochána in addressing youth crime and also protecting local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> I commend the outstanding work of An Garda Síochána in supporting our young people by working with the youth diversion projects, as well as all the teams in those projects across the country. In one example of this, An Garda Síochána, in association with the FAI and local authorities, runs the late night soccer league programme in the Dublin metropolitan region. It is a diversionary programme incorporating soccer leagues at various locations across Dublin and is aimed at encouraging at-risk young people to participate in meaningful activities, thereby reducing antisocial behaviour involving young people in disadvantaged areas. It also gives young people something to do, which is so often why people turn to crime. The initiative is based around the concept of using football as a tool for social inclusion and learning and is just one example of the many ongoing efforts by An Garda Síochána to reduce antisocial behaviour and to protect our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> A total allocation of €23.8 million provided in this year's budget to youth justice services will allow for continued good work in this field that is backed by evidence-based policy and practice. In line with the principles underpinning the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027, the significant increase in youth justice funding will be deployed with the assistance of the best available research and expert evidence. In the Department we are investing in ensuring any policy, programme or plan we roll out is underpinned by evidence and that it will have the effect and bring about the change we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> I am conscious a number of communities have been affected by antisocial behaviour and there were incidents in the Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot areas earlier in the year. Local Garda management immediately enhanced the high-visibility policing presence, together with the support and assistance of the Garda public order unit over the course of a number of weekends. This high-visibility policing has continued to date. However, the response should not just be about policing. Having visited the area and spoken to community workers and others, they are looking for a holistic and co-ordinated community safety-style approach. That is what is being worked on and it will be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> As the Garda Commissioner has stated, accommodation is a crucial element of facilitating policing activities and we must further future-proof in this area. It is for this reason An Garda Síochána continue to engage with the Office of Public Works, OPW, on capital and maintenance work across Ireland. While still under discussion, this includes what the Commissioner has referred to as an exciting development of a substantial new Garda station and facilities on Dublin City Council lands at the comer of the R139 and the Malahide Road at Northern Cross. I am also pleased to say the new Garda building on Military Road will open in the coming weeks. The completed building will represent a major investment in policing from the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, as well as an investment in our city centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I reiterate that combating antisocial behaviour and keeping communities safe, particularly with regard to Dublin city centre, encompasses the work of multiple Departments and State agencies. My Government colleagues will outline throughout the debate the ongoing work of their Departments in this area and I am glad to be here with them today to reaffirm the Government's commitment to this issue. My Department will always support An Garda Síochána and all the justice agencies to make Dublin city centre safe for all. We will work with all colleagues in this House because we all have the same objective of reaching this goal.</p>

        <speech by="#MalcolmNoonan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Housing,_Local_Government_and_Heritage" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Malcolm Noonan)<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_429">On behalf of my colleagues, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the important issue of our capital city.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> I wish to inform the House of my Department's policy initiatives in Dublin city, including local authority funding, emergency services and housing. Like all local authorities, Dublin City Council is an independent statutory body with reserved functions vested in its elected members, and the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary to carry out those functions are the responsibility of its chief executive. Nonetheless, much of what I have to say refers to the excellent work of Dublin City Council. The national planning framework sets out a vision and strategy for Ireland in 2040 and acknowledges the importance of communities. It seeks to achieve more regionally-balanced urban and compact growth and recognises the critical role to be played by Dublin and other cities. Ireland performs well in the areas of economic outlook and stability but less so in those of quality of life and environmental performance. Dublin ranks outside the top 30 cities in the world for livability. I acknowledge there is much to do and wish to share some of the work being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> My Department provided €737 million in 2020, €724 million in 2021 and over €305 million to the end of August 2022 to Dublin City Council. This includes unprecedented support provided during the Covid-19 pandemic, including €260 million in respect of a rates waiver 2020 and 2021 and €54 million for Covid-related extra costs and lost income. For 2023, the Government is allocating €421 million to support local authorities to meet additional pay costs arising specifically as a result of the pay agreements and the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI. This will ensure they have the necessary resources to provide essential public services. In fact, local authorities provide in excess of 1,000 services. The additional pay allocation for Dublin City Council for 2022 is over €46 million and this will rise to over €62 million in 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> My Department is very aware of the pressures of inflation and rising energy costs on local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">We negotiated an additional €60 million supplementary support for the local government sector, with a provisional allocation for Dublin City Council of €5 million. </p>
          <p eId="para_434"> As committed to in the programme for Government, the move to 100% retention of the local property tax, LPT, will take place in 2023. For Dublin City Council, this will mean a surplus above its funding baseline, a greater proportion of which will be available to it in 2023. A comprehensive review of the current LPT baselines is to start in the coming months, including the overall funding position of Dublin City Council and other local authorities. </p>
          <p eId="para_435"> The council provides a number of emergency services, Dublin Fire Brigade being chief among them. It provides fire and rescue services to the four Dublin local authorities and an ambulance service on behalf of the HSE. Dublin Fire Brigade saves lives but also prevents damage to residential and commercial property daily. It serves a population of nearly 1.5 million people across 14 fire stations and has a staff of almost 1,000. Over the recent Hallowe'en period it received 234 calls which 169 related to bonfires during Hallowe'en. A campaign to target stockpiles of bonfire materials contributed to lowering the number of incidents. Local authorities have a budget of approximately €240 million annually for fire services. Additional support for development and maintenance comes from my Department’s capital programme. </p>
          <p eId="para_436"> The requirements of Dublin are somewhat unique and we are evaluating funding needs over the coming years. Dublin will receive money for appliances and for equipment and will benefit from the significant investment in communications infrastructure and training, with €27.7 million allocated to maintaining its fleet. The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department is working closely with Dublin City Council on new stations at North Strand and in west Dublin, with funding identified within the capital programme. The directorate issues an annual training programme which supports the delivery of effective services and provides standards and guidance on managing operational activities, including firefighting in high-rise buildings. Covid-19 presented challenges to recruiting and training new staff in Dublin. A plan was developed to increase the numbers across ranks and implementation has commenced. Some 108 recruits entered service in 2022 with 96 projected for next year. Dublin Fire Brigade will seek to maintain a panel of recruits to fill vacancies as they arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> Moving on to housing, Dublin Simon Community works with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive to provide outreach and engagement for adults who are sleeping rough. In the immediate term, more than 400 additional emergency accommodation beds are coming on stream in Dublin through a combination of new short-term leasing arrangements, the opening of a new facility and the reopening of a facility that was temporarily closed for essential works. Over half of these beds will be operational in the coming weeks and the remainder will come on stream in subsequent months. The Dublin Region Homeless Executive is entering into a leasing arrangement to secure the ongoing and inclusive use of a further 415 beds. The executive also recently activated its cold-weather strategy for 2022-2023 in the Dublin region.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> Housing First is a key response to ending long-term homelessness among those with complex health and mental health needs. It provides the most vulnerable with a home for life, as well as wraparound supports. There are more than 420 individuals in a Housing First tenancy in the Dublin region. Over 700 new tenancies will be delivered under the new Housing First national implementation plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> The housing assistance payment, HAP, discretion rate has been increased for all local authorities and this will secure tenancies to protect more families from homelessness. Measures under recently enacted legislation defer no-fault tenancy terminations until after March 2023, protecting renters who would otherwise face homelessness this winter. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, has made it clear to local authorities that if tenants risk being made homeless due to a landlord selling the property, my Department will support the local authority to purchase the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> With funding of over €4 billion, Housing for All aims to address social, affordable and private housing provision by increasing supply and thereby improving access to affordable rental homes. The Government is committed to building an average of 33,000 homes annually over the plan’s lifetime. The plan commits to building more than 9,000 social homes next year. It includes programmes for compulsory purchase of vacant properties, removing disincentives to selling or renting unused homes and imposing levies on vacant and derelict sites. Affordability measures are taking effect and a review of the planning system is almost complete. The Government has extended the first phase of Project Tosaigh, which is helping to create affordable and social housing out of other construction projects that cannot be completed as originally planned.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> The Croí Cónaithe scheme has allocated €450 million until 2026 for the delivery of up to 5,000 apartments in our cities. Part of the Croí Cónaithe fund, namely, the vacant property refurbishment grant, is designed to boost home ownership in urban centres supporting people to refurbish vacant and derelict properties as housing, with grants of up to €50,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> The living city initiative targets historic inner city areas and aims to regenerate heritage sites by offering income or corporation tax relief. The initiative aims to increase the supply of residential units in the market, while maintaining our historic buildings and creating more vibrant cities. The urban regeneration and development fund aims to deliver more compact sustainable development in Dublin with part-funding of regeneration and rejuvenation. By increasing residential and mixed-use development in the city; it will make Dublin a more attractive and vibrant city. My Department has allocated €2 billion in funding up to 2027 across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> The north inner city concept area is one of the eight regeneration projects in Dublin. Its goal is to achieve long-term sustainable regeneration around Smithfield and Parnell Square. The works include restoring heritage sites, promoting pedestrianisation and cycling, a new city library on Parnell Square and improving paving and street furniture. The restoration and interpretation of the Moore Street national monument by the National Monuments Service, NMS, and the OPW will further enhance the vibrancy of the city centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> Under the North East Inner City, NEIC, initiative, the Department of Rural and Community Development is providing €7.5 million towards the regeneration of this area in 2022 to help ensure that the recommendations of the Mulvey report are implemented. The programme implementation board is focusing work on six areas, namely, enhanced policing, maximising education, training and employment opportunities, family well-being, enhancing community well-being and the physical environment, substance use and misuse and inclusion health, together with the alignment of services. Capital projects which received Department of Rural and Community Development funding include the Rutland Street community hub, Diamond Park redevelopment, Charleville Mall Library, and the NEIC greening strategy implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> Finally, I will highlight just two initiatives administered by Dublin City Council and funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development. These are the community enhancement programme and the community activities fund. The community enhancement programme provides capital funding to community groups with 15 groups sharing over €200,000 in 2021. This money funds facility development in disadvantaged areas, typically by improving buildings, developing community amenities and purchasing equipment. This year the community activities fund provided over €400,000 to 61 priority target groups agreed by the Dublin city local community development committee. These non-profit voluntary groups tackle mental health challenges and isolation, in addition to issues facing Travellers, the Roma community, the long-term unemployed, new communities, parents and marginalised children. </p>
          <p eId="para_446"> There is so much more to discuss and we look forward to a very important debate on Dublin city.</p>

          <p eId="para_449"> Chathair ársa Bhaile Átha Cliath is ea mo chathair, agus cathair do bhreis is 1,250,000 daoine atá ina gcónaí ann. Rugadh agus tógadh sa chathair seo mé agus táim an-bhródúil gurbh as an chathair dom. Leis an méid sin ráite agam, tá fadhbanna bunúsacha sa chathair nach bhfuil an Rialtas láir ag tabhairt fúthu agus nach bhfuil de chumhacht nó d’acmhainn ag Comhairle Cathrach Bhaile Átha Cliath nó ag na comhairlí eile atá timpeall uirthi tabhairt fúthu. </p>
          <p eId="para_450"> Is iad na fadhbanna is mó sa chathair seo ná fadhbanna coiriúlachta seachas na cinn atá in a lán ceantar eile maidir le seirbhísí agus a leithéid a dhéanaimid plé orthu go minic. Tá ceantair i mo dhúiche féin nach bhfuil páirc pheile acu cumadh, fiú amháin, agus gan soláthar ceart tithíochta a bheith acu don éileamh áitiúil atá ann. Tá fadhbanna acu le díol drugaí oscailte le breis agus 30 bliain i roinnt de na ceantair ina bhfuil mise i mo ionadaí orthu, mar aon leis an bochtanas leanúnach atá i gceist. Is é Baile Átha Cliath 8 an ceantar is mó turasóireachta in Éirinn. Cad iad na pictiúir a fheiceann an chosmhuintir gach uile lá agus na híomhánna a fheiceann turasóirí agus iad ag siúl tríd an gceantar seo timpeall ar Guinness, Cill Mhaighneann, nó a leithéid de cheantar? Feiceann siad daoine ar ísle brí, ag lorg deirce, iad siúd atá ar dhrugaí, iad ag siúl timpeall ar thámhnéal, ag déanamh caca ar thaobh an bhóthair nó ag sá snáthaid, mar fhaoiseamh, iontu féin í mbéal dorais fliuch. It is not just in Dublin 8 that there is the sight of those addicted to drugs gathering to score and to shoot up, to beg, plead, steal or whatever is possible to get the price of the next fix. They need help and not to be on the street.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">They need more rehab beds, supported accommodation, mental health interventions and more. More so, however, they, and we in this city, need the criminal drug gangs dealt with from the ground up and from the top down at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> Despite the success of An Garda Síochána, we need many more gardaí across the city, in our community, seen openly and on a much more permanent basis than has been the case for most of the years of my life in this city. They are needed in our tourist areas, where the crimes associated with drugs - open drug dealing, harassment of people, intimidation, thuggery and wanton destruction of property - take place. It is not just the tourist areas but every single area, in particular the working-class areas of the city. Those communities have been plagued by those who are involved in this. What message goes out to the youth if, for instance, Garda Síochána cars drive by when open drug dealing is happening? That happens day in, day out. Those Garda members know where it is happening. They know where cars are being robbed. That has happened continuously.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> I know that the Minister has said the Commissioner is taking a more proactive view on that. I have been around in this House for over 20 years and I have heard that day in, day out. It is not happening quickly enough and not happening continuously and, because of that, we are left with continued fear of crime. People cry to me in my office continuously and go home at night and hope that they can close the door and that the thuggish elements outside will not come into their homes in whatever way. The advice to those who have had threats made against them because of a son's or other relative's drug debt is to pay up. That is the advice not from me but from gardaí on the beat and elsewhere. What type of message goes out when An Garda Síochána will not go into an area without the armed response unit or the public order unit?</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> The reason that this has happened at this scale in Cherry Orchard and places like it is that those places have been ignored for too long. I acknowledge that the Minister and many other Ministers have come to Cherry Orchard since the incident in which two gardaí got injured in an attack involving another car. That should not have happened. It would not have happened, I believe, if action had been taken when those cars were being taken week in, week out, and were burned in the exact same place. At least now people are starting to listen and to pay heed. I welcome the Minister's interest. I just hope that this is not one of those times when An Garda Síochána starts off but does not deliver on what it has promised.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denise Mitchell<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_455">The austerity years saw previous Governments introduce devastating cuts to vital services, which left many communities across this city feeling like they had to fend for themselves. The fallout from cutbacks in Garda numbers can be seen on our streets. Although Garda staffing has been restored to close to the levels we had in 2008, gardaí are still not visible in our communities. Those numbers have begun to drop again, with the latest Garda figures now showing we have 200 fewer gardaí than we had in 2020. The day-to-day experience of those seeking help from the Garda is that complaints are not followed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> The recent scenes in Cherry Orchard were a reality check for some, but it is only because they were caught on video that they got so much attention. They are an example of what residents in communities in Dublin have to put up with. Such scenes of antisocial behaviour are not uncommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> We all have the right to feel safe in our communities, and residents have the right to expect protection from the Garda when gangs run riot in robbed cars, intimidate residents and openly sell drugs on our streets. Many residents in my community feel like prisoners in their own homes, which is simply not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> According to the figures on the Department of Justice website, there are roughly 150 fewer gardaí in Dublin this year than there were at the end of 2020. This has an impact on the city centre. Talbot Street and North Earl Street are two streets that come to mind where open dealing is seen. That area is derelict. It has shuttered and closed up shops dotted around it and really needs regeneration.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> The latest "RTÉ Investigates" piece shone a light on how O'Connell Street has become extremely neglected. It is heartbreaking to see the once vibrant city centre being allowed to rot. It is time we restored some life into this city in the form of a living city, with a spirit at the heart of it. We need to look at how we start attracting small and medium-sized businesses back into the city so we do not see all these shuttered shopfronts everywhere we turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> There are so many galleries, museums and other cultural hubs throughout Dublin, leaving people with a real sense of the history and culture of the place. However, there is no doubt but that we could do more to promote both Irish culture and other cultures that have emerged in Dublin in recent decades. The plans to demolish the Cobblestone were a recent example of how much those seeking to develop our city could not care less about the significance of cultural hot spots. Those plans led to demonstrations, and people showed their disgust at the proposals put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> We in Sinn Féin have long argued that Moore Street be turned into a historical quarter that showcases the rich history of the area and commemorates the men and women who fought and died in the area during the 1916 Rising. It would make economic sense, would give the area a face-lift and would be a huge attraction to tourists.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Dublin city is crying out for leadership in respect of the use of public spaces, forward planning and general regeneration that is so badly needed. While we await the report of the citizens' assembly and the result of any vote that may follow, it seems to me that a directly elected mayor for Dublin could be a breath of fresh air if we do it right. The office of the mayor would need to be resourced from central government. A mayor would provide an element of accountability in how our city is run. We need to look at how we make the city more affordable and accessible for the younger generations living in it. We need to make it warm and inviting for them to socialise in it. It is their city too, and we should all aim to pass on to them a city of which we, the people of Dublin, can be proud.</p>

        <speech by="#LouiseOReilly" eId="spk_229">
          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_463">I was just thinking, before getting to speak, that I have lived in Dublin for most of my life: I was born in Dublin 10, I have lived in Dublin 8, Dublin 6, Dublin 7, Dublin 1, Dublin 18 and Dublin 12, and now I live in County Dublin. I know my city and my county very well. I am very lucky to be from Dublin and to live in Dublin. It is and should be a great place to live, to work, to do business, to rear kids - all the stuff we expect and we should demand of our Government to provide for our capital city and county.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> Like many cities, towns and villages, Dublin city has fallen into a state of disrepair, and nobody could dispute that. Anyone who walks around the city can see it. It has lacked care and attention from successive Governments for years, while at the same time it has been subjected to some atrocious policy decisions on the part of senior management in Dublin City Council. If you walk around the city, you will see disrepair and neglect at nearly every street corner. The men and women who clean the city get up early in the morning. They are the people the Minister's boss is so very fond of. They get up very early in the morning and work really hard. However, they are dealing with understaffing and those atrocious policy decisions and trying to navigate around what is, quite frankly, a disturbing and confusing array of signposts, electrical boxes and other bits and pieces on the street. It makes it tough for people who are visually impaired to get around and tough for people who are trying to keep the city clean.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The proliferation of poles and signposts in Dublin city makes tourists ask why we have a city that looks this way. Part of that is due to the decisions made by Dublin City Council and the neglect of successive Governments. There is hardly anywhere to sit. There are very few public toilets and very few bins. It is actually embarrassing at times. </p>
          <p eId="para_466"> There is a more sinister element, however, to which my colleagues have referred. There is open drug dealing in our capital city and in the suburbs and the county. Open drug dealing is to be seen on O'Connell Street, Talbot Street, North Earl Street and Henry Street. It is incredibly off-putting. People do not feel safe. When the sun goes down in Dublin city centre, people do not feel safe and that is wrong. Vulnerable people, people with disabilities, members of minority groups, migrants and members of the LGBTIQ+ community have reported a marked increase in hate crimes, including gender-based violence, homophobic and racist attacks. In addition many people do not feel safe on public transport. I was interested to hear backbenchers from the two Government parties in the run-up to the budget and immediately following it saying they wanted to see a dedicated transport police service but it was not in the budget. They talked about it but no funding was in the budget. We need to have a look at how we can make public transport safe. The recent news that the tolls are going up should encourage people to use public transport but they will not use it if it is not safe. Nobody is going to get on the bus, DART or Luas unless they feel safe. That requires a dedicated Garda presence. For many years we have called for a plan to reimagine and repurpose Dublin city and for similar plans to be delivered for towns and cities throughout the country. I call on the Government to stop using the changing retail landscape as an excuse to do nothing. I have raised this with the Tánaiste. When we see the shuttered shops, the former Debenhams and such places, he just shrugs and says people are changing and retail is changing. People are going online. He leaves it at that. That is not right. </p>
          <p eId="para_467"> We should fight for our capital city. We should fight to ensure that we have shops and businesses and that people have a reason to come into town. We need to get people back into town by offering them a better experience. We have to make people want to spend time in our towns and cities and not just to spend money. Yes, people should spend money but should want to come into town to dwell, to be in town, to soak up the atmosphere and the culture, to see the sights and to want to be there. They will of course spend money; we know that. We need to ensure that Dublin city offers people a great experience, which means a relaxed atmosphere, pedestrianised streets through which to stroll peacefully and look in shop windows. We need a visible Garda presence, clean roads and footpaths. We need public toilets, bins and seats, all of the things that come together to make our capital city a place where people actively want to be. We need outdoor dining and drinking spaces, true public spaces where people can relax, outdoor and indoor markets and public spaces for arts and culture. We need public toilets, a vibrant night-time economy and we need to make sure our towns and cities cater for those who live there. If we make Dublin city an enjoyable and exciting place, more people will be willing to visit more often and spend more time there. There is a great deal of scope here to reimagine and repurpose Dublin city for the communities who live, work and spend time there. Otherwise all that will be left will be novelty leprechaun shops, burrito bars and hotels, lots and lots of them. What we need are homes that are affordable for working people to be able to rent and buy so that they can live in Dublin city, so that it is not closed off to them, so that they can make a life in Dublin city and raise their kids in Dublin city in safety. </p>

That is a fact. We need to see the conditions created to enable people to raise their kids in safety, build a life for themselves and ensure that Dublin city is a place where people want to be because it is a fantastic place to live. It is a brilliant place to bring up kids. It is a wonderful place in which to do business. However, all of that is at risk. We need investment and we need it badly.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">The recent RTÉ programme on O'Connell Street and the videos emerging from Cherry Orchard put a spotlight on policing, drug misuse, open drug-dealing and general antisocial behaviour There is also a growing feeling that the public transport system in some areas of Dublin is not safe for either passengers or staff. On a weekly basis, we hear of buses terminating before the final stop because it is not safe to drive into some estates due to antisocial behaviour. As well as leaving residents, commuters and visitors feeling nervous, this puts already stretched members of the Garda under huge pressure. Every week in this Chamber we hear that for us to reach our climate goals, we need to massively increase public transport infrastructure. We need more buses and trains. To encourage people to make the switch from cars it must be affordable but a fundamental piece of the jigsaw is also that it is safe, that there is security on our buses, trams and trains in the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> Open drug use and dealing is a common sight in the city and suburbs and on public transport, as well as disturbing levels of antisocial behaviour and violence. Everyone should be and feel safe on our public transport. Sinn Féin has consistently called for the establishment of a dedicated public transport police unit to address antisocial behaviour and other criminal activity on public transport and at transport hubs. The negligence of the Government properly to resource An Garda Síochána to tackle these issues is a major concern. In 2016 I read a report on a retired garda, Trevor Laffan, who said “I was a garda for 35 years and I can tell you community policing has been destroyed”. That is a strong statement from a former garda who was passionate about community policing and its benefits to both the Garda and the community. In Dublin 15 we have a dedicated and hard-working community policing unit. However it is in no way near to being properly resourced in terms of personnel needed. Dublin 15 and Dublin 7 are some of the most diverse and fast-growing urban areas in the State. We have one Garda station. Limerick has three. We have one third of the Garda personnel that Limerick has and yet we both have similar populations. In fact, Dublin 15 has now increased to about 110,000 and Limerick is just below 100,000. Since 2018, we have seen a decrease of 168 gardaí deployed to a public order unit. In terms of overall policing, while the numbers of members has been climbing slowly since Templemore was reopened, a significant number of new Garda members leave annually. This trend, together with retirements, is placing massive pressure on those who remain. This is of great concern. I have spoken first-hand to members of the force who cited issues with retention, recruitment and dissatisfaction with these new proposed rotas and conditions. I raised this with our local superintendent at our joint policing committee, JPC, in the Crowne Plaza, who admitted that retention is increasingly becoming a problem with an alarming number of new recruits leaving the force. It is such a concern that steps are being taken to look at why people who have only joined, that is, newly-trained people, are leaving.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> We cannot and must not talk about policing in isolation. We cannot talk about community safety in isolation. To do so is to ensure that we continue to stick a plaster over the problems of disadvantage, poverty, drug misuse, addiction, violence and trauma. There has been an abject failure of successive Governments to tackle the root causes of crime, antisocial behaviour and drug misuse. Those of us who have worked in the community for decades have seen brilliant and effective holistic wraparound drug and misuse addiction services, early intervention initiatives, plans and strategies among a myriad of other measures starved of funding and decimated by cuts, as well as a refusal to properly fund them into the future. We have seen community services and activists isolated, ignored, minimised and dismissed by people in the HSE and particularly those in the national drugs task force. In 2019, all of the country’s former Ministers of State with responsibility for the national drug strategy united to call on the Government to restore confidence in the national drug strategy, particularly because the partnership approach which underpins the strategy was in danger of collapse. My recent conversations and work on the ground show that very little has changed since then. A county-wide project aimed at tackling crime, drug misuse and criminal and antisocial behaviour needs a multifaceted approach that has the funds to match its ambition of creating a safer Dublin. A Dublin mayor could be well placed to lead it. </p>
          <p eId="para_474">Sinn Féin in government would stand up for communities to ensure they have a real say and a voice in a community that targeted education programmes like school completion, youth drug and alcohol services, counselling services, child and adolescent mental health services and community gardaí with adequate resources so people can live and work in a city they feel safe in.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">I thank the Minister for her presentation, for her presence and for her interest in this issue. I am from Dublin. I love the city, I believe in it and I want to see a vision for it. Dublin city houses people from all over the world and, indeed, people from all over this country. On that note, may I state my disgust at any Member of this House suggesting that this country or any part of this country is being overrun by anybody. I think that if a Member of this Oireachtas comes in and makes statements like that, we have to challenge them at all times. Dublin city is a much more vibrant, colourful, exciting and culturally rich city than the city I grew up in and we need to stand by that and defend that.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> We need to have a 20-year vision for what we want Dublin city to look like. When I mention Dublin city, I am talking about the city between the canals. It is about what kind of transport we expect to have and what we want the city to feel like. I think we have to de-car the city; we have to pedestrianise the city radically. I have a four-year-old daughter and, I have to be honest, when I go into Dublin city with my daughter, I am constantly on watch for her safety because of the nature of how we have given over the city to the private car. If people go in with their elderly relatives, they feel the same thing. Why do we not have a radical approach to O'Connell Street and pedestrianise it? Why do we not turn O'Connell Street into the big civic plaza that this city needs? I know Dublin Bus will have strong opinions about that, and we can talk about that and maybe we can only pedestrianise one side of it, but we certainly need to reclaim parts of the city that have been given over to cars and to recast our brains as to how we can enjoy the city more.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> With regard to Culture Night in Dublin city, we should have a feeling like that at least every weekend. It should feel like a vibrant, culturally rich place where people want to be and want to be around, walk around, bump into each other and communicate with each other and have those human interactions. We should not just have that feeling once a year. It should be a weekly thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> The Minister mentioned football. I am fascinated by her comments about what is happening in terms of integrating young people and empowering young people. If we go to any city in Europe as a football fan, as I tend to do, we see that football tends to be one of the ways that a city expresses itself. When we come to Dublin city, the football grounds are falling down. There are conversations around Tolka Park, conversations around Dalymount Park, conversations around Richmond Park, all in the city centre area, all League of Ireland premier league grounds. There should be investment in and understanding of that type of city that believes in that football culture, not just once-off glamorous announcements about Euro 2028 coming to town, which is fine. However, that always replaces the potential we could have for big European clubs to come here all the time if our league was invested in better, because of a better experience of going to a League of Ireland ground, because of a professional women's league, because we have players here who are going to the World Cup and who are playing in that league. This is the sort of basic thing that every other city in Europe takes for granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> The Minister talked about policing. We cannot police our way out of this. We have to address, as has been suggested, the underlying issues of housing, poverty, disadvantage and drugs. I see the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is present. It is a scandal that the injecting centre has not been up and running since it was passed by these Houses in 2017. It is an incredible failure of the imagination of this Government to make it happen. I say that directly to the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, because there could have been an imaginative approach to how we can stop people dying in alleyways in our city centre. Other European countries and cities across Canada and Australia have made these interventions because they believe in their city and they understand their city. Yet, even though legislation has been passed for the last five years, we waited for a High Court case and we did not have a contingency plan. We could have a mobile clinic or we could have a mobile intervention - we could have done something – but, no, we have just left the situation to persist and people are still dying in the alleyways of our city centre. We are letting it happen because, fundamentally, they are not important enough and if they do not overdose fatally, they leave a lot of the drug litter behind them and there could be excrement involved - it is a pretty unsightly experience for everybody. These interventions are important. It sometimes seems as if the Government is waiting for something else to happen or for somebody else to make it happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> There are some practical suggestions. We need a task force of sorts to look at five, ten, 15 or 20 years hence. We need to talk radically about pedestrianisation and we need to talk radically about the need to de-car the city. People will complain about that but we have to do it. We need to talk radically about making public transport free, so people can hop on a free bus in Dublin, hop on a free train in Dublin, hop on the Luas in Dublin for free, for all of those opportunities that people want to have of coming into the city centre and enjoying a cultural experience and it being free because we have invested in Dublin city in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> On policing, we absolutely need a sense of security in our city centre but it is as if it is the go-to political response that we always say "more gardaí". Yes, we will always need more gardaí and there will never be enough gardaí, but we have to make the city policeable. If we have that volume of people who are in the city enjoying themselves and believing in the city, crime goes down not because there are gardaí everywhere, but because people feel prouder of it, they feel part of it, they feel connected to it and they feel respected by it. I taught in a part of the north inner-city and the kids would say they did not feel respected when they walked outside their own area, and if they walked into a shop they would get followed because of how they speak, how they dress or the address they are from. We need to respect this city and the people from the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> People talk about resources. I would make this bald point, and I direct this at the Minister’s party colleagues who sit on Dublin City Council and, indeed, many party groups on Dublin City Council who consistently, every year, cut the funding through the local property tax, some €12 million, that could be available to do all of the things that people in this Chamber are now complaining about. Every year, consistently, some groups in the city council, including the Minister’s group, cut the funding to Dublin City Council. We cannot complain about lack of resources, lack of bins, lack of infrastructure, lack of Dublin City Council resources, if consistently, every single year, political parties in the chamber of Dublin City Council, having the opportunity to stand up for the city, do the populist thing and cut the property tax by 15%.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> In saying all of that, I feel that, as others have said, the potential for a directly elected mayor of the city would give the civic leadership that has been lacking. I know there has been a citizens’ assembly on that and we want to see movement on it, and the Labour Party is supportive of that role. If we had that civic leadership, we would have buy-in to a long-term vision for the city. Let us be honest, the mayor is somebody who is in for a year and out after a year and does not really have an awful lot of power as all of the power is with the city manager or the CEO of the city council. There is a democratic deficit and the mayor's role has been reduced to being somebody who maybe gives moral authority to a cause or gives a level of civic leadership, but does not have the five-year term of office with the powers that are necessary in order to drive real change or accountability. For example, when the issue comes up about O’Connell Street, who is the obvious political leader to go to? Who is the obvious person who is going to feel responsible for this? Is it the Minister for Justice, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications or somebody else? There could even potentially be justification for a junior Minister for Dublin. We have junior Ministers for everything else so that could be something the Government could consider as well and it could work on a national level with the local city council.</p>

          <p eId="para_486"> We need to think strategically and have a vision for what we want the city to be like in 20 years.

When it comes to basic infrastructure, I mentioned football because I have an interest in it. That suggestion is something the Minister should take seriously. Every other city in Europe has it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_487">We all have a vision of the Dublin we would like to see. It needs to be a safe place. I have never been frightened to go into any area of the city, but I know other people who have been frightened to do so. I know people who are terrified in their own homes every night of the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> It also needs to be a place in which ordinary people can afford to live. I do not think any other speakers touched on that. If we are talking about the future of Dublin, it has to be a place for everyone, not just an elite few who have a lot of money. It has to be an inclusive place, regardless of colour, creed or sexual preference. It should not be a city where there is a divide between the haves and the have-nots. I spoke earlier in the week about how Dublin has grown. It is a city of well over 1 million people. Buildings are getting higher and the population density is increasing. Successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments have prioritised economic growth in the city and its surrounding areas. That has driven population growth and migration to the area. However, those Governments have also presided over a system that has resulted in it not being affordable for ordinary people to live in Dublin, and that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Emergency services have not experienced the same level of investment or growth. In many cases, it has been the opposite. The current state of emergency services in the capital is not adequate for the population. The fire brigade is crying out for support in the middle of a staffing crisis. Ambulances with seriously ill patients in the back of them are waiting outside hospitals. Many community gardaí are treated like supersubs. They are used for everything, such as duties outside embassies or at concerts. They plug the gaps all the time, but that increasingly takes them away from the communities with which they should be working in order to build relationships. Speaking about the way in which the Defence Forces have been decimated would take more time than I have here today. Dublin Fire Brigade has been highlighting severe understaffing. The House discussed that issue last night. There has been Government inaction for years. Staff shortages such as those being experienced by the fire service and other emergency front-line services are further proof that the Government is not serious about the safety of Dubliners. We need a fire service that has the equipment, staff, capacity and capability to respond to fires and all other potential incidents. We do not have that at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> At a meeting of the health committee yesterday, we were informed by the HSE that the percentage of Ireland's population comprising older people is rising faster than in any comparable country, which is great, but that information came in the context of dangerous overcrowding in hospitals and the inability of ambulances to discharge patients into the care of hospitals and then get back on the road to help those in need. Apparently, it takes more than an hour, on average, for ambulance crews to discharge patients and resume their duties. The HSE target is 13 minutes. I know of cases where ambulances have been outside hospitals all day. Two weeks ago, 11 ambulances were stuck outside Tallaght hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> Overt community policing is a very effective use of resources. Not only does it prevent criminal activity, it builds relationships with communities, young and old. Unfortunately, a lack of a police presence in some areas has emboldened a few people who now believe they have a space to do what they want. I regularly hear the same story from constituents - they have never before seen the current level of open drug dealing. If the Minister of State, speaks to anyone in my constituency, that is the message he will hear. Crack cocaine, with all the destruction it brings on individuals, families and communities, has now got a foothold in parts of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> If we are serious about safety in Dublin, we must recognise that the emergency services cannot cope with significant population increases without proper planning, supports and financial investment. There are small but effective actions we can take now while we recruit more emergency personnel and put policies in place to allow us to retain experienced members and crews. That must include improved pay and conditions. In policing, we need more overt patrols, the roll-out of body cameras to all gardaí, and a dedicated transport unit to safeguard commuters. Hospitals must be empowered to engage in proactive solutions such as the pathfinder service. The latter allows for people to be treated in their homes, thereby freeing up space in emergency departments. We must establish an Oireachtas committee to conduct a short and sharp review of how the national fire service is delivered across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> It the Government wants Dublin to be a safe place in which to work and raise a family in the future, it has to be affordable. Proactive measures must be put in place, and not just when the system breaks down under greater population pressure. There are solutions and approaches we can take that will improve people's lives overnight but we need to get the basics right.</p>

        <speech by="#NealeRichmond" eId="spk_237">
          <from>Deputy Neale Richmond<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_494">I greatly appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Such a debate has been requested multiple times by Deputies on all sides of the House, be it through parliamentary questions, Topical Issue matters, Questions on Policy or Legislation or Leaders' Questions. I hope the debate is being approached in a positive manner. Like most of the speakers so far, I love being from Dublin. That is something that those of us who are lucky enough to live in the capital, be that in the city or in the county, do not say enough. Whether we have been born here, brought up here or recently moved here to make a home or living, we sometimes get a little defensive and are not proud to say that being from Dublin is great. We are lucky to live in this capital city. It is one of the finest capital cities not just in Europe but in the world. Anyone who has travelled across the world will have noticed that Dublin holds its own consistently in many areas beyond the economic. In social and cultural contexts it is a European and global leader. That should be the basis for this timely and important debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> Our capital is far from perfect. There are glaring issues that need attention. There is political difference on some of those issues, and that is understandable, but on others I like to think that, regardless of the party banner or label we attach to ourselves, there is a collective resolve and a relative agreement on them. Deputy Ó Ríordáin hates when I agree with him but a couple of the points he made were bang on. They are issues about which I have spoken for a long time and in respect of which I encountered push back, be that from officials or colleagues in my party or other parties. The notion of junior Minister for Dublin is not an absurd one. We see it in countries across the EU, where there is an obvious need to prioritise the capital city from a local government and administrative perspective and that fuels the economic, social, cultural and community growth of that capital. It is a responsible role, one that has been taken on enthusiastically in EU member states, and should not be dismissed out of hand. It merits consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> In due course, I will stray into the policy fields that are the responsibility of the Minister of State and the Minister, who has just left the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> There is significant merit in the idea of public realms and increased pedestrianisation, not just in city centre areas such as that represented by Deputy Gannon, but also in county boroughs and villages - the sort of places Deputies Paul Donnelly and Ellis and I represent. Through the pandemic, we saw how transformative they were and how they were embraced. There is a need for central government to work with officialdom in local authorities to embrace the vision and enthusiasm not just of elected city and county councillors but also the traders' groups and community groups who want to see an increased focus on pedestrianisation, particularly in the city centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> Although I represent and live in a suburban constituency, this is as much my capital city as it is the capital city of someone like Deputy Gannon, who represents an area in the heart of the city, or someone such as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who represents a constituency far from Dublin, although it is not quite as far away as the constituencies of the Minister of State and Deputy Martin Kenny. It is something of which everyone who lives in the State has ownership. We all have an enthusiasm to see our capital thrive in every indicator. People have pointed out obvious concerns but increased pedestrianisation and the real concept of public realm, such as the partial or full pedestrianisation of O'Connell Street, is one area unrelated to justice that would have a significant impact on many, not just those who live and work in the close environs.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> Other matters have consistently been raised that have not been pursued, for example, the notion of more open-air public swimming facilities. We obviously have Dublin Bay, which is wonderful, stretching along the coast, but the idea of a public lido in the north inner city, which has been proposed, is an obvious amenity that will not just serve the immediate community. We see how it works in the parks and boroughs of London, and how it can be such an addition to communities for 12 months of the year. There is also the increased support for plans that are in place, that have been funded but that need to come to fruition, namely, those relating to public libraries, cultural amenities and the much-lamented sports grounds, especially in the context of association football, where there is a significant issue with crumbling stadia and the inability to get key co-operation for an entire area. That kind of top-level stuff we all see and enjoy on a daily basis is very obvious.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> What we are talking about, however - and the main reason this debate was sought - are the genuine concerns regarding public safety and public order in our capital. Many different incidents have gone viral on social media and have been well reported in the print and broadcast media, as well as being raised in the House, either directly or anecdotally, by Deputies from all parties and none. What this has to come back to - and it is the biggest issue in addressing this problem - is calculated investment in our communities, especially those that suffer the most, not just from small-scale criminality but also from what is clearly organised crime. That is why I appreciated the remarks of the Minister on the new community safety innovation fund established under her Department thanks to funding from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In its first year of operation, €2 million was invested. We have seen that allocated to very worthwhile projects throughout the country, including more than €250,000 in the Dublin Central constituency, rising to €3 million in this year's budget, which is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> The clarity I must request, however - this is not directed to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, but more to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, or whomever holds that office in due course - relates to the fact that in 2021, An Garda Síochána, not the Criminal Assets Bureau, seized €16 million in cash from criminals. I appreciate that the pandemic allowed for a level of policing and a level of return on policing in the context of cash, drugs and contraband seizures that were of a much larger scale, but that €16 million has to be ring-fenced in its entirety and ploughed back into communities because it was not an anomaly. We consistently saw in the years prior to 2021 seizures of €9 million, €7 million, €7.5 million and €8 million. The most recent seizure was somewhere in the region of €12 million. All that money has been taken away from the very individuals and the absolute thugs who run the gangs and try to ruin all our communities, be they in Dublin or beyond. That money needs to go back into those communities that are suffering from the preying figures of gangland individuals who are trying to get ten-year-olds to mule backpacks of drugs across an estate or slightly older people to take a gun or whatever into their hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> We see where that money can have a true impact on our communities. We see that youth diversion funding, thankfully, has gone up and been invested in the sorts of projects the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, regularly launches, speaks about and shows a genuine compassion for, including addiction treatment and drug diversion programmes. That is where we need to see that money going because that is the first stop. It is not the only solution, however. It will not make Dublin the safest capital city in the world overnight, but it will certainly have a significant impact. That is where we start. It is not necessary to have a political ideology of left, right or centre to recognise that genuine, co-ordinated, structured investment in communities is the first stop in any area and approach to a debate like this. When that sort of effort is made, it must be realised that it is only one strand. I imagine it is the most important, initial strand but it has to be done in tandem.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> As I said, Deputy Ó Ríordáin hates when I agree with him, so I will disagree with him on one point relating to policing. Policing has a massive part to play in the re-imagination and reinvigoration of our capital city, especially the streets in the inner city area of central Dublin as opposed to the areas of County Dublin that Deputy Paul Donnelly and I represent. We have seen success with Operation Citizen and the important role high-visibility policing has to play. Deputy Gannon held a public meeting on the subject of O'Connell Street, which is something he is extremely passionate about and has spoken about throughout his career long before being elected to the Dáil. I remember him speaking about it at Dublin City Council. Believe it or not, I was one of those people who tuned into other council meetings to hear what he, and Deputy McAuliffe, as Lord Mayor, said, largely to get ready to mark them in general election debates or whatever else. O'Connell Street is the main thoroughfare of our capital city. In many regards, it is the main street of our country, north, south, east and west. That is where the work must begin in having consistent and constant high-level policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> I absolutely welcome the announcement of a station for An Garda Síochána on O'Connell Street but the number of officers on the beat on O'Connell Street has to be drastically increased. We see where it has worked around the world, including Leicester Square and Times Square. We are very lucky to have the policing service we do in this State. It is very much a community-based policing service. Its members are not going around with machine guns looking to be intimidating spectres. The service seeks to provide that sense of safety and community outreach. We can be very proud of the work of An Garda Síochána and very glad there has been that increased level of determination when it comes to recruitment, not just of gardaí but of civilian staff. That is key. The 400 extra civilian staff that are being recruited should enable far more gardaí, be they newly attested from Templemore or moved from other districts, to get out on the beat in our city centre and our capital, particularly on O'Connell Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> In order to do that, we have to meet the aims of an additional 1,000 members of the force. That requires some real acknowledgement of issues, including rostering, pay, conditions, and investment in the equipment. When I refer to equipment, I do not mean handcuffs and uniforms; I am talking about ICT, internal servers and the vehicles and means of transportation which ensure we have what I fundamentally believe is one of the best police forces in the world in An Garda Síochána, and which enable its members to police in a manner that is community focused but is also specific, including ensuring O'Connell Street is a safe place to walk, shop and do business 24 hours a day.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> It is also about ensuring that the transport links that serve our capital city are consistently safe. Deputy McAuliffe was involved in the production of a policy document on a dedicated transport police. That is something which is, of course, at the discretion of the Garda Commissioner and his colleagues in An Garda Síochána, if they believe it is necessary. I welcome the fact we have seen increased patrols by An Garda Síochána on the Luas and DART, and in and around Dublin Bus services but, fundamentally, we need to look at a dedicated public transport policing service. It could be run out of the Phoenix Park or wherever else, just like other aspects of An Garda Síochána. It is something that many people want to see. When people talk about a feeling around Dublin, the response is that most crime statistics are down, but the feeling of security and safety cannot be banked in terms of statistics or crime figures. It can, however, be addressed by having that level of high-visibility policing on the street in our communities and on our public transport so that it can be concluded that when serious crimes take place, we see a level of, and attention to, sentencing that is respectful of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Most importantly, I think of our peace officers, which includes members of An Garda Síochána, the fire brigade, as had been mentioned, and the National Ambulance Service. Anyone who has the audacity to assault an individual in those organisations who is in the service of the State should know that not only are they assaulting an individual, they are assaulting the State itself and will face a mandatory sentence that is reflective of the need for natural justice in those cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> I could fill another 13- minute speaking slot twice over, but I will leave it at that. I thank the Minister of State for allowing us to contribute to this debate.</p>

        <speech by="#GaryGannon" eId="spk_238">
          <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_509">I thank the Minister of State for bringing this debate forward and for his helpful contribution in listening to the statements of Members. Deputy Richmond is right. We do not say often enough that we love Dublin. As somebody who grew up and spends a lot of time there, it is a place I absolutely adore. It is for that very reason I want to fight for it. There are, without question, some problems that exist on the streets of Dublin. We could talk for hours about its many wonderful characteristics and attributes, and the people of Dublin, wherever they may come from, who spend their time in our city.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">When problems emerge in our city and when, as happened a couple of weeks ago, the national broadcaster took an interest in a particular street on a particular day, too often we ask "Who is in charge?". Dublin has a democratic deficit. The reason I have been calling for statements on the city of Dublin for over a year - the first time the Business Committee agreed to statements on Dublin was in November of last year - is because I want to get some sense of collective control. There has to be a place for Parliament when it comes to our capital city.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> The House will hear me talk about Dublin City Council quite a bit. I often do so in negative terms, because we can all do better. I want to enhance local government not just in this city but throughout Ireland. The council will often say it can only go so far in light of its remit. When issues pop up around the city that pertain mostly to addiction, An Garda Síochána will rightfully say that it can police the problem of addiction. I agree with that up to a point. The HSE has a responsibility, as does the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, when it comes to tackling dereliction. There are a multitude of vast and complex problems that Parliament must take an interest in if we are to reach the degree of satisfaction in respect of our city that we all want to reach.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> It was the Government's decision to frame these statements as supporting the development of Dublin through safety initiatives and the appropriate provision of emergency and other services. That is probably not how I would frame it, but I am happy to start there. I do not believe there is one policing solution to the problems on the streets of Dublin. I know Ministers and contributors across the Chamber have acknowledged that to a degree but I want to go into it in more detail. There are short-, medium- and long-term solutions regarding the issues of safety in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> If we start by looking at long-term solutions, let us begin from a very simple premise. I am delighted that the Minister of State, who has responsibility for the national drugs strategy is with us. We can all agree that wherever they come from and whatever their situation, nobody grows up wishing to be afflicted by the scourge of drug addiction. Nobody wants to find themselves down a lane in the capital city injecting themselves or smoking poison. If we can accept that, we might also accept that the gateways to these scourges that destroy the lives of people, not just in the past year but since heroin use first penetrated into my city in the late 1970s, are poverty, trauma and neglect. They are gateways to the scourge because people self-medicate to deal with a pain I cannot even comprehend, and yet successive generations of people for over 40 years have continued to inflict that on themselves. If we accept that, we must accept that we can no longer criminalise addiction. To continue to criminalise addiction and the means by which a person self-medicates to deal with a trauma and pain I do not believe we can fully comprehend unless we have experienced it, means that we will be back here in 12 months' or five or ten years' time repeating the same mistakes.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> If we accept that we can no longer criminalise addiction, and I hope the Minister of State accepts it, surely the solution to the issues of addiction we see on the streets of Dublin involves more than policing. Decriminalisation does not absolve people of responsibility; it means that for the first time in a modern republic, we accept it as an issue that needs a compassionate health-based solution. The Minister of State might say that we already have that and I believe he is earnest in that intent but while the law still criminalises addiction, it means we do not have access to supervised detox beds on a substantial level and safe injection facilities. We have not even started the conversation about consumption rooms. All of these constitute the first steps to treating people and take them out of the lanes because a criminal response has not done us any good. To use an old trope and cliché, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome. We will not get that outcome until we change our approach drastically.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> The medium-term solution is found in how we design our cities. If you walk down O'Connell Street, you will find nowhere to sit down. You will not find a public bench. If you walk into the communities surrounding it, you will find very few trees and not much in the way of parks. Dublin City Council carried out a safety audit in respect of women on the streets. Cat O'Driscoll, my constituency colleague, was part of the audit last week. It surprised me to a degree because in 2013, Dublin City Council not only signed up to but committed to enacting the UN Safer Cities for Girls programme, which also carried out an audit that identified the same things, namely, dereliction, an absence of street lighting, decay of the city landscape and people hanging around creating an unsafe environment for everybody, particularly women and young girls. In particular, women and young girls of colour, people of different nationalities and the LGBTQI+ plus community feel extremely unsafe. Dublin City Council committed to addressing that, but it has done nothing. It certainly did not do much when I was on the council between 2014 and 2021. Deputy McAuliffe might question that, but I would say it was not challenged to any degree. Design is really important.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> When we talk about safety in a city, the manifestations of lack of safety include crime and the consequences of addiction on the streets but there are other forms of safety. There are significant respiratory problems among people who live around O'Connell Street and in the south inner city because of congestion and the fact that we consistently send car after car through those areas and clog them up. This is to the detriment of people who live close by. Respiratory problems make the city unsafe. If you have a disability, Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome, there is nowhere in this city where you can go and use a bathroom without having to go into a coffee shop or spend some money. That makes the city unsafe. If you suffer from fatigue, there is nowhere for you to sit down in this city. That makes a city unsafe. As a result, design is key.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> In the short term, without question, there is a role for policing. I welcome the fact that a police station will be opened on O'Connell Street and that we had Operation Spire and Operation Citizen. However, I do not welcome the fact that all these initiatives have done over the past couple of years is push the problems to which I refer out into the surrounding communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> Regarding Operation Citizen and Operation Spire, when communities around Talbot Street, Liberty House, Seán McDermott Street and Hardwicke Street hear about these new initiatives, what they will rightly think - because they have experienced it for so long - is that the problems will just be transferred to other places on the merry-go-round. I was at a public meeting last night on O'Connell Street. I have no doubt that in three to four months' time we will be going to community meetings in Hardwicke Street and out as far as Ballybough because the problem will simply be pushed onto on the merry-go-round and we will be back to O'Connell Street next year. Somebody else will do a documentary and we will probably be back in here listening to Deputies talking about the state of the place unless we change it. I want more police on the street but I want quality policing. We have great gardaí but I want a community-based policing approach on O'Connell Street. I do not doubt that we need them there but we need gardaí who can link in with services such as Ana Liffey. We need more of that. It will enhance the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> We also need to question who this city is being built for. In former working-class strongholds around Ringsend and East Wall, all you see are office blocks. A year or two years from now, or even before that, there will be nobody in those office blocks because the nature of work is changing completely. We have designed our city for a type of tech industry that will not exist. Hopefully, the industry will not go away, but the way people work there will certainly change. People will work in offices two or three days a week. We have already seen Meta halt development around those areas. We need to reinvigorate this city through housing people in it and through its culture in order that when we have shops that have lost commercial footfall to shopping centres on the M50, we can bring our artistic community into those areas and energise our city through art. That is how we enhance a city. The pride we associate with Dublin and how we project ourselves on the world stage have always been through our songs, stories, people and the communities that came here. If we are to enhance this city as a safe place through the eradication of crime, a compassionate approach to addiction and reinvigoration through art, we must make a start. This will have tangible outcomes and will make a difference. It will require joined-up collective thinking and a sense of responsibility. It will also require us to be strong, to demonstrate that leadership and to believe in this city, not just through our words but also through our actions.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulMcAuliffe" eId="spk_239">
          <from>Deputy Paul McAuliffe<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_520">I echo the comments of my colleagues from Dublin regarding how proud we are of the city. When we talk about its problems, we are often serving to denigrate the city we are all passionate about. I am very proud of Dublin. I am proud of its representatives when they play in Croke Park, when I visit many of the community projects here and when I travel to other cities and see what we do well. If we really care about the city and the place where we live, however, we want it to be better. From my perspective, having served for ten years on Dublin City Council, and had that honour of representing the city, there are five areas on which we need to work to strengthen Dublin's hand. We do not talk about this aspect in the House enough. Allegations are often made that Dublin gets everything and that the city is growing to the detriment of rural Ireland. There are as many problems in Dublin as there are in any other part of the world. I was once struck by the phrase "All the problems of the world exist in cities, but so do all the solutions".</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> If we listen to our own communities, they are telling us they want people who will make strong local decisions. We need reform of local government. The Government's Dublin Citizens' Assembly on local government structures in the city is a welcome step. If I was the Taoiseach, I would take its report, work with the Members of this House who have a mandate to represent the people of Dublin and legislate and implement the recommendations. I would not waste time in putting it out to a plebiscite and having an internal committee in this House to review it. I would take the report produced by Jim Gavin and I would legislate for its findings with gusto.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> If we strengthen local government in Dublin, right from having an executive mayor, whether directly or indirectly elected, down to area committee structures, we will serve the people of this city to a great degree. By doing this, we will also hold to account the agencies that are allegedly meant to serve the people of Dublin, whether it is the National Transport Authority, EirGrid, etc. Agencies operating in this State should be accountable to the representatives of the people of the city. It should not be at parliamentary level; it should be at municipal level. The local government structures in Dublin city need to change. The Dublin Citizens' Assembly recommendations, in advance of being adopted, should be seriously considered. We should also have an advanced and accelerated process of implementing them by legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Returning to the issue of agencies being accountable to the people of the city, millions of euro are being poured into my area. I represent Ballymun, Finglas, Glasnevin and Santry. These millions of euro are pouring in through drug task forces, youth centres and family resource centres. A great deal of money is also coming in from Tusla and the HSE. Often, however, there is little transparency concerning how decisions are made about where the money is spent. Equally, there is little co-ordination between different agencies. We need a more co-ordinated approach to service delivery, especially in those parts of the city left with a legacy in situations whereby large housing developments were effectively abandoned. There were decades in this State when we operated a policy of human set-aside. People were allowed to live on large tracts of land without proper services.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Many of these services are now in place. We should support the people who work in them but we must co-ordinate and strengthen how they are delivered. When I attend meetings, it is too often the case that the HSE and Tusla, and senior decision-makers in those organisations, are not represented. The people empowered to make decisions are not there to be held accountable for why decisions are made. There must be stronger local government, but also co-ordinated service delivery. Representatives of Rethink Ireland addressed several Deputies yesterday about social innovation. Mention was made of funding projects such as FoodCloud, etc. The best form of social innovation we could have would be by reforming public services and ensuring that the people who work on the ground are empowered.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> We should also have a realistic approach to the drugs industry in this city. If there ever was a war against drugs, we have lost it. That war is over. I can walk out of this House and purchase drugs on any street corner. People tell me there are parts of their estates where the shop, as they call it, is open all hours of the day and night. We must accept, therefore, that drugs are freely available for sale and that thousands of people are purchasing these products. In fact, in my community, the drugs industry is probably one of the single largest employers. This is a very sad thing to say, but as other Deputies have said, it is a realistic response to the trauma that often exists. Many Deputies might not be aware of what a trauma-informed community is, but this is no different than the trauma that existed in previous decades when many parents, often men, languished in pubs. Many of them were the people who came out and fought against drugs in their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> The debate on drugs has, though, moved on from the anti-drugs marches. At that time, the concern was about the substance. It was felt that if we were to allow the substance to take hold it would ravage our communities and impact people's lives. We must stop thinking about the substance because the industry has a far greater impact on my area than the substance has on individuals. This is not to say that taking drugs is a positive thing or that I would necessarily agree with legalising drugs or with them being freely available. What I am saying is that there are criminal gangs - we all know their names - and they have a more detrimental impact on the safety of communities than the substances they are selling. We must, then, have trauma-informed communities and have the citizens' assembly on drugs next year and legislate for the implementation of its findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> We have had a great deal of discussion at the policy level around the issue of the decriminalisation of drugs. I do not believe this conversation has happened at community level. Many families of people with addictions would be very much opposed to any sort of liberalisation, as they might say, of drugs because they do not want what happened to their family member to happen to any other person. We must engage with those communities and talk to them about what decriminalisation or drug reform might look like.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> We must also address the question of housing. When I was elected to this House in February 2020, the only way the local authority I had left could provide housing was through large-scale, low-income, single-tenure housing. This was the only policy instrument available to local authorities. We could all criticise the Housing for All policy in respect of delivery and other aspects, but we can say with certainty now that local authorities have all the policy instruments to develop mixed-income, mixed-tenure public housing. They have the financial and legislative policy resources for cost-rental, owner-occupied affordable purchase and social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> The days of building places like Ballymun and Finglas, and concentrating low-income people in one place, and then not having the services to support those communities, should be gone. When we plan new communities, local authorities can now have this mix that we often debated on Dublin City Council regarding what percentage of what categories would go into which estates. We have now given local authorities the power to build these mixed-income, mixed-tenure estates. I wish to ensure that this idea of mixed-income, mixed-tenure and well-planned estates is embedded in the housing provision in future. This has been done. We have legislated for it in this House. We must now ensure that local authorities implement it.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> The final proposal I have for Dublin concerns our economic success. We know all the things we have spoken about here often require resources. We should not underestimate the positive role that business, enterprise and economic development play in our city.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Among these are small operations where somebody starts his or her own business. It does not have to be an innovative idea that will change the world. It can be something mundane as far as a policy expert is concerned. It can be about providing a service, but that person setting up that small business has a huge impact in his or her local community. He or she is often the person who sponsors the GAA club quicker than any chain of stores. That impact, from that person in a small business right up to some of the biggest employers we have in the city, is critically important to this city being successful. There has to be a balance between those whom the city is for, but I go back to a comment that was made to me once by a company investing in Dublin that a great city to invest in is a great city to live in. If someone is making a decision to come here to build an office block, to own a piece of property and to do his or her business here, his or her managers, the people they work for and the people they are looking to attract and retain want a positive city to live in. If we want Dublin to be a successful economic city, we must make it a great city to live in too. By having stronger local government, co-ordinated public services that are connected with communities and a realistic approach to the drugs industry, if we build mixed-income and mixed tenure communities that are well planned, and if we secure economic success and investment, we can make Dublin an even greater place than it is today.</p>

        <speech by="#DessieEllis" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_532">I take the opportunity to speak about a couple of concerns of mine. One, in particular, relates to the ability of the fire services to tackle fires in high-rise buildings. There are nine habitable buildings in Dublin above 13 storeys. There is the Alto Vetro, a 16-storey residential complex on the west side of Grand Canal Dock which reaches a height of 51 m; the Capital Dock, which is a mixed-use building with a height of 79 m and 23 storeys; Liberty Hall, which is almost 60 m high and has 16 floors; and, in my constituency of Dublin North-West, the Metro Hotel in Ballymun which is 52 m high and has 15 floors.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> Dublin Fire Brigade has ladders that can reach the fourth floor of any building. The fire service also acquired a 42 m turntable ladder appliance for all high-rise developments. I am aware that Dublin Fire Brigade trains all operational firefighters and officers to deal with a full range of incidents, including fires in tall and complex buildings. In general, fire appliances carry the same standard 10 m and 13.5 m ladders, which enable firefighters to reach the fourth floor of a building and are only really suitable for what would be termed regular housing stock.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> Dublin Fire Brigade receives fire safety certificate applications for planning applications. For each, the applicant must show he or she is in compliance with regulations. The fire brigade can grant or refuse such applications. Should a fire occur in one of these high-rise buildings, the fire service strategy is principally to fight the fire from an internal protected stairwell and, where possible, using external resources. Clearly, the fire service will be constrained by the equipment that is available to it. It is the opinion of a number of fire service personnel that the Dublin Fire Brigade is neither equipped nor trained to deal with fires in such high-rise buildings. This is a real concern in the wake of the tragedy at Grenfell Tower in London and, closer to home, the devastating fire on the tenth and 13th floors of the Metro Hotel in Ballymun in March 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The tallest ladders that the fire brigade have are 30 m. This only allows the fire brigade to rescue people trapped on the seventh or eighth floor. What is equally concerning is that, according to members of the service, Dublin Fire Brigade has only one set of equipment for tackling fires in high-rise buildings and this equipment is kept at the Tara Street station. The fire service needs to be able to react and adapt to this rapidly changing city and have the resources and equipment to tackle emergencies and fires in existing and proposed buildings and complexes. Experts have modelled responses by the fire service, and their models show it takes a fire brigade 20 minutes longer to begin to tackle blazes that break out at 20 storeys than those on the ground floor. If you live at the top of a high rise, you will have to wait at least another 20 minutes before you can be rescued or for the fire service to put out the fire in your apartment.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> Tackling a fire in a high rise is a complex operation, from finding out where the fire is to who needs to be evacuated. Operationally, the fire service will need to have the apartment manager present and have access to all the keys for the building, and with the varying quality of the building and of the building materials in Dublin, the fire service has to work on the premise that it has to evacuate everyone from the building. This is a very challenging exercise, especially if there are people who are trapped more than eight floors up.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> Another concern I have is the ability of emergency vehicles to access underground parking areas, for example, in shopping malls. This was graphically brought home to me on Friday last when I was in an underground car park in a local shopping centre in Finglas when there was a very serious accident. A woman who was badly injured was left lying on the ground in the car park for more than two hours. She was in severe pain from her injuries. I rang the emergency services a number of times to get both the police and the ambulance services there. It took the ambulance more than two hours to arrive and the police failed to turn up. From the conversation I had on the phone with the emergency services, it became clear many ambulances were tied up at the hospitals waiting to have their patients admitted but, because of the overcrowding at the emergency departments, they had to wait until space was freed up in the emergency department. As a consequence, people such as the injured person I spoke about had to wait a substantial amount of time before they could get to be seen. It is not acceptable that people should be left in this condition for such a long time. When the ambulance arrived, it could not access the underground car park. The personnel had to park outside and make their way, carrying their equipment through the shopping mall, to the injured party. This must be the case, I suspect, for some, if not many, other underground facilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">I am sharing time with Deputy Bríd Smith.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> It frustrates me that every few months, or maybe every couple of years, there is a moral panic about antisocial behaviour, young people, violence and criminality and politicians jump up and down and call for more police, but what rarely happens is a serious engagement with the communities that are affected by deprivation, neglect, dereliction, poverty and the housing crisis and the lack of things for young people, particularly young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, to do. In between the moral panics, we do not seriously engage with those communities, young people and, most importantly, the groups and organisations in working-class communities that try to make things better and do positive things to give alternatives to young people to all that people are so quick to give out about.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> I wish to cite the example of Monkstown Boxing Club in Monkstown Farm in my area. Monkstown Boxing Club started in the old Mounttown Flats, which were run-down flats in one of the most deprived and neglected areas in the entire city. It took many years for that community to force the council to redevelop that area, improve it and build a new community facility. One of the key groups there was Monkstown Boxing Club, which involved young people from diverse backgrounds -Traveller backgrounds, ethnic minority backgrounds and diverse social backgrounds - in the positive activity of boxing. They have done wonders in that community. Twenty years on, this year Jack Marley, became the youngest ever Irish heavyweight elite champion, coming back from the European Under-22 championships as a gold medalist. He is now training for the Olympics. Seán Mari, another young man from that club, an Irish elite champion, has just come back from Montenegro as the flyweight gold medalist from a multinational competition. He is also training for the Olympics.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Around him are fantastic coaches, including Paulie, James, Tommy and Darren, who do it all voluntarily, and loads of young people from diverse backgrounds. These are precisely the people who are often not reached by rugby or soccer clubs, the GAA or other sports. As the club coaches and the children themselves say, if they were not doing this, they could well be in serious trouble. With everything this club has done, since it was in the run-down Mounttown Flats, it still does not have a clubhouse of its own. It has no showers or changing rooms. It does not have a storage area. Just two weeks ago, in a community facility that is supposed to be the club's, the manager locked out the entire club and all of the local groups for ten days at a few hours' notice without any explanation. There are young people training for the Olympics. All of these young people took their protest to the council and trained on the streets in the cold to make the point to the council that this was unacceptable. These are the club's facilities and it has been locked out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> In fairness, the council is now engaging with the club and we are campaigning for a permanent home and to get it back into the clubhouse. It is an instance of the lack of engagement and the lack of support we give to people and groups who are trying to do positive things to bring people away from everything that politicians are so quick to neglect. I ask the Minister of State to take this salutary lesson on the need for important things such as boxing clubs and other positive initiatives in working-class communities where the communities themselves know best how to provide alternatives for young people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BridSmith" eId="spk_242">
          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_543">I want to address several issues that are not central to the question of antisocial behaviour but are central not only to urban spaces in Dublin but to all urban spaces. There are wide issues regarding how we develop our cities and the spaces where people live. If we take Dublin 8 as an example, walking through it we would barely recognise the Coombe or the Liberties because the planners have had it their way. All of the big developments that have taken place and that are smothering the area are built for tourism and student accommodation. They are not for local people to live in but for money to flow through the area. This is precisely what I believe is at the heart of the planners and those who think about Dublin and other cities and how they will progress them. It is about getting the money from tourism and foreign students who have plenty of money to pay for dear accommodation and getting them spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> There is another part of city life and this is the people who live in it: the children, old people and people who grew up there. They have very limited, if any, space in which to play, participate in sports, hang out together or sit in parks and squares. If they do have parks and squares, they are filthy. They do not have public toilets and they do not have proper seating. When we disrespect the population like this, we, in turn, get the disrespect back in spades.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> The issue I want to focus on more than anything else is public transport. We are going through a period when we urgently need to move to free, frequent public transport to deal with the climate catastrophe and the cost-of-living crisis. What we are getting instead is the plan around BusConnects. I agree with the improved services and getting more linked services throughout the city and more night-time 24-7 services, but they are being pushed through when there is a severe staffing shortage. Throughout Dublin, particularly in the south central area where three or four new spines have been opened recently, we are suffering from a mass shortage of public transport. If we want people to feel safe in our city, especially vulnerable people, people with disabilities, women and elderly people, providing them with a reliable safe public transport system is crucial. How will they live and move around the city if they cannot depend on this? At the moment we cannot do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> I will use as an example the 79 bus route. It is a famous route about which poetry and songs have been written. It goes through all of the little estates in Ballyfermot. Recently, it was taken out and two G spines have been put in its place. They go through west Dublin from Spencer Dock practically into Kildare. They are meant to run every ten minutes and they are meant to run all night. This is all great but it does not happen. The alternative that was provided for the 70 bus, the so-called 60 route, has not shown up. I have had answers from Dublin Bus on this as recently as today. At crucial times in the mornings when people are trying to get to school and work and in the evenings when they are trying to get home, the service has failed. It is getting worse all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> We had debates with BusConnects on whether it could delay the introduction of the G spine and the change in the routes and whether more frequency could be given to the estates in Ballyfermot. We were told it will have to proceed and the plan will be going ahead. This is despite acknowledging to us that the services were 150 drivers short. Go-Ahead does not have as much of the service but proportionately it is equally short of drivers. We ask why because the companies do good recruitment campaigns. They do recruit but they cannot retain workers. There is a plethora of reasons for this. The crucial one is the conditions for workers who drive buses. Long and antisocial shifts do not allow for a decent work-life balance. They also start on unequal pay. People have to be in the job at least four to six years before they begin to catch up with the senior drivers who do the same job and earn a different rate of pay. This has to end.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> The idea we should adopt the neoliberal approach of attempting to privatise a vital public service by introducing competition that drives a race to the bottom and pushes down the pay and conditions of those who work in it is leaving us short staffed. It is leaving us short staffed in a serious way so that we cannot deliver a safe public transport system. This is related to antisocial behaviour and how people live in the city. This ideology for how live in our cities has to be removed. It is not all about money. It is also about a quality of life. It is about communities and people. It is about those who work for us and deliver these services in our city.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> Following this debate, if we get the basics right and provide decent public spaces with public toilets, clean up areas, provide play areas, provide places that are safe and inviting and provide public transport that is safe and inviting, we can deal with many of the problems that have given rise to this debate in the first place. If we do not do this, we will leave behind many people in this city in terms of supporting whatever initiatives we may need to take in future to deal with the transport and climate crisis.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EmerHiggins" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Deputy Emer Higgins<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_550">As a Dublin Deputy, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on safety in our capital city. Dublin is a brilliant city. It is a place I am proud to live and work in. It is a place to which people come from all over the world to visit and stay. Of course, we are not without our problems, and this is especially so when it comes to safety on our streets. Building stronger safer communities is a priority for the Government. We have seen this reflected very much in the actions of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Department. I am encouraged by the ongoing investment and innovation in making Dublin a safer place to live, work and visit.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> Recently the issue of car theft and joyriding was brought to the fore in news and media coverage. We saw blatant disregard and disrespect for the safety of communities and the safety of gardaí on our streets. I commend the Minister, Deputy McEntee, the Department and the Garda on acting so quickly to engage with communities and send out the message that car theft is a serious crime to which there are serious consequences. While just one incident from this was caught on camera, unfortunately, for some communities their sense of security is threatened quite often by this sort of antisocial behaviour. This is not right. Supporting communities to take back the streets and speaking up to the Garda about perpetrators of crime and those engaging in antisocial behaviour is very important. This is where the importance of investing in community policing and a Garda presence cannot be overstated. In my constituency of Dublin Mid-West I am seeing an increase in car theft which I have to say is quite concerning. It is very important we continue to treat instances of car theft as serious crimes, because they are. We must put the necessary resources into cracking down on car thieves. A stolen car is sometimes treated as something of a low-level crime. It is not low level for the victim. It turns a person's life upside down.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The are implications for their transport and insurance, and claims are impacted. The shock of being the victim of a crime can be quite awful.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> An issue I want to raise is catalytic converters being stolen from cars in estates in my constituency. It is an issue about which I am hearing more of by way of reports coming into my office and I know the Garda has reported the theft of catalytic convertors is on the rise. For us in Dublin Mid-West, complaints have come in from victims of such crime in Saint Helen's, Adamstown, Newcastle and Rathcoole, to name but a few areas. What is the Department and, indeed, the Garda doing to address this issue? Catalytic converter theft is a known risk among drivers and gardaí. There is a need for regulations on their installation when it comes to theft prevention. I know that is not directly within the remit of the Minister, but I wanted to put it on the Dáil record.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> The best way to make people feel safer on our streets in Dublin is to improve Garda presence. Increased visibility to deter anti-social and criminal activity works and it also makes people feel safer. In order to increase Garda presence, we need more gardaí. We need to bring in new recruits and ensure An Garda Síochána is an attractive career path for people. Whether it is traffic management, community policing, or cracking down on antisocial behaviour or gangland criminality, we cannot keep our streets safe without our gardaí. Garda presence is important at all points of the day, but especially in the evenings and night time.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> It has been said that certain areas of Dublin city can be a little intimidating and, frankly, unenjoyable to be around at night time. The combination of a lack of rubbish bins and public toilets, as well as the more sinister activities such as antisocial behaviour and open drug-dealing, are real issues in parts of our capital. O’Connell street is one of Ireland’s most iconic and well-known streets but, in reality, many Irish people feel it is the last place they would want to be alone at night time, and that is sad. Whether a person is coming home from work or school, waiting for a bus or walking to a bar or restaurant, at times, there is a distinct feeling of insecurity around Dublin’s main street.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> I welcome the ongoing work done by gardaí in Store Street Garda station under Operation Spire. They are targeting antisocial behaviour and drug dealing around the area to restore safety and security to O’Connell Street. That will make it a safer place to walk, shop or wait for a bus.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> We cannot talk about safety on our streets in Dublin without speaking about public transport as they are so closely linked, especially when it comes to night life and the night-time economy. I add my support to calls for a dedicated public transport police, which we heard about this afternoon. By and large, being on public transport in Dublin is a safe place to be and staff working across our public transport links do a great job at keeping people safe, but they can only do so much. The visible presence of a public transport police, especially on city-centre routes, would contribute greatly to improved safety for all commuters.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> I commend the introduction of 24-hour bus routes. Routes C and G are 24-hour routes that are well used by commuters in Dublin Mid-West. Route C has been in operation for about a year and route G is our brand-new route. They are used at night when we know taxis are in short supply. For that reason, 24-hour bus routes can be a real lifesaver for commuters making their way home late at night.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> The current lack of taxis on our streets in Dublin has to be flagged as a safety concern and I have raised this issue before in the Chamber. Again, it is not necessarily within the remit of the Minister, but we could be encouraging more taxi drivers onto our roads by addressing waiting lists for licenses and by reducing VAT on new cars used as taxis. That would also help the 3,750 taxi drivers whose vehicles may shortly be too old to operate as taxis. Free Now is warning of an imminent taxi driver shortage, the impact of which will be felt by Christmas party goers.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Being stranded in the city centre at night time, with no sign of a taxi and no immediate way to get home, is not just annoying. It can also be scary and unsafe. There are groups, including women, who feel more vulnerable on the streets of Dublin. I highlight the experience of members of the LGBT+ community in particular. Attacks on people from this community on Dublin’s streets have been particularly shocking and upsetting. While we work on making Dublin a safe place in which to live, work and socialise, it is important that we do not leave any groups out of that vision. Under the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, An Garda Síochána is working to increase significantly the reporting of hate crimes by members of the LGBTI+ community. I welcome and encourage that. We need a more open relationship between the LGBT community and the Garda. I know this is being developed and I commend that. The legislation on hate crime, which is moving through the House, will be instrumental in allowing us to hold perpetrators of these kinds of crimes to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> Dublin is a great place to live. There is no doubt the will and investment is there to make it an even greater and, crucially, a safer place to live and visit.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_562">Many of my colleagues have touched on aspects of life in Dublin and the vibrant city that it is. Many have also expressed their pride in living in Dublin. Those of us from the country recognise that Dublin is our capital city and we are also proud of it. There is something to do and see in Dublin. The tremendous sense of community that is in many parts of the capital city was mentioned, but we all agree there is also an element of danger and antisocial behaviour, which is the core of the debate this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> Open drug-dealing and use has been a common sight in our city’s main thoroughfares and transport hubs. Unfortunately, people in addiction are often used by criminals in a most dangerous way. A person who works with people suffering from addiction told me that it is suicide in slow motion for many of them. If we see a person who is suicidal, we have great empathy for them and do everything to protect and help them in order to take them away from the edge of where they may be. Yet, what about when we see a person who is addicted to crack cocaine, or some other hard drug? These drugs are slowly taking their life away from them and we, as a society, have a responsibility to intervene in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> There are significant problems with antisocial behaviour and violence. We must put proper resources into drug addiction and youth services, particularly in our capital city. Not only does it leave residents, workers, commuters and visitors fearful of being attacked, but this behaviour also causes reputational damage to our beautiful and historical capital city. There is a growing perception that public transport in not safe, both for passengers and staff, throughout Dublin. Much evidence has been provided in recent times by unions, on behalf of those working on trains, buses and trams, and by passengers who have been the victim of antisocial behaviour and violent criminal acts, for which there needs to be an intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The negligence of the Government to resource An Garda Síochána properly to tackle these issues is a major concern we must recognise. Since 2018, we have seen a decrease in the number of gardaí deployed to the public order unit. While I accept that certain areas of Dublin have seen a small increase in Garda numbers, it simply is not keeping in line with population growth or crime figures. This is happening while a significant number of new Garda members leave the force every year. There is a clear retention and recruitment crisis in An Garda Síochána. While there was great fanfare that 10,000 people expressed an interest in joining the force, less than 200 people have gone through Templemore this year. The bottom line is that the number of gardaí on the streets is falling short.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> The retention crisis has been caused by an abject failure of successive Governments to tackle the root causes of crime, antisocial behaviour, and drug use and addition seen across our city. According to the Central Statistics Office reported crime figures for the Dublin metropolitan region in the second quarter of 2021 and 2022, there was a 12.9% increase, or 819 additional reports of attempts or threats of murder, assault and harassment. This was in one 12-month period alone. That figure stands out as one of the real problems. It highlights the core of violent, drug-related crime that needs to be dealt with. The reports of theft in the Dublin metropolitan region increased by 5,572 cases in the same 12-month period.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> I commend the work of An Garda Síochána throughout the capital as part of Operation Citizen and other similar operations, but gardaí are stretched to beyond their limits and additional resources need to be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">These operations need to be supported with ring-fenced funding to ensure they are continued for as long as is necessary. A focus is also needed on overt and covert policing methods to target criminal behaviour on the streets of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> We need a dedicated public transport police to address antisocial behaviour and criminal activity on our public transport and in transport hubs. A public transport police system has been called for by both the Opposition and backbench Members of the Government. It will be simply impossible to develop a public transport system that will replace cars on our streets if it is not safe for people. Every other country in Europe has a public transport police system, as do many across the world, and we simply have to deliver it here as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> An Garda Síochána must be resourced adequately to increase rank-and-file numbers with a return to community policing, which is the model that has served communities well in the past. I have spoken to a number of victims of crime in recent months who also feel the sentences handed out by the courts may not fit the crime or the effect that crime has had on their lives. In order to support them, we need to move toward a judicial system that respects victims. A holistic programme of investment and measures such as these are what is required to target and deter the continued criminality communities experience in specific parts of our capital city. Government needs to put its money where its mouth is and correct the decades of underspend that has led to the issues which have seen our capital city in such disarray.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_571">It may seem odd that a country Deputy should get involved in Dublin city but, as the previous speaker has just said, it is everybody's city. We all have to take responsibility for it. We take pride in it and we reserve the right to comment when things are not as they should be. I acknowledge the point raised by Deputy Bríd Smith with regard to sporting and recreational facilities, clubs and youth clubs. An audit of what is available for young people is needed. It is not enough to say people are poor, upset and angry; people were poor in this city before and matters did not degenerate to the point where it is now.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> I have spoken several times about the appearance of the city when driving across it at night when one finds people falling out of doorways, staggering across the road and falling around the place in an appalling way. They are obviously a danger to themselves and create a problem for the appearance of the city but there is a health issue as well. We need to do an audit of the facilities available and try to make sure they are made available conveniently. Some people say we should have no cars in the future. I do not agree with that. There will always be people who need cars. There will always be people who have business to do and will not get on to public transport at an approved and agreed point. They wish to do their business in their own time, go home and be independent in their own time. Every city in the world has facilities to do that but we are moving away from it altogether. That is taking away people's independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> I have strong views as a former member of a ministerial task force. I know the argument continues as to whether it should be prohibition and police work to ensure the elimination of drugs or a health issue. It has to be both and they have to be applied with due regard for the situation presenting itself. We found that methadone was widely available and regularly used but, unfortunately, the victims were not relying on it. Methadone was only a top-up. The well-run centres ensured that if those who attended went to get a top-up somewhere else, they were not welcome at the clinics. I am strongly of the view that we have to do both. We have to do enforcement and cut off the supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> A late former Member of this House, Tony Gregory, spent years campaigning on the drugs issue in Dublin city. Despite it being dangerous, he courageously targeted the suppliers again and again, that is, the drug barons and the guys who were able to drive along in their BMWs and have deliveries take place at all times of the day and night. He drew attention to them because he saw them as a major contributory issue to an affliction that was affecting a whole new generation in a way that it had never presented before. He was right to do so and we need to continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> We need to review policing in the city in particular to such an extent as to interrupt the delivery of packages to households and strategic corners in locations throughout the city. We need to do so deliberately. I welcome the Minister concentration on this area but we need to emphasise it. There is no use in backing away from it or saying we are casting a stigma on the city. Decadence is not nice in any shape or form. Fear is not nice, when people become afraid to walk on a particular street in a particular area at night. In my heyday, I walked every possible place there was to go in this city, as I am sure everybody else in this House did. I walked without fear and people were not richer then than they are now. We need to recognise what is slipping away.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> I remember going to another city in another country, once upon a time, where all I could see in the middle of the city was graffiti all over the place. It was not a great sign or vision of the city or an indicator for those who came to visit the place. Dublin city is a shop window. Investors come to Dublin. I know many people in this House do not like investors and would prefer if they were elsewhere but the fact of the matter is we need and have always needed jobs. It is important to ensure that people who come to this city and country can rest assured they are safe to walk and travel regardless of their religion, race or colour. I remember when Salman Rushdie penned his famous <i>The Satanic Verses</i>. I think I was the only one who disagreed with him at the time and I said so. The book was seen as an expression of freedom of speech but I saw it as something else. I saw it as something that begged a response. It was threatening people of selected religions. Some people are very sensitive about religion. We should know about it in this country, for God's sake. Those people saw a reason for retaliation because they were sensitive about it and retaliation happened. However, nobody knocked on Salman Rushdie's door and told him he had started up something he should not have and that it was of no help.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> By the same token, we have to identify the problem in every way. Incidentally, I was driving home last night when I heard somebody who rang into a radio programme to say he or she had a right to hate. What an appalling expression. Nobody has a right to hate or should ever hate. There is no reason for it. I recall the war in Rwanda, where a gentleman seized a radio station and poured out hatred for two or three years until it eventually boiled over into outright violence and 500,000 people were beheaded as a result. It is all very fine to identify something afterwards and say it was unfortunate but that happened to people. I compliment the Minister of State for dealing with the issue of the use of hate. We do not have to hate. If we wish to hate, by all means, we should look in the mirror any morning and hate away. That is my answer. The suggestion to a radio station that a person wishes to hate and wishes to be allowed to do so and say so is wrong. It gets away from the subject, undermines our society and does us damage. We can choose that if we wish to.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> The old hidden one is about racism. One hears people say on a regular basis that they are not racist but they do not like people of a different colour, religion or background, vulnerable people or people with disabilities. What an appalling attitude to have in a so-called civilised society, in this enlightened time, when we have all the evidence in the world of what hatred and hate speech has done and what hatred has eventually ended up in.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">One would not have to wait too long. The evidence is already there.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> This is a great opportunity to concentrate on the problematic issues in and around our capital city. I do not want to stop at that. Other speakers referred to antisocial behaviour. We have that all over the country in every town and village. The threat exists in estates all over the country, where women and vulnerable people are regularly targeted in an appalling way. They are set upon and identified as being legitimate targets. We have constant reports, through our various offices, of incidents that take place daily and nightly. Older people are terrified to walk across the road. Their doors are barred and barricaded from an early hour at night because they are afraid. Fear is the other thing that we need to confront. There is no need to try to push it under the carpet or ignore it. We need to address and identify whatever causes the fear in such a way as to deal with it meaningfully. We have an opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> I know there are several local authorities on which this impinges, that is, in Dublin, the greater Dublin area, in the adjoining counties and all over the country. I do not accept the notion that if we had one authority in Dublin, this would all disappear. We have to co-operate with one another nationwide to deal with the issues, which have to be dealt with on an ongoing basis as they appear. We should not just have a look at them and then spend six months or six years deciding what would be best to do. We have to deal with it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> To have the opportunity to discuss the issues this evening is important. It gives an opportunity to everybody who has a role to play, including us. We mention how politicians rise every so often and point out these things but that is not what happens at all. The public are concerned. They approach the people who they elected and expect them to do something about it, to bring it to a head and to deal with it. Let us not make excuses that we cannot upset certain people because, if we mention them, they get upset. That is tough. Many people are living in fear. Either we do something about it and respond to it or we hand it over.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> Mayor Giuliani of New York famously claimed credit for zero tolerance. In fact, that was not his doing at all, but that of one of his predecessors, Mayor Koch, who dealt a fatal blow to the ganglands and big guys who were dealing all the time, enforcing, threatening and making millions out of illegal activity. He set them to one side. It was not acknowledged to any great extent, as we know often happens in politics. The fact is that he did it and it had an effect, to such an extent that you do not see anything like the same level of activity. I know there are still illegal activities in the United States but he dealt with that one. Our job is to deal with our issues in whatever way possible, to be helpful and to be supportive, but to be firm at the same time and not take excuses for things that go wrong and are seen to go wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">I welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate. When the public and media discussion about Dublin city hit the headlines in recent weeks, one thing that struck me was that everybody was looking for somebody to blame. The reality is that in our capital city right now, nobody is really in charge. The way in which our system of local government is set up, councils, both management and especially elected representatives, have very limited powers. Far too much continues to be centralised in Departments. A multitude of agencies are responsible for a multitude of functions. The agencies control bits of the system but not all of it. I spoke to a transport policy expert once who asked me how many transport-related agencies operated in the city of Dublin. I thought there were maybe two, three or four. The answer is 40 and the city council is just one of those. If our system of local government is such that it has very limited power, if the few powers it has are predominantly executive and held by the non-elected members who are not democratically accountable, and if we continue to over-centralise in Departments and over-rely on fragmented public agencies as well as, increasingly, private agencies, it is no wonder that the city has the reputation it has.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> I am a Dubliner and I love the city. I currently live in the suburbs and I want the city to be better. There are many good things about it. We could and must do much more, whether on public transport, housing, planning, public spaces crime, or community safety. We have to deal with the fundamental underlying structural problem, which is the weakness of our local government system. It is good that the Government established the Dublin Citizens' Assembly on a directly-elected mayor and future governance of Dublin city. That is welcome. The report is imminent and I look forward to it. Sinn Féin has long argued that we need directly-elected mayors.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> If we are going to convince the public to introduce directly-elected mayors, we have to tell them clearly why, what powers the mayors will have and to what end. I had the good fortune of being involved in the last attempt to consider a directly-elected mayor for Dublin. The Acting Chair, Deputy Higgins, and I were on the council when we considered that. People may remember there was a working group made up of members from the four local authorities. We discussed and debated these issues among the four councils. Each council got to have a separate vote. If all four councils voted, there would be a plebiscite and the public would decide. The difficulty is that we were having a debate in a complete vacuum. While we were being asked if we wanted a directly-elected mayor, we had no idea what the Government's proposals were. The question of whether we wanted a directly-elected mayor was posed first. We were told that the White Paper on the functions of that office would come afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> I completely understand the position of Fingal County Council, which feared that the limited powers that exist in local authorities would be sucked upwards into the office of the directly-elected mayor and it would lose what few functions it has. That would be a disaster and is why its members voted against this. We then had plebiscites of three cities. People were asked to support the idea of a directly-elected mayor while having no notion of what the mayor's functions or powers would be. How can we convince the electorate, which is already sceptical of politicians in many respects, to vote for a directly-elected mayor in Cork, Waterford or Limerick if we do not tell them what the role will do? While Limerick managed to pass the referendum by the skin of its teeth, we still do not have the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> It is very rare that I compliment Members from the Chair's or the last speaker's party, Fine Gael, but Deputy Phelan produced a decent White Paper talking about the significant transfer of powers away from unelected officials to elected officials. There was much merit in that. The current Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is keen to progress that but we know he is struggling with other Departments, which do not want to devolve power downwards to a different layer of administration. There is no value in mayors unless they have real powers and real authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Hopefully, the Dublin Citizens' Assembly will produce a recommendation to have a directly-elected mayor, subject to a plebiscite and the approval of the people of the city before any mayoral election, because I think people have to have their say. I would like to see a small number of important functions devolved to such an office in the first place, then to have a process of rolling devolution. For example, one could decide that transport will become a function of the mayor's office. Devolved powers of the Department of Transport and unelected bodies such as the National Transport Authority would instead be in the remit of a democratically-elected mayor. The value of that would be that a mayoral election would become a contest about how one wants the future of transport in our city to be run and managed. People can get elected, have a democratic mandate and then drive an agenda of change. Their careers will depend on them delivering on that. It is the same with the public realm, planning, housing and other areas as it is with transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> I do not want any further loss of powers from our existing local authorities. Let us strengthen our local authorities, devolve powers to a directly-elected mayor and in all of the myriad issues we have discussed in this debate, let us put somebody in charge and give that person the power, authority, budgets and staff to drive a change agenda for our capital city.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Transport worked as a key issue for London and we could do the same here in Dublin. We would then start to see a much improved city for the people who live and work here and those who travel here. We would all be the better for it.</p>

        <speech by="#CormacDevlin" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Deputy Cormac Devlin<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_595">I welcome this debate. As my party's spokesperson on Dublin, I welcome the need to improve safety, services and the environment in Dublin city and the wider Dublin region.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> Dublin is a world-class city with thousands of years of history and a rich architectural and social culture. Dublin should be a wonderful place to live and visit and most of the time it is. However, as other speakers have said, the welcoming atmosphere of Dublin has been overshadowed by antisocial and criminal behaviour by a small minority. Antisocial and criminal behaviour can have a devastating impact not only on the victims but on communities as well. Incidents of assault or intimidation are completely unacceptable and can never become the norm. We all want people to be safe and feel safe living in the capital city and to be able to enjoy its amenities, activities and surrounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Antisocial and criminal behaviour must be tackled with a multi-agency approach. We have heard many suggestions in this debate about how that can be done. Some Deputies have suggested it is for local government and others that it is for State agencies along with Departments. It will be for a myriad of those and more. Stakeholders include businesses as well as the local community themselves. I agree the current structures of Dublin are not working. There needs to be structural reform of local government, policing and other agencies to make them more effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> Fianna Fáil recently conducted a survey to assess the impact of antisocial and criminal behaviour on public transport users. We received 1,395 submissions. Some 83% of respondents indicated they did not feel safe on public transport. Taxis were perceived to be the safest form of public transport, with 60% of people who answered the question indicating they felt safe. The Luas was perceived to be the least safe mode of public transport with 49.8% of respondents indicating they did not consider it safe. The proportion of participants who indicated they had witnessed antisocial behaviour on public transport was 93%, with 53% indicating it was a regular occurrence. Some 26.4% of respondents reported incidents of antisocial behaviour but only 3.6% received a follow-up. This suggests 96% of those incidents went unreported. The proportion of participants who indicated they had been a victim of antisocial behaviour on public transport was 36%. That is a shocking figure for the level of public transport crime and intimidation.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Some 78% of respondents indicated they favoured a dedicated Garda public transport unit and I support this too. A number of other Deputies indicated the same earlier, which is welcome. It seems there is going to unanimous support for this measure in the House. Garda members patrolling public transport services, particularly around hotspots of antisocial and criminal activity, would act as a deterrent, just as it does in other European cities. Many of those cities have dedicated public transport police units. The UK operates the British Transport Police, which is primarily funded by the public transport providers. I do not favour that model. The unit we are talking about should be a dedicated unit of An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> We recently met the new Garda assistant commissioner for the Dublin metropolitan region, Angela Willis, to discuss the results of the survey and the general issue of anti-social behaviour in the capital. She agreed high-visibility policing is crucial and briefed us on her plans to expand that operation. That expansion has been announced in the form of Operation Citizen, which is very welcome. It involves targeting certain hotspots within the city, as well as reopening a Garda station presence on O'Connell Street that is set to be dedicated to the operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The €5 million additional funding for Garda overtime provided by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in budget 2023 will support the expansion of high-visibility policing. However, there must also be a focus on community policing and youth diversion projects. The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, visited our local youth diversion project in Loughlinstown. These projects and their workers and volunteers are critical tools to support young people. Local sports clubs also play a critical role in supporting young people. I mention Monkstown Boxing Club. It was in the news recently because it had issues accessing its own training facilities in a community centre run by the council. I pay tribute to JP, Tommy, James, Darren and many others in the club who have brought it from strength to strength over the last number of years. The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, recently allocated significant grant funding to help clubs like Monkstown, but there needs to be urgent progress from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to ensure the club facility is built. Local representatives such as my colleague, Councillor Justin Moylan, will work closely with the club and officials to prevent that reoccurrence.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I met Dublin Chamber earlier to discuss the issues its members perceive to be prominent within Dublin city and the greater Dublin area. There are challenges around the public realm. We saw many of these during the pandemic in particular. There is a lack of amenities in the core of the city centre, there are transport issues and crime, there is the night-time economy and the challenges it presents for businesses, shift workers and others and then there is planning and housing. There are a plethora of issues we could discuss. I do not want to be negative about Dublin city. There has been so much positive reform of the heart of the city but we as legislators must ensure we play our part in this Chamber, along with our colleagues on the council, to ensure the development plan is fit for purpose, enhances the city centre and makes it a more vibrant and inviting place than the headlines might lead you to believe. On the public realm, we have unfortunately seen an epidemic of plastic street clutter since the pandemic. The latter has brought its own challenges, especially when you look at the condition of some roads and footpaths that have fallen into disrepair. Local authorities must play their role in ensuring the rich architectural environment of our city, and indeed our county, are maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> The Cathaoirleach Gníomhach and other Deputies mentioned the problems with taxis. Difficulties with Free Now and the lack of availability of taxis are real issues facing the city centre and have been going on for months. As we head into the Christmas period, nobody wants to see people being stranded. The Cathaoirleach Gníomhach highlighted the particular issues with females feeling unsafe in the city and if there are no taxis available that presents its own challenges and must be avoided. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, for being here for the debate and ask him to raise that with his colleagues at the Department of Transport. It is a very important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> There are many issues we wish to see addressed for Dublin city. As I said, I do not want to be negative and there have been plenty of good things done and good initiatives taken. During Hallowe'en we saw various initiatives being undertaken by the city council to encourage good community spirit and a positive experience of Hallowe'en. That is to be welcomed and applauded. It needs to be expanded across all other local authorities. This debate is welcome and timely, given the challenges we have faced in the city and greater Dublin area over the last while. I ask the Minister of State to raise those various issues with his colleagues in the Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_605">I wish to raise a few short points about Dublin that are by no means exhaustive. The very last thing I want to do is talk down Dublin. Dublin is a phenomenal mid-sized European capital with huge success and potential and talking it down is the last thing we want to do. At the same time, we must be realistic about some of the challenges Dublin faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> We often hear, correctly, about rural Ireland in the House but it is reasonable for Dublin Deputies to stand up and say we can do better and be more ambitious for Dublin than we sometimes have been to date. There are a few key points around that. The first is infrastructure. I refer in particular to Dublin Airport and some of the challenges with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">It is not reasonable that we have set ourselves up as a modern economy with a trade model that invites foreign direct investment in the context of people coming here, setting up businesses and bringing employees to live and work here, but that those people cannot get taxis or cannot be confident of using their credit cards in taxi when they get to Dublin airport. It is not reasonable that if one goes to Dublin airport at 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. to catch a flight to any part of Europe, there is nowhere to get a sandwich. These things do not seem to be like a big deal, but can people imagine it happening at another airport? It is just not professional or good enough. These things should just work properly and easily. They do not involve the creation of new infrastructure; they are simply things working properly. This is a basic standard we should set for ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> We have had the perceptions of Dublin and the sentiment towards it whereby there has been a great deal of talk recently about public order, how Dublin is perceived, whether it is more unsafe or perceived to be so, and on what happened during Covid-19 to influence that. An Garda Síochána used to do a public attitudes survey in respect of Dublin, but that has not been done since 2019. My view is that Dublin has changed a great deal during the Covid-19 period, and it has felt different. Whether it is different is another question, but it has felt different for a variety of reasons. Perhaps there are fewer people in the city on a day-to-day basis. It is very important that the sentiment tracker to which I refer be picked up again and be done now in order that we can understand how people in Dublin are really feeling. It is also important to ask business owners how they are feeling and what the sentiment is with businesses in Dublin day to day. I have spoken to shop owners, pub owners and people who work in the hospitality sector who have to try to get home at night regarding what there experience is. Are they in fear of public order problems or of experiencing them? Between public attitudes and business sentiment, it is very important that we ask people how they feel about Dublin in order to see how that has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> The next issue is the labour market. Every single part of the labour market, be it construction, tech, finance or hospitality, is under pressure. There is a circularity to our difficulties with housing and infrastructure that is compounding problems and limiting our ability to be ambitious for Dublin in so many different ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> I visited the United States in recent months and I was struck, more than would be the case anywhere else, by the scale and volume and variety of rental accommodation that is available in that country. Quality amenities are provided in the context of the rental accommodation available to people living and working in different cities in the United States for whatever period they are there. We just do not have the same availability or range of accommodation in Dublin for the different people who want to live here. We cannot provide the sheer volume of accommodation that is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> All of these things are circular. Ultimately, however, Dublin is a mid-sized European capital. Its topography has not changed as quickly as its demographic, its income or in the context of the number of people working here. We must set the highest ambition for Dublin on a comparative basis. It is not the case that Dublin or Wicklow are competing with each other or that Finglas and Tallaght are competing with each other. Dublin is competing with the other capital cities in Europe for international investment and for the best of people, businesses and employment opportunities. Dublin is competing with Amsterdam. In that context, decisions are being made around the world about where to locate businesses, employment and opportunity. I want that opportunity for people in Ireland who want to remain here, who want to make a contribution and who want to have a great life here. Such a life is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> We have not been ambitious enough for Dublin. We need to set our ambition higher with regard to infrastructure and housing, and we should do so in an unashamed way. This ambition should be set as high as possible in the context of ensuring that everything we have works properly and correctly. We should test and assess sentiment and see what people really feel about the city and, what is working what is not. We need to be honest about the things that are not working. We have to set our ambition for housing at the highest possible level, with a broad range of different types of accommodation. Such accommodation should be easily accessible to the range of people who are here, not just in terms of price but also when it comes to flexibility in respect of the different rental models that are available. It is only by understanding that circularity and talking to the groups that can design an ambitious Dublin in order to see where we are and where we should be that we can achieve what is best, not only for the people of Dublin but also for the people of Ireland in general. Dublin is the engine, whether we want to accept that or not, and we must start treating it as such in a serious way.</p>

        <speech by="#NeasaHourigan" eId="spk_250">
          <from>Deputy Neasa Hourigan<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_613">I thank the House for facilitating this debate. One of the nicest things to hear is Deputies who are not directly from Dublin saying that they feel it is their city too. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> I am incredibly proud of Dublin. It has been the honour of my life to represent the constituency of Dublin Central and, in particular, the north inner city, which is such a unique part of our country. The people who grew up in the communities in my area, those who choose to make their homes there and those who come there for recreational purposes or to shop or work, make the area incredibly vibrant and diverse. It is a fantastic place in which to live. One could take a walk around the north inner city right now and see all the bustling activity taking place there. I walk to work, which means that I walk through O'Connell Street every day, usually twice, and I walk there at night. I know that I might be a bit of a tough, but I never feel afraid or scared to walk in the north inner city.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> We have to recognise that there are issues in the area. Many people were surprised by the recent RTÉ "Prime Time" programme on O’Connell Street, but it came as no shock to people like me who live in the area that there are major problems there which need to be addressed and about which we need to be honest. It is very easy to point the finger and say that the problems are all the fault of Dublin City Council or of An Garda Síochána and that there are simple solutions such as better management or changing the management or changing our way of policing. Like so many simple solutions, they will probably not result in serious change.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> I would very much like to see Dublin City Council do a better job of ensuring that homeless services are not concentrated in one area of the city, as seems to be the case right now . We cannot expect Dublin City Council to pick up the slack left by other councils that are not doing their fair share. As has been pointed out by previous speakers, we cannot expect this to happen with the weak local government model we have at the moment. All of this is happening while parties in this Chamber vote through the council every year to reduce the funding available. I look forward very much to the day when we have a directly elected mayor who can raise their own funds and levy taxes in their own way.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> I would like to see a better policing response to crime and antisocial behaviour in our city. There is no suggestion or evidence to support the idea that we can police our way out of this problem or that criminalising those caught in addiction will prevent addiction. It has not worked like that in any other open democracy and it is not going to work here. Many of the problems we have in Dublin City are rooted in addiction, poverty, deprivation and trauma. Unless we in this House take radical steps to tackle that core fact, what we are doing is not going to have a material impact on Dublin's streets. Because we a have a centralised model of government, it will primarily be decisions made in this House, not in Civic Offices on Wood Quay or in Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park, that will make the difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> We have a significant opportunity with the upcoming citizens’ assembly on drug use to radically reform our drug policy. The assembly should not be hamstrung by our current thinking or even by what is viewed as best practice in other countries. We need to talk to those affected, namely, families and communities, look at harm-reduction strategies and drug legalisation and reduce the time and effort being spent on a largely unwinnable war on drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> We need to look at the support we are providing to the communities most impacted by drug addiction; not just support for those in addiction but also support for people long before they fall into addiction. I refer here to supports such as those relating to mental health, sport and education. Right now, I am trying to help a local community crèche in the north inner city find a suitable space. For single-parent families and women who desperately need it, accessing children should not be the struggle that it is. I can tell the House that it is very difficult to find a space.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> We need to look at our model of local government and our funding for it. People in need of support will probably end up finding it in Dublin and other urban council areas. This needs to be recognised in the funding model nationwide. Services should not be concentrated in that way because it serves nobody. Everybody has a right to access services in their local area in a way that is meaningful for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> It is most important that we deal with those caught in addiction in a compassionate manner. I was disappointed by the dehumanising language used recently in respect of this matter and in the discussion relating to O'Connell Street. In one form or another, be it drugs, alcohol, gambling, addiction has probably had an impact on every family in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">We are all aware of the challenging behaviours that accompany all forms of addiction. We are also aware that nobody will make his or her way out of addiction by being ostracised or vilified. We need to give such people support. They need it. Our families, our friends and our communities need our support. They need, for example, supervised injection facilities, a measure passed by this House a full five years ago, but with little progress since. They need their addiction to be treated as a health matter, not a criminal matter. They need politicians to be brave in our reform of drug policy, and that all starts in this House.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Frankie Feighan)<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_623">Today's debate brought back a lot of the love Dubliners have for Dublin, but around the country we have a great love for Dublin as well. I think of the happy times coming up on the Sligo train, maybe to support Sligo Rovers or Roscommon, Leitrim or Sligo - anytime we could beat Dublin, which was not too often. I always remember those great days and happy times. It was a time before mobile phones, when the people of this country always met under Clerys' clock and then made their way around. Deputy Hourigan is right that many people from around the country have made Dublin their home. I see Deputy Durkan, who made his home in Kildare, in the suburbs of Dublin. I think of last summer and the beautiful time I had with my family. We came up to Dublin and took the DART out to Dún Laoghaire and the 46A back in, sitting up at the top of the bus. We went to all the usual places. They cost nothing. You can walk down Grafton Street or around Merrion Square or the Phoenix Park or just take a walk along the Liffey or through Temple Bar and you realise that Dublin is a beautiful city. There was huge positivity here today, and that is lovely to see. I think of places such as Trinity College, the Guinness museum and brewery, and Christchurch and St. Patrick's. I think of going to Croke Park, Dalymount Park and Lansdowne Road, as we still call it, and even Glenmalure Park and Richmond Park. Those are really happy memories. Dublin is our capital city and we are very proud of it. It has a long history, of which we are also very proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> There are significant challenges facing individuals who are socially excluded in Dublin city centre, particularly those who are homeless and living with addiction. That is part of my brief, which I wish to talk about. As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, I have lead responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the strategy across Departments and Government agencies. The national drugs strategy promotes a more compassionate and humane approach to people who use drugs, with addiction treated first and foremost as a public health issue. It is underpinned by the key values of compassion, respect, equality and inclusion. It is a priority for the remaining period of the national drugs strategy to 2025 to develop integrated care pathways and harm reduction responses for high-risk drug users, including people who are homeless, offenders, stimulant users and people who inject drugs, so as to achieve better health outcomes. These high-risk drug users have complex health and social care needs that make them vulnerable to drug overdose and premature death. Integrated care pathways are required to deliver the best outcomes for this cohort. Those pathways connect care settings between GPs, primary and community care providers, community specialist teams and hospital-based specialists. The experience of the Dublin Covid-19 homeless response provides a template for integrated care.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> A key outcome indicator will be the reduction in drug deaths. Strengthening harm reduction responses to high-risk drug use associated with the nighttime economy, including proposals for drug monitoring, forms part of this priority. It is important we show compassion and understanding to people who are affected by drug addiction. As I have said before in this House, using stigmatising language makes it more difficult for these people to access services.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The Department of Health has worked closely with the HSE, drug and alcohol task forces and community-based organisations to provide services for socially excluded groups in Dublin city centre. Those services receive funding of €6.3 million per annum, including funding provided through drug and alcohol task forces. I firmly believe that addressing drug addiction and homelessness in Dublin city centre requires a multipronged approach, providing harm-reduction and prevention initiatives in tandem with treatment services. I wish to inform the House of the following harm-reduction health initiatives for marginalised people in the city centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> During the Covid-19 pandemic, people with addiction issues and those who are homeless were identified as a vulnerable group. Additional funding of €4.2 million was provided to the HSE to expand opioid substitution treatment in 2020 and 2021, with an additional 1,000 clients given access to treatment. The HSE funds an assertive case management team involving Ana Liffey and Coolmine, working with people who are homeless in emergency accommodation in the city centre. That team also does outreach work with people who are homeless on the city streets. The HSE and Dublin City Council fund the law engagement and assisted recovery project in Dublin city centre. That project provides intensive case management services to people entrenched in street life in the city centre, specifically Middle Abbey Street, O'Connell Street and Talbot Street. Ana Liffey also provides city centre outreach and accessible nursing interventions daily to prevent overdose, to provide needle and syringe equipment, including sterile crack pipes, and to address drug litter in the city. It uses a mobile unit and an on-foot backpacking service. This service also trains peers in the use of naloxone, a lifesaving drug in the event of an overdose. I understand that this service works with approximately 350 individuals per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> Housing First is a housing model that aims to eliminate homelessness for people with a history of long-term rough sleeping who have complex needs around substance use and mental health. It provides direct access to permanent housing together with intensive housing and health supports, delivered mainly in the person's new home. From a health perspective, Housing First can be viewed as Sláintecare in action: the right care in the right place at the right time. Housing First is an expression of the Government's determination to break the vicious cycle between homelessness and ill health. As a social determinant of health, being homeless worsens the physical and mental health of those affected and makes people more vulnerable to problematic drug and alcohol use. Furthermore, homelessness undermines the effectiveness of healthcare services as it creates additional barriers for people in accessing treatment in a timely and integrated manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> I reiterate my support for the establishment of a supervised injection facility in Dublin as a public health response to the high incidence of drug-related deaths due to heroin overdose in the city centre. The supervised injecting facility will save lives and reduce street injecting and drug-related litter in the locality. In budget 2023 we secured €4 million to expand the provision of drug and alcohol services to meet changing patterns of drug use and emerging trends. These services will benefit people in Dublin city centre. This investment will expand community-based drug and alcohol services, ensure the sustainability and increase the capacity of residential treatment services, mitigate the impact of drugs on children, families and communities and strengthen drug monitoring and harm reduction. It is anticipated that this additional investment will lead to an increase in numbers accessing drug and alcohol services across all regions; better supports for children and families affected by parental drug and alcohol use; more women and men in recovery from addiction; and a reduction in drug-related harms, overdoses and deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate on supporting the development of Dublin city centre through safety initiatives and the appropriate provision of emergency and other services. I acknowledge Deputies' concern for people who are homeless and living with addiction. I assure them of my commitment to continue to improve healthcare services for this vulnerable group. It was a very measured, useful and informative debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> One area which I think Deputy Hourigan raised was the upcoming citizens' assembly on drug use. The citizens of Ireland have strong emotions and differing opinions on the use of drugs. I think that this citizens' assembly, which will happen early in the new year, will give potential contributions to the Government's health-led approach to drug use.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">All members of society are directly or indirectly affected by drug use. This assembly will be another wonderful way of involving citizens in decision-making on our drug policy. That is appropriate. The community knows best and I look forward to the assembly taking place early in 2023. Arrangements are already in place to hold this assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> It has been a positive debate. Dublin is a magnificent city. It is our city, a city of Ireland but also a city of Ireland and the UK. Many people have come here from the UK, Europe and across the world. We are all proud of our city.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, the best after his incident yesterday. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for coming in and substituting for the question. This is my third time speaking on this issue. I am passionate about it. I served as a county councillor for six years before I had the honour of being elected to this House. I have fundamental concerns about the direction of local democracy, particularly in regard to the issue of the powers of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR. One of the few remaining powers that local councillors have in city and county areas is their development plan. It is the one thing they can take ownership of. It is great that they have that say at local level in their own local electoral areas, counties and cities. I understand the role of the OPR. There has been correspondence between myself; the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien; and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke; in regard to this issue. I can nearly predict the answer that the Minister of State will read out shortly. I understand the role of the OPR but I believe there is over-reach. When the OPR was initially mapped out, I do not believe it was envisaged that it would to go into each and every local area plan in such minute detail.</p>
            <p eId="para_635"> I have spoken here before about the role of the OPR in recommending the dezoning of land that is serviceable. I could speak about instances in Fermoy and Bantry in County Cork. Deputies Stanton and O’Connor in east Cork regularly mention an outlet centre in Carrigtwohill, which is the best example of the OPR’s over-reach. I will give the House an idea of what that relates to. On two occasions, Cork County Council took legal action against the Minister in respect of the OPR’s recommendations and on both occasions the council was vindicated. Despite being vindicated on two separate occasions in two separate legal cases, the OPR continues to recommend to the Minister that he put a halt to this potential outlet centre in east Cork. If a court makes a judgment and that judgment is stood over not once but twice, I do not see how the OPR can put the Minister in a difficult position by continuing to recommend that the project be shelved. Thankfully in that situation the Minister, on foot of receiving his own advice, sided with the county council essentially and did not enforce the OPR’s recommendation. That said, how did the OPR get into a situation where not once but twice it went against two legal judgments? It is reprehensible that it would put the Minister in that position.</p>
            <p eId="para_636"> I understand why the OPR is there. I understand why we must be careful about land zoning in view of the history we have in the State with regard to the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals. For me, the OPR is not the police officer. If there are allegations of impropriety or illegal activity, the Standards in Public Office Commission or some other body that is legislated for should enforce any difficulties with regard to zoning. I do not believe this role was initially envisaged for the OPR. My rant is the same; it is about the OPR over-reaching, particularly in the case of Carrigtwohill when it ill-advised the Minister. I know that the Minister has not always agreed with the OPR. I have asked numerous parliamentary questions about it and obtained the statistics on that. For me, fundamentally it comes back to local democracy in action. If we do not leave these powers with councillors, what are councillors there for?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Mary Butler)<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_637">I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien; and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke. I wish the Minister of State the very best as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_638"> I thank Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan for his question on the activities of the OPR concerning county and city development plans. It is probable that the Deputy has already heard much of the response I am about to give him. The Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, gives the OPR a statutory basis to carry out three main functions. One core function of the OPR is the independent assessment of all local authority and regional assembly statutory plan-making processes. This includes county and city development plans, local area plans, and regional spatial and economic strategies. The OPR provides observations during the drafting of statutory plans. If the OPR finds that a local authority's plans are ultimately not consistent with relevant regional or national policies, it can recommend the use of ministerial powers of direction to bring plans back in line with statutory requirements and best practice. If the Minister does not agree with the recommendations of the OPR, he or she must prepare a statement of reasons for this decision which is then laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> Recommendations issued by the OPR relate to clear breaches of the relevant legislative provisions, the national or regional policy framework or Government policy, as set out in ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Act. As such, the planning authority is required to implement or address recommendations made by the OPR in order to ensure consistency with the relevant policy and legislative provisions. The Minister's powers pursuant to the section 31 process are invoked on receipt of a notice issued by the OPR in accordance with section 31AM(8) of the Act. Since its establishment in April 2019, the OPR has assessed and evaluated 22 city and county development plans to adoption stage. Of the 22 adopted plans, 13 have been the subject of a section 31AM(8) notice letter from the OPR to the Minister of State with responsibility for planning and local government recommending that the Minister issue a draft direction. All 13 draft directions have been issued by the Minister. The OPR has to date recommended that the Minister issue final direction notice letters on 12 of those, with the outstanding one due to be issued to the Minister by mid-January 2023. To date, final section 31 directions have been issued on seven development plans. The remaining recommendations are under consideration by the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_640"> The planning issues which were the subject of the seven section 31 final directions issued by the Minister on county development plan reviews can be summarised generally as follows: excessive and inappropriate land use zonings for a variety of land uses, often in peripheral locations at a remove from settlements or subject to a number of specific site constraints including flooding, access and servicing; the inclusion of conflicting wind energy policies; prohibitive policies related to the banning or limiting of certain types of development; and flood risk management. There have been four occasions when the Minister has decided not to include all of the recommendations made by the OPR in issuing either a draft or a final direction. The four directions in question are as follows: the section 31 draft direction on the Kerry county development plan 2022-28 did not issue on one of the recommendations made by the OPR relating to renewable energy targets; the section 31 final direction on the Cork county development plan 2022-28 did not issue on two of the recommendations made by the OPR relating to retail planning policy, to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred; the section 31 final direction on the Westmeath county development plan 2021-27 did not issue on one of the recommendations made by the OPR relating to renewable energy targets, specifically wind energy; and the section 31 final direction on the Laois county development plan 2022-28 did not issue on one of the recommendations made by the OPR relating to renewable energy targets, specifically wind energy.</p>

            <p eId="para_641">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. She has given me much of the same information I have been given on previous occasions when I have raised this matter. I am not trying to undermine the OPR. In the overall argument, I know the OPR has a job to do. </p>
            <p eId="para_642">While I cannot speak for all of us, most of us here would have started as county councillors and city councillors. We know how important it is locally to our constituents that we are involved in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> The way the OPR has acted at times has been counterproductive to local democracy in action. I note all of the other county development plans that were referenced here but I can speak to Cork. Cork city development plan is still being actively scrutinised by the Minister’s Department pending those recommendations being implemented or not. I know the Minister has said he cannot speak to those, and I understand that. However, of the nine items that are listed in the city council plan, for example, at least three that I am aware of are on serviced land. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has said previously that no serviced sites should be dezoned - he said that on the record - but I can flag three separate occasions in the city plan, which has yet to be adjudicated on, where that has not happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_644"> As I said, I do not want to sound like a broken record but Carrigtwohill is the one that really sticks with me. I think the OPR's recommendation put the Minister in a very tough spot. The court case was quite clear and it was quite clear that the OPR was defeated, essentially, in what it was proposing yet it still went on to recommend to the Minister that it would implement its recommendation. For me, there should be massive alarm bells ringing at that. I know the Minister of State cannot comment on the live issues but I believe the future of local democracy is on the line and now is the time to question it.</p>

            <p eId="para_645">I know the Deputy has raised this issue on several occasions. To conclude, there were four occasions where the Minister had decided not to include all of the recommendations made by the office, and they were in regard to Kerry, Cork, Westmeath and Laois. For each of the four, the Minister has prepared and submitted a statement of reason to both Houses of the Oireachtas as to why he had not agreed with the recommendations of the OPR. As the Deputy said, seven development plans are still undergoing the review process and will remain subject to evaluation and assessment by the OPR.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> It is worth remembering that the Office of the Planning Regulator was formally established in April 2019 on foot of recommendations made by the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments – the Mahon tribunal. The appointment of an independent planning regulator empowered to oversee the planning system in Ireland was one of the key recommendations of the tribunal. Since its establishment, the OPR has been a key part of our national and regional planning infrastructure. It has a valuable role in ensuring that the process and formulation of city and county development plans are consistent with national planning policies. The Office of the Planning Regulator is an independent body tasked with ensuring that local authorities’ plans are consistent with relevant national and regional planning policy objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_647"> The Minister is empowered to direct a planning authority to take specified measures in regard to a development plan further to a recommendation of the OPR. In the case where the Minister does not agree with the recommendation of the OPR, he must prepare a statement of reasons and that is what he has done on four occasions when he has not agreed in regard to some of the recommendations from the OPR.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> I will certainly pass on the Deputy's concerns to the Minister. As I said, I know he has raised this several times before.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">The Ombudsman for Children launched a report in May 2021 detailing the very serious concerns for residents in Spring Lane, Cork. It found that the living conditions were deplorable. The ombudsman’s report had ten recommendations, with 17 actions which needed to be taken. Last November, Deputies Ellis, Joan Collins and I visited the site as part of the committee and, to be upfront, we were absolutely appalled at the conditions the Traveller community had to put up with. They raised concerns with us on the day and we brought these issues back to Cork City Council, which we met later that evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_650"> We have since been contacted by residents to tell us that these issues still have not been resolved a year later. There are issues where toilets are still not up to scratch and are still backing up and flooding during bad weather and Cork City Council has not concreted a bay at the lowest point of the site, which it promised to do last February. One family who spoke to us on the day had a leaking roof; they received a guarantee that this would be addressed but a year on, it is still not sorted. As we go into the winter months, it is very concerning.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Cork City Council need to make sure these issues are addressed with urgency. The reality is that we are 18 months on from this damning report and these families are still living in deplorable conditions. The Minister of State will agree it is totally unacceptable.</p>

            <p eId="para_652">The Ombudsman for Children issued a damning report in May 2021, which said that the rights of Traveller children were being violated at the Spring Lane halting site in Cork. The report details what was described as failure after failure to improve living conditions, with children being left in filthy, overcrowded, rat infested, cold and damp living conditions. It was concerning to say the least that families and young children were living in such atrocious and unsafe conditions. The site required a radical overhaul and extensive refurbishment as a matter of urgency, particularly with regard to washing and toilet facilities and living facilities. The Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community visited the site last year. As a member of the committee on that visit, I can confirm that many of the issues highlighted in the report and raised by the local Traveller community were witnessed by me and by the other members of the committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_653"> Additionally, the report found that the implementation of Traveller accommodation plans had been discriminatory and unfair. We were assured at the time at a meeting with Cork City Council that these issues would be dealt with and it is disappointing that many of these serious issues have not been properly addressed. The outstanding issues need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. At the time, Cork City Council said it would have the system independently equality-proofed in autumn but that does not seem to have happened either. Excuses were made as to the reasons why it did not meet its targets, blaming weather, security events and lengthy court proceedings. It is simply not acceptable. We need action.</p>

            <p eId="para_654">The Office of the Ombudsman for Children published “No End in Site” in May 2021. One of the recommendations, at section 7.14.2,states, “That a system is in place to ensure routine and emergency maintenance works and upgrade works are addressed in a timely manner and that contracts with external service providers are proactively managed.” Cork City Council formally responded to this, stating it would put an updated system in place to ensure routine and emergency maintenance and upgrade works are carried out efficiently in quarter 4 of 2021. We are now in quarter 4 of 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> As Deputies Ellis and Mitchell said, we visited the site last year and were appalled at the conditions people were living in. We met one mother of a large family and the family's youngest son, who suffers from the rare Williams syndrome. They highlighted the damage caused to the roof of the family’s Portakabin. The matter had been reported to Cork City Council prior to our visit but it saddens me to report that, almost one year later, the matter remains unaddressed. In fact, it has got worse, as the roof started leaking and the leak has got steadily worse. The mother said on Friday that she can only imagine what will happen given the heavy rains, and today is the first clear rain day in Cork over the past four weeks. There was also another situation where a family at the lowest end of the site had literally to step into a mini-swimming pool to get out of their unit, even though three contractors had already submitted assessments to put in concrete flooring. This cannot go on.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">The Traveller accommodation unit of the Department should be following this up strictly with Cork City Council and directing it to implement the things it was supposed to do and fix the issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_657">I compliment the Oireachtas committee members who have taken such an interest in the Spring Lane halting site. I am aware of the ombudsman's report. It is disappointing to hear from all three Deputies that things have not improved after the site having been visited and funding provided. I agree wholeheartedly that these issues need to be addressed urgently. I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 provides that local authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes in their areas in order to meet the identified accommodation needs. The role of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is to ensure there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding. </p>
            <p eId="para_659"> The 2022 budget provision is €18 million, an increase of €2.5 million on 2021, and I am pleased to note this will increase further in 2023, to €20 million. The full capital provision of €15.5 million was expended in 2021 providing Traveller-specific accommodation and, this year, is on course for full spend.</p>
            <p eId="para_660"> Cork City Council is working on a range of measures in response to the recommendations in No End in Site, the report of the Ombudsman for Children's Office, in order to improve conditions on the halting site. I am informed by the Minister's office that the council is focusing on immediate short-term measures, as well as progressing projects to provide a longer-term response to the accommodation needs of the families on site. The Department undertakes regular monthly meetings with Cork City Council in order to monitor progress by the council, while also ensuring the necessary supports are available in a timely manner. To this end, the Department has provided funding of more than €1.4 million for improvement works at Spring Lane halting site since 2015. In addition, a mediator funded by the Department has been appointed to assist the council in assessing the needs of individual families on a continuous basis to establish long-term housing solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> The Department is informed that the city council is working towards publishing a Part 8 planning application for the redevelopment of both Spring Lane and Ellis Yard as well as a third local authority development which will provide long-term accommodation for the families. Funding of more than €6 million has been approved by the Department for plans under way by the council for the development of a group housing scheme at the adjacent and disused Ellis Yard site. In addition, Cork City Council is preparing a number of applications under the pilot caravan loan scheme, introduced by the Department, which supports the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation by providing preferential loans to Travellers to purchase their own caravan for use as their primary residence on halting sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> Meeting the needs of all Traveller communities continues to be a priority for the local authorities and the Department under my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> I have been working closely with Travellers in respect of mental health. Last week, I was at Pavee Point when a new website at <i>youngpavee</i>.<i>ie</i> was launched. The website is entitled Mind Your Nuck. Nuck means head. I was delighted to work with young Travellers that day. In the context of providing mental health supports for Travellers, it is important to note that this is a cross-departmental issue that may involve inadequate housing, social welfare or education, and the relevant Departments have to work together. I have noticed that the mental health of Travellers can be seriously impacted by their living conditions. Although I see that the Minister has put the financial supports in place, it is disappointing that little has changed heading into winter.</p>

            <p eId="para_664">I thank the Minister of State. I agree with her. Although the response from the Department speaks to looking to the future, we have to support the families on the halting site in the now. I appeal to her to go back to the Department and ask it to look at the issues this community is experiencing in the context of maintenance. The Department needs to ensure that, for now, the roof is fixed and the concrete bay put in, and then we can go forward with the other plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community published its report last year in this House. The report set out 18 recommendations relating to accommodation for Travellers. One of the recommendations was that an audit of all sites be carried out to examine the living conditions. It is not the brief of the Minister of State but could she ask the Minister for housing whether any of those audits have taken place? If they have not, will she ask him when they will take place?</p>

            <p eId="para_666">The Minister stated that €1.4 million has been allocated to Spring Lane since 2015. I wonder how much of that ended up as an underspend. That is what has happened across the country. We have seen underspend on many projects relating to the Traveller community.</p>
            <p eId="para_667"> I was impressed by the resilience of the community on the halting site. They greeted us and brought us into their homes. Even though the conditions there were so bad, they were still in great spirits and very welcoming. The Minister of State mentioned the that the council is considering another site and that Part 8 has gone through, but I hope that is being done in proper consultation with all the people on Spring Lane and that no one is left out. I ask the Minister of State to ensure there is consultation. There are many issues happening in this situation. Young kids are missing out on education because of the conditions on the halting site. It is also giving rise to issues relating to mental health, as the Minister of State recognised.</p>

            <p eId="para_668">There are two issues here. The first is the long-term development of Spring Lane, and that seems to be moving along. What is not being addressed, however, is the maintenance of the halting site at the moment. The Cork Traveller Visibility Group wrote to us in that regard. The letter states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_669">As you should know, [this family's] temporary, makeshift bay is one of the lowest points of the site, ... one of the places which floods first and worst. The family has been both self advocating and advocating through the local Traveller organisations for improvements to their immediate living circumstances, the required 'upgrade works', as the long-term permanent accommodation is still several years in the future.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_670"> The basic improvements the family has been looking for includes a permanent, raised surface in the temporary bay ... including measures to take rainwater away, a proper step into the mobile home, and a covering to the underside of the mobile home to improve heat retention and to aid rodent control.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">The council came back after three procurements and three companies going to the site and said that all the Traveller accommodation unit could do was to put a temporary base on the mobile home and it did not have the back of the mobile home to improve the heat retention. It has not even implemented what it put money into getting procurement for. It is now saying it is not implementing what it paid those people to do. I do not believe a word out of Cork City Council's mouth when it comes to the Travelling community at Spring Lane. The council has not delivered on what it said it would do, which is to deal with maintenance.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">As regards the points made, it appears that plans are in place for a long-term solution, with €6 million having been approved by the Department for plans under way by the council for the development of a group housing scheme at the adjacent and disused Ellis Yard and the redevelopment of Spring Lane and Ellis Yard. Officials from Cork City Council have been in ongoing engagement with the families on the site, with the aid of mediators funded by the Department, which is welcome, to reach agreement on long-term accommodation solutions for the families. We all welcome that but the issue seems to relate to what needs to be done in the short term. The Department is saying it will continue its ongoing engagement with the city council to provide the necessary supports to ensure the council is well positioned to meet the challenges in this case in a timely manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> I again compliment the Oireachtas committee. It is really proactive of the Deputies to go down to Cork, meet the Travelling community and get feedback afterwards. I will bring it all back to the Minister because, as I said, it crosses over to my brief. We have a plan coming shortly. It will relate specifically to the health and mental health of the Travelling community.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">If people's living conditions are not appropriate, it is very hard for that not to affect their physical and mental health. I thank all three Deputies for coming together on this matter. I will certainly feed it back. </p>

            <p eId="para_678">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for again affording me the opportunity to raise this issue in the House. As he knows, I raised it several weeks ago, when he gave me permission to do so, as did the Leas-Cheann Comhairle subsequently. Since then, matters have got worse as opposed to better. Normally, as the Ceann Comhairle knows, if one raises a matter in this House, there is usually a hurried rush to make changes and to ensure nothing is happening that should not be happening. That is not the case in this situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_679"> The situation continues whereby mothers, in the course of their rightful entitlement to go before the family law courts, are being ridiculed, despised and treated with contempt, and are having their self-esteem and confidence removed from them to such an extent that they are now afraid to go back to the courts in case they lose. In fact, they know they will lose. They are losing all the time. The rule of law does not apply to them. Due process and natural justice is no longer available to them because in the confrontational system that now applies in the courts, there is a bargaining situation between custody and whatever else might be available or possible in a settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> We all know that people fall in and out of love. I am not making any complaint about that at all; it happens. It is an extraordinary situation, however, whereby a gentleman in the United States some years back coined the phrase, "parental alienation", on the basis that children should be examined to find out the cause of their dissatisfaction with one parent or the other. This is after a separation. There is a simple answer to it: there is a separation. It is not the same as before. Something needs to be done to help out and not make the situation worse, but that goes on.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> There are situations where constituents of the Ceann Comhairle's and mine have been put in cells while going through the process and their future was discussed in their absence. That is an amazing situation in a democracy. There have been situations where children have been taken away in the middle of the night, placed in very doubtful custody circumstances and locations, and where cases of sexual violence, and attacks made on that basis, have been subsequently brought to the attention of the institutions concerned. This is an appalling situation. It is particularly appalling in the context of the veil of secrecy and the veil of the<i> in camera</i> rule that protects everybody involved and nobody can ask questions about it. As the Ceann Comhairle knows, he allowed Members to raise questions about this, thankfully. I identified some of the chief conspirators, as I call them, in this particular situation. It is not them exclusively; more than one institution is involved. The fact remains, however, that women who are mothers are being treated despicably in the first place and children are being treated with absolute contempt when, for example, gardaí were ordered to go into a school, remove the children from the classroom, and place them in the custody of the other party.</p>
            <p eId="para_682"> This is not one occurrence but several. It continues to be the case that a parent is not allowed to rebut the allegation made against her in court. I presume it is because she is a woman. The system is so overbearing insofar as women are concerned. We thought that, down through the years, we had produced legislation in this House to protect women and children. We did so but that protection is not happening. It has now been brought to public attention again.</p>
            <p eId="para_683"> I thank the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, for bringing in new rules for the conduct of cases. That is important but we need to deal with the particular issue that prevails at this time and the victims of it.</p>

There have been a whole host of questions from the Deputy on this particular matter and, with very few exceptions, the advice I have got is to rule him out of order, which I have not done. The reason I have not is that while I fully accept the separation of powers, I also fully accept that Deputy Durkan is a long-serving, distinguished Member of this House who does not raise matters without good reason. He has consistently raised this matter and he is entitled to get a proper and adequate response. I do not know what the response should be.

            <p eId="para_685">I convey the apologies of my colleague, the Minster for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who cannot be here for this matter due to another commitment. I am happy to respond on her behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> On behalf of the Minister, I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this important matter and for giving me the opportunity to provide clarity on some issues. As the Deputy is aware, I am unable to comment on any individual case or category of cases. The Deputy may be interested to know that, yesterday, the Minister published the first national family justice strategy and secured Government approval for the family court Bill 2022, which will be published in the coming days. These are the mechanisms by which the Minister intends to reform how our family justice system operates to make it more efficient, more user-friendly and less adversarial, and to develop a system that puts the family at the centre of its work. Everybody will welcome that. This is a key commitment in the Minister's Justice Plan 2022. The family court Bill will provide many of the building blocks essential to the reform of the family justice system. The Bill will create new dedicated family courts as divisions within the existing court structures, with family court judges assigned on a full-time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> To support the legislative changes proposed in the family court Bill, the Minister established a family justice oversight group to develop the first national strategy for the reform of the family justice system. The oversight group was chaired by the Department of Justice and made up of representatives from the main statutory agencies across the family justice system. The work of the group was informed by a wide-ranging consultation process. As well as relevant stakeholders and members of the public, a bespoke consultation took place with children and young people who engage with the family justice system. The strategy has nine goals and more than 50 actions, with the aim of establishing a strong foundation for a future system that will be child and family centred, and more streamlined and user-friendly, which everybody will welcome. Among the actions in the strategy is the examination of the role of expert reports in the family law process and to make recommendations regarding their future application and function.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> In addition to this progress, the Minister recently held a public consultation on the topic of parental alienation, which the Deputy referred to. This provided a valuable opportunity to stakeholders and citizens to express their views on this complex issue and inform her Department's thinking on whether any legislative or policy changes may be required. All views, opinions and experiences submitted as part of that consultation have been welcomed and the responses received are under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">We can never ignore lived experience so I hope this answers some of the Deputy's questions. </p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_690">I thank the Minister of State and the Department for attaching importance to this issue. That deals with the issue for the future, which I welcome. Unfortunately, it does not deal with the current situation, which continues unabated. The question of parental alienation was always scoffed at by contributors in family law. It is regarded as a flawed resolution to a particular problem, which creates a further problem at the expense of mothers.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> We as creators of the law have put in place the necessary procedures whereby women and children are protected. We learn from past experience again and again over the years that we should have listened to the children. Remember that? We spoke about it in this House several times. What the children are saying is a warning to us in these cases but their warnings and those of their mothers are being dismissed. This cannot continue and it will not continue. Whatever must be done will be done in the shortest possible time to release from that burden the people who are suffering because mothers and children are part of the population of this country. They are in an area where they expect to be well treated and get due process and natural justice. They are not getting it. It is slowly stripping away from them any power and voice they thought they had and it is sad that we have to make this reference. I hope to see some dramatic changes in the next few days as to what might be done to deal with the system that cannot go on. </p>

            <p eId="para_692">On behalf of the Minister, I again thank Deputy Durkan for raising this really important matter. The Minister intends to reform how our family law system operates to make it more efficient and user-friendly and less adversarial and to develop a system that puts the family at the centre of its work. That is very welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> The Department also arranged for a separate strand of independent research on parental alienation to be carried out last year. The Minister is pleased to say that a draft report has been received by the Department and is being reviewed. It is expected that the research and the public consultation will create a deeper understanding of the issue and inform the Department's consideration of policy in law in this area. Work is ongoing to integrate these strands of work and the Minister expects a report outlining the outcome of the research and consultation process and any resulting recommendations. I take on board the Deputy's point. This is really welcome news and cannot happen soon enough but it is the immediate term about which the Deputy is concerned and I will certainly pass on his comments to the Minister. </p>

          <speech by="#DuncanSmith" eId="spk_272">
            <from>Deputy Duncan Smith<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_694">The increase in tolls came as a bolt out of the blue for everyone, including Government, today. I am probably the only Deputy in this Chamber who does not have to go through a toll to get to Leinster House. I am looking at the M7, M8 and M9. We are all used to paying tolls. The M50 and the Dublin Port Tunnel are in my county.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> This is not about tolling as a revenue raiser. Nobody likes paying tolls but it is accepted across the world as a way of paying for a road system. This is not about raising money for climate or congestion measures. It would be a totally different argument if it was. This is raising tolls to the maximum allowable under the existing contract by eight private companies in PPPs with the State for the running of a toll road system and the M50, which is wholly State-owned. The M50 brought in €140 million in revenue last year, which was a year of curtailed movement and economic activity, and €1.2 billion over the past ten years. These are huge revenue raisers for the State for reinvestment in our road network. </p>
            <p eId="para_696"> What has happened now is just a undefined and unexplained grab for the maximum allowable revenue by these companies under the guise of keeping up with inflation. We have an Oireachtas transport committee, a Committee of Public Accounts and the Dáil. We have spokespeople who can be contacted directly. We have plenty of opportunities for TII to come to us and say "we know we are in a cost-of-living crisis but these companies feel they need to raise that" and to let us interrogate that. I do not believe they need to raise tolls. The Tánaiste said today that he is not happy with it, that it caught him by surprise and that now this has been announced, the Government will engage. I hope that as the sun sets and rises tomorrow, the Government does not think this has moved on and that people will just absorb another ten, 20 or 30 cent increase in their tolls. I will use my local example. If you have to travel from Swords to Ballymount to go through the M50 every day, that is €110 to €120 per month for tolling alone excluding fuel costs, which as we know, have increased by 60% to 70% over the past year. We know the external reasons for the increase in the price of fuel. We will not go into them. However, this is something the State has a direct interest in and can influence and control. I know the Minister of State does not have responsibility for this but we cannot just have a script that mentions the contract and TII. The Government can act here. It can contact TII. TII will accept a phone call. The Government can engage with these companies. </p>
            <p eId="para_697"> People are making micro-savings in their weekly budgets to put food on their table and heat their homes. Everything is down to the euro and the cent so this makes a big difference. This cannot just be allowed to slip through. There should be a price freeze. I want to be clear that this is not about tolling in general. It is about this toll and this price increase. </p>

            <p eId="para_698">I think I drew the short straw today. I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of the Minister for Transport. I was very glad that I was here for Leaders' Questions because this issue was raised and the Tánaiste answered and it was also raised under Questions on Promised Legislation. I reiterate what the Tánaiste said today. He said that we are not happy about it and that "obviously, news of the increase is not welcome.". He was unaware of it before it happened and he said the issue would be taken up with TII when the details of its proposals are published. I welcome the fact that the Government will take it up with TII because the setting of tolls is a statutory function of TII. In line with that statutory function, the TII board has agreed to a toll increase for 2023 on the M50. TII has also reviewed and agreed with the toll increases submitted by the PPP companies for the eight PPP routes. There will be no changes to toll rates for the Dublin Port Tunnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">I am with the Deputy on this issue. This came out of the blue. It was not what we were expecting and I welcome the Tánaiste's words today.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DuncanSmith" eId="spk_274">
            <from>Deputy Duncan Smith<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_700">I hope he follows through. I was not expecting this today. I was not down to speak today. I am usually a suit man when I am speaking in the Dáil but this issue is such that I had to submit a Topical Issue matter. People are angry about this. Sometimes an issue can be the straw that breaks the camel's back. These tolling companies do not have to put their prices up. I have never read an article stating that tolling companies have lost money or even broke even. These are cash cows and rake in the money. It is not just on the M50 but all over the country. This is a licence to print money. These are some of the most attractive companies for public-private partnership, PPP, contracts. They are cash cows.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> This is gouging at a time when we have a cost-of-living crisis where every cent counts. I call on the Government to take action and put pressure on these companies. They will have to respond because, ultimately, the Government and the State are the gatekeepers for all future contracts. They own the roads. If the Government and the State come down heavily on these companies, they will have to respond and extend a freeze through the winter and into 2023. We cannot just accept this development based on some loose inflationary reason. These companies are cash cows and this is gouging people. The Minister of State has said she is with me.</p>

            <p eId="para_704">I will set out the position. Toll revenue is used for purposes that include motorway maintenance, toll collection and operation and for the maintenance of the wider national road network. Nobody is happy about this increase, but these are the facts. The money is reinvested. Returning to the point the Deputy is raising, in a time of inflationary cycles people are at the pin of their collars. This development goes against everything we tried to achieve in the budget. This week, for example, recipients of the fuel allowance will get a one-off payment of €400, while anyone on the living alone allowance will receive a payment of €200. Carers and those on disability payments will receive a one-off payment of €500. This is welcome and will go some way to alleviate the pressures. Moving away from the script, what we heard today concerning an increase in tolls is in total contradiction in this regard. I will certainly bring the Deputy's concerns back. As I said, I was heartened by what the Tánaiste said in the House today. He repeated that twice when the matter was raised, so it is timely that the Deputy raised the issue today.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelCollins2016" eId="spk_278">
          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_705">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> I apologise for the absence of Deputy Mattie McGrath. He genuinely wanted to be here this evening but is unable to be with us. He has put a great deal of work into this Bill, along with others, as I will explain. The Deputy sends his apologies.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> This Rural Independent Group has the overarching objective of protecting the family farm and the linked family home from the ruthless and speculative practices of vulture funds. We believe this Bill is innovative and clear-cut. This legislation, if passed, would give solid protections to family farms and family homes from ruthless vulture funds, while also providing low-interest loans for farmers. This Private Members' Bill is sponsored by the six Rural Independent Group Deputies and it was carefully crafted by the former Master of the High Court, Mr. Ed Honohan. We acknowledge the tremendous work carried out by Mr. Honohan and Brian O'Reilly. I thank them for their sterling service. I also thank Brian Ó Domhnaill and Máiread in our office and all those in the Gallery who played some part in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> Farms are being repossessed in rural Ireland and lands that have been in families for generations are being sold off by vulture funds. Some banks are selling off agricultural debts to multinational property asset companies, which subsequently demand immediate payment of moneys owed. Fears are growing that an entire generation of farmers could be wiped out, thereby stalling hopes of a sustainable rural recovery. Vast tracts of land are now in the hands of vulture funds and farmers are under immense pressure. When farmers lose their land, they not only lose an asset but also their income. The stress and anxiety experienced by these farmers have led to countless suicides. My colleagues and I have often highlighted the number of suicides directly linked to the financial pressures arising from banks and financial institutions chasing their debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> In the absence of the Government coming forward with strict legislation to regulate vulture funds, the activities of which will wipe out a generation of farmers, we have crafted this Bill to address the problems. The current situation cannot continue. We are seeing young people lose interest in farming when they see the stress and anxiety their parents are suffering. If this continues, it will spell the destruction of rural communities and be a further drain on the mental health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> All banks are acting in a manner that is not acceptable in piling stress and misery on embattled farmers. They are destroying viable farms and undermining the recovery in rural areas. Another serious issue emerging is the refusal of banks to release sites to the sons or daughters of farmers who are paying off a loan. For too long, the Government has facilitated vulture funds and banks to seize and sell family farms. This Bill would create a policy platform to tip the scales back in favour of landowners and farmers and is all about protecting the small man or woman against predatory financial institutions. The agrifood sector and the role of farmers in the Irish economy is of systemic importance and is generating gross value added equating to €14.4 billion a year. Furthermore, the sector employs one in every ten workers in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> Farmers are under attack from all quarters. First, the Government is targeting deep cuts to farmers’ ability to earn a living through climate action reductions and an inadequate new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP. Second, banks and vulture funds continue to seize and sell off family farms all over the country, with Government policy stacked in favour of these institutions. We have observed at first hand the destruction and crippling impacts these forfeitures have caused to families and rural communities. This is why we have brought forward this imaginative new Bill. It is well known that international vulture funds are a massive threat to many Irish family farms and linked family homes. Unfortunately, the Government has allowed those faceless funds to destroy families by seizing and selling viable family farms.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> Our Bill would limit these merciless practices and tip the scales back in favour of farm families by delivering legislative protection against the predatory practices of vulture funds and financial institutions. For example, recent figures from the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, have estimated that between 2,500 and 3,000 family farms may be in danger of seizure by vulture funds, with the total amount of land involved being up to 150,000 acres. However, the number is likely to be even higher than this, particularly as we enter a high interest rate environment which will place greater financial pressures on all borrowers, including farmers. Therefore, this is a very serious threat to all rural communities, and we believe this Bill provides a genuine legal framework to put ordinary people first by at least giving them a fairer level of legislative protections.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> Vulture funds do not operate in the open. Instead, they use little known corporate entities to avoid open scrutiny and adverse publicity. The Government has facilitated this practice by allowing these funds to seize and sell off family farms all over the country. The reality is that in the years to come vulture funds will be closing in on hundreds of farms. This is due to legacy debt and the sale of mortgage portfolios to global funds by pillar banks. An example is the exiting transfers from Ulster Bank and KBC. This will result in these funds scooping up indebted properties, unless legislation, such as this Bill, is passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The vulture funds' primary interest is in the assets, not the debt. We know these funds are attracted to the agricultural property and lands that secure debts. Farmers are now struggling to get loans from other banks to pay moneys back to the hedge funds and some are being left with very few options. This is why our Bill also provides for a State-backed, low interest loan scheme for farmers. Ireland’s banking cartel of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks do not understand the pressures farmers are under. To be honest, these banks do not care. They operate a system whereby if people fail to pay, they lose. Unless proper laws are in place to protect these people, there will be a free run for the vulture funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Farm families are being terrorised by these funds. It is simply not acceptable for the State to allow vulture funds to force the sale of land that has come as security with a debt bought from a bank when there are other viable alternatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The laws are stacked in favour of the funds, as we have observed first-hand on many occasions. That is why we have brought forward this imaginative new Bill. My colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group, in conjunction with the former Master of the High Court, Mr. Ed Honohan, are confident that if this Bill were passed into law, farm families would be given the best possible legislative protection against the speculative practices of vulture funds and receivers. We strongly encourage all Deputies to join us and vote in favour of this Bill. In reality, to vote against this Bill would be akin to protecting the rights of the vulture funds over the interests of the family farm.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> This Bill would also pave the way for a new State-run institution that would extend low-interest credit to all farm enterprises. It would be a paradigm shift, allowing access to capital and credit in rural Ireland, boosting the entire rural economy and pivoting regional development in the process. This Bill provides a new approach to credit and impaired credit which is unique to the farm enterprise. Therefore, it is hoped the Government will accept the genuine spirit in which this Bill is tabled and work with us to progress it through this House and on to the next Stage, Committee Stage. Naturally, we would be happy to work with the Government, or anyone else for that matter, and would welcome amendments on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> Likewise, we invite all stakeholders to engage in a searching reappraisal of the current dysfunction in the banking model as it applies to Irish agriculture. For instance, in other countries, farmers have access to low-cost or almost zero-interest loans. In Ireland, our farmers are at the full greedy mercy of high-interest loans from banks. We fully expect that the usual gang of anonymous and highly paid banking lobbyists will beat a path to the doors of any Minister or Government Deputy who might appreciate a briefing on the measures in this Bill in a desperate attempt to block or delay open discussion to protect the interests of the banks. The defining outcome of those lobbying efforts will rest in whether Government Deputies will vote in favour of this Bill when a vote is called. Shadowy figures from the banking world should not be allowed to derail this Bill because it challenges their profits margins. Rather than the usual behind-closed-doors lobbying by the banking elites, we invite and strongly suggest that all those individuals and institutions should come on the record and direct their observations to the relevant Oireachtas committee during Committee Stage deliberation of this Bill, where they can be the subject of constructive analysis. It would be nice, for once, to hear a Minister undertaking to put on the record of the House a full record of all comments he receives - front door or back channel - when it comes to this Bill. Such an undertaking might be the key to open and transparent debate. That is why we invite all Deputies will take a brave step and support this Bill, on Second Stage and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> In drafting this Bill, we were drawn to remarks made by the renowned professor of economics at Princeton University, Dr. Atif Mian, which strongly criticised the Irish Government's policy which favours the interest of banks and vulture funds over the best interests of borrowers. Professor Mian has said that Ireland's "harsh, creditor-friendly laws" meant that households were bearing too much of the burden of strict mortgage rules and that it would be better for the economy if people could get out from under their debts more easily.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> The potential of interest rate increases coming down the line will have a very substantial impact on people in arrears, as the interest will accumulate faster, and will likely also increase the number of people falling into mortgage arrears. All in all, this represents a serious hangover from the financial crash that has not been addressed by any government over the past decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> It is important to remember that agriculture is a work in progress at any point in time. The common good is best served by keeping Irish land in the hands of Irish farmers rather than giving it over to banks and vulture funds. Food security issues are also in play but the nation's lands, as the sovereign asset, must be shielded against disinterested speculators. For instance, section 12 of the 1965 Land Act will filter all land transfers through the Minister's hands, and his scope of discretion within EU principles is more extensive than might at first appear. There may come a time, as an alternative option, for example, when farmland threatened with foreclosure and with no prospect of farm debt settlement arrangement, for whatever reason, must be optioned to the State, rather than sold to a foreign vulture fund, to be returned to full State ownership but under the stewardship of the farmer prepared to manage the lands to benefit the environment through biodiversity and even rewilding.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> This Bill would not be possible without the exceptional and invaluable voluntary contribution of the former Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan. Mr. Honohan's first-hand knowledge of the difficulties faced by farm families and his exceptional legal expertise have been instrumental to the publication of this Bill. My colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group are very pleased the Bill is before the House. Earlier in the year, we held a parliamentary briefing session in the audiovisual room, to which every Deputy was invited, to inform all Members of the Oireachtas about the merits and objectives of the legislative provisions. That session was addressed by the former master, Mr. Honohan. We sincerely hope all Deputies will join us and fully support the Bill and the farm families it seeks to assist. After all, without substantial local agriculture in local ownership, the towns will be blighted and rural Ireland will continue to decline. For far too long, the pillar banks have used and abused the farming sector in this country. Our Bill would pave the way for a new State-run institution that would extend low-interest credit to all farm enterprises in a specialised manner. It would be a paradigm shift, allowing access to capital and credit in rural Ireland, boosting the entire rural economy and pivoting regional development in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> There are four main objectives of this Bill, including a moratorium monitored by a receiver. During the moratorium, the receiver will not be permitted to negotiate the sale of the security or place the farm on the market, and farming will continue as usual. The Bill provides for an effective legal moratorium. After the moratorium, a farm debt settlement arrangement will be subject to court approval, and the personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, section 115A veto override will be open to the court, which would allow the borrower to hold on to the farm after an appropriate discharge of structured debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Second, the farmhouse would be an excluded parcel, with the division of the collateral into two parcels - the farmlands and the farmhouse. The Bill provides for the debt to remain charged on both but, crucially, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, including the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, will apply to the farmhouse. This will give the family home legislative protections under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears process and the MARP.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> Third, the inactive co-borrower, often the wife, is protected. The co-owner can sometimes be casually involved as a co-borrower, although not a farmer. The law currently offers little protection. The spouse's version of events is usually undocumented, and the banks' formal files are rarely opened to the court. With the presumed admissibility of these hearsay records as evidence of the truth of the record, since the Oireachtas passed the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020, the scales of justice favour the lender if there is a factual dispute. Where a fact is presumed, it cannot be disputed.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> The fourth is the proactive measures to secure the future. Often, difficulties in predicting the impact of anticipated shocks, for example, Brexit, CAP reform, climate and weather extremes, make formal risk assessment for credit to the farming sector a matter of guesswork, but the sector will need more credit. Standard intermediation or traditional bank lending will not be enough to protect the long-term future of Irish agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> We believe that the State has an opportunity to create cross-Border access to liquidity pools that cater for investors, including, in particular, ESG funds, at competitive rates. The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, can offer such funds credit default swaps. This would allow the State to establish a new State-backed bank for the agriculture sector that can offer farmers low-cost loans.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Charlie McConalogue)<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_728">At the outset, I acknowledge the work of Deputy Collins, his colleagues and Mr. Honohan and the work and consideration that has gone into the Bill. I also acknowledge that the intentions behind the Bill are genuine and that the primary concerns of the Deputies are based on protecting the family farm. We all share that concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> The family farm is the bedrock of our €14 billion export sector and it ensures a balanced regional economy. It plays a huge role in the fabric of all our lives. The Irish farming model is almost exclusively based on the family farm. Approximately 30% of our farms, mainly dairy and tillage, are classified as full-time in terms of labour input required but still relying mainly on family workers. However, the majority of Irish farms are part-time small-scale family farms relying on diverse income streams, including off-farm employment. That structure undoubtedly has its challenges but it is the family story behind Irish food and drink which is part of what makes it unique for our own consumers and for consumers all over the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> Farmers are the foundations of our sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">For them this is not just a business, it is a tradition and an honour that is passed down from generation to generation. Farmers are the first to recognise that for this to continue it must be done sustainably. I know this first hand. I was born on a suckler and sheep farm in north Inishowen in Donegal. It is a farm that reared me and my five siblings. I was honoured to run the farm before entering politics. It is now run by my brother.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Every family hopes the farm will be handed down to the next generation when the time is right. Protecting and enhancing farm incomes is at the very heart of everything I do as Minister. Our shared vision for the future of the sector, Food Vision 2030, states that for farming the family farm model is key to economic, social and environmental sustainability. In common with everyone in the House I really want to protect this model. However, I do not believe the Bill will assist farm families. Fundamentally the restrictions it places on debt recovery in the sector are such as to dissuade financial institutions from lending to the sector in future. Land mobility is very important as is access to land.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> Primary responsibility for banking and credit policy lies with my colleague the Minister for Finance while enterprise policy lies is with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Access to finance is a crucial business need. As well as liaising with the main banks on issues relating to the agrifood sector, the Department and I work closely with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and that Department, as well as the Minister for Finance and that Department. This has been a good working partnership that has yielded important supports for businesses through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. This was to ensure they had access to finance to help deal with the challenges brought about by Brexit, Covid-19 and the impact of the war in Ukraine. Finance for business is required for two main reasons. The first is as working capital to ensure the efficient functioning of businesses on a day-to-day basis. The second is as investment capital to develop and evolve to meet future needs and challenges. I am working to ensure farmers, fishers and food businesses have access to appropriate supports, whether through private provision or with the help of State-backed schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> As a small economy, we must pull our resources to provide appropriate business supports, for example, the future growth loan scheme supports strategic long-term capital investment by small and medium enterprises, farmers and fishers and delivers approximately €800 million in competitively priced loans. The unique characteristic of the scheme is that loans of up to €500,000 are unsecured making it a viable source finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It also serves smaller-scale farmers who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institutions. The future growth loan scheme has been in high demand generally and especially in the agrifood sector, with approximately 46% of loans by number and 31% by value. This represents loans to 1,289 farmers with a value of €155 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> The agrifood sector has a demonstrated capacity to plan for the long term even when grappling with more immediate challenges. The Government also delivered the Brexit impact loan scheme to businesses impacted by Brexit, including farmers, for working capital, investment and refinancing. This was then extended to Covid-19 impacted businesses when the worst effects of the pandemic were being felt. Again, large numbers of farmers and businesses in the agrifood sector generally were able to avail of these initiatives, with 55% of the overall number of loans and a value of 40%, or 850 farmers and a value of €68 million in loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> In addition, in response to liquidity concerns when the pandemic hit, the Government introduced the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme with a capacity of up to €2 billion to facilitate the provision of eligible financial products to Covid-19 impacted SMEs and small mid-caps including farmers. In budget 2023 I was happy to announce with the Tánaiste the development of a new long-term lending scheme. It will ensure there is an appropriate option available to farmers, fishers and food businesses to access finance for strategic and investment purposes. The new proposed €500 million growth and sustainability loan scheme, GSLS, will facilitate strategic investment by farmers, fishers and businesses and ensure their continued viability and sustainability. We are also working together on a Ukraine credit guarantee scheme to assist businesses, including farmers, fishers and food businesses, to meet their liquidity and development needs especially in this time of economic uncertainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> All the main banks have specific agricultural products and services, including dedicated advisory services. I speak with the banks regularly to ensure the sector is well serviced. Central Bank data shows that credit advanced to primary agriculture was €686 million last year and has been consistently at this level over the past decade. Credit outstanding at the end of 2021 was just over €3 billion, slightly lower than the €3.3 billion outstanding the year before but down from a high level of €4.7 billion in 2010. We monitor debt levels on an ongoing basis. The Teagasc national farm survey for 2021 shows that across all farm systems six out of ten farms have no farm business related debt. However this figure varies considerably, as we can imagine and understand, by farm type. Two thirds of dairy farms had borrowings in 2021 compared to one third of cattle farms. Just over one third of sheep farms had outstanding farm debt in 2021 with close to half of all tillage farms reporting borrowings. </p>
          <p eId="para_738"> When farms without debt are excluded, the average dairy farm debt last year was €139,000. The average debt on cattle rearing farms was almost €30,000 at €29,900, with cattle finishing farms having an average debt of €46,700. On sheep farms it was just over €21,000. The data indicate the average debt on tillage farms was €64,000. The majority of farm-related debt, at approximately 72%, was classified as medium to long-term with a further 18% relating to hire purchase or leasing and the remaining 8% considered to be short-term debt such as overdrafts. This data on credit advanced and credit outstanding strongly suggests the primary agriculture sector is well placed to manage debt and default rates are generally among the lowest in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> Introducing the Bill and its conditions and requirements would immediately jeopardise farmers' participation in any horizontal access to finance supports. It would also jeopardise their ability to access credit generally. In addition, the Government opposes the Impaired Farm Credit Bill 2022 on the grounds that impaired farm credit arrangements are already provided for under company law where the farm business is incorporated as a limited company, or under personal insolvency law where the farm business operates as a sole trader as is the case in the vast majority of instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> Existing legislation for personal or company insolvency already requires well tried and known pathways for resolving farm debt as well as any other collateralised debt. Section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act allows courts to impose debt restructure on secured creditors. It is a very carefully balanced and exceptional provision and strikes a very carefully calibrated balance between the various constitutional rights concerned. It was introduced only after very detailed impact assessment, policy analysis and consultations between all relevant Departments and the office of the Attorney General. The Central Bank has a code of conduct on mortgage arrears which sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or in pre-arrears, including use of the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP. There are already strongly protection on the treatment of the family home, including the farmhouse where that is the family home.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> Looking at the Bill objectively there is no evidence base to support the proposals that a separate debt management protocol and legal framework is required for agricultural property. The introduction of a law relating only to the treatment of farm debt would likely require constitutional justification as to why farm debt should be treated differently from all other small business debt and consideration of how farm business activities secured on farmland is to be treated. The Bill proposes to limit certain financial regulatory functions and make them subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in a manner that is inappropriate. For example, the Bill proposes the Central Bank shall report annually to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the trends noted in the quantum and beneficial ownership of lands charged with repayment of such loans, and that the Central Bank shall establish and manage a brokerage supporting farmers seeking finance and refinance from elsewhere in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The Bill provides any transaction that may have the effect of besting beneficial ownership of farmland in collateral recovery businesses or in securitisation vehicles shall require the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and provides conditions attached to such consent. The Bill also requires that the National Treasury Management Agency shall make available for sale credit default swaps with a view to supporting access for farmers to shadow banking intermediated liquidity on a second mortgage basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> These detailed proposals suggest the exercise of specific financial regulatory functions will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This would constitute an unwarranted interference in the independent functions of the appropriate regulatory bodies. Importantly, these are areas of policy for which my Department does not have responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> I am committed to ensuring the agrifood sector has appropriate access to finance. The ability to access finance at the lowest rates possible will be crucial to the continued success of the agrifood sector, especially at a time of considerable challenge for the industry. The requirements and conditions within the Bill would hinder rather than assist farmers. While well intentioned, it is fundamentally flawed and the Government, therefore, opposes its introduction.</p>

        <speech by="#HollyCairns" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_745">I welcome the Bill and thank the Rural Independent Group for developing it. The Bill provides greater security and entitlements for farmers in terms of credit and debt proceedings, especially in situations where families are pursued by banks and financial businesses for debt. Crucially, the farm house, which is not only a family home but often a generational and inter-generational home, must be treated separately from farmland in debt situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> There continues to be a significant imbalance in this country between the banks and vulture funds on one side and ordinary families on the other. This inequity is particularly pronounced when it comes to farms. The law and successive Governments have failed to treat the farmhouse as a family home. Although rectified now, we saw the same situation arise in the development of the fair deal scheme, which included all assets on farms. This situation has left farmers vulnerable to forfeitures and seizures, which harm entire communities. Policies and laws must reflect social realities for the benefit of ordinary people, not for banks and hedge funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> I also welcome provisions for alternative avenues to be exhausted before a farm can be possessed and sold. It provides breathing space to allow the farmer and his or her representatives to work with the receiver to develop resolutions to the farm's financial issues. This is in the best interest of all parties, as a viable plan could be put in place that would save the farm, while the financial body could receive substantial repayments, which is its primary concern. We need more pragmatic approaches to these and similar circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> The additional protection and reassurance offered by the Bill will benefit families and facilitate greater agricultural activity and economic development in rural areas. With issues around generational renewal, farmers will have more confidence in seeking credit to address seasonal variations and invest in their machinery and equipment. We are all aware the sector is going through a difficult time, from the large increases in fertiliser prices earlier in the year, to the disruption in supply chains. It is important to note, although food prices are rising, this in no way means farmers and producers are making more money. The opposite is often true. A debate on the dire need for a proper food regulator with statutory powers is for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> Access to credit is crucial to keep people farming. Families need to be assured that seeking money to fund their livelihoods will not cost them their homes. On this point, I refer to credit unions. I cannot count the number of farmers or rural organisations that mention the importance of credit union loans. I can say confidently that they are keeping many family farms viable. They also offer tailored supports such as the cultivate programme, which provides short- to medium-term loans. I refer to this specific initiative because not only does it help families, it generates insightful data to understand the needs of the sector. It is reported in the first half of this year that 25% of loans was for stocking and working capital, while 24% was for farm buildings. Financial systems must recognise the distinct challenges faced by farmers and food producers, and if not, legislative and policy changes must ensure they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> Our agricultural sector needs as much stability and certainty as possible. While we cannot control the market and international supply chains, we can provide a legislative and policy context that supports family farms. Irish farmers produce high-quality products, however, increasingly fewer farmers produce a range of products. Consumers want locally produced food, but the cost of operating makes it more difficult for family businesses and small-scale producers. We need a radical policy shift to diversify the range of produce that will help support farmers, especially small family farms, and ensure a more sustainable and secure food system.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> Many farmers are forced into dairy just to get by or are being subsumed by large-scale industrialised farms. Sheep farming is becoming increasingly unviable. As wool prices are so low, it is more economical to dump it. This is at a time when we should be insulating buildings with this natural, locally-sourced product. This is just one example in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> Despite the expansion of the organic farming scheme, the lack of measures to support widespread organic farming means it will remain a niche sector. Unless there is a major course correction, the small family farm will be a thing of the past in a generation. The Bill provides the type of security and assurance farmers and rural Ireland need. I am working on a Bill to address food producers' vulnerability to food processers and larger retailers. We need to ensure the people who make our food can make a decent living, while also ensuring food is affordable and improving food security. All of these things are possible, it would just require the reigning in of the big players.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> I hope the Government will facilitate the progress of the Bill, which is more important than ever. It will help support family farms and protect rural communities, and it needs to be advanced as quickly as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinBrowne" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Deputy Martin Browne<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_754">I also thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this Bill. I am disappointed the Government will not accept it, but I am not in the least bit surprised by this.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> The Bill addresses the important issue of farm house and farmland repossession. It endeavours to tilt the legislative scale somewhere in the direction of fairness, which would be to the benefit of farming families. The Bill brings this issue into the light. As a representative of a large rural constituency in Tipperary, it is an important step in acknowledging the needs of rural Ireland and our farmers who are often called the custodians of the land. That description is accurate as there are many cases in which the same families have been working the same land for generations. Throughout that time, across the decades, those farmers and their families have risen to the challenge on every occasion to meet the needs of the State and society, which has not always been in their interest or to their benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> Farmers in rural Ireland lead the charge. They are invested in this country and we are indebted to them. Our farmers are to the fore in our response to climate change, and I am firmly of the opinion that they are both willing and able to deliver if the Government can put in place a workable framework to assist them in delivering the necessary changes, not simply taking an approach based on driving down production and expecting farmers to soak up losses in their already meagre margins. This view is not voiced enough in national debate, therefore, I add my voice to that acknowledgement today.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> It cannot be disputed that our farmers are the bedrock of rural communities and this country. During better times and times of economic turmoil, farmers continued to contribute substantially not only to the national economy, but to local and rural economies, driving economic activity and helping to sustain employment across the State. This is true in Tipperary as it is anywhere else. In this context, repossessions of farmhouses and land is a particular scourge and blight on our society. This is especially so in cases where such repossessions are undertaken by vulture and investment funds that pay little or no tax while profiteering on individual farms in financial distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The former Master of the High Court, who I understand has drafted this Bill, in speaking on its background commented that one would wonder whether the marketplace was working to everybody's benefit equally or whether some people were profiting to the extent which was not really equitable. </p>
          <p eId="para_759"> From discussions with farmers over the years and from what I have heard at the Joint Committee for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, it is obvious that farmers understand credit and borrowing very well. Different agricultural sectors experience upturns and downturns due to various factors and farmers, as a matter of course, must plan for this. Ideally, we look at the State-backed loans offered to farmers via the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland repayment rates to prove that our farmers represent a good investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> Of course, in the face of domestic and international pressures, some farmers will find themselves in a distressed financial position and the impact this will have on affected families and their own mental health cannot be over stated, as well as the impact on broader communities and local economies when such cases are taken in their totality. No Government can mitigate all factors, internal or external, but this Bill seeks to meet the State's obligation to those farming families to give them a fair opportunity and a fighting chance if they find themselves in such circumstances. Not only could it have a positive impact for those individuals, it should be recognised as being in this State's strategic interest to keep farmers on the land. That gets lost in many national conversations. The provisions of this Bill would give farmers a level of space to explore sustainable resolutions to their financial difficulties. It provides additional protections to the family home.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> Sinn Féin believes there are areas and aspects of this Bill that may require more detailed consideration and in which measures could possibly be further strengthened but, in the words of the former Master of the High Court, who has drafted this Bill, it is all about protecting the small man or woman against predatory financial institutions. Families need to be protected from such institutions. Sinn Féin believes that these provisions and that sentiment are absolutely worthy of further consideration and engagement. I urge all Deputies to support this Bill and look forward to engaging with it in more depth on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFitzmaurice" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_762">I support this Bill. In fairness to Deputies O'Donoghue, Healy-Rae and McGrath, they have engaged. Mr. Edmund Honohan has to be commended on the amount of work he has put in and for being one of the people who asked the questions when he was working down the road that many people did not ask. It was not a rubber-stamp job on many occasions. Mr. Brian Reilly also needs a mention. I am shocked the Government is going against this. I listened to the Minister's speech when he talked about the dangers of not being able to get money. The bottom line is if one owns a company and is borrowing for it, the risk is the same. Companies can get money no problem. The kite that is flown about the dangers of getting finance is not there. There is a strategic fund the Government can back to help, which it has, in fairness, for the agricultural sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> Nobody seems to get the problem we saw when the country hit trouble, whether that was a company, an individual or a farmer. People in different walks of life can go through financial pressures or be in financial stress. Solutions are needed to that because, first, somebody in financial stress finds it very hard to get out of it and, second, the big problem is with getting money from the another bank or elsewhere when one tries to do a deal. What has happened needs to be understood: the investment funds that had a lot of money, which we call vulture funds, bought all these loans from the bank. It was like watching a person grow up. If one had money in a bank, the bank would be charged interest but every day as the years went by, the interest and value were growing on these loans because, thankfully, land has gone up in value. However, the funds were smiling and the person was still left in distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> Many of these debts were bought at between 30% and 50%. It was all right for the funds to have it at that. I am talking about the people who are trying to get back on the road again, to whom the funds were not listening or even interested in talking. The person could have 40 meetings and it was basically full duck or no dinner. The funds had to get everything or nothing and that was a considerable problem. I acknowledge the work done by the likes of Mr. David Hall in the line of housing. He helps many people in different parts of the country. I also acknowledge the likes of Mr. Keith Farry who has done considerable work on the insolvency side, as the Minister mentioned. I acknowledge the amount of work those people did.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> This Bill is a no-brainer because, at the end of the day, we need farmers to be able to go forward. We see when a company closes down that the person opens up another company down the road. We saw it with building. How many builders have basically been in serious bother and have been back building again? They can get money because once the slate is clean and they are able to put a business case forward, they get money. The problem for other people is that their names come up with the credit bureau and they cannot get money even if they are trying to get a deal. It is a major problem and leaves them with nowhere else to go other than to family members or others. We need to make sure we give them this new lease of life for their families and communities. It is sickening for someone from whom a debt was bought at 50% of what it was when the buyer still keeps trying to knock the last pound of flesh out of them. That is ferociously hard to understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> As the Minister will see, the Bill seeks to make sure the family home is looked after. We have seen situations with regard to family homes where if the names of siblings or partners are not put down, they do not seem to have any rights. That is a major problem. Thankfully, bit by bit around the country, the likes of the people I mentioned and many Deputies have engaged to try to help people resolve difficulties and issues. However, there is still plenty of it out there and many families still do not know what will happen or where they will be because they find it hard to get a deal over the line. Funnily enough, it was nearly easier to get a deal four or five years ago. The country is doing better now and the price of things is going up. As things become more expensive, there is no interest in doing a deal quickly but there is interest and fees and, in some cases, a receiver will be appointed, which adds considerable costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> We have to solve the problems because when the people one talks to get a resolution in respect of their house, business or farm, it is like a new lease of life or a load off their back. Many of these people move forward and make a considerable contribution to the country or society. What we need is for society to be prosperous. I urge the Government to look at this and take it on board. To put it mildly, the person who wrote this Bill has a fair legal brain. Mr. Honohan has put in hours to put this together.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> As politicians, we should not be on the side of big business all the time, to put it very simply. We should look at the small people because, funnily enough, many small people throughout this country contribute the taxes. Ironically, the people who have a hold on this State, the vultures, are the ones who do not have to pay taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">It is rather an unusual set-up. The first thing we should do is look after the people around the country. If we have a prosperous community and society, then there is less pull on the Government. If people are struggling, they will always need more help from the State. That is plain to see. I urge the Government to take on board what we have said and provide another prong and way to solve those problems as well as insolvency. I agree that significant work has been done on insolvency. People such as David Hall have done so much. We have to get into our heads that there are vulture funds that are going for the last penny. As rates go up, they will stick tighter to that. Then there are bodies such as iCare that will buy it out. When a person gets up and running at a 5% or 6% rate, they can buy the house back for what was paid for it, not twice the price. The information about what companies gave for that debt is redacted. That is how they make huge profits every year. We should make sure we help people as much as possible.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Charlie McConalogue)<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_770">I thank all the contributors for the assessment of and perspectives on the Bill. Like the Deputies here, I am committed to protecting the Irish family farm model. To prosper, we need to ensure farming is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable. As well as ensuring the Common Agricultural Policy works for Irish farmers and that we provide other appropriate supports when required, I work across Government on issues such as access to finance. Access to finance is the lifeblood of any business, and farms are not any different in that regard. As well as working closely with financial institutions to ensure farmers continue to be well-served, we do not hesitate to act when gaps in the private market emerge. This has been seen with the development and introduction of important supports for investment finance. We have also introduced important supports over the past years to bolster resilience and ensure we can weather the challenges brought about by Brexit, Covid-19 and the impact of the war in Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> Important impaired credit arrangements are already provided for under personal insolvency law and company law, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. There are existing arrangements for mortgages and mortgage arrears. There is no evidence base to support the Bill's proposals that a separate debt management protocol and legal framework is required for agricultural property. The Bill proposes to give specific financial regulatory functions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which would constitute unwarranted interference in the independent functions of the appropriate financial regulatory bodies and in areas of policy for which my Department does not have responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> Introducing this Bill and the conditions and requirements therein would jeopardise farmers' participation in any horizontal access to financial supports, which have been useful to farmers and the agrifood sector. It also jeopardises their ability to access credit generally. Therefore, I do not believe the Bill will assist farm families or agriculture generally. Fundamentally, the restrictions it places on debt recovery in the sector are such that it would dissuade financial institutions from lending to the sector in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> As I already stated, I am committed to ensuring the agrifood sector has appropriate access to finance, especially in achieving the objectives and development of the sector that we outlined in Food Vision 2030. Without that access to finance, there would not be businesses. That is no different for farmers and farm families to how it is for other businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> I believe the introduction of this Bill and the requirements and conditions in it would hinder farmers rather than assist them. I fully appreciate and understand where the Deputies are coming from with the Bill. Like the Deputies, I understand how farming has played and will continue to play a significant role in the life of this country and of rural Ireland. However, I do not believe the Bill proposed will assist in developing the sector and ensuring it is backed financially so that it can develop and grow in future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard O'Donoghue<recordedTime time="2022-11-17T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_775">I am disappointed that the Minister, who comes from a farming background, will not accept this Bill. If he had amendments to table, I would have welcomed that. He comes from the farming sector, which I come from myself. My mother and father were farmers. I am disappointed the Minister would not do this for the protection of the family home. This Bill would pave the way for a new State-run institution that would give low-interest credit to all farm enterprises. This means credit and access to capital in rural Ireland, which would boost the entire rural economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> I said I am disappointed, with the Minister coming from a farming background, because many of the problems the farming sector has had with raising funds throughout the years have been because of the detrimental changes the Government and its predecessors have made with legislation and rules they brought in. In 2011, the Government told the farmers of this country to invest in white gold, which was milk, and to increase the national herd. It said that people needed milk around the world and were looking at the farmers. This year, the Government came out with a statement that the herd should be reduced by 25%. Farmers invested in a farm based on what the Government told them to do and the Government reversed it with the stroke of a pen. It does so every time there is a change of government. Farmers borrowed in 2011 and 2012, and onwards, to invest, on the Government's advice, but the Government is saying today to reduce the herd by 25%.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> I thank the Rural Independent Group. Mainly, I thank Deputy Collins for the work he has put in to get the Bill to this stage. I also thank Edmund Honohan for his contribution and work, his legal experience, and his first-hand knowledge from his previous career. He knew first-hand how he could help, whereas the Minister's paperwork was written for him by the Department which caused this problem in the first place. We now have a man with a lifetime of legal experience who has given the Minister solutions, but he will not even accept the Bill and try to introduce amendments to save the family home. It would separate the family home from the family farm. That is why I am disappointed. I know the Minister is not a bad person, but he is taking legislation and rules from a Department that writes it for him and tells him this is right. It is wrong. The legal expertise we have from outside is telling the Minister it is wrong. Why does he not seek legal opinion himself? It will tell him the Department is wrong. All it is doing is protecting vulture funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> The banks in this country have sold off loans. One can call it whatever one likes, whether shadow banking or vulture funds. Those vulture funds or banks can foreclose on or call in a person's loan. That same bank cannot introduce an examiner because it is not the bank's loan. Did the Minister know that?</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Does he know that if there is a debt on the farm, the farm retirement scheme can be pulled into the debt of a loan by means of exhaustible execution? Imagine the wording of it. That scheme can be pulled into the debt of a farm, which was caused by this Government and previous Governments. It is so disappointing that the Minister will not accept the Bill, even with amendments, particularly in view of the fact that he is from a farming background.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> I look at this as the future-proofing of farming. The failure to protect farms in the country is why farming has not grown. Is there any other SME in Ireland that could sustain its business through all the different changes that come in every time there is a change of Government? Look at the cost of the things that make a difference in farming. Agriculture is very much affected by the shocks in the market that most other industries would only consider to be bumps. Take the weather's effect on crops, Brexit and fluctuations in raw materials production. A while ago, I used the example of the price of milk. There is also the price of meat. There is the price of energy and of fertiliser. All these things come in the margin of farming. All these things are changed every time there is a change of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> The main reason for bring forward this Bill was to protect family homes and invest in farms in order that future generations would look at them as viable businesses. It is the heritage of the Minister's family, of my family and of all the sons and daughters of farmers who went on to different jobs. They want to see the family home protected for generations to come. This protection would also be an incentive to new, young farmers. I was out last week on a tractor with Macra na Feirme and the next entrepreneurs in farming. I hope they get all the support they can get. They are taking on an uphill battle because every time there is a change in Government, there is a change in the rules. These people are the next generation, and I am certain that, in his heart, the Minister wants them to survive. With every turn of a key, however, the Government puts something else on them. The Government says farmers must give up so much of their land to plant trees and farmers do it. The Government says farmers must change the way they spread slurry and farmers do it. The Government says farmers must change the amount of fertiliser they put on the ground and farmers do it. Farmers change everything around for the Government while still trying to sustain themselves, but every ten years they have to go back and borrow again. We have Departments telling them how to run their farms and they do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> Then the Government comes out and says the farming industry is the biggest polluter in the country, when we have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the biggest polluters are the local authorities with their failed sewerage systems. Yet the Government still wants to blame everything on farmers. That is not right. I want to see the protection of the next generation of farmers in order that they can see producing food for this country as a viable business. God help us if anything happens around the world and we look to the farming sector, especially the tillage sector, to protect us. Who did we call on when Covid came? We called on the farmers to grow wheat, barley and oats. That is what the Government called on them to do but it has overregulated farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Fianna Fáil has killed the farming industry every time it has gone into Government in coalition with somebody else. I am talking about the very farmers who voted for Fianna Fáil for many generations. Like the farmers, Fianna Fáil's numbers are going down because people have lost their belief the Government will represent the farming community. Fianna Fáil is on the same trajectory as farming. The party has killed itself by not protecting the farming industry and still it has not learned. We have the former Master of the High Court who has a lifetime's experience of how to help because the matter was in front of him every day of his life, yet the Minister will not take that on board because he is listening to his Department. The Department has lied to the Minister. It is time he got legal advice from outside it and looked at this Bill. I ask him to come back to us. If he wants to amend the Bill, we will work with him but he should not turn down it down. It is about the protection of the farm and of the family home for the sons, daughters, husbands, wives and partners of farmers. That is what we are asking the Minister to do. Before he goes against this Bill, he should think of that. All I am asking him to do is say he will accept the Bill and make amendments to it.</p>
