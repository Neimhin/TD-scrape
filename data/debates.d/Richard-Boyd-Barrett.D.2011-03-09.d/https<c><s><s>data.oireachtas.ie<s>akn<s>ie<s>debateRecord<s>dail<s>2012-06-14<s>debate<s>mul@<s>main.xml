          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the distressing situation facing 214 families in the north west.  They are in shock this morning having heard the announcement that the Daughters of Wisdom intend to withdraw from the services they provide at Cregg House in Sligo.  This religious order has provided services to people with intellectual disabilities for almost 60 years.  The Daughters of Wisdom believe that the shortfall of €1.3 million in the funding provided by the HSE makes it impossible for them to continue to provide the services they have provided so well up to now.  The staff at the Cregg House centre were informed of this decision late yesterday afternoon after it had been confirmed that talks with the HSE had broken down.  I believe the families are being informed today.  The manner in which the 214 families and the users of the centre are being treated is a scandal and a reflection of the current state of our health services.  It shows the lack of progress that has been made by the Government since it took office.  Why has a conscious decision been made to reduce the funding provided to the Daughters of Wisdom, who have done this job so well for the past 60 years?</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Some 2,000 people took part in a march in Sligo last month and called for these services to be protected.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and Senator O'Keeffe praised the magnificent services that are provided at Cregg House and gave assurances that they would not be cut or withdrawn.  We all know there is a need for efficiencies and cost savings in the current environment, but those with intellectual disabilities should not be neglected.  I ask the Minister to assure the House that services will continue to be provided at Cregg House and that every effort will be made to ensure those families who benefit from this service and the Daughters of Wisdom, who have provided this service for many years, will be spoken to and these services will be maintained.</p>

          <p eId="para_3">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which is of concern to many people.  I can assure him, on the basis of what I have been told by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that the service will continue.  Negotiations with the Daughters of Wisdom have been taking place since last April.  There has been no distinction or discrimination in relation to the allocation of funding for these services.  The Department will issue a statement later today.  I assure the Deputy and the families who are concerned and affected by this issue that the service will be maintained.</p>

          <p eId="para_4">The refusal by a charitable organisation like the Daughters of Wisdom to continue to provide this service because of the €1.3 million shortfall in funding is a reflection of a much wider malaise in the health service.  Unfortunately, this problem is also evident in hospitals and in other locations throughout the country where essential services are provided.  The civil servants and health service managers who are responsible for administering the cuts - the Government has asked them to do so - have little choice other than to continue to do their best with the limited resources that are being given to them.  The Government is handing a certain amount of reduced funding to hospitals and other health service providers throughout the country.  It is telling hospital managers, doctors and nurses to like it or lump it and to offer whatever level of service they can from the limited funds that are being provided.  The patients are having to lump it, unfortunately.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">I heard the Minister's reply to the previous speaker and I am appalled.  Here we have a service which has been running for 57 years and which provides services for over 200 people.  I have been told a fantastic level of care is being delivered, with psychological services, social services, social work and speech and language services among those services.  The Daughters of Wisdom order has announced it will not continue because of a Government cutback to the tune of €1.3 million.  This service covers a wide area, including south Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and parts of Cavan.  Is the Minister guaranteeing there will be no break in the service delivered to all of those people who avail of this service-----</p>

I can understand there is concern out there because of the work that has been provided by the Daughters of Wisdom over many years.  They have been in discussion with the Department of Health since April, as I said to Deputy McConalogue.  There is, as we speak, a transition team from the HSE that has been in negotiations recently with the Daughters of Wisdom to provide for continuity in the delivery of these essential services.  I accept, of course, there are difficulties in the funding of services, whether it is in the health area, education or anywhere else because of the extraordinary economic mess this Administration inherited just over 15 months ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_71">Deputy Boyd Barrett will be aware, coming from the constituency he does, that Ireland has inherited a very rich architectural heritage of buildings going back centuries.  Some of them are private dwellings in which people live.  The maintenance and upkeep of those buildings is very extensive because of their age and the manner in which they were built in the past.  In order to ensure that this heritage would survive and be maintained, Governments of different complexions have over the years provided tax incentives and tax relief to the private owners of private dwellings in which they live to maintain and restore those buildings on condition that they make those buildings open to the public so that the wider public can share that heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">There is no "one law for the rich and one law for the poor".  The laws in regard to heritage preservation are open to everybody who is in a position to avail of them.  To the best of my knowledge, that is what has happened in this instance.</p>

The Minister is right to say there are Georgian homes and so on in Dún Laoghaire and elsewhere where it is reasonable to give financial support or tax breaks to people who are not in a position to maintain those homes.  That is the way it should be done.  However, it is not acceptable that tax breaks exist for people who are on salaries of €140,000 or €150,000 a year, or, in many cases, on much higher salaries-----</p>

If people live in a house of that kind and spend money to maintain it, they only get the tax relief if they open the doors of those houses to the wider public.  That is the public benefit of that measure.  Individual status, in terms of people's income, is secondary to the overall objective cited in the Deputy's question.</p>

According to the response to a parliamentary question, this report was received on 7 February.

          <p eId="para_138">I support this Bill.  It is vital that Ireland has extradition agreements with all countries.  The Bill will enable the Government to apply many of the provisions contained within the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 to Norway and Iceland, bringing into action surrender agreements reached in 2006 between these two countries and the EU.  It will also cover any agreements that may be reached with non-member states in the future.  The amendments contained in the Bill will provide for quicker and easier processing of extradition requests under both Acts.  Since the European arrest warrant commenced operation on 1 January 2004, the use of the warrant has increased every year.  For example, in 2010, Ireland issued a total of 373 European arrest warrants to 15 countries, the majority of which were issued for Polish nationals, while a further 32 were issued in respect of cases involving Irish nationals.  In 2010, some 14 persons who were subject to European arrest warrants were surrendered to the State, including 11 people from the UK.  In total, 148 people have been surrendered to the State since the commencement of the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The number of people surrendered by the State has also increased considerably since the commencement of the warrant system, with a total of 424 people surrendered in total.  In 2004, only two people were surrendered.  This compares to a figure of 161 in 2010, which was more than double the number in 2009.  This large increase is very welcome, as we do not want people evading justice when they should be arrested to face the full rigours of the law.  The large increase is also due to the fact that the Garda Síochána decentralised the European arrest warrant arrangements from the extradition unit in Dublin to local Garda divisions, which had more autonomy and access to local information.  This shows the role that local gardaí can play in arresting suspects who are wanted abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">In 2010, the Irish authorities issued 51 arrest warrants for the arrest of Irish nationals in other EU states, of whom 26 have so far been returned to the State.  The arrest warrants were sought in respect of many serious crimes, such as sexual offences, murder, grievous bodily harm, drug offences, fraud and organised crime.  In general, the most common charges cited by EU member states applying for the extradition of foreign nationals living in Ireland are theft, assault and robbery.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Organised crime, particularly human trafficking and drug trafficking, is a serious issue in this country.  Drug trafficking is a widespread problem across Europe, and the European arrest warrant is vital in tackling this.  Co-operation between the various authorities and police organisations in different countries is essential to ensure criminals are brought to justice.  A good example of this co-operation was seen between Ireland and Spain over the past year.  At the end of last year, a suspected member of an international criminal gang from Ireland was extradited to Spain to be questioned by Spanish authorities on suspicion of drug trafficking and bringing weapons into the country.  Then, earlier this year, Spain agreed to extradite to Ireland a convicted killer who was wanted on charges of firearms possession and handling of stolen goods.  Thus, we can see there is increased co-operation in ensuring that people do not evade the law by crossing borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Human trafficking is a profitable form of organised crime in Ireland.  In 2009, the Garda investigated 68 cases of human trafficking, with a total of nine people being prosecuted for this serious crime.  During Operation Sibling, in 2009, the Garda was involved in a joint operation with the Romanian police which resulted in the prosecution of three Romanian nationals on charges of human trafficking.  Such co-operation is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">The introduction of the European arrest warrant in 2003 has been described as one of the most significant initiatives of the EU in dealing with criminal matters.  The efficiency and effectiveness of the European arrest warrant was witnessed at the end of April, when two members of one of Limerick's biggest organised crime gangs were arrested at a resort in Bulgaria.  The Bulgarian police made the arrests following receipt of information from the Garda.  One of the men was wanted by the State to face serious drugs charges and charges of threatening to endanger life.  The Garda liaised well with the Bulgarian authorities to ensure the European arrest warrant was executed, and the men were deported to Ireland.  Concerns have been expressed more generally about the European arrest warrant by the European Commission.  Problems arise in the way certain member states enforce warrants and Irish barristers have expressed concern about the vagueness in the framework decision underlying the European arrest warrant, which was adopted in the months after the events of 11 September 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The European arrest warrant is, however, an essential tool for dealing with organised crime and was welcomed throughout Europe on its introduction.  It is vital that the EU's various police authorities are able to co-operate with each other and the statistics suggest they are doing so.  We cannot allow criminals to use borders to evade justice.  Organised crime is a serious issue and it is being tackled under the European arrest warrant structure.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnHalligan" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Deputy John Halligan</from>
          <p eId="para_145">Until comparatively recently, the ambit of criminal laws in most countries applied only to what was done in the country in question.  Persons could not be prosecuted in one country for what they were alleged to have done in another jurisdiction.  Thus, Irish citizens were accountable only to the Irish courts for crimes they allegedly committed in Ireland.  They were not accountable to the courts of countries such as Albania, Turkey and Zimbabwe, with which we have extradition treaties.  In recent years, the laws of some countries purport to apply their criminal laws to acts done anywhere in the world even by non-citizens of those countries.  This Bill aims to facilitate such developments.  A person who previously lived in Albania, Turkey or Zimbabwe and is now living in Dublin or Cork could through his or her business or other activities provide the excuse for those countries to seek his or her extradition even though the activities in question do not warrant investigation by the Director of Public Prosecution in Ireland and may indeed be completely legal here.  The only safeguard, if one could fairly describe it as a safeguard, is the discretion, whim or good sense of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  United States law covers a plethora of complex crimes related to rasing funds and financing business.  Under the proposed amendments, any Irish citizen who raises funds here in a similar way is at risk of being extradited to the United States, even if the DPP declines to prosecute.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The amendment proposed by the Government makes our citizens and those who legally reside here amenable to the laws of our extradition partners, including Albania, Turkey and Zimbabwe, and potentially applies to every activity in this country undertaken by a person which the applicant country wishes to extradite.  A conscientious citizen would be advised to become familiar with the criminal laws of countries with which Ireland has extradition arrangements before adopting any particular course of conduct in respect of these countries.  Subject to the decision of the DPP and the discretion of the Minister, one could be at risk of extradition to any number of countries.  It is easy to envisage a situation in which a person offended the authorities of a country in which he or she conducted business.  Those countries would be able to seek extradition on the grounds that the way in which that person conducts business in Ireland offends their criminal codes and, hence, their extraterritorial law.  In such circumstances, only the discretion of the Minister could save a person from extradition.  The lawyers whom I have consulted take the view that such a state of affairs is most likely unconstitutional.  In practice it applies a whole variety of foreign criminal laws to what citizens do in Ireland, including laws of which nobody here can reasonably be expected cognisant.  These laws may be in languages which the citizen does not speak or based on the tenets of various religions.  Accordingly, unless the amendment is surrounded by appropriate safeguards, this outrageous and wholly disproportionate proposal will most likely be struck down as unconstitutional, at least insofar as it applies to Irish citizens and permanent residents.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The amendment should not apply to Irish citizens.  If they contravene criminal law in this country, the place to try them is before an Irish jury of their peers.  It is impossible to envisage circumstances where citizens should be extradited to some other country to be tried, often without a jury, for crimes they have allegedly committed here.  Insofar as non-citizens are concerned, since 2008 there have been procedures that greatly facilitate prosecutions in this State where aspects of the alleged offence occurred or have some effect outside the State.  Under the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008, relevant evidence existing outside the State can easily be given in criminal trials in the State either by way of having evidence taken abroad and sent here or through audio-visual links.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Before anyone is extradited for an action that could be prosecuted as a crime in Ireland, it should be demonstrated that it is impossible to have the individual prosecuted in this country.  Assuming the impossibility of prosecution in Ireland, the country seeking the extradition of a non-Irish citizen should be required to provide what is commonly referred to as a<i>prima facie</i> case.  This is common justice in most democratic countries.  The country seeking extradition should provide evidence to demonstrate that it has sufficient proof against the person concerned to justify his or her being put on trial when surrendered.  A requirement along these lines exists in many international extradition arrangements, with the notable exception of the USA.  When US authorities seek a person’s extradition from Ireland or the UK they do not provide <i>prima facie</i> proof, whereas US law requires Irish or UK prosecutors to demonstrate a <i>prima facie</i> case in the US courts before it will permit an extradition.  It is one law for the American State and another for everywhere else. </p>
          <p eId="para_149">Where no material part of the offence occurred in the State, for example, a terrorist bombing committed in the US and prepared in Timbuktu, a case may be made for revoking some of the safeguards but the proponents of this amendment are citing extreme and exceptional case to justify the removal of proper safeguards in the more common cases.  In the recent case concerning Sean Garland, US authorities alleged that he arranged the distribution of counterfeit US dollars in several EU countries , from his base in Dublin.  The documentation sent by the US did not contain a shred of evidence to suggest that the alleged offence even occurred, let alone implicate Mr. Garland.  The US authorities merely presented sweeping assertions without evidence to back them up.  They repeatedly stated that they did not need to produce evidence until they brought Mr. Garland back to America.  Surely that cannot be permitted.  We cannot stand over such a regime.  Notwithstanding that, Mr. Garland could have been put on trial here.  The Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 applies to the USA, making it very easy for evidence gathered by the US authorities to be used in a criminal trial in this country.  No attempt has since been made by the US authorities to have Mr. Garland prosecuted here.  Had the US authorities evidence of his guilt, they could easily present the evidence in a prosecution before a jury in Ireland.  That no such prosecution has commenced points to a simple conclusion, namely, that there never was evidence of his guilt and the attempt to have him extradited was simply an abuse of the system in order to get Mr. Garland to America.  If this amendment is adopted without satisfactory safeguards, the only protection against extradition to the USA or elsewhere, for the purpose of putting the person on trial for crimes allegedly committed in this country, relies on the good offices of the Minister and political convenience.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Many Deputies and Senators supported Mr. Garland.  Many of us believed the case was based on the fact that the man had spent his life fighting American imperialism and terrorism in South America, Africa and the Middle East.  That was the real reason Mr. Garland was to be extradited.  Fair Trials International, FTI, is a London-based non-governmental organisation.  It is highly thought of across the world and has claimed to highlight a number of cases demonstrating that the European arrest warrant system is causing serious injustice and jeopardising the right to a fair trial.  The organisation says the European arrest warrant has been issued many years after the alleged offence was committed and expressed concern that warrants have been used to force a person to trial when the charges are based on evidence obtained through police brutality in many countries.  This has been accepted by many governments across the world.  There have been numerous instances where people surrendered under an arrest warrant have had to spend months or even years in detention before they appear in court to establish their innocence.  It is the first duty of the State to protect its citizens and allow them the right to a fair trial and we cannot allow the Bill to be passed.  The alternative is to sacrifice the safeguards of due process for the sake of expediency.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">I reiterate my point about the difference between America and here because the Minister was not in the Chamber at the time I made it.  When the US authorities seek a person's extradition from Ireland or the UK, they provide no<i>prima facie</i> proof but when Ireland and the UK want to extradite someone from the US, the law of the US categorically states that a <i>prima facie</i> case must be demonstrated before the person is surrendered.  No doubt, this is driven by outside interests.  The Minister may or may not admit that he has been contacted by the American authorities or some of their agencies.  It is interesting that the Bill has come before the Dáil so quickly.  It reminds me of a song by Sandie Shaw called “Puppet on a String”.  Perhaps the Minister can make it his favourite tune of all time.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I thank Deputies who contributed to this debate over two days on an important issue with regard to matters concerning US arrest warrants and extradition.  There have been interesting and thoughtful contributions to the debate as well as wild, wonderful and imaginative contributions that do not seem to be based on an understanding of how the legislation works, its objectives and its benefits, in particular to this State, in ensuring we protect our people from those engaged in serious criminality.  As best I can, I want to respond to what has been said by Deputies but I hope they will forgive me if I do not refer to everyone by name.  Some of the same points were made by different Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">I thank Deputy Calleary for the support for the Bill expressed by him on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  I agree with the sentiments he expressed, that we must ensure our legislation is sufficiently robust to meet existing challenges and those that may arise in the future.  He made reference to cyber crime and the threat it poses to the State.  It is a threat posed across the world and in respect of which there are no territorial boundaries.  It is an issue the Government takes most seriously and it is being taken seriously at European Union level.  The issue requires substantial co-operation between European Union countries, and on a global basis between countries across the world, in identifying those who engage in that area of criminality.  It is important to be conscious of the risks they pose to disrupting essential services or to accessing information that should be kept private, particularly through the manner in which they are prepared to violate data protection laws to access information that should remain private to the individuals concerned.  It is an area that classically illustrates the need for international co-operation in dealing with law enforcement issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">I am not in a position to give a timeframe for the review of the legislation.  It will involve more than a consolidation of existing legislation.  My original speech referred to the number of times it proved necessary to amend the European arrest warrant legislation.  It is desirable that all law in this area is ultimately contained in a single consolidated Bill but it may also be that other reforms are required.  The review will be a thorough and fundamental review of how we have implemented the European arrest warrant provisions in Ireland, legislatively and administratively.  The aim is to ensure we have a system that is legislatively robust and administratively cost efficient while at the same time protective of the constitutional and human rights of the persons whose surrender is sought.  I listened with wonderment to some of the contributions made by Deputies who seem to be extraordinarily and blissfully unaware of the provisions contained in section 37 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, which provide express protection for human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">The review will proceed without delay but, equally, it will be a careful review without undue haste.  The frequent amendments to the Act are a caution against the rush to reform.  It is desirable that we ensure any difficulties that might be anticipated in so far as possible can be anticipated and addressed in the functioning of the legislation.  We all know that the nature of legislation is such that, arising from court judgements or unexpected circumstances, flaws that had not been anticipated are discovered and require further amendment.  A comprehensive job will be done and I hope it will prove helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">Deputy Humphreys suggested jurisdiction to hear European arrest warrant extradition cases might be transferred to the District Court from the High Court, with a view to reducing cost.  This is an interesting suggestion but it cannot be addressed the isolation.  The legal and other implications in the proposal, and the question of whether it would realise the apparent savings, require careful consideration.  We will address the issue in the review of the legislation.  On the surface, it might facilitate the processing of applications with less expense and greater speed, particularly those that are not contended.  In my recollection as a legal practitioner, when the District Court exercised certain jurisdiction in extradition matters, it inevitably resulted in a substantial number of cases being the subject to judicial review in the High Court.  Rather than providing a more cost effective means of dealing with matters, it ultimately proved to elongate court proceedings and add to legal costs substantially.  I am concerned that if this jurisdiction were exercised in the District Court, those who justifiably and properly should be the subject of extradition from this State, or who should be transferred to another European Union state using the European arrest warrant procedure, would seek to prolong matters resulting in this State incurring unnecessary legal costs in circumstances where it is unjustifiable.  Thus, a substantial proportion of cases determined at District Court level would ultimately be replayed in judicial review proceedings in the High Court.  That issue requires consideration and we will pay some attention to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">A number of Deputies, including Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Daly, have cited the European Commission's report on the implementation of the European arrest warrant system in support of their contention that it is a flawed system.  The report is an indication of how transparent the system is.  I refer to the facts that it is being kept under review and that difficulties that arise are being commented on and considered so as to facilitate their being addressed in a uniform manner across the European Union.  As might be expected, unfortunately, the extracts of the report used by the Deputies entailed a very selective reading.  They ignored those parts of the report, or the bulk thereof, that do not support their arguments.  The Deputies ignored the finding in the report that the European arrest warrant "has undoubtedly reinforced the free movement of persons within the EU by providing a more efficient mechanism to ensure that open borders are not exploited by those seeking to evade justice".  It is true that the Commission acknowledges that the European arrest warrant, despite its operational success, is not perfect.  I am not claiming perfection for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The report points to the progress being made on measures establishing minimum procedural rights across the Union under the roadmap on procedural rights.  While Deputies have bemoaned the lack of a proportionality test regarding the issuing of a European arrest warrant, none has mentioned that section of the report which deals with this issue.  Paragraph 5 of the report sets out in detail the amendment to the handbook on how to issue a European arrest warrant, which provides expressly for a proportionality check.   On listening to some of the Deputies opposite, one would be forgiven for believing Ireland's role in the European arrest warrant system is merely to surrender its citizens to other states.  It seems to have escaped their attention that the system is a mutually reciprocal one and that Ireland has also had people surrendered to it from other states who had sought to evade justice here.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">In 2010, 26 persons were surrendered to Ireland on foot of European arrest warrants.  Offences committed in this State in respect of which European arrest warrants were issued by Ireland included murder, sexual offences, drug offences, assault, robbery and arson.  I do not believe Deputies O'Brien, Halligan or Daly would seek to argue in this House that those properly charged with murder, sexual assault, robbery, arson or drug offences should not be extradited back to this State to have their cases properly determined and prosecuted here.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">There is a serious issue to be considered.  In principle, a number of Members of this House have said here that they are opposed not only to this amending Bill but also to European arrest warrant legislation.  Let us be absolutely clear: what this legislation does is facilitate the removal from this State of individuals facing serious charges in other parts of Europe so they can be dealt with through a proper court process, which falls under the effective application of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Should any state violate the convention, it can be brought to court therefor.  The instrument facilitates the returning to this State of people who engage in serious criminality in this State.  It seems to escape Deputies' notice that some of those who are subject to European arrest warrants have left the state of which they are citizens to come to Ireland to evade justice.  There is an extraordinary lack of insight in some of the speeches I have heard delivered on this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The Commission reports that, among those surrendered thanks to the European arrest warrant, were a failed London bomber caught in Italy, a German serial killer tracked down in Spain, a suspected drug smuggler from Malta extradited from the UK, and a gang of armed robbers sought by Italy whose members were arrested in six different EU countries.  A large international operation against highway cargo theft networks resulted in the dismantling of networks in five different countries.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_158" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
          <p eId="para_188">I was somewhat shocked to hear Deputies opposite refer to the European arrest warrant as involving no-questions-asked extradition.  Equally, it was suggested that it offers no protection for the human rights of persons sought.  I can only assume from these ill-informed comments that the Deputies are either not bothered to read the European Arrest Warrant Act in full, have read it and do not fully understand it or have chosen to ignore wilfully its provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">Before anyone can be arrested on foot of a European arrest warrant in Ireland, the warrant must be endorsed for execution by the High Court.  This is provided for in section 13 in Part 2 of the 2003 Act.  Before the court endorses the warrant, it must be satisfied that the warrant complies with the Act.  Second, when a person is arrested, he or she must be brought before the High Court as soon as may be after arrest and will be entitled to a full hearing before the court on the surrender request.  The person is entitled to a lawyer without charge, if appropriate, and, if necessary, an interpreter.  There is also a limited right of appeal to the Supreme Court against an order for surrender.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">On the question of human rights protection,  I refer Deputies to section 37 of the Act.  This section provides that a person shall not be surrendered if surrender would be incompatible with the State's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights or would constitute a contravention of any provision of the Constitution.  It also bars surrender where it is believed the prosecution or punishment was based on one of discriminatory grounds listed or that the person would be treated less favourably on one of those grounds of discrimination.  I should point out that the Human Rights Commission, which according to those opposite condemned the 2003 Act in its entirety, welcomed the inclusion of section 37 and, in particular, the reference contained in it to the Human Rights Convention.  I trust this dispels any notion that human rights are not protected in the European arrest warrant procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I am also concerned at statements made by Deputies opposite which give the impression that this Bill will in some way automatically extend the scope of European arrest warrants to countries outside the EU.  I can only assume from these ill-informed comments that the Deputies have either not bothered to read the Bill in full or have read it and do not fully understand it, or have chosen to wilfully ignore its provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Part 2 of the Bill enables the provisions of the European Arrest Warrants Acts to be extended to countries other than EU member states.  As I said in my speech, this is subject to some important limitations.  Section 2(3) in applying the European arrest warrant arrangements to a third country may only be made where there is an EU agreement on surrender in force with that third country.  Such an agreement would of course require a high degree of mutual trust between the EU and the country concerned.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
          <p eId="para_211">A further limitation is that under section 2(4) an order applying the European Arrest Warrant Act to a third country must reflect the terms of the agreement it gives effect to.  What is being done here provides a legislative mechanism to give effect to agreements on surrender negotiated by the European Union as a whole - I would emphasise that - with non-EU countries.  However colourful either Deputy Halligan's contribution about Zimbabwe or Deputy Daly's invocation of extradition to Thailand under this provision may be, they are also completely inaccurate.  We have no such intentions or arrangements.  I can also assure Deputy Pringle that Australia and the United States do not fall within this provision either.  Therefore, perhaps we can have a little less excitement on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Deputy Mattie McGrath made a very interesting speech and I feel it would be remiss of me not to make some reference to it.  He informed us that this legislation - and I hope I am doing him justice - should not be enacted.  He did not want anyone extradited under it and said he would be voting against the Bill.  He also said he had serious principles on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I must say that I was somewhat taken aback by Deputy Mattie McGrath's attack on the European arrest warrant system because he has form on this matter.  He has obviously forgotten what he said on previous occasions both in this House and elsewhere.  When he stood up to speak I expected to receive his support.  As a member of Fianna Fáil, he had previously supported this measure not just by voting it through the lobbies but by express statements he made.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I presumed him to be a staunch supporter of the European arrest warrant system, particularly having regard to the records of this House.  They show that on 28 May 2009, Deputy McGrath made a particularly eloquent speech on Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009, which amended the European Arrest Warrant Act of 2003.  In that speech he said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_215">Part 1 of the Bill contains the standard preliminary features of all legislative proposals including the Short Title, the interpretation section and the provision that the Exchequer will bear the cost of administering the Bill when enacted.  Part 2 contains amendments to the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  The 2003 Act, which gave effect to the European Union framework decision on the European Arrest Warrant, replaced extradition arrangements between member states with a system of surrender based on arrest warrants issued by judicial authorities in member states.  The amendments proposed in this part of the Bill are necessary to deal with issues that have arisen in the administration and implementation of the 2003 Act.  As the House will be aware, the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 has been in operation for more than five years.  There is now a better understanding in Ireland and across all member states of the European Arrest Warrant system.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The Deupty then voted enthusiastically in favour of the European arrest warrant system.  On 24 September 2009, Deputy McGrath issued a statement, which I think was directed at the national media but perhaps only got coverage in his local media, under the happy title "Lisbon treaty will help tackle crime in Tipperary".  He has not yet enlightened us as to whether or not the Lisbon treaty helped to tackle crime in Tipperary.  In that particular statement, which may still be accessible on his website, he said that organised crime is international by nature and requires, and I quote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_217">a concerted and united international response to it to be effectively tackled.  The Lisbon treaty will give the European Union more effective powers to combat cross-Border crime such as human trafficking and drug smuggling.  In an internal market where there are 500 million people living in 27 different countries, member states need to work more closely together so that they can defeat those international drug barons and slave traders.  Organised criminal groups have evolved over the years and tend to have highly sophisticated networks.  Ireland is best placed to tackle these criminals with the full force of the European Union behind it.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I presume that today Deputy McGrath is as concerned about international drug barons and slave traders as he was back in 2009.  In this context, he went on to say that "the treaty will also build on the work that the EU has already done in the area of cross-Border crime".  Listed below were just a few examples of EU anti-crime initiatives of which he obviously approved.  I ask Members to guess the first initiative to which he referred, and I quote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_219">The European arrest warrant has ensured that criminals can no longer escape justice by fleeing to another European Union member state.  The European arrest warrant has led to a substantial reduction in the time it takes to surrender a person from one member state to another for prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">The Deputy said that approvingly in urging his constituents to vote "Yes" to the Lisbon treaty.  What metamorphosis has the Deputy experienced since he delivered that speech?</p>
          <p eId="para_221">It was noticeable that in his contribution to this House, Deputy McGrath made no reference of any kind to these aspects.  However, he said something that is as relevant today as it was in 2009 concerning the European arrest warrant system.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The reforms we are introducing to the European arrest warrant system are of crucial importance in protecting citizens of this State, ensuring that those who commit serious crimes in this State can be returned here for trial, to protect citizens of this State from those who have committed serious crimes in other parts of Europe locating here and, possibly, engaging in criminality in this State and, to ensure that those against whom charges have been brought in other European Union countries can be effectively returned to the States that are bringing criminal proceedings against them within Europe.  These are important objectives.  Ultimately, they are about human rights and ensuring we do everything possible to protect every citizen of this State against criminality, that we bring those who are alleged to have committed offences before our courts, that we have the maximum co-operation from our European Union colleagues in returning to this State those who we want to put on trial and ensuring this State is not burdened by becoming a safe haven for criminals who have committed serious crime across the European Union.  In the context of our general extradition laws, I do not want this State to become a safe haven for those engaged in serious crime, be it in the United States or any other country in which the rule of law applies and in which there are constitutional protections of personal rights and civil liberties.</p>

        <speech by="#RobertDowds" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Deputy Robert Dowds</from>
          <p eId="para_352">I will be sharing time with Deputy Seán Kenny.  This is an issue on which I was not originally inclined to speak, but having been approached by members of a survivors of child abuse group I decided it was appropriate to speak.  It is quite far removed from any experience I have had in my life, so in a sense the more I looked at it the more it shocked me on two fronts.  The first is with regard to the State.  The 1916 Proclamation aspires to cherish all the children of the nation equally and sadly this story indicates the opposite.  Given that religious institutions were involved, the treatment is absolutely in contradiction with the core Christian message of loving one's neighbour as oneself.  It is particularly shocking when related to those two things.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Residential abuse in Ireland represents an exceptionally dark chapter and we had a number of dark chapters in the 20th century.  We are now familiar with the scars of torture that were inflicted on young children during their internment in these institutions.  The abuse perpetuated in so many industrial schools operated by the Catholic Church is difficult to comprehend and quite stomach churning.  The Ryan report exposed one of the blackest stains in the history of the State, including that the entire system treated children more like prison inmates and slaves than people with legal rights and human potential.  Some religious officials encouraged ritual beatings and consistency shielded their orders amid a culture of self-serving secrecy.  This is where the State comes in because Government inspectors failed to stop the abuses.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The entire State system, from the Garda to the Government, turned a blind eye.  It is a testament to the courage and the fortitude of the victims of these institutions, three of whom I met on Monday morning, that they did not give up the fight for justice for themselves, and that finally after many years of complicity and turning a blind eye the State and the religious institutions accepted that they had wronged those who had been placed in their care.  The Bill before us is the continuation of the process by which the State seeks to make amends for the abuse and the suffering it facilitated being inflicted upon a particularly vulnerable set of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Having known the Minister for many years, I know that the victims of this abuse will get nothing less than the highest priority when it comes to this Bill.  However, I wish to bring a number of issues to his attention.  Given the horrific experiences of many of the people held in these institutions, it is critical that those administering the fund must have a sufficient degree of empathy with the victims of abuse.  Having spoken to some victims of abuse, I understand that there is room for improvement in this regard.  Obviously, there must be safeguards in place, but at the end of the day, it must never be forgotten, in any part of the process, that the State is one of the guilty parties here, and that the victims are carrying very deep wounds and must be dealt with gently.  I therefore urge the Minister to make his appointments on this matter with an extra degree of care and consideration for the needs for the victims.  It is the least that the State owes them.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I have a concern over the financing of the administration of the fund.  Having read the Minister's opening speech on this debate I am somewhat unclear on the issue and would be grateful to get clarification.  Victims are very concerned that any funding for the administration of the fund should come from outside sources.  It would not be appropriate to fund both the administration and the reimbursements for victims from the same source of funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I understand that approximately 400 students who are the children of victims of the abuse have been receiving assistance to complete educational courses.  They are nearly finished but may be cut off from funding before they can complete them.  I urge the Minister to ensure that those who have already begun a course with the help of the Education Finance Fund can continue to be supported by the fund until they have completed their current course of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Former residents, who did not put in claims to the Residential Redress Board, are essentially locked out of any form of redress under the Bill.  I appreciate the need for a cut-off point in this regard, but I understand from survivors groups that a substantial number of victims did not go to the redress board and should perhaps be given a second chance.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether this is feasible.  However, these people should be kept in mind in some way.  Just because they did not claim redress from the State does not mean they have not been deeply hurt by the abuse they suffered.  Perhaps they were too grievously hurt by their experiences to go through the pain of dragging it up again.  Let us keep them in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I wish to raise a related issue.  Because I am a member of the Protestant minority, I have been approached by a number of people with connections with Bethany Home.  Unfortunately, no redress has been forthcoming from the State in regard to these victims, who suffered the same sort of punishment as the people covered by the Bill.  This matter is still a running sore for the victims of Bethany Home, and I ask the Minister to raise this issue with his Government colleagues.  I know that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has being making positive sounds in this regard and I hope it will yield positive results.  I want to pay tribute to Mr. Derek Leinster, Mr. Niall Meehan and their colleagues in the Bethany Homes Survivors Group, who continue to campaign for justice for all the victims in Protestant institutions.  I would appreciate if the Minister could bring that back to Cabinet.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanKenny" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_360">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and I welcome the Minister's presence in the House.  The Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill provides for the establishment of a fund to support the needs of survivors of residential institutional child abuse.  Some 15,000 former residents will be eligible to apply for support from the fund and every effort is being made to minimise the administration involved.  Some former residents have advocated a simpler distribution of the available money.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Following the publication of the Ryan report in May 2009, the congregations, which managed the residential institutions and were party to the 2002 indemnity agreement, were called upon to provide further substantial contributions by way of reparation.  The Government agreed to proceed with this legislation to establish a Residential Institutions Statutory Fund, to support the victims of residential institutional abuse, as endorsed by Dáil Éireann.  The legislation has been prepared following a public consultation process, which included consultations with groups representing survivors of residential institutional child abuse, the religious congregations and other interested parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Those who received an award from the redress board or an award or settlement in court proceedings and who would otherwise have received an award from the redress board will be eligible to apply for assistance from the fund.  In response to applications from eligible former residents, the fund can make arrangements for the provision of approved services and may pay grants to assist former residents to avail of approved services.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The Education Finance Board, which was established on a statutory basis in 2006 and is funded via the €12.7 million contribution provided by the religious congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement and is specifically earmarked for educational support for former residents and their families, has almost completed the performance of its functions.  The EFB will be dissolved and its staff will transfer to the statutory fund, which will assume its functions regarding the remaining moneys available to it.  I agree with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, that the fund should target resources at services to support former residents' needs, such as counselling, psychological support services, mental health services, health and personal social services, educational services and housing services.  The former residents need help, and the fund exists for the purpose of helping them.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The establishment of the fund follows extensive consultations with survivors of residential abuse and a public consultation process.  I met some of the survivors groups in the House in the past few days.  I have also met them in my constituency when they visited me, as they did other Deputies, to discuss the situation.  Seven individuals will operate the fund and it will be overseen by a chief executive answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It will fall within the scope of the Ombudsman and freedom of information legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">As responsibility for information for survivors will also be taken on by the fund, funding of survivor groups by the Department of Education and Skills will cease.  It is important that this transfer of responsibilities is handled in the correct way, with no chance of mistakes or of elements of these responsibilities falling through cracks during the transfer.  The fund will have the power to hold and dispose of land or an interest in land, and may acquire, hold and dispose of any other property.  Two of its members will be former residents of institutions, which I welcome.  The insight and experience of those who were abused in the institutions is essential.  While the Residential Institutions Redress Board provides financial compensation to those who suffered abuse while resident in the institutions, the new statutory fund will focus on meeting specified needs that many survivors have as they struggle with the effects of abuse that may have taken place many years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The fund will be financed from the cash contributions, of up to €110 million, offered by the religious congregations.  To date, contributions of approximately €20 million have been received from the congregations towards the fund.  These and the remaining contributions to be received will be invested in an investment account to be established by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  The fund will take over the functions of the Education Finance Board for abuse survivors, which will be dissolved.  I believe that the costs of the response to residential abuse should be shared on a 50:50 basis, between the taxpayer and those responsible for managing the institutions where the abuse took place.  I understand that efforts are continuing to pursue the 50:50 division with the management bodies involved and that the transfer of school infrastructure to the State for the benefit of the taxpayer has been proposed as a mechanism to allow those involved the opportunity to shoulder their share of the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">It is my hope that this new fund will provide ongoing support to those who suffered as children in residential care in the State.  We have let these people down in the past and we cannot be allowed to fail them again.  I am anxious that this legislation be passed and implemented as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_368">The Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill legislates for the provision of support for some of our most vulnerable citizens who, under the State-run institutions, suffered appalling mental, physical and sexual abuse.  It left a harrowing legacy where lives were blighted and ruined, and the scars of the sadistic cruelty inflicted have never healed.  The failure of successive Governments to protect the most vulnerable children and hold the abusers to account further compounded this dark and shameful period in Irish history.`</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The cover-up of the religious orders and the State's refusal to acknowledge the extent of the cruelty being inflicted within institutions that were supposed to be a safe haven for children have had far-reaching implications.  The Ryan report laid bare the scale of the systematic and widespread institutional abuse that had blighted so many lives over a number of decades.  What it revealed and the conclusions it came to shocked a nation that had become increasingly numbed by scandals that discredited the once unassailable power and authority of the Catholic Church and the religious orders.  It was a watershed moment that vindicated the efforts of the courageous survivors of abuse who had campaigned so vigorously for the truth about what had taken place in supposed institutions of care to be revealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">When I have met and spoken to survivors their constant criticism has been the lack of meaningful consultation with the victims of abuse and the fact that little or no effort has been made to listen to what they had to say.  Despite all the rhetoric in support of victims and the spilling of crocodile tears in recognition of their plight, more often than not survivors of abuse have been kept on the margins of the decision making process, with no credence given to what they want from the process of redress.  Typically, their views have been ignored or sidelined and their rights as individuals have been denied.  As evidence of this, it is clear that a straightforward way of consulting directly with survivors would have been to use the redress board's database which has the details of over 15,000 people who have previously made an application for recompense.  This would have been the ideal mechanism for the Government to elicit the views of the people who suffered under the care of the State and to find out from them what they required and in what form.  It would have been the ideal way to facilitate their input into shaping this legislation but, as has so often happened in the past, their views have been largely ignored and the decision on their behalf has been made without respect to their opinions or needs.  This Bill is intended to provide support for a range of services, including access to housing, education and counselling, yet it does not allow for compensation to be paid directly to individual survivors who wish to receive compensation in the form of a lump sum payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I note the Minister's disappointment with the offers made to date by the religious orders and the fact that he continues to pursue a 50:50 division with the management bodies involved.  He has suggested transfer of the ownership of the schools' infrastructure as one way of allowing those involved in the process the opportunity to shoulder their share of the cost.  It is now incumbent on the Minister to ensure the religious orders and congregations honour their past commitments and pay their financial obligations in full.  Their failure to do so to date has resulted in further hurt and anxiety for people who have already experienced too much suffering.  It is clear that many of the services for which the Bill provides are already available to survivors, or they should be, as a matter of right.  At a minimum, necessary procedures must be put in place so the victims of abuse can have preferential treatment when accessing health care and counselling facilities, as this is the type of enhanced provision that can make a meaningful difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Providing supports for children whose parents qualify under the redress Bill should be provided for in the legislation, as access to education can go some way towards enhancing an individual's opportunities and life chances.  It is also the case that education plays an important role in helping families break the cycle of inter-generational abuse and can be a platform that enhances the life chances of children whose parents were themselves the victims of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Part 4 of the Bill dissolves the Education Finance Board and transfers its functions to the residential institutions statutory fund board to distribute the remaining €12.7 million contribution provided by the congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement.  The Education Finance Board has advised that it expects its funds to be fully allocated on applications received by the end of November 2011 and that it is not therefore in a position to process any applications received after that date.  I hope the Minister will be able to confirm that anybody who has benefited under the Education Finance Board will have the opportunity to complete their courses and that they will remain fully funded.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">A serious flaw in the Bill is, of course, the eligibility criteria, which are currently confined to those who received an award from the redress board or compensation following a court decision or settlement.  Former residents of scheduled institutions are also excluded primarily because, as the Minister has already stated, if eligibility were significantly widened, the amounts available to fund services for individuals could be greatly reduced and the effectiveness of the statutory fund placed at risk.  He also went on to say that the question of reviewing the eligibility under the statutory fund could be considered following the establishment of the fund in the event of applications not resulting in a significant expenditure of the fund.  What this simply means is that money is the deciding factor which will dictate who will be entitled to receive help should they need it.  That is not good enough.  Limiting access to redress in this way will exclude a significant number of people who for many reasons have been unable to access compensation.  One difficulty with the redress fund was how best to communicate its existence to the thousands of survivors who would qualify for help but who, because they were widely dispersed throughout many countries, were unaware of its existence.  It also is the case that many victims of abuse, scarred by their past experiences, left institutions with few or no literacy or numeracy skills and subsequently struggled to find gainful employment.  Some turned to alcohol and substance abuse and ended up living lives on the margins of society far removed from the source of the communications that would have made them aware of the limited assistance that was being made available to them.  Clearly, a newspaper advertising campaign informing people of the redress board that was restricted to a handful of countries could only reach a minority of survivors.  It is wrong, therefore, that despite these flaws, the Government has sought to limit the eligibility of people who qualify for the redress fund.  There also is a perception among many survivors that a significant amount of money paid through the redress board went to the legal profession to pay for fees or for people sitting on advocacy groups.  It is important that every effort is made to ensure that resources made available to victims of abuse go directly to them and to their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Even more worrying has been the impact on people who went through the stressful and fraught process of gaining access to compensation, in which old wounds were reopened and the pain of past experiences was relived.  From my own family's experience, my first cousin, Danny Ferris, was put into St. Joseph's institution at the age of 14 and a half years.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">I have first-hand experience of visiting him in those institutions and at one stage seeing how his leg was broken but he did not even get hospital treatment.  When he was 16 years of age, my mother took him out of the institution and he lived with us for the remainder of his teenage and early life.  He has been dead for four years and he never sought compensation or went through any board because of the shame associated with what happened and what was done to him.  I am told the abuser lives in Dublin.  I do not know the person's name or anything about him and thank God for that.  However, I do know that for the rest of his life, my cousin carried a hidden scar in respect of what happened to him and what was done to him.  Moreover, I am sure his experience mirrors those of thousands of other people who went through the same situation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_381">Sensitivity and care must be employed when engaging with anyone attempting to seek assistance under the statutory fund Bill.  As has been stated in the past, no one wishes to see any individual deprived of his or her rights and consideration should be given to Deputy Brendan Smith's proposal that the Government incorporate into the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill the residual functions of the redress board.  Incorporating such a provision would provide a mechanism in order that the work of the redress board could be activated again should new applicants who meet the criteria arise.  This would be one way to safeguard the rights of those who are entitled to redress but who have been unable to access it.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">I will conclude by highlighting the plight of women and children who were placed in the Magdalene laundries and in Bethany Home, as well as the shameful refusal of the Government to provide any meaningful assistance to the victims of these institutions.  One year after the United Nations Committee against Torture recommendations that the Magdalene survivors receive a formal apology from the State and proper redress, a soon-to-be-published interdepartmental report into the laundry no doubt will tell one what one already knows, namely, the women held in such institutions suffered the most degrading and appalling treatment and deprivation imaginable under the State's watch.  As the Justice for Magdalenes group recently reported in testimony gathered from survivors, inmates could not leave the laundries, the doors were locked and the windows were inaccessible.  Moreover, if they did try to leave, they were returned by the Garda while others decided not to try to escape because they knew the same fate awaited them.  Every single survivor confirmed they were never paid, that no inspections ever were carried out and no Government official ever came to check them out.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The irrefutable evidence of what was inflicted on the Magdalene women led to a statement made in this Chamber in 2010 by the current Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  She rightly stated that former residents of the Magdalene laundries and Bethany Home must be included in the redress scheme.  She went on to state, correctly, that these institutions were, to all intents and purposes, places of detention and that residents had been held by the State for often indeterminate periods of confinement.  Her justifiable outrage at the then Government's failure to address properly this matter was echoed by another Labour Party Member, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who in 2005 correctly identified the scandal of Bethany Home as a matter of national importance.  Likewise, her party colleague, Deputy Costello, called on the Government of the day to include Bethany Home in a redress scheme.  To their credit, all three of the aforementioned Labour Party Deputies regularly highlighted this important issue.  However, now they are in government and in a position to right this terrible wrong inflicted on the survivors of Magdalene laundries and Bethany Home, will they live up to their previous contributions in this House?  By contrast, the campaigns of the survivors of both the Magdalene laundries and Bethany Home have helped to bring irrefutable evidence of State involvement into the public domain.  It is time for Fine Gael and Labour Party Ministers to step up to their worthy words by offering up an apology, redress and restitution for these now elderly men and women.  The Government's inaction in respect of both these matters is nothing short of shameful to date and until the Government acts on its own words, its members will be no better than those of previous Governments or of those who caused the hurt in the first instance.</p>

          <p eId="para_384">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill, which provides for the establishment of a statutory fund to support the needs of survivors of child abuse in residential institutions.  I note that 1,500 former residents are expected to be eligible to apply for support from the fund and every effort is being made by the Minister, who I welcome to the Chamber today, to minimise the administration involved.  The fund should target resources at services to support former residents' needs, such as counselling, psychological support services and mental health services, health and personal social services, educational services and housing services.  While the Residential Institutions Redress Board provides financial compensation to those who suffered abuse while resident in the institutions, this Bill provides for a new statutory fund, which will focus on meeting specified needs which many survivors have as they struggle with the effects of abuse that may have taken place many years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Following on from the last speaker's contribution,  I wish to deal specifically with the effects of child abuse and the trauma experienced by those who were in institutional care at the time.  Studies examining the relationship between childhood trauma, such as that suffered by many people in institutions, and adult suicidal behaviour have reported evidence the two are frequently linked.  For example, 12 of the 100 young people who were abused in children's homes in Clwyd, north Wales, have since taken their lives.  My contribution is based on consultation meetings with people who experienced industrial child sexual abuse conducted by the National Suicide Research Foundation based in Cork, which examined this issue.  This consultation took place in Tralee, Limerick, Waterford, Enniscorthy, Galway and Cork and involved 90 survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.  Some of the survivors had numerous insights themselves with regard to risk and protective factors for suicidal behaviour among people experiencing institutional abuse.  Many refer to alcohol abuse, depression, lack of education, difficulty obtaining employment and social isolation as being risk factors.  A frequently recurring theme was the belief instilled in them by those in charge of the institutions that nobody else wanted them and that they would never be successful in life.  Much of the abuse took place at night in the institutions and thus many survivors find it very difficult to sleep even now, decades after the abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Protective factors against suicide mentioned by survivors included relationships, children, contact with survivor groups and being able to secure steady employment and obtaining an education after they had left the institution.  Survivors who had attempted to take their own lives or who had considered doing so spoke about their situation around this time.  The emerging themes included not having support of their partner, feeling depressed or experiencing a sense of hopelessness, being under the influence of alcohol or having commenced counselling, thereby opening up the past.  Feeling that there is nobody to talk to who will understand is also frequently mentioned as an issue around the time of suicidal ideation.  Those who did not go ahead with their plans to take their own lives frequently referred to their children as being a protective factor.  A large number of survivors who participated in consultation meetings had experienced the death of either a friend or a member of family through suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The situation around the time of persons taking their own life sometimes reflected a detachment from the world, where a depressed individual seemed happier in the weeks running up to their suicide than they had been for some time.  Redress was a particularly traumatic time for survivors who had not yet attended counselling.  The experience of telling one's story for the first time to a panel of strangers with whom one had not built up any rapport and who were only interested in the facts of one's case was a terrible ordeal.  Many survivors have experienced mental and physical health difficulties in adult life.  Depression, bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder were evident.  Psychosomatic affects such as migraine and diarrhoea were mentioned by some of the survivors.  Survivors are concerned about the apparent over-use of medication as a treatment, in particular by GPs.  Many feel that the professionals do not understand their unique situation as survivors of institutional abuse and that greater awareness is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Transgenerational mental health issues also need to be addressed.  There have been some examples among survivors who are anxious for their adult children who are perhaps struggling with addictions or appear to be depressed or suicidal.  With no parenting model themselves survivors are often unsure how to deal with these issues or even what services are available for their children and how to access them.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">A recurring theme at the consultation meetings was that previously survivors did not speak about the abuse they suffered because they feared they would not be believed.  In spite of the extensive media coverage in recent years of cases of abuse in institutions some survivors still have not told their partners what they experienced in childhood.  Reasons for not wishing to explain this part of their lives include not wanting to upset the partner with full disclosure of abuse, or being afraid that the partner will be unable to deal with the knowledge and the relationship may suffer in consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Much of the abuse took place in the institutions and thus many survivors find it very difficult to sleep even now, as I stated.  For that reason night time is often when they need someone to talk to and the lack of a 24 hour help line, apart from the Samaritans, was mentioned by a number of survivors.  Upon leaving the institutions at the age of 16 survivors took various pathways in adult life.  Many found the outside world too difficult to cope with, especially when they were used to large self-contained institutions, big dormitories and the strict routine with hundreds of other people around.  As a result, a recurring theme was the return to institutional life, for example, by joining the Army.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Survivors recalled the difficulty of adjusting to life outside while trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves.  Many went to England as there one could ask for advice about simple things such as taking a bus and excuse one's lack of knowledge by saying one was unfamiliar with the country.  Others spoke of trying to understand one had to pay for food in supermarkets or learning to go to bed at night in a room on one's own with no noise, no other people around.  Trying to fit in socially on the outside was difficult given the sense of shame of growing up in an institutional school.  Survivors explained how they would invent a story to tell their new work colleagues or friends where they grew up and where their families now were.  They recalled being on the outside of their circle of friends, lacking in confidence and being careful not to be caught out in their stories.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Relationships were a particularly difficult issue for survivors, given that industrial schools for older children were single-sex.  Given the prevalence of sexual abuse in the industrial schools survivors did not have a comprehension of what constituted normal, consensual, sexual behaviour between adults.  Furthermore, nuns made a particular point of warning girls to stay away from men, without giving them any actual sex education.  For many there is a sad sense of missed opportunities for the relationships they did not get to experience in their younger days.  Marital disharmony or separation arose quite frequently in discussions with survivors.  For many this related back to when they told their spouses about the experience in the institution.  For others it resulted from the pressures of long periods of unemployment or alcohol abuse.  In addition, growing up in an institutional environment meant that survivors had a lack of experience in forming lasting relationships and had no model to learn from.  Those who had children outlined difficulties in parenting without having had any role models.  Some recalled giving their children everything they wanted without establishing boundaries.  Others were unsure how to be affectionate with their children in an appropriate manner.  Yet others felt their parenting was too regimented because the strict regime of the institution was the only parenting model they had experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Finding employment was difficult for many as they left the institutions with low levels of literacy.  Some spoke of being institutionalised in their employment.  Frequently, concern was expressed about patients being discharged from psychiatric wards too soon.  Although those concerned understand the capacity problem concerning crisis beds they believe the circumstances of some of their fellow survivors should necessitate keeping them in for observation for a longer period.  Some of these people have nowhere to go when they are discharged.  The Minister highlighted this point in regard to how the housing issue concerns survivors.  There was some discussion about the usefulness of a nursing home or halfway house for survivors who have to leave hospital but are not well enough to return to independent living in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I refer in conclusion to a professional person who identified suicidal behaviour among survivors.  When she spoke about a female patient of a psychiatrist, she said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_395">I do not think she will ever tell him [her husband] because when he hears the [television] programmes, he says "look at all those dreadful people lying just to get money", so of course she is never going to.  "That never happened", he says, so she will never tell him now.  Well, she says she will not.  So, all her life this was a piece kept away.   Her deepest friends do not know .... and her husband knows nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I would like to speak about the effects of child abuse.  It is right that we abhor child abuse.  As earlier speakers have said, it is important to understand its effects and its destructive outcomes for children.  When child abuse occurs, the victim can develop a variety of distressing feelings, thoughts and behaviours.  No child is psychologically prepared to cope with repeated sexual stimulation.  Even a two year old who cannot know sexual activity is wrong will develop problems as a result of his or her inability to cope with over-stimulation.  A child of five years or older who knows and cares for the abuser will become trapped between affection or loyalty for the person and the sense that sexual activities are terribly wrong.  If the child tries to break away from the sexual relationship, the abuser may threaten the child with violence or loss of love.  A child who is the victim of prolonged sexual abuse usually develops low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness and abnormal or disordered views on sex.  The child may become withdrawn or mistrustful of adults.  He or she can become suicidal.  Children who have been sexually abused sometimes have difficulty relating to other people other than on sexual terms.  Some of them become child abusers or prostitutes or experience other serious problems when they reach adulthood.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">There are often no obvious physical signs of child sexual abuse.  A number of signs can be detected through physical examination by a doctor.  Sexually abused children may develop an unusual interest in, or avoidance of, things of a sexual nature.  They can experience sleep problems and often have nightmares.  They can suffer depression and become withdrawn from friends or family.  They may make statements about their bodies being "dirty" or "damaged".  They might think there is something wrong with them in the genital area.  They may refuse to go to school, or become delinquent and have behavioural problems.  They often become secretive.  They sometimes display aspects of their sexual molestation in their drawings, games or fantasies.  They may be unusually aggressive.  The child may be extremely fearful of telling someone, although he or she might talk freely when a special effort has been made to help him or her to feel safe.  If a child says he or she has been molested, parents and supporters should try to remain calm and reassure him or her that what happened was not his or her fault.  They should seek a medical examination and a psychiatric consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The initial and short-term effects of sexual abuse usually occur within two years of the termination of the abuse.  These effects vary depending on the circumstances of the abuse and the child's stage of development.  They may include regressive behaviour such as a return to thumb-sucking or bed-wetting, sleep disturbance, eating problems, behavioural or performance problems in school and non-participation in school and social activities.  The negative effects of child abuse can affect victims for many years and into adulthood.  High levels of anxiety in these adults can result in self-destructive behaviours such as alcoholism, drug abuse, anxiety attacks, situation-specific anxiety disorders, insomnia, depression, attempted suicide and completed suicide.  Many victims encounter problems in their adult relationships and adult sexual functioning.  Revictimisation is a common phenomenon in people who were abused as children.  Research has shown that child sexual abuse victims are more likely to be victims of rape or be involved in physically abusive relationships as adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The ill-effects of child abuse are wide-ranging.  There is no one set of symptoms or outcomes.  Some children report little or no psychological distress from the abuse.  These children may be afraid to express their emotions and may be denying their feelings as a coping mechanism.  Other children may have sleeper effects - experiencing no harm in the short term but suffering serious problems in later life.  In an attempt to assess whether a child can recover from sexual abuse and to better understand the ill-effects of such abuse, psychologists have studied the factors that seem to lessen the impact of such abuse.  The factors that affect the amount of harm done to the victim include the age of the child, the duration, frequency and intrusiveness of the abuse, the degree of force used and the relationship with the abuser.  Issues such as the child's interpretation of the abuse, whether he or she discloses the abuse and how quickly he or she reports it can also affect the short-term and long-term consequences of the abuse.  As I have said, it is very easy and important to abhor child abuse and to establish redress boards to deal with this vital issue.  It is just as important to understand the effects and destructive outcomes for children who have suffered child abuse in institutions and elsewhere.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_402">I would like to acknowledge Deputy Neville's moving speech.  He showed great understanding of and compassion for people who have been abused.  I am familiar with his work in the area of suicide prevention.  I am glad to have been present to listen to his contribution to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Following the publication of the Ryan report in May 2009, the congregations that managed the residential institutions were called on to make further substantial contributions by way of reparation.  The word "reparation" can be associated with words like "repair" and "reparable" that involve setting things right, making amends, mending and compensating.  When the Cloyne report was published, I had to read it in stages because I found it so grim and awful to read what was done and was allowed to be done by the church and the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Every country has had its dark moments.  For the Jewish nation, it was the Holocaust.  For the people of Cambodia, it was the Killing Fields.  For the Balkan countries, it was the incidents in places like Srebrenica and Mostar.  This country's darkest moment was obviously the Famine, but I suggest that the systematic sexual, physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual abuse which was carried out by those in authority in the church, in the State and within families is in second place.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">We should not forget that some of the deaths that took place in these institutions have not yet been explained.  There is a sense in which those who are abused experience a form of death, in that part of a person dies when he or she is abused.  Those in positions of trust who perpetrated this abuse were responsible for vulnerable young people.  There are no words to describe that betrayal of trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">We know what happened, or did not happen, when instances of abuse was reported or mentioned to another person.  When action was taken, it was often inappropriate or wrong.  It involved moving the perpetrator and failing to call on the authorities along the line to take further action.  We know the authorities were sadly lacking at times.  There are issues regarding the involvement of the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">It seems that the welfare of the abuser was the paramount concern at times.  I know of a victim who has suggested that there was more of a focus on damage limitation than a genuine wish to help unreservedly.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">There is so much hurt, pain, damage and distress, not just for the immediate victim but also for their families and their relationships.  I know that some of those abused, in that hurt, pain and despair, turned to alcohol and drugs.  We know the additional difficulties and trauma that addiction brings.  There are areas, some in my constituency in Dublin Central, where we can see death by suicide or through addiction of young people in recent years having a direct link to family members who had been abused in these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">I have met people who have been abused.  What is common is the pain and hurt but how people deal with it varies considerably.  Some, as I mentioned, turned to alcohol and drugs.  Some left the country and although there was a better life for some of those, many ended up homeless and destitute.  Therefore, the services are also needed for those outside Ireland.  Others tried to bury the hurt and to keep the lid on.  This probably saved some because not everyone is comfortable with the process of opening up and talking about what happened.  In that case, the time factor is crucial because the healing process does not have a time limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The abuse took place over many decades and the abused heal at different paces so we cannot say the compensation moneys or the services can only be available for a certain time.  It is important that counselling and psychotherapy are available when the person who has been abused is ready to avail of them.  There is no "one size fits all" solution for victims of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">This was brought home to me very forcibly by a person I met who had been abused and whose reaction was very different.  He said he was trying to get on with his life with his family.  He was a man of very simple needs and his entertainment was television and radio but when the media coverage happened, his entertainment was lost as he did not want constant reminders of what had happened.  He was deprived of being able to turn on the radio and television because, at the time the Cloyne report was published and at other times, it was always there in front of him.  We could all say that person needs to be in therapy but forcing somebody into a counselling or psychotherapy situation is not the answer.  That man needs to know what is available to him when he is ready and when he chooses.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">We have had a public consultation process in which groups representing survivors, religious congregations and others were involved.  I want to acknowledge the purpose of the Bill, which is to provide for the establishment of a body to support the needs of former residents and to provide for the making of contributions by certain persons.  I also want to acknowledge the principles of equity, consistency and transparency, the provision of approved services and the requirement that those services will be evaluated, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Section 8 is very clear on the range of approved services, which are all needed.  These range from mental health, health, social, education, hospital and housing services and it is stated they would be provided both within and outside the State and that there is provision for further services to be added.  Another positive point is the effort to ensure there are standards for those approved services.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I want to consider the process of applying and the criteria around decisions on the applications.  For that, the board will take account of the individual circumstances, including personal and financial circumstances.  Everybody wants the money used in the best interests of those who were abused so I was disappointed not to see, within those principles, that there would be some emphasis on respecting the dignity of the person applying.  I know the board has to be fair but it sounds a very rigorous and intrusive process for vulnerable people.  A lot of information is required and I particularly wonder about this when practically all of that information is known already.  That section deals with individual personal and financial circumstances, assessing the likely effect of a service on health and general well-being, personal and social development, educational development and living conditions.  It then specifies the "supporting evidence that may be required" and, in a rather vague phrase, refers to taking into account any other matter that the board considers is a proper matter to be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">This set off a few alarm bells because I see this as an onerous process.  I can see it being difficult for vulnerable people unless there is a clear commitment to respecting the dignity of the person and that the individual needs are not lost in the layers of bureaucracy.  Form-filling is hard enough for people in the whole of their health.  Some of these people are so badly hurt that I am afraid individual needs will be lost or that they will not be addressed adequately.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">There are concerns from some of the survivors that the application process may be demeaning.  Victims of residential abuse should not be made to feel they are coming, cap in hand, almost with a begging bowl, and also with no guarantee of getting the compensation or service they need.  No amount of money will ever be adequate compensation for abuse and it can only go some way.  While some amounts have been given already, many of the survivors are of an advanced age so it is vital their needs are addressed soon and this is not allowed to drag on.  The same can be said in regard to their health and housing needs as it is now they need the services, not in years to come.  We must also ask about the records of the victims who have not come forward.  Is the Department confident it has records on all those who have been in the institutions?</p>
          <p eId="para_417">While this fund is not about making finance available, there are survivors who feel this is wrong.  Has the Minister taken into account those survivors, whose signatures he received, who are against the way in which this fund is being administered?  They say the details are with the Department and they believe it is preferable that there would be a simple system of dividing money among the survivors.  I personally believe a certain amount must be reserved for services.  It is sad that it took ten years for the Government to allocate €12.7 million from the education fund under the 2002 indemnity agreements, and I go back to the point about the urgency of these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The children and grandchildren of survivors have been removed from the new fund but they were included by the Education Finance Board.  This is where a further set amount to each named person who has been in an institution would be helpful and would be a financial support for children or grandchildren of survivors, whom we know have been affected by what has happened the abused family member - the parent or the grandparents who had been in an institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The board has nine members, all appointed by the Minister, four of whom will have been resident in an institution specified in the Schedule.  I am stating the obvious when I say these appointments are crucial to the process.  Some concerns arise in regard to the board's finances.  It should not cost any member of the board money to serve on it but we have so many examples of the expenses culture in this country, and I hope that will not happen with this board.  While there are allowances for expenses, they must be relatively modest.  With regard to the chief executive's salary, again, we have examples in this country of chief executives on absolutely obscene salaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The board will have a staff and certain sections of the Bill cover their remuneration and superannuation.  The National Treasury Management Agency will establish an investment account into which the sums will be deposited.  Another section states that the agency can advance to the board sums as requested for the purpose of defraying expenditure incurred by the board and advancing other sums to enable the Minister to make a payment to an appeals officer.  There will also be liaison officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">We know the constraints that local authorities are under at present and this will make for additional pressure.  While it is necessary, some issues arise.  There is a need for limits surrounding all of these aspects because, to me, the money is for those who were abused in the institutions, which is where it has to go.  There should be a limit on what goes from the fund towards these salaries and expenses.  There is also a committee of experts to be employed by the board and, again, there will be expenses for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">It is very unfortunate and sad that some survivors see the Bill as a massive job creation scheme, although that should not happen.  The survivors have been through a redress board and the Education Finance Board so life should be becoming easier for them, not more difficult.  To me, the needs of the survivors are paramount.  One survivor group said "We, as survivors, did not get a say as to what way this unwanted fund should be implemented", that "The Government consulted the so-called representative groups, who do not have an authority to speak on our behalf" and that it continued to support them.  This issue has to be addressed.  Are the groups speaking for all of the survivors or some of the survivors?  Are there survivors who are not within these groups or represented by them?  Their voices have to be heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The apology and the memorial must be handled in a dignified and careful manner and the voices of the survivors must be heard in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">With regard to the Justice for Magdalenes group, I wish to acknowledge their work and the way they went about it.  I am aware that their work and that of Professor Smith, Claire McGettrick and Maeve O'Rourke showed a respect for the dignity of individuals who worked in the laundries and provided them with a space to tell their stories.  I was very struck by what some of those ladies said, that they want to be believed and to have their voices heard.  We must hear them and allow them their dignity.  I acknowledge the work of those I have mentioned as an example of how we can do this right.  The issue is that progress is very slow on this.  Many of these ladies are of advanced age.  The Minister may say he does not wish to rush on this and that he wants to do it right.  However, the issue has been around a long time and time is very important.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_425">This is not a holistic group.  The consultation proved there are a variety of different responses required by the people who suffered abuse and it is for that reason I feel we should provide the maximum flexibility possible.  These were people who had a portion or all of their childhood controlled and stolen and who were not allowed any individualism.  Therefore, we owe them the ability to tell us what they want and what is right for them as individuals rather than as a group.  The State took control of these people's lives and now it is taking control again.  Of the nine people to be nominated by the Minister, the majority, five, are people who have not been in this situation, while four have.  I wonder why control of this was not given to those survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">When discussing these issues, we must remember those people who broke the silence, people like Christine Buckley, for whom I have enormous respect, and the late Mary Raftery.  We should never speak about this issue without remembering the service she gave and the debt of gratitude we owe her.  Children who were in institutions were shunned and were always considered to have been in the institution for a reason.  Some of the reasons were that their parents had died, they had missed school or something more serious.  Being in an institution was not regarded as normal and as a result the children felt they had less value as people.  This is an attitude that is very difficult to change as people go through life and many of these people have been hugely damaged by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I remember attending Goldenbridge for sixth class.  Ironically, my mother thought the school I was in was too violent and she sent me to Goldenbridge.  There were two schools in Goldenbridge at the time, one internal and the other the regular primary school, which I attended.  There were a few "orphans", as they were called, in my class.  These were the lucky, bright ones who got the opportunity to attend the regular school.  They were the cream of the crop or money had been provided for them.  I was aware that those children worked before they came to school and after they finished school each day.  I could see the marks on their hands from making the rosary beads, which was the work they did.  We did not see into their lives in the institution and they did not see out.  All I saw was the few girls in the class with me.  Goldenbridge orphanage was an institution on a par with a prison and that is what we are talking about here.  What we did not see came out later on and was revealed in the programmes made by Mary Raftery.  What went on was horrific.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I lived near Artane as a child, before moving to the wild west of Palmerstown.  In Artane people saw the lucky boys being brought out for a walk.  They walked two-by-two in their grey jerseys.  People crossed to the other side of the street when they saw these boys.  They did not talk to people and people did not talk to them.  These are the sorts of conditions we are talking about.  How can we make people forget this or the abuse that went on?  We must listen to these people and must provide the maximum flexibility to them to be individuals, as they were not allowed do that in their childhood.  It was stolen from them and they suffered horrific abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">This is what concerns me in the case of this Bill.  Deputy O'Sullivan has gone into detail with regard to the formality of making an application and so on.  What I see happening is that the people who need it most will be the people least able to put themselves through the application process, because it is too hurtful.  My main concerns are the lack of flexibility and concern for individuals.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">I welcome this Bill and welcome the establishment of the statutory fund for victims of abuse in residential institutions.  The extent of the abuse of women and children by those people entrusted with their care will forever be a stain on our nation.  What these people have lost can never be quantified here.  The reports we have seen, the stories we have heard and the many stories still untold represent the most awful betrayal and abuse of women and children in the history of this country.  My heart goes out to those victims of abuse, but I know my words are of little comfort because in the past, nobody listened, nobody asked questions and nobody said stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">What happened can never be allowed to happen again.  Those who suffered abuse still live in society and still struggle on a daily basis to deal with simple matters.  Over the past couple of days, I read the Justice for Magdalenes report that was issued by Professor James Smith of Boston College and was horrified by some of the stories.  While many have told their stories openly, many stories that may be even more horrific have never been told.   This process proposes to compensate victims and provide for counselling and whatever else victims may need in the future.  This is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The Bill is an important step in demonstrating support for victims of residential institutional abuse.  The statutory fund will provide victims of abuse in residential institution with access to the help and support they need, through the provision of counselling, health, education, housing and other services.  The Bill provides that former residents who received financial compensation from the redress board or who received an award or settlement in court proceedings and who would otherwise have received an award from the redress board will be eligible to apply for assistance from the fund.  It is expected that some 15,000 former residents, whether living in Ireland or abroad, will successfully complete the redress process and be eligible to apply for services they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The statutory fund of some €110 million will be financed by contributions from the congregations.  However, contributions of just €21.05 million have been received to date.  I urge the Minister to pursue those who have not so far contributed to this fund and make sure their contribution is given now and not at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Last year, the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established, and this will be complemented by the new child and family support agency.  The new Children First guidelines were published last year and the heads of the Bill to put the guidelines on a statutory basis have recently been published, along with the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012.  Preparations for the children's rights referendum are on target.  Our primary focus is to protect our children and ensure that the horrendous abuses suffered by so many are a thing of the past.  We all have a duty to protect children, whether our own or others, and to act when we know that children are at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The issue of the eligibility for the scheme has been raised, and I urge the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to examine whether all former residents of State institutions could be included, given that some did not manage to engage with the redress scheme for a variety of reasons.  I listened to the comments of other Deputies on this subject.  I have lived in Inchicore all my life, and when I was growing up, the industrial school in Goldenbridge was only 30 seconds away from my hall door.  I was conscious of the fact that there were two types of school in Goldenbridge: one for local children and one for residents of the institution.  I will not speak in defence of the Sisters of Mercy because I know there were horrific problems in the institution.  However, I believe the Sisters of Mercy, who were surrounded at the time by vulnerable young people living in Keogh Square, contributed to the education and health of many children from Inchicore.  As someone who has worked alongside many community organisations, I have seen much respect for the sisters who worked tirelessly to educate children in our community, and still do today.  As in every sphere, including politics, a small number of people can affect a system so badly that everyone is labelled.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne</from>
          <p eId="para_437">I welcome the publication of the Bill.  The Ryan and Murphy reports investigating abuse, including that which occurred at residential institutions, were shocking in their revelations of systemic abuse of a verbal, physical and sexual nature.  For many years, courageous individuals attempted to expose the despicable activities of some people who had been entrusted with the care of thousands of vulnerable children.  There were many obstacles to uncovering the truth: a deep unwillingness to act on the part of religious orders, the turning of a blind eye by the State, fear among the media of the ramifications of investigating what were then rumours and, above all, a deferential public seemingly unwilling to ask questions or raise social issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Given all this, it is entirely appropriate that the burden of rectifying as far as possible the grave injustices and mistakes of the past should be shared by the State and the churches.  Disgracefully, previous Ministers allowed their own deferential views to limit the amount of compensation payable by religious orders, leaving the taxpayer to foot the lion's share of the bill.  The revelations in the Ryan and Murphy reports evoked understandable anger from survivors, their families and wider society at the response of religious groups.  Some religious orders, clearly shocked and humbled by the revelations, pledged voluntarily to increase their contributions, and the Bill will facilitate this.  The legislation is a product of extensive consultation between the State, the religious orders and, most significantly, the survivors of abuse.  The fund will be available to an estimated 15,000 former residents who successfully complete the application process to the existing Residential Institutions Redress Board or who separately agree settlements which would have fallen under the remit of the redress board.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The legislation also facilitates the appointment of a board to oversee the fund, and there is no doubt the board will play a significant role in determining its effectiveness, chiefly by ensuring that appropriate services, including mental health, health, education and housing support services, are in place.  The board will have at least four members who resided as children in some of the institutions in question.  Provision is also made to ensure the board has appropriate expertise in the keeping of accounts, fund disbursal, management and administration, and so forth.  I am pleased to see that the chief executive of the board will be accountable to Oireachtas committees and that the Freedom of Information Act and recourse to the Ombudsman will apply.  These detailed provisions should provide reassurance that public moneys will be spent efficiently and effectively in an attempt to rectify the serious and disturbing events of the past.  It must always be remembered, however, that compensation cannot undo the theft of innocence and the loss of carefree and happy childhoods which were instead characterised by violence, abuse, intimidation and suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I wish I could say I have no concerns regarding the administration of previous funds to recompense survivors, but I cannot.  Unsettling matters have been brought to my attention by constituents who are survivors of abuse regarding the conduct of some organisations that were established to provide services to survivors.  Serious questions have also been raised by journalists investigating organisations.  It must be acknowledged that a great many organisations involved in assisting survivors do an impeccable job to the highest standards, and they must be commended for this.  However, at least one organisation, Right of Place, which has offices in Galway in Cork, has had to receive extra financial support from the HSE to remain solvent and, in the very recent past, has been unable to provide satisfactory accounts detailing to whom public funds were allocated.  As a result, the HSE rightly requested monthly expenditure and activity reports and quarterly face-to-face meetings with the organisation.  This raises the fundamental issue of proper and prudent expenditure of public moneys.  The residential institutions statutory fund must demonstrate that legislators have learned from the recent past, just as Irish society has learned from the grave injustices the system facilitated throughout the 20th century.  Every cent must be accounted for and every cent must benefit survivors as they attempt to address the problems caused by the traumatic experiences of their childhoods.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_441">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill, which addresses issues that were rampant in this country for a long time.  I compliment all those involved in the reporting of these issues when they were first brought to light.  I commend them for their courage and their willingness to stand their ground, in the face of some very stiff opposition, when it would have been easy for them to stand down.  Society owes them a great debt of gratitude for their resilience, their commitment and their conviction, and particularly for their actions which benefited this and future generations.  It serves as a lesson to us all to remember and contemplate these events so that we can make sure we do not see a repetition of such things in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">While many people felt that the manner by which people were placed in certain institutions, for whatever purpose, was not always in accordance with best practice, there were few who spoke out against it at the time.  Perhaps in the future some of the people who are currently in the care of the State will be the subject of reviews and examinations in view of standards that may then apply.  We must remember that it was not generally recognised that the institutions were not treating their residents in the manner in which they should have.  We must also remember that the State has a responsibility to those in its care, for whatever reason they come to be in that care, whether in hospitals, schools, corrective institutions, training areas, prisons or anywhere else.  The State has a responsibility to uphold the rights of the individual, which means State institutions must exercise a duty of care at all times.  Failure to recognise the rights of individuals will lead to similar cases in the future and the taxpayer may once again be required to come to the rescue of those who have been offended against.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I speak as someone who has met victims of institutional abuse.  What these victims had in common was that they could not recall events associated with their past without becoming emotional and tearful.  That was a clear indication to me that they had unhappy childhoods as a result of being put in the care of the State.  That is a sad reflection on any society because it is no good to claim we were not directly responsible for how we treat those who were vulnerable.  Society was responsible and we all stand condemned.  Those who were asked to exercise these functions on behalf of society have to accept a particular responsibility.  It is true that not everybody committed the same sins or ignored what was happening but, unfortunately, a lot of people who held responsible positions failed to act.  To this day, there are exceptions to good practice and even though they may be known to those in authority, issues continue to arise that impinge on the constitutional rights and welfare of individuals.  That should not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Whenever something is brought to the attention of the authorities, they have a duty to ensure any issues arising are investigated thoroughly in order to protect individuals, institutions and taxpayers in the long run.  If there were no breaches of good conduct, we would not be debating this Bill.  The lesson to be learned is that we must recognise wrongdoing that deprives individuals of their fundamental rights and entitlements at an earlier stage, regardless of what these individuals may have done or who they may have offended.  Children and young adults were referred to institutions for venial sins.  Certainly the punishment of incarceration and abuse was far in excess of what they deserved.  In many cases, unfortunate families and individuals who lived in deprived social and economic circumstances found their way into institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">While on the one hand we must recognise the good work done by voluntary and religious orders and groups, on the other a lot happened to besmirch the good name of both State and institutions.  We are now attempting to repay individuals for the physical and psychological damage that was done to them.  Similar events occurred in other jurisdictions.  These issues have received enough publicity over the years for us to realise the need to intervene at an early stage.  We should not do this in a spiteful or mean way but on health and safety grounds.  We have learned lessons but we have more to learn and I hope we do not pay the cost for further lessons in years to come.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_446">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill 2012.  Before I speak on the details of the Bill I express my solidarity with and understanding of the plight of all victims and survivors of sexual and other abuse.  Their suffering can never be forgotten but we will never be able to compensate them for the loss of their childhood.  If this House wants to be serious, we must put compassion, truth and justice at the top of our agenda.  Failure to act in this manner would be another crime against the survivors of abuse.  Good practice, quality child safety provisions and top-class legislation must be part of the solution.  Vigilance is also a part of the child protection agenda to ensure this abuse is not repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I commend the survivors on the courage and dignity they have shown but let us not forget the victims who were left adrift because they were unable to speak out.  Children with intellectual disabilities are the forgotten victims because they did not have the mental capacity or wherewithal to come out of the dark tunnel of abuse.  I urge the Minister to be creative and sensible in dealing with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Following the publication of the Ryan report in 2009, the congregations which managed the residential institutions and which were party to the 2002 indemnity agreement were asked to provide further contributions by way of reparation.  The Government agreed to proceed with legislation establishing a residential institution statutory fund in order to support the victims of abuse.  It is important to note that the decision received cross-party support in the Dáil.  This Bill was prepared following a process of public consultation with groups representing the survivors of residential institution child abuse, religious congregations and other interested parties.  The fund will be financed by the cash portion of the offers from the congregations, which totals approximately €110 million.  To date, contributions of €21.5 million have been received for the statutory fund.  These, and the remaining contributions to be received, will be invested in an investment account to be established by the NTMA.  Those who received an award from the redress board or an award or settlement in court proceedings, and those who have otherwise received an award from the redress board, will be eligible to apply for assistance to the fund.  I welcome that.  It is likely that some 15,000 former residents will successfully complete the redress process.  In response to applications from eligible residents, the fund can make arrangements for the provision of improved services and may pay grants to assist former residents to avail of approved services.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Looking beyond the details of the legislation, the Education Finance Board was established on a statutory basis in 2006 and is funded through a contribution from the religious congregations of €12.7 million under the 2000 indemnity agreement.  It is specifically earmarked for educational support for former residents and their families.  It has almost completed the performance of its functions.  The Education Finance Board will be dissolved and its staff will transfer to the statutory fund, which will assume its functions in respect of the remaining moneys available.  That is the background to the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I welcome Mr. Paddy Doyle to the Visitors Gallery.  He is a long time campaigner for people in institutions and on the broader issue of disability.  I met Paddy when my daughter was born.  She has an intellectual disability and he was one of the first people to influence me about disability rights and civil rights for people with disabilities.  I thank him for his work on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">When talking about the rights of children who came out of these institutions, we must remember they were the invisible children for many years.  Children who find themselves in tough situations are often not afforded the care and protection they deserve.  Historically, the State has shirked its responsibility for vulnerable children, allowing organisations like the church to fill gaps in services.  The Kilkenny incest investigation in 1993 was the first report to outline the gaps in Irish law causing grave problems for children.  Many subsequent reports regarding children, such as the Ferns, Ryan and Murphy reports, reiterated these concerns.  There has been much outcry but, unfortunately, little concrete action has been delivered.  We must watch this in respect of further debate in the House and the children who have suffered abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Over a decade after the publication of the Children First national guidelines, we do not have enforceable child protection law in Ireland.  The vetting of individuals working with children remains voluntary and the law continues to discriminate against certain children on the basis of the marriage status of their parents.  I am pleased the Minister is in the House.  We should be radical and creative.  Things that were done in the past are often positive.  It is not just a case of having so many points in the leaving certificate if one wants to work in the education service.  People also need other skills.  Many years ago, when applying for teacher training colleges, people had to undergo an in-depth interview as well as having academic qualifications.  When I turned up at St. Patrick's College, psychologists, others involved in education and those with an interest in children were in place and all students were vetted after the call to training.  We were all given a hard interview.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_454">It was my skill and determination, I hope.  I always remember that interview because they were selecting people who were suitable to work with children.  The interview was important as well as academic qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">According to a HSE report, one child in ten in foster care has no allocated social worker.  Last year, 120 children with mental health difficulties were admitted to adult psychiatric units.  Since 2000, 500 children have disappeared from State care and 90% of those have never been found.  We must monitor disadvantaged children in particular.  Children remain virtually invisible in the Irish Constitution.  They continue to be seen and not heard, even though the ISPCC has been vocal in its call for reform as far back as 1989.  Up to 2,000 children remain in legal limbo because the Constitution makes it impossible for them to be adopted into long-term foster families, even after years of little or no contact with their birth parents.  There are proposals on the table to deal with the issue and I will support them when they come on the pitch.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">If we want to lay the ghost of past failures to rest and learn from the mistakes highlighted in the Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports, children need to be listened to and provided with a safe environment in which to grow up.  I commend and thank the foster parents of this country for their magnificent work.  The vast majority do an excellent job, provide safety for children and a public service for many families.  They also prevent children getting into difficulty later in life by providing stability in the home.  I thank all foster parents in the country on behalf of all Oireachtas Members.  They do an excellent job but that does not mean we do not have to be vigilant in respect of that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">There is a sense in Ireland that something is not right with the system dealing with our children.  A series of traumatic headlines and reports have driven home the message that the State and society has been guilty of turning its back on children in this country.  We must face reality.  The general acknowledgement is accompanied by a sense of confusion about the issues at play.  People are immediately suspicious of overly legalistic language and there is a general sense that the sins of the past are in the past.  This reflects a worrying trend that the people of Ireland do not recognise children's rights as an immediate priority in light of the current economic crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">Yes, and I am part of all-party support for the referendum because it is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Campaigners for children have been met with genuine surprise when we tell people that child protection guidelines have not been put on a statutory footing.  Inequality between children of married and unmarried children provokes surprise and a strong reaction.  There is a fear that more rights for children means fewer rights for parents, reflecting the public's impression of rights as a zero-sum game.  The Irish people also have an emotional connection to the Irish Constitution.  Urgent and compelling reasons must be provided to change the<i>status quo</i>, which is why we need an open, honest and positive debate.  The Irish public are very sophisticated and will make up their mind based on the evidence.  They deal with the issues and the facts and then vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Historically, Ireland has a weak position on the rights of children.  Many people say Ireland, the State and the church has failed these children.  For too long, the voices of our children have been silenced.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">Urgent problems face children in this country.  The State must respond in a proportionate manner when vulnerable children are at risk.  The necessary resources are not being delivered.  I understand the resource issue but we must be on the ball and positive where vulnerable children are at risk.  Irish law continues to treat families with married parents differently to parents who are cohabiting or single.  There are serious knock-on effects for children.  There are gaps in the legal system and, because of legal loopholes, it is almost impossible to adopt children placed in State care if they were born to a married couple.  Up to 2,000 children live in a state of limbo, unable to be adopted by their long-term foster parents.  I will be supporting the legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_466">It is still around and still on the agenda.  Regarding constitutional loopholes, the Constitution is virtually silent on the rights of the child outside the traditional family unit, which has a negative impact on the welfare of vulnerable children.  I raise these issues because we need to discuss them today and because they are relevant to the broader debate on this issue.  There are concrete solutions to deal with the problems that arise.  As an Independent Member, I not only challenge but also put forward solutions, as I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The changes recommended in the Ryan report implementation plan must be made to ensure the litany of abuse visited on our children can never recur.  After-supports for children leaving the care system must be provided.  We must deal with this important issue.  If children who leave the care system do not have supports, they will end up in more trouble and difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The visibility of children in the Constitution must be increased.  Legislation must be put in place to standardise good practice in child protection work, and the Children First guidelines must be given legal force.  I emphasise the need for good practice.  I know from experience that there are excellent examples thereof.  That said, we need to ensure excellent services are provided to all children.  Some service providers on the front line claim there has been a change over the past ten or 15 years.  I note from my experience of intellectual disabilities services that many young care workers are involved with IT, independent living and personal development, but they are also top of the class with regard to child protection and safety.  Prosper Fingal service in Swords is excellent and there are other such services doing an excellent job.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The Government must offer leadership and commit to reforming the child protection and welfare systems.  If it does so, it will get my support.  If it drags his feet, it will be challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Section 8 stipulates the board can determine the approved services to be provided from the following classes of services - mental health services relating to the care and treatment of a person suffering from a mental illness or a mental disorder, counselling services and psychological support services; and health and personal social services, including general practitioner, hospital treatment, pharmacy and nursing services and services to assist in the maintenance at home of a former resident who is sick or infirm.  These provisions are important because we must provide supports for the 15,000 survivors.  Section 8 also refers to educational services and housing support services, including for the adaptation or improvement of real property but not including financial aid for the purchase, mortgage or charge of real property.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">On the issue of protecting children, we need a rights-based approach to monitoring child and youth well-being.  Understanding the gap between child and youth policy development and implementation is required.  We need to rethink the culture of youth justice in respect of research, rights and reflections on practice.  We must consider supporting educational achievement in areas of social deprivation, supporting the mental health of children and youth in respect of prevention in mental health services, and securing youth civic engagement.  There are many ideas to deal with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">We must ensure that the former residents of institutions are afforded the maximum support in the services they receive from day to day.  Society and the State owe them this because a grave injustice was done to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">Section 14 deals with the functions of the chief executive.  According to the explanatory memorandum, it provides:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_474">[...] that the chief executive shall manage and control generally the administration of the Board and perform other functions determined by the Board; that the chief executive is accountable to the Board and may make proposals to the Board; shall provide such information to the Board as the Board require and also provides for the delegation by the chief executive of any of his or her functions to a staff member subject to the approval of the Board.  Provision is included for the designation of a staff member, with their agreement, to perform the functions of the chief executive in the absence of the chief executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Section 15 deals with accountability.  There ought to be clear accountability.  Accountability of the chief executive to the Committee of Public Accounts is an important standard provision.  Accountability may be routine for many but accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts on this issue is to ensure that any money spent will be spent in a sensible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The agenda must involve truth, justice, compassion and support, which are important.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I welcome section 19 on the annual report and information.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I welcome the debate.  I urge all involved, regardless of political party or their independence, to be supportive.  I urge Members to support the rights of children, the referendum and any proposals that will improve the rights of children.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_479">I am sharing time with Deputies Fitzpatrick, Anne Ferris and Feighan.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I am thankful to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  The Bill aims to provide for the establishment of a statutory fund to support the survivors of institutional child abuse.  The Bill is necessitated by the long-standing failure of the State to take proper care of its most vulnerable citizens.  For decades, the well-being of children deemed to require care was delegated to religious institutions.  The statutory fund, which is the subject of the Bill, will be financed by the contributions from religious congregations.  This fund is but one element of the State's response to the litany of horrific abuses exposed in recent years.  The first and most important element of the response is to put in place a structure to ensure best practice is followed in every setting where children are found to ensure their safety and well-being.  Abuse survivors will agree with me that is the first step in any form of redress.  I agree great strides have been made in that respect across State institutions in recent years, but a huge volume of work remains to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The second step in achieving redress involves ascertaining the damage done, if the depth and extent of such damage can ever be properly assessed.  To this end, over 14,000 awards have been made to abuse survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The third element of address involves this Bill by way of taking care of the longer-term needs of the survivors.  To this end, the statutory fund provided for in the Bill is only available to those who receive an award from the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  However, unlike that board, the statutory fund will not make financial awards to former residents; instead, it will seek to provide approved services or grants to allow people to avail of such services.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Many Members on all sides of the House have received representations from former residents of residential institutions now located overseas.  It is important that their voices be heard also.  It is no wonder that many former residents of institutions left Ireland's shores as soon as they possibly could given the treatment meted out unfairly to them at the hands of those in the Government appointed to look after them.  Thus, it is especially important that such people be taken care of through services they will need in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The making available of educational services to both former residents and their children was an important role of the Education Finance Board.  Proper education can never take place in an environment full of fear.  For people whose place of education was also the scene of their abuse, there could never be a love of education.  Increasingly, a lack of education proves to be a barrier to well-paying jobs.  It was imperative that the cycle of poverty was broken.  Educating former residents and their children was a key tool in tackling a monstrous wrong.  However, in creating the present fund, some survivors have expressed the belief that the fund available should be confined to former residents.  Thus, it was decided that only former residents would be able to avail of the statutory fund.  Disenchantment was expressed by some correspondents in regard to groups representing survivors of abuse.  They cited a lack of accountability and a lack of a mandate for such groups.  In 2011, the Department funded five groups representing survivors in Ireland and three in the United Kingdom.  Last year, the Department of Education and Skills spent over €42,000 funding groups in Ireland and over €227,000 funding groups in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The wrong done to the children in question can never be righted.  The fear, dread and foreboding of their childhoods can never be eroded.  Their negative memories can never be replaced with positive ones, and the trust, so utterly shattered for them, can never be rebuilt.  However, exposing the wrongs done to them in the State-run institutions or those run by religious orders appointed by the State was only ever a first step in telling the horrific stories.  The longer-term care of the former residents is the focus of this Bill.  The services offered through the statutory fund will prove invaluable to the 15,000 former residents of the Irish institutions, wherever in the world they may find themselves.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_486">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill, which provides for a statutory fund to support the survivors of residential institution child abuse.  This Bill establishes a residential institution statutory fund board, which will oversee applications for assistance and make arrangements for the provision of approved services or grants to former residents.  The fund will be entirely financed by contributions from religious congregations.  Those who receive an award from the Residential Institutions Redress Board will be eligible for the funds, as will those who receive equivalent court settlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The Bill also provides for the dissolution of the Education Finance Board and the transfer of its functions to the residential institutions statutory fund board.  The fund will be entirely financed from the cash contributions of up to €110 million offered by the religious congregations who were party to the 2002 indemnity agreement.  They agreed to further contributions following the publication of the Ryan report in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">To date, contributions of over €21 million have been received from the congregations to the fund.  The fund's aim is to support the needs of survivors of the residential institution child abuse, as well as providing for a range of health, welfare and other services.  The fund will not make financial awards but the statutory fund board will arrange for the provision of a range of approved services.  The latter will include mental health, health and personal social services, GP and hospital treatment, nursing, education and housing supports for adapting or improving properties.  Housing support services do not include financial aid to buy a property.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The board will comprise nine members appointed by the Minister and there will be an equitable gender balance in so far as that is practical.  Four of the members will be former child residents of the institutions specified in the schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.  Among the other five board members, the Minister must ensure that some have expertise in or knowledge of keeping financial accounts and disbursement of funds, management and administration of an organisation, and provision of approved services.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Section 32 provides for the dissolution of the Education Finance Board, while section 33 provides for the transfer of its functions, properties and employees to the new board.  The board's functions include: paying grants to former residents of the institutions and their relatives; assisting them to avail of educational services; providing information on education services, for which grants are payable; and determining and publishing criteria for the payment of such grants.</p>

          <from>Deputy Anne Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_491">While I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill, the history leading to it is one that I wish had never occurred.  It is a history of abuse, which was systemic, endemic and covered up.  Many thousands of men and women, who were boys and girls then, suffered at the hands of a church and State that clearly did not give a damn about their welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">They had a responsibility to them, a duty of care, which was often ignored or discharged corruptly.  The church and State still have a responsibility to them, which is the reason for the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill.  The Bill is welcome and offers a much needed fund to support the education, health, housing and welfare needs of survivors of residential child abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The cost of responding to this abuse is now estimated to exceed €1.36 billion.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_494">It is €1.5 billion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnneFerris" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Deputy Anne Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_495">So it is even more.  I certainly believe that this should be shared on a 50-50 basis between church and State.  I was surprised by the outcome of the original indemnity deal negotiated in 2002.  There is still some mystery as to why the church was limited to providing €128 million in cash and property, especially when it would seem that the Department of Finance had suggested otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The most important outcome of this Bill is that victims will receive any and all assistance that they need.  It is incumbent on me to say, however, that those who were at fault should bear full responsibility for their actions.  Certainly, the original indemnity deal could in no way contribute fully to this responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">To this end, I support the Minister, Deputy Quinn's calls for further substantial contributions as a way of making reparations that are sorely needed.  The Minster has called for the school infrastructure that the congregations possess to be transferred to the State at no cost.  I would endorse this call as a helpful approach as it would allow a further shouldering of the costs while permitting schools to operate under the ethos they choose.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">It has been reported that 17 religious orders have an asset base of around €2.6 billion and therefore the feasibility of offering more to the overall fund is not beyond their means at all.  The end result of this process must be that victims' needs are adequately met.  It is also important that mechanisms are put in place that will prevent something like this from recurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">For that reason, I also welcome the Government's commitment to place the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis.  That measure, along with the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012, will also help in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">There is something very wrong at the heart of a church, of which I am a member, that would allow this abuse to happen.  It is clear from report after report that the violence suffered by children was horrific and was made worse by being covered up for so many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">There is also something wrong on wider issues concerning many of the church's teachings, its dogma and rhetoric.  They appear to be sadly at odds with what the general public feeling.  An interesting poll was taken on behalf of the Association of Catholic Priests, which showed that three quarters of the population believe the church's teaching on sexuality has no relevance to them.  The poll also demonstrated that a large majority thought priests ought to be allowed to marry, and that women priests should be ordained - God forbid.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The poll also showed strong disagreement with the church's teaching on homosexuality.  All of this demonstrates a wide disconnect with the people but I wonder, and worry, whether this is properly recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I commend the survivors who bravely came forward to highlight the abuse they experienced.  I would like to mention Christine Buckley in particular.  I was a pupil at Goldenbridge and while I was lucky not to have experienced abuse, hearing the awful stories that came out of that institution really brought the issue of abuse home to me.  It is very brave of her, and all the others who came forward, to bring light on a dark chapter of our history.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I am glad the Government is taking some of the necessary steps to do something about addressing past wrongs.  There is still a way to go, however, and more work is required to ensure that some measure of justice is achieved for all those who have suffered.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_213">
          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_505">I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister, Deputy Quinn, for bringing it before the House.  When the Ryan report was published it met with a huge outcry over how this could have happened.  It happened because church and State acted in collusion to brush all these unfortunate incidents under the carpet.  The church should never have been invited in to run our State, and the State should never have been tied hand-in-hand with the church.  It had a corrosive effect on the State and on the Catholic church, of which I am a member.  In the past ten or 15 years, both church and State have gone their own ways, which is beneficial for both.  The church has moved towards a more liberal attitude in the past 15 or 20 years, and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The events the Bill seeks to deal with should never have happened, however.  The State neglected some 15,000 people who were also neglected by the church which ran these facilities for the State.  I know from those who attend my constituency clinics that they are angry and feel let down.  Deputy Connaughton rightly pointed out that the minute they were able to leave these institutions they took the boat to get away from this country, which turned its back on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">When the Ryan report was published, for once, we could not blame the British.  This was of our own making.  The situation was an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  We called ourselves Christian and caring.    We did not care for the vulnerable young people in these institutions.  There were so many tiers in our society then, with people either belonging to a particular political party, group or the church.  We must now ensure that everyone is equal and is given the same opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The €128 million deal agreed was not in the interests of this State.  I believe the State got a very raw deal and that the church should come up with more funding.  I believe it will do so.  I am not here to criticise the church, which has done much good work down through the years.  Unfortunately, however, there was no vetting procedure in place therein, which allowed people with no interest in Christianity to infiltrate its ranks and undermine young innocent children.  We must now ensure that systems are put in place to ensure this does not happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">The fund must provide for counselling, mental health, education and housing services.  I am glad that the Bill provides that further services can be prescribed because despite that everything has been done to contact those involved, there are still people living outside of this country who do not know to what they are entitled and who have not availed of these services.  I welcome that it has been provided in the Bill that further services can be prescribed.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">It is important we ensure that the fund is spent on front line services rather than on administration.  I welcome the Bill.  I believe the Ryan report was the line in the sand in terms of how this State deals with this abuse.  We have grown up and are a lot more open.  Unfortunately, however, the 15,000 people who endured this abuse are still angry, and rightly so.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_511">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I commend the Minister and Government on bringing forward this Bill at this time.  The Government has received much criticism in regard to the publication of Bills.  However, I welcome that we are today discussing this long promised and badly needed legislation.  While this issue has been the focus of many people, there are many who were shocked, alarmed and concerned about the findings of the Ryan report, which it has been mentioned cost €1.5 million.  However, cost should not at this stage be a factor.  No money will ever compensate for the horrible atrocities and barbarities perpetrated on those involved.  Regardless of how slight the abuse, it should never have happened.  Ireland was a different place at that time.  It is easy to be wise after the event.  However, I do not condone that abuse in any shape or form.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Deputy Finian McGrath spoke earlier about the people with intellectual disabilities who knew no better because of their profound difficulties.  Those who were institutionalised in educational facilities at least knew, regardless of the type of education they were receiving, what was right and what was wrong.  I, too, would welcome implementation of the Children First guidelines.  I believe they will be a game-changer.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">There has been much reference to previous efforts in terms of negotiations with the church, of which I will not be critical.  The Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill 2012 is being introduced in the context of over a decade of different State responses to the issues of abuse in residential institutions.  It provides for the establishment of a fund to support the victims of abuse in residential institutions.  The fund is to be financed by contributions agreed with the religious congregations, which is important.  The policy aim of the fund, which will be administered by the residential institutions statutory fund board, is to support the education, health and welfare needs of survivors of residential child abuse.  That is vital.  We can never lose sight of that.  I know that the Minister is keen to ensure we do not.  As I stated earlier, money will do no good if it is not channelled in the right way.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I welcome also that people will be assessed so as to determine what service is appropriate to them, that these services will be approved services and that grants will be paid to former residents of this State so that they may avail of an approved service.  We must be very careful and ensure these services are approved services, ones which will benefit the unfortunate victims and ensure the best value for the State.  I am not being crude in terms of saying we must ensure best value for the State but it is important we do not only throw money at this problem, as has been done in the past.  Through my office, I have been involved with at least ten people who suffered abuse.  While they received some financial redress, it was no good to them.  It simply went like snow off a ditch.  They were given no meaningful counselling.  We must ensure that this funding is channelled to the appropriate places and that appropriate training is provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">As I stated earlier, people end up in many different situations.  People in every walk of life change their minds.  I was accused of doing so in this House this morning.  However, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a particular situation in Clonmel, where some of the Rosminian Brothers were found guilty of some heinous crimes.  The brothers also did much good.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">The people of Clonmel are confused.  A high profile gentleman - I will not mention any names -  a former resident of a Rosminian institution and Mayor of Clonmel, once held a civic reception for the Rosminians.  He also praised them at many public events in respect of the treatment he received in that institution.  He gave them the highest accolade a town could give, in terms of giving them a civic reception, and was supported by the council in doing so.  He stated time and again at a number of public events how good they were and how he would not have become an urban town councillor or Mayor but for the Rosminian Brothers in Ferryhouse.  Everyone believed him and accepted that.  We all know that the Rosminian Brothers have done great work.  However, this man, who once attacked local media people for printing an article about charges being brought against some of the Rosminian Brothers, later had a change of mind - I accept everyone has the right to do so - and has now become one of the leading advocates on this issue.  He has gained national notoriety on television - I understand he was on television last night - in this regard.  It is bizarre that he has made a complete turnaround and is now attacking the same people to whom he, when Mayor of Clonmel, gave a civic reception on behalf of the town.</p>

          <p eId="para_517">I apologise for interrupting the Deputy, but I must inform him that regardless of whether he names a person, where such a person becomes clearly identifiable, it is dangerous to be making critical remarks against that person when he or she is not present to respond to them.  The Deputy needs to be careful.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_518">Go raibh maith agat.  I will try to be cúramach.  Some of these people do outstanding work.  Christine Buckley and others have been mentioned.  It is bad enough that awful crimes were perpetrated but if any seeds of doubt are shown by these survivors and their organisations, and some of them have been very disappointed, it can throw a bad light on the situation so we must be careful because we cannot have this.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Survivors have come to my office to say they were very unhappy with what unfolded and how locally the money was channelled through a particular office.  We must be careful.  The heinous crimes committed were bad enough and we cannot have the State fund being abused.  I am pleased that on this occasion it will be channelled through the Department of Education and Skills for counselling and other services required not only for the victims but also their families.  I have to put on the record that people in Clonmel and South Tipperary are confused and I am also confused.  People can change their minds but there is no room for double standards, a total change of heart or jumping on the bandwagon.  This cannot be accepted.  I know it is not by the vast majority but unfortunately I had to say what I did with regard to this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I commend the survivors like Christine Buckley who have been champions and brought these cases to the fore.  They do great work and this work should not be diminished in any way.  They have also done great work in encouraging other victims to come forward and tell their stories and gain what hope and future they can for themselves and use the support services to be provided by the fund.  Other survivors have carried it silently for decades and will probably continue to do so.  Many of them are abroad, which is sad.  It is easy to be wise after the event and people live with this hell every hour of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I wish to mention a family very close to me whom I know well who provided foster care before it was popular and remunerated.  They worked with approximately 28 different children, some with whom I socialise with now.  They have been transformed.  They came from the most awful cases and lived with this family who did tremendous work.  I am dealing with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, because not only did the family not get a shilling from the State for taking the children, one of whom did £25,000 worth of damage to the house in one night in a psychotic incident because of what had happened that child, they also cannot receive a pension because they have neither the credit nor the stamps.  This case must be examined.  The 28 human beings they cared for have gone on to get married and have led all types of lives.  I could see the transformation in them.  I did not know the background at the time but it is wonderful to think where they are now.  I am sure there are many such families who also did not receive any payment because they did what they did out of human interest, kindness, compassion and a desire to help those less fortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Children ended up in institutions for many reasons such as accidents, suicide, poverty or criminality.  State-supported institutions contacted this family to take various children because it was known the family could deal with them in a particular specialised manner in a home setting and friendly therapeutic environment.  I am not diminishing in any way the fund of €1.5 billion but some cognisance must be given to these families.  I have spoken about one particular family but there are probably a number of others who gave of their time voluntarily and worked to make wonderful men and women of the people who now take part in life as near to normally as they can.  They still need a little support after the traumatic events they went through.  We cannot look at this coldly.  We must be able to look after the families who cherished these people and gave them a life.  I am not looking for anything magical, I am looking for recognition of the valuable time they spent.  One cannot place a monetary value on it but some support should be in place for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I thank the members of religious orders, particularly those in education.  A small number of politicians have damaged the reputation of people in the House.  People across the board have been found guilty of awful activities and besmirched the good name of many and varied institutions, such as FÁS.  The religious orders did outstanding work.  At this point I am trying to support myself.  I am on a voluntary board limited by guarantee to establish an adolescent drug treatment centre and we are negotiating with a religious institution on the use of the most spectacular building, which I often visited and in which I often had tea.  We are trying to get a voluntary contribution from the State.  This morning a situation in Sligo was discussed.  I do not know anything about it but the Minister had to respond on it.  Facilities exist and good work was done.  I was involved with Sister Veronica in establishing the Aislinn project in Ballyragget and good work was done there.  One could not get better people to head up an organisation than religious sisters or brothers because they have no other ties or demands and are normally well-educated.  They are driven by the ideals of a religious background, compassion and humanity to work on such a project.  We cannot throw out the baby with the bathwater and attack them all, because they have done tremendous work.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">I remember the first time I saw the Artane Boys Band march at a match.  They put on a great show at various all-Ireland finals.  I am 53 years of age and little did any of us believe that what was happening behind those walls could have happened.  One has a public image and a public face.  We have a different Ireland now.  It is easy to be wise in hindsight.  We now have Garda vetting.  I am involved in child care through a community group.  I do not knock the Garda Síochána, but the vetting system is too cumbersome and slow.  It is nothing like it used to be.  Previously Garda vetting involved a phone call to the local garda who knew every family in the parish and 99% of the time the garda was right.  Now in County Tipperary the service is centralised in Thurles and the gardaí do not have a clue who they are talking about.  Often I wonder whether it is worth the paper it is written on.  I am not being callous or cold, I am stating it is difficult to give a reference and we must be very careful it is fit for purpose.  We cannot make these mistakes again.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">We see cases all the time.  Recently I was shocked to learn of a case in my home county.  I could not believe it.  I knew the person, and worked and socialised with him.  It was shocking.  I do not know what desires and bizarre thoughts are in the minds of those who commit these heinous crimes.  People can be totally taken in and not even suspect.  It is a very sad situation.  It will always be with us so we must be mindful of it.  However, we cannot attack the institutions because while awful things happened much good was done too.  The education system in the country would be far poorer were it not for the excellent work and contributions of the sisters and brothers throughout the country.  I have sat on boards with them.  I have seen religious and lay schools amalgamated and the contribution made by the members of religious orders.  I have sat on interview boards and done everything one can think of with religious people and their contribution has been immense.  They feel hugely let down by the actions of a minority.  We must always remember this and be conscious of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Now that they are being removed we can see the cost of providing education.  It is unbearable and we cannot do it.  Where would we have been as a fledging State but for their work and how they brought education to people through night classes?  I do not knock the VECs which also did this.  We are not talking about that today - we are talking about the situation in the education system, which we can never forget.  I will never forget it and it cannot be said enough here.  Too many people are too quick to denounce everything else that went on.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I ask the Minister to be very cautious when setting up the board.  I know that he will rightly appoint four of the survivors.  In light of my earlier remarks, he needs to be certain that the people he appoints are there for the right motives.  While 99.9% of them are, I felt obliged to say what I said.  I will not say much more, a Cheann Comhairle, because I do not want to identify people here.  However, it does not sit easily with me or with many of my constituents that a certain individual may be portraying a double life.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The Bill has been well researched and documented.  Money will be channelled to the places it should go.  Since 2001 the Department of Education and Skills has spent €8 million to support the provision of information and referral services by support groups for former residents.  As with many other areas in life, money can naturally get gobbled up in setting up groups.  However, in the delivery of the service the victim cannot be sidelined in any way at any time.  The victim is paramount and we must ensure that every cent spent goes into the proper services.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Case conferences about children or other people often involve 15 officials of different ranking sitting around a table.  While many or all of them are there for good reasons and doing their best, it is impossible to do anything in such a situation.  I have sat on boards with 15 or 20 people and it is impossible for a survivor to have to face such a stressful situation.  Regardless of their present situation, they may have suffered over the long term.  While they may have an advocate with them, nonetheless it is too bureaucratic with too many people involved.  It should be kept slim and trim with the right people with the vision, passion and understanding, and it needs to be dealt with as sensitively as possible.  We cannot have scope for the heavy hand of the State or any institution dealing insensitively.  An inappropriate word or a syllable could be enough to frighten the person sitting across the table and make him or her feel bullied, threatened or intimidated.  We must remember they have been through horrific attacks on their being and they have been nurtured to come out of it.  Christine Buckley and others are doing great work in getting them out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">We must be awfully careful that the money is channelled in the right way and that every cent is spent to restore them their dignity, humanity, individualism and their good name so that they can be helped to live the best life they can.  We also need to try to reach out to those who have gone abroad and gone into hiding in some cases, which is the most difficult of all.  I wish the Minister well and commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">I welcome the Bill and I thank the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, for his hard work in ensuring the Bill was brought before the House as quickly as possible.  The Government obviously recognises the significance and importance of the issue and it has been determined to move to establish this fund as a priority.  The previous Government should be commended on its work with the establishment of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse in 2000.  Like everybody, I was appalled and shocked with the findings of the Ryan report published in 2009 and with the other reports into this matter.  It is absolutely shocking that widespread child abuse took place in residential institutions, which should have been safe places for children, especially given that these events did not occur too long ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Nothing will take away from the distress and damage caused to the residents of these institutions when they were children.  However, I am encouraged by the many steps the Government has taken to address the issue and to ensure the rights of children are protected in future.  The referendum on children's rights will take place later in the year.  Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 took place in the Seanad on Tuesday.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs, headed by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, was established last year with the sole purpose of dealing with policy issues that affect children showing that the Government is fully dedicated to address this situation.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, recently published the heads of the children first Bill, which is an important first step.  Children are certainly in the focus of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Some 15,000 people will be eligible for support from the statutory fund to be established by the Bill.  Obviously it is vital that the application process is as simple and quick as possible so that survivors do not have to endure any more pain or experience delays in getting support.  The fund will support services, including mental health services such as counselling and psychological support, educational services, housing services and personal social services as opposed to providing funds directly to former residents.  The fund will be administered by nine board members, four of whom will be survivors of residential institutions, which has been welcomed by the former residents.  Having shared the same appalling experiences they will be able to give invaluable input into how the fund will operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">More than €21 million has already been received from religious congregations for the fund, with €110 million needed to fully support the services for the 15,000 eligible people.  Eligibility to apply to the fund will be confined to those who have received an award under the Residential Institutions Redress Board or those who would otherwise have received an award but received a court settlement.  It is clear the Government does not wish to bankrupt any religious congregations, but it is important that each congregation contributes to the fund to help the survivors of abuse to have access to proper support services.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">It is tragic that sufferers were not listened to in the past and that many, who were abused, had to hide the truth from their family members.  It is also tragic that abuse was commonplace in many religious residential institutions and was allowed to continue for many years without anybody intervening to prevent it.  It is important that the costs are equally divided because the State also has a case to answer.  I welcome the establishment of the fund which will provide essential support services for the survivors.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_537">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important debate.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a statutory fund to support the needs of former residents of residential institutions, which was endorsed unanimously by the House following the publication of the Ryan report.  The distribution of this fund gives statutory recognition to the victims of abuse in our residential institutions and makes provision for counselling, health, education, housing and other services which are necessary to support victims.  I am also very conscious of the victims and am very aware that on every occasion on which this issue has been debated in this House and elsewhere, including on the airwaves, the victims have to relive the horror and suffering they endured throughout the years, which can be very painful for them.  Any words of mine are wholly inadequate to express the suffering of victims, many of whom I meet regularly in my constituency office in Ennis.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">There is a diversity of opinion among victims about the establishment of this fund.  Some victims believe that money from the fund should be allocated directly to them.  However, the Department of Education and Skills consulted widely with survivors' groups and individual victims, including survivors' groups and victims who are now living in the UK.  The Minister for Education and Skills has explained his reason for the approach taken in the Bill.  From the responses received during the consultation process, a number of needs were identified which this fund should address, including the importance of a holistic approach in counselling services, so physiotherapy and family support services are made available as part of those services; a proposal that home care packages should be made available for victims so survivors can avoid the need to be placed in institutional care in their older years; and the importance of providing adequate funding for the provision of health care services, including dental care, particularly in circumstances where such services are not covered by the provision of a medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">It was clear that the survivors' groups are anxious that this fund be managed in an effective manner and I welcome the fact that four of the nine members of the fund's board will be former residents.  This gives victims confidence that the board will oversee the applications for support in an effective and fair manner.  The Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Ryan report and I commend the Minister for Education and Skills on bringing this legislation before the House.  It is an important step in supporting victims who suffered abuse in our institutions.  Lessons must be learned from the past.  That is the reason the Government has established the interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of Senator Martin McAleese to establish the facts and clarify the State's involvement with the ten Magdalene laundries that existed in Ireland between 1992 and 1996.  The work is very important.  The committee has already met and heard individual testimonies from many of the victims.  I will be interested to see its findings when its work is completed.  I commend Senator McAleese on the work he is doing on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">When one meets with survivors of abuse, each of them will tells one that they tried to tell the story of what was happening, but nobody listened.  For too long, people stood by and let abuse happen.  For that reason it is essential that our child protection guidelines are put on a statutory basis.  I welcome the Government's plans to introduce a raft of legislative measures which will place children's rights and child protection guidelines on a statutory footing.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs recently published the heads of the Children First Bill, which is a key step.  Separate legislation will be published which will make it a criminal offence for a person to fail to disclose abuse.  In addition, the children referendum will strengthen children's rights in our Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Change and reform which had been promised to protect our vulnerable children has been delayed for far too long or has not been delivered.  As a Government Deputy, I am glad that this Government is acting in support of victims.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_542">I welcome this Bill which provides for the establishment of the residential institutions statutory fund that was proposed following the publication of the Ryan report.  The findings of that report exposed in all its awfulness the different types of abuse meted out to our young children by people in positions of power and trust in this State.  The physical, emotional and psychological abuse doled out in these institutions was matched by authorities that were complicit in both ignoring and condoning the horrors being experienced by vulnerable children and teenagers in the name of reformation of one kind or another.  Society, the Government and religious orders failed them.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">We must never forget this traumatic period in our history when, as a young democracy, we placed little value on our children and young people's well-being.  Violence and coercion appear to have been seen as the only ways to build good character and values.  Adults in positions of trust, wielding such power and aggression over young people, did not live up to the Christian values they purported to espouse.  We must never allow such horrors to recur.  Where people deviate into such behaviour we, as a society, must act swiftly to ensure that the full rigours of the law are used against such individuals to send a clear message that our young people are valued and deserve every opportunity to live safely in this Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Establishing a fund for the victims and their families is a means for them to be compensated but it can never truly compensate them for a lost childhood, full of pain and horror.  A fund that will give them access to services and educational opportunities is but one step for our society to try to recognise and abhor what happened to the victims.  The ongoing trauma prevented many of them from living an emotionally secure life and the subsequent fall-out for their families cannot be underestimated.  In this context I ask that the fund be accessible to all people who can prove that there were past residents of these institutions.  It appears unfair that only the people who have already accessed the redress board or the courts are allowed to apply to the proposed fund.  There might have been genuine reasons for not coming forward until now, and we are now proposing to compound the neglect of these victims through this exclusion.  That is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Access to education is the best way out of poverty.  The existing education fund was a successful way for families of victims to obtain educational grants.  This access should continue under the statutory fund for families of all the former residents as well as for the former residents.  I also ask that the fund be left open to philanthropic donations, which would ensure the fund would be sufficient to cover these needs, rather than just relying on the contributions of the religious orders and the Government, which will be a finite sum.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">There is still further work to be done.  While I welcome this Bill, we must also address the circumstances of the victims of the Magdalene laundries and the Bethany Homes, something which should be done sooner rather than later.  Services must be provided to address the needs of victims, who must be at the centre of all our actions.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_221">
          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_547">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and put my opinions on the record.  I support the legislation as proposed.  I have not had the opportunity, either in this House or in the Seanad, over the past number of years to speak on the issue of children's rights and the litany of abuses of those rights which we discovered in this country over the past ten to 15 years.  I will take this opportunity to add my voice to those who have spoken on the Ryan report and its findings in May 2009 and on other reports which have outlined widespread abuse over many years in different parts of the country.  In fact, I do not believe any part of the country has been exempt from some of the tales of horror that have been revealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">It is part of the first step in helping the victims that we uncover what happened and acknowledge the grave horrors inflicted upon them in a number of residential homes throughout the country.  It is an important first step.  It is difficult for people who are not trained in this area, of whom I am one, to get their mind around how an adult would inflict this torture on a child.  Very few crimes are more horrific than the removal of the innocence of a child.  I am lucky that I grew up in a close-knit family environment and that, like my siblings, I did not end up having to be committed to a residential institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">It is important to recall that many people who ended up in these residential homes in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s did so under rather dubious circumstances.  The people who were committing them to these homes and the advice that was given and taken on board as to which families and children should be taken into care were dubious, to say the least.  I am familiar with a family in my community that was split up in the 1950s.  I knew one of the siblings who, sadly, is now deceased.  He was very traumatised for the rest of his life as a result of what he endured in one of our residential homes.  Moreover, I am sure others among his siblings could have suffered a similar fate.  It is important to point out that not all the experts on whose advice people were committed to such residential institutions were clergy, as many were not.  It also is important to emphasise the abuses that took place were not all perpetrated by members of religious orders.  There was a complete abdication by the State of its role in looking after children who needed residential care and this simply was unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">I join previous speakers in commending the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Government on their efforts in producing legislation.  I note the publication of the heads of the children first Bill and the Minister's determination to make progress in respect of the children's rights referendum to enshrine specifically the rights of children into the Constitution.  However, legislation and rights enshrined in the Constitution are only part of what must happen.  It really is a question of how these rights will be enforced on the ground and of ensuring a sufficient mechanism exists for such rights to be upheld into the future.  That will be the difficult part of what must be done by the Government, particularly at a time when budgets are not exactly full across the board.  However, one cannot scrimp on protecting the rights of children.  If one is to learn anything from what happened for generations in Ireland, it is that one must pull out all the stops with regard to protecting children into the future.  I support the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, in that regard, as well as the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, who is present in the Chamber and who is responsible for the legislation under discussion.  It is a welcome step in the right direction.  While funding of this redress board is essential, victims also need other services, particularly in the health area and in education.  I join Deputies Breen and Corcoran Kennedy in asking that those particular avenues for funding will be available for victims into the future.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_222">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_551">This discussion is hugely important.  The provisions of the Bill provide for the establishment of a statutory fund to support the needs of former residents of residential institutions and if Members are to do justice to these victims, they should listen to them.  However, huge numbers of such victims have stated they are not satisfied the Bill's provisions meet their needs.  There could be agreement throughout the House that what happened in these institutions was one of the most disgraceful episodes in Irish history and that those who were subjected to abuse in institutions deserve Members' support and some form of redress, even though one cannot undo the wrong that was done to them.  However, I do not believe the Bill does this.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The Minister has stated he has engaged in extensive consultation with many of the groups of survivors of residential abuse but I simply do not buy this in respect of the consultation.  While I agree the Minister has met such groups, questions have been raised as to how representative they are of the thousands of victims of abuse.  Moreover, a number of the aforementioned groups are on record as stating they are not happy with the method the Minister has chosen to deal with this issue.  As for the level of consultation engaged in, the number of e-mails I have received personally in respect of raising objections to this Bill probably is greater than the number of people who were consulted about this Bill.  I acknowledge the Minister is looking at me in disbelief but that is a fact.  All of us, as Members of Parliament, have received horrific correspondence from victims who are not happy with the method that has been proposed.  Questions have been raised about a number of the organisations that were consulted.  Moreover, a number of the aforementioned organisations are on record as stating they do not believe the establishment of the fund in this way is the best way forward.  The belief that a fund should benefit the survivors, rather than creating a quango or an administrative bureaucracy to use up the money that then does not get to the victims, has been raised and I do not believe this has been addressed adequately.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">I will put on record the deep concern to which I referred at the outset and that everyone feels with regard to this situation.  Many victims outside of Ireland have gone on record to state they are the ones who are living away, lost, lonely, in poor health and who have been left out of the equation.  Moreover, they still consider themselves to be left out of the equation and this must be addressed.  I wish to read into the record one particular story I received.  It does not constitute personal abuse of the Minister and does not even mention him but it gives someone's story and puts it on the record.  Such people have the right to have their voices heard.  This individual stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_569">I am a survivor of sixteen years of brutal abuse in Tullamore Ireland. ... My abuse was starvation, broken bones and we were forced out to steal for our mother.  For sixteen years the Midland health board watched on and took notes of our abuse but [did] nothing.  I was in hospital for most of my young life with malnutrition and broken bones ... At the age of eleven I was put into care in Galway and then on to Lusk in Dublin.  While I was in these schools, I was molested by a Christian brother and by a fellow inmate.  I suffer severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  I have now been put on disability because I have a hard time living with my [post-traumatic stress disorder].  Abuse has destroyed my life and is with me 24/7.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">He went on to outline his circumstances but then concluded by stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_571">This Statutory fund has nothing [to offer me]. ... This is no good to those [of us] who have been left disabled or who are too old.  Irish victim support groups have refused to help victims who live outside Ireland.  I do not think that these groups should receive [money]...</p>
          <p eId="para_572">He pointed out that voices like his needed to be heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Many survivors take the view that the creation of a statutory Act to regulate the use of €110 million, painfully recovered from Catholic orders, is another bureaucratic nightmare and  there are simpler ways of dealing with this.  It has taken ten years to disburse the €12.7 million from the education fund.  Moreover, I understand that yesterday, the Minister or officials from his Department had meetings with some of the groups involved that sought changes to this legislation.  These changes are based on the fact that the youngest victims are now 60 years of age and are not getting any younger and many of them are significantly older.  Consequently, the longer one delays and the more bureaucratic one is, the less access those people, who everyone claims to wish to support, will have to resources.  At the meeting yesterday, I understand it was not admitted by either the Minister or representatives of his Department that it would take at least two years to set up this fund after which the application process would begin to kick in, a long and cumbersome process that would deny access to many of the victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">What they sought instead, perfectly legitimately in my view, is that the funds be divided up and distributed directly to those who need them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_578">We certainly will.  One of the victims who attended that meeting made a very good analogy, stating that what they were talking about was moneys being set up into funds which people can access for education, welfare, health, whatever.  This victim has a son who has autism.  He has been trying for two years to get a special wheelchair for his son but the HSE has not conceded to his request in any way.  He made the very valid point that if the moneys were paid directly to him he would avoid a great deal of wastage of public servants' time and could buy the wheelchair himself, which would meet his son's needs.  I believe the clergy also made the point that victims should have direct access to the funds.  There is a danger, a legitimate one in my view, that this money will be used to support quangos or groups in administration rather than going to the actual victims.  It is not in any way an unreasonable demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Another problem with the legislation is that it excludes the children and family members of abuse victims from accessing the funds, a mechanism which was available in the schemes previously.  The point has been made, and is well backed up by research, that the only way of breaking the cycle is through access to education and proper family support, etc.  Excluding children and families is not in any way doing justice to these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">There are enormous problems with the Bill.  We are already working on multiple amendments but it would be much preferable if the Bill was rejected at this Stage because-----</p>

          <p eId="para_582">It would, but sadly that is a consequence of the fact the Minister has not listened to the victims as sufficiently as he should.  Given that the Government has the majority it has there is no doubt the Bill will go to Committee Stage but we will certainly keep the Minister busy with multiple amendments in that regard.  Ultimately, we are talking about a population of thousands but, sadly, it is a diminishing one because of the age of the people involved.  There is no doubt that not only these people but their families also have been scarred for life because of what was done to them.  There must be redress and justice for them.  We can never undo the wrong that was done but can at least acknowledge it and try to put some form of redress in place.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Skills  (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
          <p eId="para_584">I will come back to some of the points that were made.  First, I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  As has been discussed, the Bill's primary purpose is to establish a statutory fund to support the needs of survivors, in keeping with the all-party motion which was unanimously agreed by the House in the aftermath of the Ryan report.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The general support for the Bill is welcome.  I noted the many concerns expressed by many Deputies.  On the issue of eligibility, some Deputies called for access to be broadened to include all former residents, relatives of victims and former residents of the Magdalen laundries and the Bethany Home.  As a maximum of €110 million will be available for the fund, to assist some 15,000 potential beneficiaries, in my view the optimal approach is to proceed on the basis we already proposed.  The question of review and eligibility can be considered after the fund is established, in the event there has not been a significant expenditure of the fund.  Extensive efforts were made to facilitate claims to the redress board and those former residents who did not apply to the board can avail of the counselling and family tracing services available.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I can clarify for Deputy Brendan Smith, who is present in the House, that those who gave evidence to the commission on child abuse will be eligible to apply where they have received awards from the redress board.  I can also clarify for Deputy Mary Lou McDonald that eligibility is not confined to those living in Ireland.  Former residents who received redress board awards will be eligible to apply for assistance, irrespective of where they live.  This is an important point, as some 40%, or just under half the number of applicants to the redress board, now live outside the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">To date, €21.05 million of the €110 million in cash contributions committed by congregations has been received.  A number of congregations have confirmed that their contributions will be received on the establishment of the fund.  I have written to the remaining congregations requesting confirmation of the timescales for the receipt of their contributions.  I expect to be in a position to confirm the arrangements when the Bill has been considered in committee.  Like other Deputies, I urge the congregations to fulfil their commitments and respond in a generous spirit.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Having regard to the financial situation facing the country and the burden already borne by taxpayers, the Exchequer is not in a position to top up the fund, as proposed by some Deputies.  Some Deputies raised demands from some survivors for the available money to be distributed on a simple<i>per capita</i> basis while others referred to the possibility of a <i>pro rata </i>distribution based on the redress board awards.  The purpose of the fund, however, is not, and never was, a form of additional compensation.  That issue has been dealt with by the redress board.  It is, as advocated in the original motion passed by all parties in this House, intended for the support of victims.  </p>
          <p eId="para_589">Eligible former residents will have a range of needs, with some likely to require more significant interventions than others.  The approach set out in the Bill is intended to support those needs.  I have consulted with very many people, including many of the victims who are represented by different individual groups and other bodies, as well as those unrepresented by anybody but themselves.  The nature of the victimisation they endured is such that it was never possible, and was never going to be the case, that there would be a coherent or cohesive representative body.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The current economic climate precludes the use of Exchequer funds to meet administration costs.  Every effort has been made to contain the administration overhead and I am confident that the administration costs will be kept to a minimum while we ensure the fund has the capacity to function effectively.  I point out to Deputy Daly there must be some mechanism for the distribution of funds but that does not mean it has to be some kind of bloated inefficient quango.  I assure the Deputy it will not be such a body.  I noted the concerns expressed regarding the need to ensure simple and accessible procedures and agree these should be pursued while acknowledging the need for the fund to confirm the legitimacy of its expenditure.  The essential function of the fund will be to use its resources to provide services and support the needs of eligible former residents.  The Bill places an onus on it to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of its resources.  The fund will have regard to the existence of publicly available services.  This is to ensure that it is not used in place of existing State-funded services but rather that it can supplement existing services for the benefit of survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">In addition to the points that were prepared after the initial debate that took place in the House some weeks ago, I listened with interest to the many contributions that were made in the House by various Deputies.  I cannot recall a Second Stage debate that has had so many contributions in this area, during my time with responsibility for it.  I know that victims have been in contact with many Deputies, on all sides of the House.  Before I came into this position, in the previous Dáil and the one before that, I was in contact with many victims and received their representations.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I believe the full revelations of the Ryan report were devastating to a point far beyond that we already knew, or thought we knew.  When I responded on behalf of the parliamentary Labour Party in opposition I was a strong supporter for the erection of a memorial to those victims.  That caused some discussion and debate among some of the victims and I now wish to respond to that.  This atrocity that occurred on this island, in our name, in an independent state, was something we did to ourselves.  It was not the fault of the British nor the function of some colonial exploitation.  It was not the foreign invader.  It was us, who did it to us.  For future generations, including the one now in the Visitors Gallery, who have no idea what this country was like in those days, we need to be able to say, for generation after generation, "We did this to ourselves.  We are capable and were capable in the past of doing such things to ourselves".  The memorial, therefore, should be a constant reminder that we must never let it happen again.  I believe the victims need a place where they can explain to their children, grandchildren and extended families that they could not live full lives because of the damage that was done to them.  We have heard tale after tale and story after story about the effects of abuse on people during their adult lives.  In some cases, people have not been able to articulate what was done to them.  As a consequence of that, the life experiences of their children and grandchildren have been irreparably damaged, distorted and deprived of the potential they would otherwise have had.  That is the significance and the importance of the memorial.  I know the memorial committee met this week.  I am not sure what its decision will be.  I assure those who are listening to this Second Stage debate and those who will read my concluding reply that the memorial, above and beyond any shape or form it will take, will be an important and significant piece of communication.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">I wish to respond to the comments of a number of Deputies, including Deputy Clare Daly, whom I interrupted in order to add to the debate.  I believe this is a place where we should talk to each other and listen to each other, even on Second Stage.  The State has distributed the guts of €1.5 billion to 15,000 victims of abuse who came forward.  The deal that was done with the church by Dr. Woods on behalf of the Bertie Ahern Government was frankly outrageous.  When I have spoken with the religious congregations, I have consistently argued that there is a responsibility on them to agree that the costs should be shared 50:50.  I have asked all 17 or 18 of them whether they accept that argument.  At the outset of this process, it was impossible to measure what the likely cost would be.  The figure I have mentioned significantly exceeded all of our expectations.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">We know that some people chose not to apply for redress, for a variety of reasons.  Some people did not want their families to know, did not want to go back there or did not want to ask for money.  We extended the length of time for which the window for applications was open.  The relevant period was much longer than was originally anticipated.  After we introduced legislation this time last year to impose a closing date on that window, we received approximately 1,500 additional applications before the closing date in the autumn of last year.  I am not sure how many of those applications will be processed to their completion.  Additional information is usually requested to verify and confirm that the person who made the initial application is entitled to compensation.  We simply do not know.  I have been told by the chairman of the board, former justice Esmond Smyth, that it will probably take approximately 15 months to process the last tranche of applications that arrived in the autumn of 2011.  The sum of money that is involved is frankly enormous.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Some of the religious congregations - we have not completed our negotiations with all of them - have said they have no more money to give.  According to the congregations, the figures mentioned in the recent<i>The Irish Times</i> series in advance of the Eucharistic Congress, which is taking place as we speak, were based on property valuations rather than on assets and cash deposits.  Obviously, those properties have lost their value considerably in recent times.  I assure the House that I am continuing to pursue the 50:50 proposal with those congregations.  I will repeat in this House what I have said to them as the Minister responsible.  I am aware that the religious congregation are ageing communities.  Many of them have retired from the active lives they engaged in when they provided services for this country in the education and health fields.  They have to care for their own rapidly ageing communities.  They do not have children or grandchildren of their own.  They just have themselves.  As anyone who has a relative in full-time care will know, care is very expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">My Government colleagues and I have absolutely no desire to bankrupt these communities.  They have given this country great service.  The vast majority of that service was positive and constructive.  As a former student of the Holy Ghost Fathers, I am one of those who benefited from that service.  I salute the contribution they have made.  Having said that, they are way shy of contributing the 50:50 share I have mentioned.  I have said to them that neither Fine Gael nor the Labour Party wants to damage, smear or besmirch the contributions they have made to our society.  We have paid €1.5 billion in cash, however.  This country is currently in a programme, having lost its economic sovereignty.  There has to be some tangible response from the congregations that were responsible, along with the State, for what happened.  We have paid more than 50%.  I am asking the communities in question to give us at no cost - not even legal transaction costs - the title deeds of the educational and medical infrastructure they own.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_598">That would bring us very close to a 50:50 deal.  In the area of education, I have responsibility for this country's 3,200 primary schools, some 92% of which are under the patronage of the Catholic Church, and 728 post-primary schools.  Many of our school buildings are located on the grounds of religious orders and are partially if not totally owned by the patron in question.  They were financed from the contributions of the members of the parish or more recently funded by grants from the State.  The most recent set of schools are all owned by the State and leased out to the operating patrons.  I have said to the religious congregations that the only reason we want the full freehold ownership - the ultimate founding title deed - of the school infrastructure is that it would allow us to ensure those schools are not sold off into the private sector.  I have assured them that for the duration each building remains to be used as a school, it will be used under the existing patronage of the patron and with the ethos of that patron, until such time as they voluntarily choose to change it.  This is not confiscation.  It is a way of enabling them to make their 50:50 contribution without disrupting the delivery of the service for which those buildings are currently used.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I have not had similar discussions of the same extent or detail with the religious congregations that own large hospitals around the country.  Not all of our hospitals are so owned.  However, the same principles would prevail for my purposes and those of this debate.  I think this will be seen in years to come as the settlement that was made by the religious congregations which, at the behest of the State, abused their power.  The State abused or neglected its own power to properly monitor what the congregations were doing.  We are all guilty in this respect.  It is not the case that "them over there" perpetrated this abuse against the most vulnerable people in society.  It was us.  Our predecessors in this Chamber refused to raise the questions that many of them heard.  Indeed, many people in society saw what was happening and chose not to say anything about it.  We have to learn a lesson from the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The €110 million fund that will be assembled will be used to deal with the consequences of the abuse that occurred.  It will not be used to compensate for the abuse that occurred.  That process has already taken place and was availed of by the 15,000 people who chose to apply.  I would like to address a question that was asked in that regard.  We have heard examples of the cases of people who, for some reason, chose not to apply even though the window was open for many years.  That was the choice they made.  It has been suggested that those people and others, such as those from the Magdalenes and Bethany House, should also be included in this round of monetary compensation.  It was suggested the money should go straight to the victims, not for counselling and for related services and purposes.  To divide 15,000 into €110 million will produce a very small sum of money relative to the 15,000 that went into €1.5 billion.  There are residual needs out there that need to be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">We have chosen to avoid the extraordinarily bureaucratic quango-type operation that would come into existence if we were to open up eligibility to everyone and anyone again.  Quite frankly, the time taken to process such an open-ended set of applications would be enormous.  That is why, reluctantly but necessarily, to respond exactly to the sentiments that were expressed by Deputy Clare Daly, and not to have an open-ended, long, tortuous, bureaucratic quango come into existence, we have decided pragmatically, in the full knowledge of the decision we were making, that we would use the database of the 15,000 people who have already been given awards.  That is the database that is already there - we know what it is.  To start again, given their age and given the period when the abuse took place, would have taken an enormous amount of time in terms of processing and verifying that information.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">I know that answer does not satisfy the requests and demands made by some people but I am giving it here, on the floor of the House on the conclusion of the Second Stage debate, to fellow Deputies so that they understand it.  While they may not agree with it, I am giving the logic and the rationale behind it.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">In conclusion, I say to the Members of this House and the other House that we will engage in a Committee Stage debate.  I am open to constructive proposals and amendments that make sense, are practical and can be implemented.  At the end of the day, the people to whom we are addressing the proceeds of this fund and related matters are fellow citizens whom we collectively in this State, or our parents and grandparents collectively in this State, allowed to be abused under our watch, in this Republic.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
            <p eId="para_727">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for discussion today.  As the House is aware, news came through late last night that the residential service provided by Wisdom Services at Cregg House in Sligo was to be withdrawn.  That was devastating news for the many families who have a member in residence there.  There are more than 214 residents at Cregg House.  The service covers the whole north west, including Sligo, Leitrim, west Cavan and south Donegal.  Many families from Donegal have benefited from the services at Cregg House over the years.  Their loved ones have been well looked after, and I know from talking to these families that they are extremely happy with the level of service that has been provided over the years.  There have never been any problems with access or visiting.  This news is devastating for the families and brings unnecessary uncertainty to them and to the residents of Cregg House, many of whom will be greatly affected by the turmoil and the prospect of having to move to completely new surroundings.  This will take a long time and will need to be handled carefully by the health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">Since 2005, Cregg House has had greater reductions in support than equivalent services across the country.  This information is gleaned from the HSE's own annual report.  It is important to remember this in the context of today's debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">This morning in the House, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, stated that the Cregg House Wisdom Services had voluntarily withdrawn its service.  That is, at best, disingenuous.  I know from discussions with Wisdom Services and with the families that they have tried to find a way to continue.  The real reason the service is being withdrawn at Cregg House is that, in 2012, it suffered a €1.3 million reduction in its budget from the HSE.  Since 2008, there has been a total reduction of almost €4 million in funding to this vital service.  It is important to put that €1.3 million reduction in context.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Joe Costello, spent €1.3 million in the last year on consultancy services in his Department.  This was for 65 reports, many of which will be unread and unused and will gather dust on shelves in the Department.  This is the very same amount of money that would have ensured the continuation of services at Cregg House.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">The statement last night from Wisdom Services said that the HSE would continue to provide the services.  I have no faith that this is the case.  Indeed, the statement from Wisdom Services reads: "We sincerely hope that the HSE can in the future secure the funding required to provide people with disabilities in this area with modern accommodation."  That is the crux of the issue.  How will the HSE provide for the residents of Cregg House in the context of reducing budgets, a recruitment embargo and the withdrawal of services across the board in the north west and around the country?  I demand that the HSE and the Government provide the funding for Wisdom Services and make up the amount of the backlog, because that is how the service can be continued.  In this way, families can be sure their loved ones will receive the care and attention they rightly deserve.</p>

          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_252">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health  (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_731">I thank Deputy Pringle for raising this matter.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the current position of Wisdom Services.  As the Deputy is aware, Wisdom Services is a voluntary body operated by the Daughters of Wisdom which provides services for people with disabilities in the north-west region.  It supports more than 200 service users, with 111 on campus, 75 in the community and 20 day attendees.  I was disappointed to learn that the Daughters of Wisdom, who operate Wisdom Services, have advised the HSE that they intend to withdraw from the provision of services on behalf of the HSE.  The HSE has been working with Wisdom Services for some time to address its financial concerns and identify opportunities for efficiencies and savings through potential new combinations of service delivery in the north west.  Wisdom Services has a cost containment plan for 2012, which has had some success, but despite detailed engagement by the HSE with its management, I regret that Wisdom Services has now decided to withdraw from service provision.  I would like to reassure the families of the children and adults with disabilities that their current level of service will continue to be provided.  I am requesting the HSE to work with Wisdom Services to ensure continuity of service for all clients while a transition process is being put in place.  I understand that Wisdom Services has written to families of service users and to staff to reassure them of its co-operation in this process.  I thank Wisdom Services for its dedication and commitment to providing services to children and adults in the north west since 1955.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">The HSE will now commence a detailed assessment of all aspects of Wisdom Service operations in order to arrive at a mutually agreed resolution on the continuation of services to its clients and, in particular, to ensure that service users will continue to receive the care and support they require.  I understand that early discussions are planned with the management of the service.  Wisdom Services was allocated €15.5 million by the HSE in 2012 and has been funded consistently over the years.  In addition, it was the beneficiary of 38% of all intellectual disability development moneys in this HSE area in the period 2006 to 2011, as well as additional capital funding.  This compares favourably with the percentage of clients with intellectual disabilities from the area covered by its services.  Accordingly, I do not accept that this service has been under-funded, allowing for the necessary reductions that have been applied evenly to all service providers in the last two to three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">I thank Wisdom Services for its work in providing services to children and adults over the years, and I urge all involved to work closely to ensure that the needs of service users and their families are given priority.  Even when I was in opposition I thought it reprehensible to frighten the families of people who relied on particular services.  This service will continue to be provided to the people who rely on it.  The service provider has done a good job over the years and we owe a debt of gratitude to the voluntary, private and religious service providers which stepped in when the State was reluctant to get involved.  The State is now more involved and while the services that are provided in the future will differ in some respects, in this instance the service on which people have come to depend will continue.</p>

          <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_253">
            <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
            <p eId="para_734">I reject the Minister of State's contention that I am trying to frighten service users and their families.  When I met family members today after they received the letter from Wisdom Services, they expressed concern for what the future holds.  When I look around the country and see how the HSE has been withdrawing services and cutting home care packages, I realise they are right to be worried.  I do not believe the HSE will be able to sustain the level of service these families have enjoyed.  It needs to make it clear to the families what type of service they can expect because they may face the prospect of moving their loved ones to alternative residential premises.  Will the HSE take over Cregg House in order to maintain the service there?</p>
            <p eId="para_735">The family of a son who entered hospital recently had to care for him because of staffing issues.  The hospital could not provide the care and attention this family's loved one required.  Wisdom Services provided that level of service and it was disingenuous of the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to imply that Wisdom Services is voluntarily withdrawing.  If the funding had not been cut by €1.3 million this year, it would not be in this situation and the service would not be under threat.  I hope the HSE will at least make contact with the families to reassure them the service they expect will continue.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm whether the HSE will continue to provide the services in Cregg House.</p>

            <p eId="para_736">I presume the families and individuals who have particular concern about this matter are following the debate.  There was nothing disingenuous in the Minister's reply this morning.  People decide to discontinue providing services for all sorts of reasons and this is not the first year in which the Daughters of Wisdom and Cregg House have encountered difficulties in funding.  Negotiations have been ongoing over the service and I understand the families were extremely happy with the service provided.  It is to its credit that Wisdom Services is seeking to ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible.  I assure families that day services, residential accommodation and respite care will continue to be provided without gaps.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">The trying times in which we live demand a little bit more from all of us.  Everybody is feeling that burden but we need to be especially conscious of the people to whom we deliver services, including at Cregg House.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">I remind the Deputy that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, has only been in his current office for a portion of a year.  I think he deserves an apology.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_740">Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan offers her apologies because she cannot be with us.  I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue on behalf of the Oireachtas all-party interest group on sexual and reproductive health and rights.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, will be aware that, with the Rio+20 conference and the target date for realisation of the millennium development goals imminent, Ireland along with its international development partners will be evaluating the progress achieved, restating and renewing their commitments to achieving the unmet goals, setting new targets and, most important, establishing priorities.  The all-party interest group is concerned to ensure Ireland prioritises gender issues and, specifically, sexual and reproductive health and rights in its input into these decisions, particularly while it exerts its influence while holding the EU Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">Family planning is particularly important in this regard because it underpins the achievement of all the millennium development goals.  The ability of women in poor countries to decide when to start having children and how to space them improves maternal and infant mortality, reduces miscarriages and abortions, particularly unsafe abortions which are unfortunately most prevalent in poorer countries, and impacts on the material well-being of the entire population because fewer children mean better fed and educated children.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">In renewing the sustainable development targets in the Rio+20 conference, it is crucial that we do not ignore population issues.  Sheer numbers are at least as damaging to the planet as excessive consumption and waste in rich countries.  I ask our delegation to bring this message to the table in Rio.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">I also wish to raise the issue of women's family planning needs in conflict situations.  Women are particularly vulnerable where there is war, natural disaster or mass migration.  I welcome the Minister of State's announcement that funds will be transferred from the Ghana depot to the starving people in west Africa.  Normally in these situations the priority is food, shelter and medical supplies, while family planning and contraceptives are forgotten.  However, it is precisely in situations where law and order breaks down that the latter are needed.  If we are to prioritise maternal health, all aspects of aid must be proofed for its impact on this area.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AnneFerris" eId="spk_257">
            <from>Deputy Anne Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_744">Next year we will hold the Presidency of the EU, which gives the Government a great opportunity to put sexual and reproductive health and rights at the forefront of the UN development agenda.  The framework for the millennium development goals expires in 2015 and it is vital these rights are prioritised for the next framework.  I do not think the link between sexual and reproductive rights and poverty alleviation is being made sufficiently clear and the neglect of this issue is to the detriment of the millennium development goals.  This is not a controversial issue, although some may attempt to undermine it by claiming otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">Among these rights are the right to information on these matters and the right to gender equality.  Access to adequate health facilities is also required.  It is clear that women who gain access to greater educational and economic choice have a significantly greater chance of breaking intergenerational cycles of poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">Ill-health from causes related to sexuality and reproduction remains a major cause of preventable death, disability and suffering among women, particularly in low and middle income countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">A briefing report from the WHO on progress in this area stated that the decline in the maternal mortality ratio has been slow and remains uneven.  Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, east Asia, north Africa, southeast Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have shown no incline and none of them have reached the target of 5.5% required to achieve the millennium development goal target.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">Some 8 million of the estimated 210 million women who become pregnant each year experience life-threatening complications.  Every year 536 women die during pregnancy and childbirth.  Some 99% of these deaths occur in developing countries, making maternal mortality the health statistic with the greatest disparity between developed and developing countries.  Ensuring universal access to skilled attendants at childbirth, emergency obstetric care, postpartum care, preventing unsafe abortions and widening contraceptive choices are some of the interventions shown to reduce maternal morbidity.  I urge the Government to take the opportunity presented by the EU Presidency to ensure these items are firmly on the agenda.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade  (Deputy Joe Costello)</from>
            <p eId="para_749">I thank Deputies Mitchell and Anne Ferris for raising this matter.  It is accepted internationally, and the Government agrees, that the provision of reproductive health services to women is essential in tackling the continuing high rates of maternal mortality in the developing world.  These include pre-natal and postnatal care, emergency obstetric services and access to family planning services.  The position Ireland takes in international policy discussions on sexual and reproductive health is based on a firm commitment to the programme of action agreed at the international conference on population and development, ICPD, in Cairo 1994.  The ICPD set out a number of clear principles of reproductive health.  These include the importance of gender equality and the empowerment of women in reducing poverty and vulnerability, the right of all women to the information and means to make autonomous decisions about their fertility, and the link between women's control over their fertility and the wider empowerment of women in the economic, social and political life.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">The agreement on the ICPD programme of action was the first time the international community committed to the goal of universal access to reproductive health care by 2015, a target later integrated into the millennium development goals, MDG.  The fifth MDG is to improve maternal health.  Ireland is fully committed to helping to achieve the goal.  Through our aid programme, we provide funding for programmes that aim to improve maternal health, reduce maternal mortality and provide family planning and reproductive health services to women in the developing world.  Unfortunately, less progress has been made on the targets set out under the fifth MDG than on any other development targets.  For instance, there is still a massive unmet need for family planning globally, especially in the poorest countries and communities.  We need broad international consensus on sexual and reproductive health issues if serious progress is to be made on meeting these targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">Ireland's main partners for our support of reproductive health and maternal health programmes include the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, and Irish and international NGOs.  Ireland has provided almost €30 million in funding to UNFPA since 2005.  We also support reproductive and maternal health programmes as integral elements in our assistance in many of Irish Aid's priority countries, including Ethiopia and Mozambique.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">One of Ireland's development priorities for our Presidency of the Council of the EU in 2013 will be agreeing a common EU position for UN General Assembly high level meeting in September 2013 on the millennium development goals and developing a position on the framework for international development after 2015, the target date for the MDGs.  Ireland's consistent position has been to draw particular attention to the targets and the countries where least progress has been made, notably in sub-Saharan Africa.  We will continue to emphasise the need for a renewed commitment to reducing maternal mortality and to achieving universal access to reproductive health care.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">The European Commission has started the process for preparing a Commission communication on the MDG review and post-2015 development framework and will formally launch a public consultation in the next few weeks.  The consultation will last some 12 weeks.  We expect the Commission communication will be available in early 2013.  Ireland will work closely with the Commission throughout the process and we look forward to having Council conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on this important issue during Ireland's Presidency.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_754">I am pleased this issue will be to the fore in our Presidency.  The good news is that, since 1994, there has been a 50% drop in maternal mortality in the developing world.  There are still unmet goals and 1,000 women a day die in childbirth, which is unacceptable.  Over 200 million women have no access to family planning.  This is partly because AIDS resulted in diverting funds away from family planning and towards solving AIDS.  The inverse relationship between maternal mortality and the availability of contraception means it is essential that funds are redirected to family planning.  It is more than just a case of funding - political will is at least as important from the donor and recipient countries.  I recognise the Minister of State has that political will.  I ask the Minister of State to use every opportunity during the Presidency and in his interaction with recipient countries to ensure they prioritise policies and practices that put maternal health to the fore and prioritise millennium development goals Nos. 4 and 5.</p>

            <p eId="para_755">I thank the Minister of State for his positive report and I am heartened to hear the Government is committed to having this at the forefront during the European Presidency.  Less progress has been made on the targets set in the fifth millennium development goals than in any other development issue.  This must be grasped.  As Deputy Mitchell said, there must be cross-party political support and political will.  We must show ourselves to be leaders and it is not good enough that the target has been left behind.  Women are dying everyday in less developed countries and something must be done.  I welcome the report of the Minister of State.  Deputies Mitchell and Maureen O'Sullivan and I will be keeping an eye on matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_756">I thank the Deputies for their remarks.  These are issues of life and death for mothers and children.  Maternal, child care and gender issues have always been central to the Irish Aid programme and will continue to be so while I am Minister of State.  We have a key role in preparing for the post-2015 millennium development goals.  The review will start during our Presidency and the first summit meeting will take place in New York in September 2015.  We are charged with developing a common European Union negotiating position.  It will be done during our Presidency and agreed at the Council meetings during the Presidency.  This will be the basis for the negotiations to begin in September 2013, which will continue until September 2015.  The post-millennium development goals will be the second stage.  We are in a position to play a key role in that respect and we note that the fifth millennium development goal, concerning reproductive health and maternal child care, is the one that has been least developed to a successful degree.  It is an area to which we will pay particular attention.</p>

          <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_262">
            <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
            <p eId="para_757">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important item.  I and my colleagues in Fianna Fáil support the retention of the 4th Western Brigade and its headquarters status in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  Reforms of the Defence Forces should not be done in isolation or on a piecemeal basis.  Any reforms should be carried out within the framework of the Green Paper, whereby all interested parties would be consulted.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">I accept there is no threat to close Custume Barracks and that the only people using this line are Government members who are doing so as a smoke-screen to cover up the real issue at hand.  The decision to reduce the number of brigades from three to two was that of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter.  I am disappointed he did not have the courtesy to attend this debate.  It was he who wrote to the chief of the Defence Forces in December seeking a report on the reduction.  He has received this report and I believe an announcement is imminent.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">Is the 4th Western Brigade for the chop according to the report?  If so, what will be the strength of the remaining units?  Can the Minister of State name the units that will remain in Custume Barracks, Athlone?  Can he confirm that the 600 personnel currently linked to the Western Brigade in Athlone could be relocated?  Does he realise the considerable economic impact this would have not only on the town of Athlone but also on the much wider midlands area?  The local chamber of commerce has predicted an economic loss in the region of €24 million annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">Does the Minister of State realise just how severely the 4th Western Brigade has been hit, with barracks closing in Mullingar, Longford, Cavan and Lifford, to name but a few?  Does he not agree that the central location of Athlone is ideal for headquarters of any future brigade?</p>
            <p eId="para_761">Possibly the most important issue concerns the Army personnel and their families.  I refer to the men and women who have dedicated their lives to service to the town, region and country.  The manner in which the Government is treating them is nothing short of appalling and scandalous.  There is considerable anxiety and worry and nothing is being done by the Government to alleviate the fear.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">I ask the Minister of State to defer any decision and work within the framework of the Green Paper, which is included in the programme for Government.  He should make a commitment on the floor of this House that the Minister for Defence and the Taoiseach will meet a delegation from those who attended the recently held public meeting, a selection of Oireachtas Members and representatives from Athlone Town Council, not just to engage in some cosmetic exercise but to engage in a meaningful manner to ensure the future of Custume Barracks and the headquarters status of the 4th Western Brigade.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_763">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me time to discuss this very important matter, namely, the need for the Minister for Defence, in light of the ongoing scare-mongering regarding the downgrading of Custume Barracks, Athlone, and the rumours relating to the 4th Western Brigade, to confirm his statement that there will be no downgrading of the barracks or job losses in Athlone.  I acknowledge the considerable contribution and effort of my constituency colleague Deputy Nicky McFadden to save the facility in Athlone.  She raised this at the parliamentary party meeting and at every available opportunity, not only this year but also over the past four or five years.  She has made a considerable contribution towards obtaining in the region of €6 million to upgrade services in Athlone over the past four or five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">It is essential to put to rest the very calculated political rabble-rousing that is seeking to cause fear and anger in the area, which has already shouldered more than its fair share of economic fallout.  My primary consideration at all times is to ensure that Custume Barracks will continue to operate in its present capacity.  My colleague and I will fight any proposal to close or downgrade the barracks, or carry out any threat against the 4th Western Brigade.  They are vital to the economic and social profile of Athlone and must be retained.  The barracks has been a feature of Athlone life since 1697.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">I welcome the opportunity to share time with my constituency colleague Deputy Troy.  I hope we are united in this matter for the good of our constituents, and not for personal gain for a political party.  I am here to address the growing consensus in County Westmeath that the future of Custume Barracks and the 4th Western Brigade are at risk.  However, I am determined to put what are merely rumours to rest.  With politically motivated scaremongering raising fear and anger in an area already hard-hit by the economic downturn and credence being provided to those only too willing to believe there is no smoke without fire, I am anxious that assurance be given by the Minister of State, on behalf of the Minister for Defence, that Custume Barracks will be upgraded, not downgraded.  I want him to confirm that there will be no job losses in Athlone.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">In my dealings with the Minister, I have found him to be honest and fair at all times.  His door is open to the Deputies from my constituency with regard to the well-being of the Defence Forces and the people living within the communities in which Defence Forces personnel are based.  His record stands in regard to the open way in which he dealt with and facilitated the purchase of Connolly Barracks, Longford, by the local authority for the use of the people.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">In the interest of our constituents in Athlone, I ask Deputy Troy to support Deputy McFadden and me in maintaining a calm, rational approach to the issue, which has been stirred up by the extreme elements through the use of false facts etc.  The Minister has already given assurance.  We want the rumours put to rest this evening.  I hope he will reinforce his position and offer us reassurance.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Deputy Paul Kehoe)</from>
            <p eId="para_768">I thank Deputies Bannon and Troy for raising this issue.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, regrets that he is unable to address this topical issue as he is officiating at a citizenship ceremony this afternoon in the Convention Centre Dublin.  I believe the Deputies will accept his apologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">As the Deputies are aware, arising from the Government's comprehensive review of expenditure, the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, was reduced to 9,500 personnel.  In response to this reduced strength ceiling, the Minister initiated a major reorganisation of the Defence Forces, both permanent and reserve.  This reorganisation will encompass a reduction in the number of Army brigades from the current three to two.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">A three-brigade structure was originally introduced during the 1990s when the strength ceiling of the PDF was revised to approximately 11,500 personnel.  It was retained when the strength ceiling of the PDF was reduced to 10,500 as part of the White Paper on Defence, 2000.  However, it is no longer viable to retain a three-brigade structure within a revised PDF strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">The priority is on maintaining the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force to the greatest extent possible, within the reduced strength ceiling.  This will be achieved through rationalising administrative and support functions and rebalancing force elements.  The reorganisation builds upon and complements the efficiencies arising from recent barracks closures and, as the Minister has repeatedly stated, no further barracks closures are required.  There will, of course, be movement of functions and personnel within and between barracks, as provided for in the Croke Park agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">The Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff are identifying approaches to reducing the number of Army brigades from the current three to two.  The Minister has received an agreed interim report from the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff and it has been his stated preference to await the submission of final proposals before making any announcements.  Unfortunately, there is an ongoing campaign of misleading speculation about Custume Barracks, Athlone, raising unnecessary concerns locally about the barracks and going so far as to suggest that the removal of the brigade headquarters would result in some 600 personnel being withdrawn from the barracks.  Reform is challenging in itself, particularly for the personnel directly affected, and this negative speculation is unhelpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">To counter this negative campaign and support the completion of the preparatory work, the Minister finds it necessary to clarify the position with regard to Custume Barracks.  I can confirm that the brigade headquarters for the two new brigades will be located in Cork and Dublin.  However, I can also confirm that within an overall strength of 9,500 the numbers serving in Custume Barracks will be of the order of 1,000 personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">When the Government came in to office in March 2011, there were approximately 900 personnel in Custume Barracks and there are currently approximately 1,050 personnel in the barracks.  Consequently, the new arrangements with regard to the brigade will have no dramatic impact on the numbers in Custume Barracks.  The Minister is disappointed at the necessity to announce decisions on the re-organisation before being in a position to outline the final outcome in its totality.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">Work is ongoing to finalise proposals on the remainder of the re-organisation.  The Minister will be in a position to address questions of detail on completion of this work.  The representative associations will be fully consulted on all matters that fall within the scope of representation when this work is complete.</p>

            <p eId="para_778">The re-organisation affirms the Government's intention that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to fulfil all of its assigned roles to the greatest extent possible.

            <p eId="para_779">The Minister of State's reply is extremely disappointing, to say the least.  I suppose he drew the short straw because he has had to give such devastating news to the House.  There are 1,400 plus soldiers attached to Custume Barracks in Athlone, when one includes personnel serving overseas, yet the ceiling will be 1,000 according to the Minister of State.  A calculator is not required to work out that there will be 400 fewer soldiers initially.  It is the first time in the history of the State that there will not be a Commander-General there.  A minimum of 400 soldiers will be moving from Athlone, which will result in a loss of €20 million to the local economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">The Green Paper review is a total sham.  The Government is reforming the Defence Forces in isolation and on a piecemeal basis.  The review, which was part of the programme for Government, is a sham.  What has this Government got against Westmeath?  It closed Columb Barracks in Mullingar and is now downgrading Custume Barracks in Athlone.  The Minister of State said the numbers went up in Athlone in the past 12 months, but that happened because barracks were closed in Mullingar and Cavan.  What has the Government got against Westmeath?</p>
            <p eId="para_781">As part of its consultation process, the Government should confirm that the west will be losing the Western Brigade headquarter status, which is in the Taoiseach's own area.  What does the Taoiseach have to say about that?</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_813">The greater Dublin drainage project is being directed by Fingal County Council to plan and build a new massive regional sewerage plant in north Dublin that will treat a population equivalent to 350,000 in 2020, moving up to perhaps 700,000 or more up to 2040.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">Under phase 2 of the project, rural Clonshaugh, on the city boundary in Dublin north east, has been selected as one of three emerging preferred site options for this massive new sewerage plant, along with Annsbrook and Newtown Corduff near Lusk.  I understand that all three project options will be considered further in detail before one emerging preferred option is decided on and a planning application is made to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The inclusion of Clonshaugh as one of three emerging preferred sites has rightly been described as cynical and outrageous by residents right across my constituency, including Clonshaugh, Newbury, Riverside, Carragh Park, Priorswood, Darndale, Belcamp, Belmaine, Clare Hall, Airfield, Donaghmeade, Clongriffen, the coast, Baldoyle itself and Portmarnock.  It would go against all natural justice to locate this waste water treatment plant one field north of the Fingal-Dublin border rather than in the heart of Fingal county, which is the region which the plant will service.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">In my submissions to phases 1 and 2 of the consultation programme on this sewage plant I argued strongly that it would be unjustifiable to select the Clonshaugh site, in particular because of the size of the proposed plant and its certain negative affects on the huge adjacent population.  Disturbingly, no socioeconomic impact survey was undertaken by Jacobs Tobin of the negative impacts on the almost 25,000-30,000 people who will be living directly adjacent to or only metres away from this monstrous sewage plant, if located in Clonshaugh.  There also appears to have been no comparative analysis and appropriate weighting given to the population densities at each of the original nine sites.  Clearly, the high population density around Clonshaugh will be particularly negatively affected if the plant is to go ahead at that location.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">Given the range of planning challenges still facing the north fringe of Dublin, of which I know the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, is well aware, including Priory Hall and the pyrite disaster, it would be catastrophic to locate this major new sewage and waste water plant in the north fringe region, which is where Clonshaugh is located.  Such a decision would wreck the two local authority plans for the region, which are currently being prepared by Dublin City Council.  In addition to its unique planning difficulties, the north fringe is also characterised by its unique environment.  The core coastal area and highly protected amenity coastal district, the proposed outfall for this plan, would be at Baldoyle-Portmarnock, which is a polder.  The possible location, therefore, proposes a significant environmental threat to the velvet strand from Portmarnock to Baldoyle Bay and on to the Malahide Estuary.  This area is a European conservation area and Natura 2000 site.  Placing a sewage outfall there would be an incredible breach of EU environmental policy.  The proposed site location is also in line with the lower flight path of the main runway of Dublin Airport - it is barely outside of the Airport's inner safety zone - and the clear danger of gas emissions to aviation aside, locating a massive sewage plant in the middle of a district which has already been designated as part of the lands of the critical airport economic zone would severely hamper the economic development of the region.  In this regard, the Minister of State will be aware of the plans for a high-tech industrial hub in this region, which could potentially facilitate up to 10,000 jobs.  I learned yesterday from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, that exactly that number of people in the adjoining parishes are unemployed, a figure which is increasing daily.  It would be contemptible to jeopardise these long-standing plans by locating a massive regional sewage plant at the location.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">Local businesses such as the successful Bewley's Dublin Airport Hotel will be less than 500 metres from the Clonshaugh site.  Mr. Kieran O'Donovan, manager of that hotel, has already spoken publicly of the great damage this project could do to its business.  It would devastate a number of long-standing rural and new urban communities and recreational facilities from Clonshaugh-Belcamp eastwards to Portmarnock and destroy long-standing Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council plans for the region in terms of a diversion of the Malahide Road.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">The feeling in my constituency is that this is being dumped on the edge of a vulnerable lower income residential district despite there being more appropriate locations, from a service and environmental point of view, in the heart of Fingal county.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_820">I am taking this topical issue debate on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  I thank Deputy Broughan for the opportunity to outline the position on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">In March 2011, Fingal County Council appointed consultants to prepare a preliminary report and environmental impact assessment for the greater Dublin regional drainage project-north Dublin treatment plant and orbital sewer.  The identification of potential locations for the regional waste water treatment plant is an important step in this process.  In October 2011, as part of phase 1, alternative sites assessment and route selection report, Fingal County Council identified nine potential land parcels in the northern part of the greater Dublin area within which a proposed regional waste water treatment plant could potentially be located, along with a marine outfall and an orbital drainage system.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">The council carried out an eight week non-statutory public consultation seeking views on the proposals and the land parcels.  These nine land parcels were then assessed as potential locations in which to site the regional waste water treatment plant.  The routes for the orbital drainage system and the marine outfall pipe locations were also assessed.  Site specific information, more indepth desktop research, consultations and detailed site surveys, as well as feedback from the public were used to assist in identifying the locations with the least impact under 15 criteria.  Of these nine land parcels, three sites have now been identified by the council as emerging preferred site options in the phase 2 alternative sites assessment and route selection report.  A further eight week non-statutory public consultation period commenced on Monday, 14 May 2012, and runs until 6 July 2012.  As part of this process, four open days are being arranged by the council where the public can meet with the project team to discuss the report.  I note Deputy Broughan has made submissions in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">When the preferred site is identified the council will prepare detailed plans and complete an environmental impact statement.  This EIS, together with a planning application under the Planning and Development Strategic Infrastructure Act 2006, will be submitted to An Bord Pleanála, which will carry out its own statutory public consultation on the project.  The Minister's main role in water services projects is to provide capital funding for the work through the Department's water services investment programme.  He may in the future have a statutory role should there be a requirement for a foreshore licence for the project.  Beyond the inclusion of the project in the investment programme for planning and funding of the planning stage, the Minister has not commented on these proposals as they developed as this might prejudice his statutory role and-or the role of An Bord Pleanála.  It is a matter for Fingal County Council to advance the planning of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">I have noted the points made by Deputy Broughan.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_825">I have a few further questions for the Minister of State in regard to this proposal.  If she does not have the answers to hand, I would appreciate if she could send them to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">In my view, the Jacobs Tobin report is defective, in terms of its costings of these sites.  I met with the engineers in question, who had done no homework or cost benefit analysis of any kind of the sites, including the Lusk and Clonshaugh sites.  I would like to know why they did not do so.  Surely, that is the first basic requirement following engineering.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">During my almost 20 years as a Member of this House I have on numerous occasions raised profound issues which affect the communities that will be only a few meters from this proposed plant.  They have overcome many challenges over the past two decades.  It is egregious that this service is to be located cheek by jowl with these communities.  Would the Minister of State agree that the outfall constraints for the Clonshaugh sites are inappropriate given the Portmarnock-Baldoyle area is a European conversation area?</p>
            <p eId="para_828">My colleague, Deputy Brendan Ryan, in previous discussions on this issue in the House put forward the valuable proposal that the locating of up to seven different sites across the county, with appropriate outfall, would be better than one large site so that the burden of the plant could be shared.  In recent weeks, there has been a major odour problem at the Swords plant, on which it was not possible to take action for two weeks owing to the fact that the equipment required had to be brought in from the UK.  Is this not another approach that could have been, and could still be, tried?</p>
            <p eId="para_829">It is madness to locate this plant on the main flight path of Dublin Airport.  Aeroplanes will be required to fly directly over it.  That this site is being considered is, in my view, madness.  There was a debate in the House last night on planning issues.  I understand the Government is to introduce further planning legislation.  All of those developers who made millions, whom we are now supporting through NAMA, made no provision whatsoever for water or sewage plants in major new urban communities.  They took, or lost as the case may be, all the profits.  It is important action is taken to ensure this does not happen again.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_830">I note the Deputy's serious concerns on this issue and that he has made submissions on it.  The specific issues of conservation and aviation will be taken into account.  The Deputy will be aware that a consultation process is currently under way.  There will be further consultation processes in the context of an environmental impact assessment.  Obviously whatever site is chosen will require planning permission.  A foreshore licence may also be required.  Therefore, a series of statutory consultations is to come.  I know the Deputy's concern at present is with regard to which of the sites will be chosen.  With regard to the first issue the Deputy raised, which was on costs, I understand the overall cost of the treatment plant, the outfall and the orbital sewer is not expected to exceed €500 million.  This is the estimated costing I have.  This is a major decision to be made and I note the Deputy's concerns.  I will convey them to the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  As I stated, he has not commented because there are procedures and various stages in the process which have yet to come.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and for his serious concerns.</p>

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_301">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_832">Since their publication, the proposals by the European Commission for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy have undergone detailed examination at Council working groups, the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  At next Monday's Agriculture Council, the Danish Presidency will present a progress report outlining the current status of the negotiations.  Negotiations on the new multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for the EU budget for the period 2014 to 2020 are being progressed in parallel, primarily through the General Affairs Council, although the final decision will be taken by the European Council.  Many of the CAP issues, including the key issue of distribution of funds between member states, are being discussed in the MFF negotiations and will ultimately be agreed as part of these negotiations.  These proposals are also being discussed in the European Parliament and next week will see the release of draft reports from EP rapporteurs on each of the Commission's proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">My key concerns about the reform proposals arise in four areas.  These are the overall CAP funding, the method for distributing CAP funds between member states, the method for distributing direct payment funds within member states and the overarching need for simplification in the reformed CAP.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">On the budget, the funding proposals in the MFF maintains CAP spending at current levels in nominal terms post-2013.  The agriculture heading is the one showing the greatest restraint, and in my view the amount proposed by the Commission is the minimum required.  However, there are continuing and intense pressures for reductions in the proposed overall EU budget, with obvious implications for proposed CAP allocations.  The Government will continue to resist any pressure for reductions in the CAP budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">As to the allocation of CAP funds between member states, the current Commission proposals for direct payments in Pillar 1 take a pragmatic approach to redistribution and are broadly satisfactory albeit with some loss to Ireland, estimated at approximately 1.4%.  The Commission has yet to table a specific proposal for allocation of Pillar 2 funds for rural development.  I have concerns that the basis on which they propose to do so could reduce our allocation.  However, I am vigorously defending our Pillar 2 funds, and will continue to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">As to the distribution of direct payments within member states, the Commission proposal is to gradually move towards a system of uniform per hectare payments, or flat rates, by 2019, in each member state or region of a member state.  As the Deputy knows, we have a difficulty with this because we would see a significant transfer of money from the more historically productive farming sector, which is likely to continue to be productive, to the less productive sector.  We recognise there needs to be a redistribution of single farm payment but we need to put limits on it to ensure we can continue to maintain, grow and expand Ireland's agrifood sector while at the same time moving away from the historical basis for payment based on 2002 and 2003 productivity levels.  The Deputy will see more information in the rest of this reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">Many member states already have such flat rates or are evolving towards them.  I recognise that we cannot continue to base our payments on outdated historic production references.  Nevertheless, I have major difficulties with the pace and extent of convergence in the Commission's proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">Under a national flat rate, although the overall allocation to Ireland would not change, around 76,000 Irish farmers would gain an average of 86% on their current payments, while around 57,000 would lose an average of 33%.  These are average percentages, and some of the gains and losses would be far larger than this.  For example, in the extreme case of those on very high payments of over €1,000 per hectare, the loss would be well over 70%.  In general the losses would be incurred by more productive farmers. This would have undesirable consequences at a time when Ireland is trying to encourage sustainable intensification in the agrifood sector, as we strive to achieve the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">I have accordingly been pressing for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to member states to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions.  I also want a more gradual, back-loaded transition process.  The approximation approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard.  The Commission's pragmatic proposal for redistribution between member states is, in effect, an approximation approach and provides a useful precedent.  Modelling in my Department suggests that the application of this system to the distribution of funds between farmers in Ireland would lead to much smaller gains and losses to individual farmers than a flat rate system.  However, the precise level of transfers depends on the details of the methodology used.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">I have been very active in seeking allies for this position, and I have been making significant progress, particularly with a group of member states with somewhat similar concerns.  However, it should also be understood that a majority of member states have no difficulty with the idea of flat rate payments, although they have concerns about other aspects of the proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">The negotiation process on CAP is complex and difficult, but all of my efforts are focused on achieving the best possible outcome for Ireland.  These efforts will be continued over the coming months as the process evolves, and will further intensify during our Presidency in 2013.</p>

Last July, to the great relief of the Irish agricultural sector, the European Commission committed itself to maintaining CAP funding at 2013 levels.  From the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine attended by the Members of the European Parliament and in talks and discussions we have had with various people in Europe and at home, there seems to be huge pressure on the CAP budget.  Before we go into its distribution and its various sections, we need to ensure the strongest possible case is made to maintain the budget as was promised in July last year.  The negotiations seem to be slowing down.  It was always envisaged, and the Minister stated it on numerous occasions, the CAP negotiations would be finalised during the Irish Presidency and his chairmanship of the European Council of Agriculture Ministers.  What is the likelihood of this happening?  If it does not happen are contingency plans in place to roll over the present Common Agricultural Policy to 2014?</p>

            <p eId="para_844">As I see it, we cannot finalise the Common Agricultural Policy reform and spending money on new schemes until the multi-annual financial framework negotiations are finalised.  This is the multi-year budget which Europe must agree.  The Commission hopes the MFF will be finalised in December.  I would like to see this happen but I think it is unlikely politically.  I think it will also be an issue for the Irish Presidency.  Under our Presidency we will need to try to get agreement and finality on the MFF and in doing so protect the CAP budget.  Let us be clear: More than 80% of all EU funds coming to Ireland comes through the CAP.  It is by far the most important element of EU funding for us and we need to protect it.  It is hard to give a date but I hope that in the first quarter of next year we will see the MFF finalised and agreed.  This will mean there will be huge pressure on the Irish Presidency to get the deal on CAP done before our Presidency ends.  If the detail of CAP is not agreed next year it will be impossible to see a new CAP taking effect from the beginning of 2014.  There will be only six months to put the new regulations and rules in place and get the information out to farmers.  There will be huge pressure on our Presidency to get this done, and this pressure will come from the Commission and other member states.  I hope that in February or March of next year we will be able to finalise the MFF and in May or early June we will see CAP coming to a final conclusion.  Many of the final agreed CAP proposals will have been predicted at this stage by the Commission and it will be ready to go with the new rules and regulations that need to be rolled out in the following six months for a new CAP to begin at the start of 2014.  The timetable is tight but I believe it is doable.</p>

            <p eId="para_848">I do not think the timetable is impossible but it is very tight.  If it is not possible to deliver it on time we will have to look at a contingency plan, on which the Commission will have to put proposals together, which will involve extending the implementation of a new CAP by a year and some type of continuation measure for 2014.  However, this may not be possible because if it is decided in the MFF that the budget allocation for CAP for 2014 will not be what it is now we will have problems with regard to how to allocate the money.  This is not straightforward which is why I believe there will be considerable pressure to get the job done within the timeframe set out.  If it is not possible to do that, we will need to get on with doing the job and putting in place a contingency plan for 2014 so that a new CAP could begin in 2015.  I emphasise the ambition of the Government and that of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament as far as I know is to get the MFF and CAP finalised in a timeframe that would allow us to enter a new CAP from the start of 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_850">All Departments have been allocated fixed expenditure ceilings for the period 2012 to 2014 under medium-term expenditure framework which was introduced by the Government in the comprehensive expenditure report.  The report outlines the Government's plan for a return to sustainable growth in the economy and sets out in some detail the measures that will be taken to put the national finances in order including annual public expenditure and revenue targets for the period.  The expenditure ceilings in the report are given effect through the annual Votes for different Departments, including mine.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">The expenditure ceilings which have been set for my Department represent annual gross expenditure.  The cost of all administration, service delivery and scheme implementation must be accommodated within the ceiling.  In addition to the gross expenditure corresponding to the expenditure ceiling, the Vote for the Department provides for net expenditure which takes account of appropriations-in-aid, including EU receipts.  In accordance with long-established practice under Government accounting procedures, all receipts, including the drawdown of EU funding are accounted for separately in that manner.  There has been no change in the situation under the arrangements introduced under the comprehensive expenditure report.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">EU transfers take the form of the funding for those schemes which are 100% funded by the EU, such as the single payment scheme, and the co-funding of schemes under the Rural Development Programme 2007-13 and the Operational Programme for Fisheries 2007-13.  The Department has been maximising the levels of EU drawdown under both programmes to date.  My intention is to continue to manage the funding available to my Department in the Vote to ensure that as far as possible all available funds are drawn down.  This is an ongoing process which will be carefully managed within the constraints of the annual Vote for the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_853">I thank the Minister for his reply.  Obviously the bailout programme places conditions and restrictions on expenditure across all Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, as the Minister outlined.  It covers not only expenditure, but also policy as we have seen with other Departments.  If the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is bound by the Government expenditure rules, could it potentially cause difficulty this year or in the final year of the programme, 2013, when we try to draw down those funds?  As the Minister said, some of them are 100% funded from Europe and some of them have a co-funded dimension.  Could the funds from Europe exceed the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine limits on expenditure from the point of view of co-funded programmes and thus harm the ability to draw down those funds?</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_854">That is a fair question.  My Department is different from many other Departments in that many of the schemes we finance are heavily co-funded by the EU.  These include AEOS, which is 70% co-funded, DAS and TAM scheme in terms of rural development funding.  A very significant element of our budget comes through schemes co-financed by the EU.  There is also the €1.2 billion to €1.3 billion each year of direct payments which are 100% funded.  These direct payments do not come under our ceilings.  The issue for us is trying to manage staying within our expenditure ceiling while at the same time drawing down all the available co-funding for schemes under Pillar II money, which is under Access 1, 2 and 3.  They are the schemes with which we are all very familiar, the grant aid, Leader programmes and so on.  We are working carefully to ensure - as farmers would say - we do not leave any money behind in Europe.  So far we have done that very successfully and obviously I am working to ensure we maximise the drawdown of EU funds.  In recent months the European Commission has had a decision confirmed that allows it to increase the co-funding level of European moneys for some of the co-funding schemes by up to 85%.  We need to try to work that system as best we can to make it as cost efficient for the Irish Exchequer as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_855">If the element of co-funding has been increased across the schemes, obviously that will be beneficial.  From the Minister's reply, do I understand correctly that the schemes that are co-funded may be affected but the ones that are 100% funded will not be affected under the restrictions of the troika programme?</p>

            <p eId="para_856">Single farm payment is not affected by ceilings.  I can assure the Deputy that we will do everything we can to ensure we draw down all the available funding under the rural development programme.  However, it is a management exercise to do that when we are dealing with ceilings as well as Exchequer targets.  This is more difficult for my Department because setting expenditure ceilings as we have under the troika programme is a very blunt tool.  It is just about what we spend and does not also take account of what we earn.  When all the expenditure, whether it is the co-funding from the Exchequer or from the European Union, counts towards the expenditure ceiling it is a frustrating process.  I would prefer just counting the Exchequer contribution towards an expenditure ceiling.  This is difficult to manage, but we are doing it in a way that I hope will result in us drawing down all the available funds from Europe.</p>

            <p eId="para_858">My Department, in the context of delivering the single payment scheme, disadvantaged area scheme and other area-based schemes, is required to carry out annual inspections covering the eligibility of the land declared to draw down payments and cross compliance to ensure compliance with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare.  These inspections are mandatory, and there are minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually - we do not have a choice in this.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">Land eligibility checks must be carried out on 5% of applicants.  These checks are carried out to verify that the area claimed in the application form corresponds with the area farmed by the farmer and to ensure that any ineligible land or features are deducted.  Up to two thirds of these inspections are carried out without visiting the farm as the information is verified using the technique of remote sensing via satellite, in other words mapping areas via satellite.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">The rate of inspections for cross-compliance is 1% of applicants to whom the statutory management requirements, SMRs, and good agricultural condition, GAEC, apply.  However, 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration requirements while 3% of sheep farmers must be inspected covering 5% of the flock.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">In 2010, in an effort to minimise duplication of farm inspections between the two Departments, my Department agreed to carry out 1,600 nitrates inspections under the GAP regulations on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  This arrangement was retained in 2011 and 2102 and is working well.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">The value of these schemes to Irish farmers is €1.8 billion annually.  It is therefore incumbent on my Department to ensure the regulatory control environment is comprehensively implemented to protect these payments and to avoid significant EU disallowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">The data sought by the Deputy are supplied separately in respect of the 2009 and 2010 schemes.  The data in respect of the 2011 schemes will be made available when it they are finalised later in the year.  I regret the delay in responding to the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_868">If I had had a chance to finish my reply, the last sentence is that I regret the delay in responding to the Deputy's detailed query.  However, the Deputy sought a great deal of information and it took time to put it together.  It involved gathering information from every county.  The written reply contains a very detailed and comprehensive set of data in response to all the questions the Deputy asked.  I will not read it out but I have looked through it and I hope the Deputy will not see any inconsistencies between different counties and that the number of inspections are as they should be in terms of the minimum number we are required to undertake.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">We are talking about payments of approximately €1.8 billion per year.  With that level of payment, which is predominantly from EU funds, there is an obligation on us to play by the rules with regard to the number of inspections laid down in the regulations that states are required to implement to draw down funds.  If we do not do this, disallowances will be applied to Ireland.  That is where the EU Commission asks for its money back.  Every state must give a certain amount of money back each year on disallowances because after the EU audits how the schemes are monitored and the funds are distributed, it asks for its money back in many cases.  In most years there is some level of disallowance payments to be paid back and sometimes these involve huge sums of money.  It is not by choice, therefore, that we have this level of inspections.  We are required to do it to draw down the level of funding we distribute among farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_870">Most of the complaints and representations I have received are about land eligibility.  If there is an incorrect declaration, a 100% penalty is applied.  That is very harsh.  There must be some flexibility, as it involves marginal cases as well.  These people are huge contributors to the economy and they participate actively in farming.  There must be a flexible system in place, as is the case with commonage ground where recalibration is allowed.  Perhaps the Minister would make allowances for these farmers as well.</p>

However, we must also ensure that people play by the rules.  If there is no consequence for people who do not play by the rules, there will be breaches everywhere.  It is important to make the distinction between people who make a genuine mistake and those who are trying to play the system.  The vast majority of people here play by the rules.  They fill out the forms, or work with advisers to do so, and draw down their payments as they should.  If people believe they have been harshly treated, there is an appeals mechanism and they should use it.</p>

            <p eId="para_873">This question is about the disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, about which there has been some confusion.  It is important to point out that the changes relating to eligibility that we are applying to the disadvantaged areas scheme in order to make savings have not changed since budget day.  We have debated some of these matters in the House previously.  There appears to be a view that we have suddenly changed a number of things in the last few weeks.  We have not.  What I said on budget day last year is what we are trying to implement.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">What I was trying to avoid was cutting the rates or the areas under which farmers could apply for a disadvantaged area payment.  I did not want to reduce the income of people who are farming at reasonable stocking rates and keeping their stock for a reasonable amount of time during the year.  I was anxious to make a distinction between farmers whose farms are fully in disadvantaged areas and those whose farms were only partly in disadvantaged areas, that is, farmers whose primary holding is outside a disadvantaged area but who are leasing or buying land in a disadvantaged area and drawing down funds.  They are not in the same category as farmers whose full holding is in a disadvantaged area.  In other words, we are trying to change the eligibility to make savings in as intelligent a way as possible in order to protect real and active farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">If some people are losing payments unfairly as a result of those changes, I am anxious to hear about it.  We will put an appeals mechanism in place and I have been given assurances that it will be a swift mechanism that will give people a quick decision.  I hope people will use it.  We are trying to make a distinction by using last year as a reference year for trying to make a measurement of reasonable stocking rates in disadvantaged areas in respect of sheep, suckler herds and so forth.  I spoke to farming organisations before making those decisions to get their reaction.  I am not saying the farming organisations are responsible for the decisions, because they are not.  I am responsible.  However, I am anxious to outline the motivation for the decisions we took.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">Finally, in the past when Ministers and previous Governments have had to make savings in the DAS, they simply reduced the area farmers could apply for or reduced the rate of payment.  We wanted to do things in a more targeted way and change the scheme in a way that would protect farmers who are relying on and need DAS payments, and to try to make the distinction from other farmers who are in a different category.  That was the motivation for what we are trying to do and that policy has been consistent since budget day last year.</p>

            <p eId="para_877">The Minister said there was some confusion but that the position remains the same as was stated in the budget.  The Minister applied to the European Commission for its agreement to do what he proposed on budget day, particularly in respect of the retrospective basis on which he is increasing the stocking rate.  Everywhere one receives very detailed cases for<i>force majeure</i>, based on hardship, illness, death and so forth, and there would be difficulties with that.  We have been in contact with the Department to seek an appeal mechanism.  This must be clarified.  We understand what the Minister said in December and that there is a difficulty with getting approval from the EU Commission.  It has a huge difficulty with the retrospective basis on which the Minister applied the increase in the livestock units and, indeed, in respect of the 80 km, about which I am not particularly concerned.  However, with regard to the increase in the livestock unit to 0.3 and its retrospective basis, the information from the farming media and other people is that the European Commission has flatly refused to give its permission.</p>

            <p eId="para_878">First, the Deputy should not believe everything he reads in the media.  Second, when one makes a change to the criteria of any scheme, one must make an application to get approval for those changes because the funding comes through the European Commission.  My Department is going through that process at present, which is perfectly normal.  While letters are going back and forth to clarify questions and so on, it would not be true to state anyone has a huge problem with this proposal.  From the correspondence I have seen to date, this is the kind of correspondence that happens when one makes changes to criteria within a scheme, whereby one makes a proposal, the Commission reverts with questions and one responds by answering those questions.  This is the process through which the Department is going at present and there is nothing extraordinary about it.</p>

            <p eId="para_879">Is there not a huge difficulty with putting in place a retrospective basis for this scheme by using 2011 stocking densities to qualify for a 2012 scheme?  As for productive farmers, I acknowledge at the outset that farming production must be increased and so on.  However, people are living in great difficulty in respect of land constraint, peripheral regions, quality of land and so forth.  They have lost the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  Moreover, the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, is not being reopened this year and the disadvantaged areas scheme is coupled with that.  These schemes were not just about farming but also provided environmental benefits.</p>

            <p eId="para_882">First, it is important to be accurate in this Chamber.  As I have stated clearly to the Deputy previously, I am hopeful a limited AEOS scheme will be opened in September.  I acknowledge it will be limited and it primarily will be focused on Natura areas and on those farmers who farm in commonage areas.  In respect of the disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, the entire point of what the Department is trying to do is to try to protect the incomes of those to whom the Deputy has just referred, because people in disadvantaged areas need that income.  They are limited in respect of the return they can get from the marketplace because of the limitations on productivity on their land, their soil or whatever.  This is the reason I sought to try to protect the income of people who are farming in disadvantaged areas by changing the eligibility in such a way that people who are not farming fully in disadvantaged areas would not receive the same level of payment as those who are.  This is a perfectly reasonable thing to do and I revert to the entire point of what I was trying to do.  Unlike the previous Government, which simply applied cuts to everyone, I tried to differentiate between those who need the money most and those who do not and now I am being criticised for it.  If people are getting a raw deal because of the payment or because of the change in eligibility I have made, I want them to use an appeals process and my Department will try to look at that in as generous a way as it can.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">On the retrospective payment issue, people tell me all the time in respect of the 2014 reference year for the CAP, for example, that if one intends to set a reference year, one must set it in the past and not in the future because otherwise, everyone simply would change behaviour in the future.  This is the reason I picked the most recent year in the past, 2011, to be the reference year.  This is not about retrospective change but is about setting a reference year to distinguish between people who should be getting a full DAS payment and those who should not.  Were one simply to change it for this year, everyone would simply have increased their stocking rate to have the bare minimum necessary to draw down a payment.  The Department was trying to save money and to distinguish between those who should be getting a full payment and those who should not.  If we have made mistakes in certain case studies and for certain people, they should use the appeals mechanism to enable the Department to look after them.</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_885">The bovine TB eradication programme includes a comprehensive range of measures aimed at eradicating TB from the cattle population in Ireland through testing and the control of cattle movements in order to prevent the spread of disease.  More specifically, the programme provides for the mandatory annual testing of all cattle in the national herd, the implementation of a range of supplementary tests and the restriction of herds where TB is disclosed or suspected.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">With regard to restrictions on holdings which adjoin a holding containing a herd which has disclosed TB, my Department has implemented what is known as a contiguous testing programme for the past 30 years.  Under this programme, herdowners whose herds are adjoining a holding where a high-risk TB breakdown has been disclosed, usually involving more than one reactor, are required to have their herd tested if it has not been tested within the preceding four months.  Herdowners whose holding adjoins a holding experiencing a low-risk breakdown, usually involving a single reactor, are informed of the breakdown in the neighbouring herd and are advised of the precautions to take but are not required to have their herd tested.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">The eradication programme is reviewed on an ongoing basis by my Department in light of experience and research.  Following a review conducted on the programme last year, my Department introduced a number of changes to ensure the programme addressed all potential sources of infection and to prevent the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds.  These changes, which were made following a number of consultation meetings with the farming organisations, are in the first instance based on research demonstrating there are increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals and second, are designed to protect clear herds from buying in high-risk animals.  For example, research has shown the TB risk relating to animals that move out of herds which have been identified as contiguous to a herd experiencing an active high-risk TB breakdown is almost three times greater than the risk in the case of herds tested on a round test.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">The only change which my Department has made to the arrangements relating to the testing of neighbouring or contiguous herds is that herds adjoining a high-risk breakdown are now being trade-restricted, except to slaughter, pending a TB test.  They will, however, be permitted to buy in cattle for a short period while awaiting a test.  Previously, such herds were permitted to sell cattle on the open market prior to carrying out the test and research had shown that this posed a risk to clear herds.  The objective of the restriction is to protect clear herds from buying in infected animals from these herds and thereby avoid the clear herd being restricted for four months and the associated additional testing.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">I have clarified the trade restriction only applies to those herds which are identified, following an epidemiological investigation by my Department, as being relevant to the breakdown herd and which have not been tested in the previous four months.  Herdowners will be contacted by my Department prior to restriction and only those herds which, on a case-by-case consideration, are identified as genuinely relevant to the breakdown will be restricted.  Those farmers whose herds are restricted can minimise any impact by arranging to have their herds tested as soon as possible.  Any herd which tests clear will be immediately de-restricted.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">I also wish to clarify the choice of four months as the benchmark period under this programme is not new and is part of the existing EU co-funded programme.  The four-month period is related to the time interval from when an animal may be exposed to infection and the expectation that a test will give a positive result if the animal is infected.  Finally, I believe the restriction on contiguous herds pending a test should have a very limited effect on trade in cattle.  In effect, it is only those herds in which TB is disclosed that will be restricted for any significant period of time.</p>

            <p eId="para_892">I thank the Minister for his reply.  All Members are agreed this is an extremely important issue and it is essential that herds are kept free of disease and in particular of TB.  However, the concern is there should not be overly severe restrictions on farmers whose farms are in proximity to farms on which there are infected herds.  Once an acceptable level of disease control has been put in place, the farmer should be able to farm as normal and Sinn Féin has received some representations on this point.  It also is important that no further additional costs be placed on the farmer due to the restrictions.  Finally, I remind the Minister that I have spoken to him a number of times about one particular historical case.  He might examine it again in the context of the effects on one particular farmer.</p>

            <p eId="para_893">It is important to recognise this is a major concern to farmers.  I have met individual farmers, farming organisations and collective groups of farmers on this issue in recent weeks.  There is real concern that we should not overdo attempts to stamp out TB and thereby make life impossible for farmers.  This applies in particular to contiguous herds because the only change my Department has made to the arrangements relating to the testing of neighbouring or contiguous herds is that herds adjoining a high-risk breakdown are now being trade-restricted, except for slaughter, pending a TB test.  Consequently, there is an impact on farmers in this regard.  On foot of my Department's discussions with farming organisations, we have made some changes because of the representations they have made.  For example, it had been intended to have an automatic freezing of a herd if one happened to have a herd contiguous to a herd that contained a reactor or reactors.  While there also were some communications problems that now have been ironed out, if, following communication with the farmer, a reasonable case can be made that there would be an extremely low risk of transmission of the disease between one herd and the other, an inspector or a vet can then make a judgment call as to whether that farmer should be trade-restricted.  In other words, in a scenario in which a farmer has a field of barley between his or her herd and the contiguous herd or if there is a narrow buffer strip of forestry or whatever, it should be possible to apply a practical approach.   We should not impose trade restrictions on farmers unless this is absolutely necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">There has been strong lobbying, asking us to review the four month period.  Contiguous herds need to be tested and are restricted if they have not had a test within four months. Farming organisations would like us to extend that period to six months because that would ensure that in a worst case scenario there would not be a need for three tests in a year which would be very expensive and time consuming for farmers.  I am looking at that but I must also take veterinary advice in this regard.  We have less incidence of TB now than at any time since the 1950s.  We are winning this fight and will eradicate TB in the not too distant future, which will be a fantastic achievement. I have to try to balance the concerns of farmers in respect of inconvenience with the advice I get from the vets in my Department.  We will return to the farming organisations.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">Responsibility for the drainage and reclamation of wetlands is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and I simultaneously introduced legislation on 8 September 2011 in this area to address a European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland relating to Ireland's implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive which requires environmental impact assessment for certain categories of farm development.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">The ECJ judgement is in regard to the restructuring of rural land holdings, the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture, and land drainage works on lands used for agriculture.  Naturally, it has been a priority to address the findings of the court and thereby minimise the prospects of significant fines being applied against Ireland.  This case, which opened in 2006, remains before the court for adjudication and an oral hearing has been set for early October 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">In introducing these regulations, however, I have also sought to ensure the system introduced was appropriate, accessible and reflected the particular circumstances on Irish farms.  It is for this reason that, with the exception of the drainage and reclamation of wetlands, responsibility for removal of field boundaries, the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture, and land drainage works on lands used for agriculture, has transferred to my Department from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">My officials have had significant consultation with the farm bodies at all stages of the process, including meeting the representative organisations on a number of occasions to discuss progress and explain the requirements of the new regulations.  In addition, I published a comprehensive guidance document for farmers which is available on my Department's website and in hard copy format at Teagasc, from agricultural consultants and at local Department offices.  I also provided a leaflet to every farmer in the country explaining the regulations that now apply in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_903">From telephone conversations I had with people in Duhallow during the day, I understand the entire region could be described as a wetland at present.  The difficulty concerns information.  Some of the local authorities seem to have maps of what is designated as wetland but the landowner or farmer does not.  Is there information within either the local authorities or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government?  Should it be made available to farmers?  A farmer's definition of wetland may vary from field to field.  I have seen some farmers get into serious difficulties with the local authority because of what they described as a wet field, which would have been traditionally known as such, but which they would not have classified as a wetland.  Is it possible to have farmers notified as to which lands or territories they own that are designated under the wetlands directive?</p>

            <p eId="para_907">May I intervene on that point to say there are designated wetlands and there is a map but there is some confusion among some landowners in regard to land that while it may not be designated as such from a European habitats point of view may be categorised as wetland.  That is the ambiguous area that needs to be clarified for people.  There is a difference, however, in terms of the eco-system and the actual designation that goes with that at a European level, between wetlands and wet land that is so because of heavy rain or poor drainage.  We have tried to clarify as much of this as we can through the information leaflets that have been sent out.</p>

            <p eId="para_911">In launching the national climate policy review in November 2011, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, confirmed the objective, in line with the programme for Government, to introduce climate legislation within the lifetime of the Government.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, announced a three-pronged approach to the development of a robust and comprehensive response to Ireland's obligations, challenges and opportunities in the area of climate policy.  These included a public consultation process, which ran from February 2012 to end April 2012, to ensure that the widest possible range of views is brought into the debate on future policy; an analysis by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, secretariat of future policy options; and ongoing work, through the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy to drive sectoral progress on emissions mitigation.  As part of its analysis the NESC Secretariat has been asked to examine options for policies and measures to close the distance to Ireland's 2020 targets and the development of a basis for a long-term 2050 vision for a low-carbon economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">I realise the Deputy's question relates to the challenges for the agrifood sector.  When one takes out the traded sector in terms of emissions, namely, the 106 biggest emitters in Ireland that will be part of an EU emissions trading system, 40% of Ireland's emission problem comes from agriculture and food production.  If we are being asked to reduce our emissions by 20% as a country, from the base year until 2020, that is a huge ask for the agrifood side.  In my view, when those targets were set, Ireland's burden, or the target set for us, was inappropriate.  That has been shown to be the case since, in terms of the figures that were released recently.  Nevertheless that is what we are dealing with now.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">I have made it clear at a European level that I believe there is a contradiction between climate change policy, on which the European Union is rightly trying to give global leadership, and food security policy.  The reality is that Ireland produces food at one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world.  In other words, the carbon intensity of food production in Ireland is lower than it is practically anywhere else on the planet yet we are under pressure to limit food production in order to meet climate change targets.  That makes no sense.</p>

            <p eId="para_919">Something unforeseen could happen.  I am committed to the climate change agenda.  I am also committed to our Food Harvest plan and to expanding the Irish food industry so it can fulfil its full potential.  Both of those things can be done.  Many things can be done in Irish agriculture to reduce emissions.  Grazing seasons can be extended.  We can look at ways of changing how we spread slurry.  We can consider direct drilling in arable farming.  A series of practical things that are doable and affordable for farmers can have a positive impact on the emissions that may come from spreading slurry.  The management of the grazing of herds can be examined.  One can do a great deal in relation to food conversion efficiency to reduce methane emissions from herds.  We can reduce the time it takes to bring a beef steer or beef heifer through its full life cycle.  It is obvious that the shorter the animal's life cycle, the fewer the emissions that come from it.  I am interested in making practical policy direction proposals within the agriculture sector that are aimed at reducing emissions in a reasonable way, where appropriate.  I am not in the business of reducing our ambition or expectation in terms of growth and expansion in this sector.  I do not think that would be appropriate or in the interests of the environment.</p>

Such an approach would reduce the potential for run-off into our streams and rivers.</p>

            <p eId="para_921">That is a useful suggestion.  The answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes".  The last Government introduced an anaerobic digester grant aid scheme for which farmers could apply.  Just two of the ten applications that were made have actually progressed.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is actively considering how it can encourage and support the development of anaerobic digesters in Ireland.  I think it needs to be done at district level.  We need to ensure that multiple feedstuffs - not just farm slurry, belly grass from beef factories or waste from dairy processing - go into the anaerobic digester.  We have worked on this with Professor Jerry Murphy of University College Cork, who is Ireland's leading expert on anaerobic digestion, and we will continue to do so.  I hope to introduce new initiatives by the end of the year to support anaerobic digestion, particularly at quite a large-scale district level.  There are economies of scale that can be achieved to help anaerobic digestion to be financially viable.</p>

            <p eId="para_923">We have already dealt with a question on TB testing.  It is crucial to go through it again.  As long as I can remember - I have been farming since I was 14 years of age - TB has been the scourge of every farmer.  Given the lowest levels on record were achieved in 2011, we need to put every effort into the eradication of TB.  We were delighted to receive telephone calls two months ago about the new regulations that were being introduced.  There is no way we can be seen to be soft on it.  We have a chance of a lifetime to eradicate it.  Every effort has to be made to that end.  Like everybody else, I was delighted to hear what the Minister said earlier about the ongoing negotiations with the farming community.  The eradication of TB needs to be a priority.  We need to consider the role of badgers and deer in this context.  Such matters have to be examined in conjunction with our other efforts.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">The bovine TB eradication programme includes a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing of all cattle in the national herd, the early removal of reactors, the payment of compensation for cattle removed as reactors, implementation of a range of supplementary tests such as post-derestriction and contiguous tests, a wildlife programme and the depopulation of infected herds in some cases.  These measures have proven to be relatively effective in recent years, as evidenced by the significant reduction in disease levels over the past decade.  For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.53% in 2000 to 4.18% last year.  Reactor numbers in 2011 - 18,500 - were the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950s.  Reactor numbers and herd incidence have continued to fall in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">The eradication programme is scientifically based and my Department continues to monitor and review the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme on an ongoing basis in light of experience and research.  In this context, my Department reviewed the programme last year and concluded that, if we want to progress towards eradication, it was necessary to address all other potential sources of infection, including from neighbouring herds and the movement of high risk animals, in addition to the emphasis which has been placed on badgers as a source of infection in recent years.  It also concluded that it was necessary to ensure that testing is conducted in a timely manner.  In light of this, my Department introduced a number of changes into the TB programme earlier this year to prevent the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds and to tighten up on overdue testing.  These changes were made following a number of consultation meetings with the farming organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">I emphasise that the changes are based on research which demonstrates that increased risks are attached to the movement of certain animals.  The changes are also designed to protect clear herds from buying in high-risk animals.  For example, the restrictions imposed on the movement of inconclusive reactors are based on research which showed that standard inconclusive reactors which passed the retest and moved out of the herd, subsequent to passing the test, were 12 times more likely to be TB positive at the subsequent test or at slaughter compared to all other animals in the herd.  The new controls on the movement of animals out of herds which have been identified as contiguous to a herd experiencing an active high-risk TB breakdown are based on research which showed that the risk of such herds disclosing TB is almost three times greater than the risk in the case of herds tested on a round test.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">Following representations from the farming sector, my Department has reviewed the new arrangements.  I have clarified that my Department will contact herd owners prior to restricting their herds under the contiguous testing programme and that herds which are trade-restricted pending a test will not be excluded from the Russian trade.  In addition, I have made a number of changes to the new arrangements relating to overdue tests so that herd owners who, having genuine reasons, negotiate a delay of up to one month with the departmental veterinary office prior to the overdue date will not have any penalties applied.  In addition, herd owners who postpone their tests with the permission of the office or are contiguous to a high-risk breakdown and are waiting for a test will be permitted to buy in animals for a limited period.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan</from>
            <p eId="para_929">Everybody is committed to the eradication of TB.  It is vitally important, particularly for suckler producers in the west who sell at the end of the year.  As a farmer who had reactors on the farm last year, I understand the concerns in this regard and know full well the damage they can do.  I heard the Minister speaking about the approach that is taken if there are some fields of barley, forestry or silage fields between contiguous herds.  Such matters have to be taken into consideration.  Flexibility is vitally important.  The rules of the scheme, as they were being implemented in recent months, had to be followed.  Farmers and veterinary officers throughout the country want to get the best results.  There has been significant co-operation on the TB scheme between farmers and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food over 50 or 60 years.  A little common sense is needed at this time, however.  The worst affected farmers are those who have had no TB showing up in their own tests - they may have had generations of clear tests - but cannot sell their weanlings because of the test results in a contiguous herd.  I appeal to the Minister to make sure a common sense approach is taken when departmental officials are discussing these matters with farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_931">I agree with what Deputy Moynihan has said about flexibility.  Regardless of the decisions we make, we should stand by them.  We cannot have an open-ended approach even if there is a roadway or a field of barley between the farms, or if the four-month or six-month rule applies.  One has to do the whole lot together.  Reference has been made to wildlife.  In the 1960s, there were approximately 2,500 or 3,000 deer in this country.  That number had increased to 25,000 by the 1980s.  At present, there are almost 250,000 wild deer in Ireland.  If we do not do something about that, in five years' time there will as many deer as there are unemployed people.</p>

Deputy Moynihan referred to suckler farmers.  Regardless of whether we provide for four months or six months, we need to be ruthless.  There should not be an open-ended approach on the part of the farmer, the vet and the Department.  If these are the rules, we should stick to them.</p>

            <from>Deputy Shane McEntee</from>
            <p eId="para_935">This is a very good subject.  When I read the<i>Irish Farmers’ Journal</i> today, I was not quite shocked to read that this country imports €3 billion worth of food every year.  Someone said to me that if we all ate Irish chickens, we could employ an additional 1,300 people.  It is not good enough that we import such an amount of food.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">I believe the Irish agri-food sector is well positioned to take advantage of greater demand arising from increasing global population.  Exports in the agri-food sector have performed strongly in recent years and offer the potential to increase significantly in the coming years.  The Food Harvest 2020 report sets out the strategic vision for the agri-food and fishing sector and includes specific growth targets for the dairy, beef, pork and lamb sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">From a dairying perspective, the ending of milk quotas in 2015 represents an exceptional opportunity to increase milk output, and Food Harvest 2020 has targeted a 50% increase in milk production in the period to 2020.  This target is ambitious but I believe it is realistic because the dairy sector has the capability to expand at producer and processor level.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">The beef industry's ability to maintain and expand employment levels will depend on the extent to which its product offerings are competitive in EU and world markets.  In this regard, my Department and its agencies provide an array of financial and infrastructural supports to underpin production and employment in the beef sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">The pigmeat sector is the third largest individual component of the Irish agri-food industry and supports approximately 7,000 jobs, many of which are in rural communities.  Production, prices and exports increased significantly in 2011, and robust domestic demand, coupled with a strong performance in export markets, should help ensure progress in the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_945">The beef technology adoption programme was introduced in the context of the strategy for the long-term development of the beef sector as set out in the Food Harvest 2020 report.  The strategy acknowledges that significant challenges exist in regard to farm-level profitability in the sector.  Market realities dictate that a strong commercial perspective is vital to improving viability, securing sufficient returns and achieving long-term growth.  It is evident that improved productivity and market orientation among beef farmers are essential to sustain future growth in the sector.  It noted that initiatives such as the recently expanded Teagasc BETTER Farm Beef Programme highlight the significant growth potential when best practices are adopted inside the farm gate.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">The Beef 2020 Activation Group, which was established to consider the next steps necessary to achieve the sectoral output targets contained in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, recommended that an effective discussion group programme be established with publicly funded support to underpin effective management and technology transfer in beef farming similar to that already operating in the dairy sector.

        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_365">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_952">I would like to thank the party Whips and the Government for giving me the opportunity to speak today.  In relation to my company's under-declaration of VAT in 2009, M &amp; J Wallace Limited sold apartments in 2008 and 2009 and the proceeds from the closings of the sales were pledged to the bank.  Normally, the business cash flow would have allowed us to deal with the VAT liability but not on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">In early 2008, the company had got the go-ahead to build a large project on the North Circular Road, which gave confidence in its potential to go forward.  Towards the end of the year, the bank pulled the plug on the project.  This meant serious and unforeseen cash flow problems for the company.  M &amp; J Wallace Limited had committed a lot more money to the project than it ultimately received from the bank.  It had to let some men go and pay redundancy.  It was coming under pressure for payment from suppliers and subcontractors, and having to deal with four banks becoming increasingly aggressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">The company was not able to pay the VAT at the time but was convinced that it was possible to work our way through the crisis.  M &amp; J Wallace Limited believed that the company would be able to pay the full amount within six to 12 months.  It was feared that if the problem was revealed at the time, either the Revenue or the banks would have moved against the company and put it out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The manner in which the VAT was dealt with was, in hindsight, an error of judgment made under pressure at a time when the approach of the banks was changing dramatically and the value of property was dropping sharply.  There was never an intention that the money that was owed would not be paid to Revenue and the motive behind the underpayment was to delay payment in order to trade out of difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">Few at the time predicted that the country's economic woes would continue as long as they have.  We were never big developers, which meant that we did not go into NAMA as the company's debts were not large enough with the Irish banks, most money being owed to foreign banks, which are not subject to State guarantee and which have been more aggressive in their pursuit of debts as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">The company had traded successfully for 20 years and it meant a lot to me.  People have said that if M &amp; J Wallace Limited had not understated its VAT, the Revenue would have worked with the company.  Maybe that is true – hindsight is a great thing – though at the time, it appeared that flexibility was in short supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">The following year, 2010, the situation had continued to deteriorate and the company made a full declaration to the Revenue and opened its books.  The Revenue then proceeded to carry out a full audit of the company's books and, after some weeks, an agreement was reached between both parties whereby a sum of money would be paid each month by the company to the Revenue to deal with the outstanding amount, and all other ongoing tax liabilities would be honoured.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">When I stood for election in February 2011, I personally had a tax clearance certificate, and so too did M &amp; J Wallace Limited as it was meeting the terms of its arrangement with the Revenue.  The company was sourcing work, paying the Revenue, paying off as many subcontractors and suppliers as possible, and this continued to be the case up until November 2011, when, following a €19.4 million judgment against the company by ACC Rabobank, M &amp; J Wallace Limited was no longer able to get work due to the judgment.  I should add that all payments regarding PAYE, PRSI, pensions and redundancy were made but, unfortunately, the VAT and a number of subcontractors were left being owed money.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">I have strived to demonstrate the distinction between my personal tax affairs and those of the limited company M &amp; J Wallace Limited.  In legal and company terms, they are two separate entities, something which everyone in business will recognise, and without which no one would ever risk enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">I understand that many people do not see it in this way.  My personal tax affairs are in order and for 20 years M &amp; J Wallace Limited paid all taxes due, until the company found itself in its recent troubles and failed to meet the VAT obligation in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">In view of the fact that I now work for the people and am paid by the people, I feel obliged to look beyond the bounds of company law.  I understand that many people suffering under vicious austerity were upset by my statement last week that M &amp; J Wallace Limited would not be able to repay the tax debt.  This was not a cavalier comment, but rather an honest statement of fact.  I understand that PAYE workers and social welfare recipients are not afforded this flexibility, although life for most people in small and medium sized businesses is far from rosy either at the moment.  In solidarity with the citizens of this country, I will strive personally to make repayments in relation to the tax debt of M &amp; J Wallace Limited  To this end, starting immediately, I am taking steps to organise for half of my Dáil salary to go towards paying M &amp; J Wallace Limited's VAT liability to the Revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">I have been told that I have not presented my case well and that I should have hired a PR company to help me make my presentation.  That may be so, but rightly or wrongly, that has not been my way of doing things.  I did not come in here today to defend the indefensible.  The company understated its VAT liability and was wrong to do so.  I want to apologise and say sorry to all the people who expected more from me.  I want to apologise to the Members of the Dáil for bringing any dishonour on a profession which hardly needed it.  I want, especially, to apologise to the people of Wexford.  I went home last weekend and found it hard to believe the support I was given.  The manner in which people can find it in themselves to offer support to somebody who has done something wrong and is down would boost anyone's faith in human nature.  I want to apologise to people all over Ireland, particularly those who have supported and continue to support me.  No matter what happens, I will not forget them.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">I have done many things in my life that I should not have done and now I have disappointed many people who believed in me.  Some Members of this Dáil have suggested that I should resign the seat for a mistake made by the company M &amp; J Wallace Limited before I was elected.  Have I considered resigning and running in a by-election?  Yes I have.  Have I considered resigning and walking away from politics for good?  I certainly have.  However, I have never been very good at quitting.  I went into politics with a desire to work for social justice, to challenge the lack of fairness that exists in our society and to strive to make this country a better place in which to live for all of us.  I am grateful for the support I have received from the small and medium sized business community, who know how difficult things can be and what the pressures of business can be like.  As well as support from owners of small businesses, I have been greatly heartened by the many messages of support from all over Ireland in general, and from Wexford in particular.  As a Deputy for Wexford, I feel privileged to have met so many wonderful people living quiet, extraordinary lives and to have worked with them on so many issues, such as cuts to special needs assistants, resource teachers and guidance counsellors, problems with the domiciliary care allowance and the carer's allowance, changes to the one-parent family payment and a host of other issues.  In short, it is an honour and a privilege for me to represent the people of Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">They say that those of us who speak out should be above reproach, but I would be at pains to stress that I will never be that.  I am just another human being who is very far from being perfect and will remain so.  I am answerable to the people of Wexford who elected me and they will discard me when they see fit.  It is their seat, not mine.  In the meantime, I will strive to serve them and all the people of Ireland as well as I can.  Thank you.</p>

            <p eId="para_968">The Health and Safety Authority (HSA), under the remit of my colleague Minister Richard Bruton, has primary responsibility for securing health and safety at work, particularly from an enforcement point of view.  My Department is represented on the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee which is a Sub-Committee of the Health and Safety Authority.  The Committee advises the Board on the direction the HSA should take in relation to farm safety.  The end of this year will see the culmination of the Farm Safety Action Plan 2009-2012 which has been the main focus of the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee and the organisations involved over the past three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">My Department is very strongly committed to promoting Farm Safety in collaboration with the HSA.  We have taken a number of steps over the past year in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to both raise awareness of the problem and educate farmers and their families on the realities and the dangers of working in this industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">The most recent measure taken by my Department was the inclusion of a Farm Safety message with the Single Payment application packs, which were distributed in March of this year to over 130,000 farmers.  This was a joint initiative between my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the Farm Safety Partnership Committee and led to every one of those farmers receiving an individual reminder of the importance of farming safely and the potentially fatal consequences of not doing so.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">The HSA produced an excellent DVD earlier this year containing testimonials from six individual farmers who provide an emotional telling of their experiences on farm which led to either fatalities or serious injury.  This DVD has been widely circulated and is included in all training courses undertaken by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will make the opening address at the National Farm Safety Conference next week, 21 June, in Ballincollig, Co. Cork.  I opened last year's Conference at Roscommon.  The National Farm Safety Conference is one of the highlights of the Farm Safety calendar and my Department is fully committed to helping raise the profile of this Conference among farmers so that the farm safety message remains high on everyone's agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, also recently launched the Farm and Countryside Safety project, which is located in the Family Farm at Dublin Zoo.  The project is supported by Agri Aware in conjunction with FBD Insurance, the IFA and ESB Networks.  This programme will help to educate children about farm safety, one of the groups most at risk on farms today.  The project will culminate with the production of a 2013 calendar featuring selected images of safety messages drawn or painted by children.  The calendar will be sent to all primary schools in the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">Other actions by my Department include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_975">The provision to all farms of a Code of Practice aimed at reducing farm accidents.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_976">The inclusion of Health and Safety Guidelines in all Building Specifications drawn up by my Department.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_977">The inclusion of Farm Safety in all REPS Training Courses.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_978">A dedicated area on our website outlining the requirements on Farm Safety and practical advice on Safety on Farms.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_979">My Department has asked Teagasc to include a farm safety element in the Dairy Discussion Groups participating in the Dairy Efficiency Programme 2010-2012.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_980">Regular Press Statements drawing attention to Farm Safety agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">There is no single action or organisation that can solve this difficult problem that impacts so horrendously, on so many lives, each year.  Already this year, seven people have lost their lives in farming accidents and a further five people have died in the fisheries area.  This follows on two terrible years for farm safety in which 26 and 27 people died in 2010 and 2011, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">Since taking office, I have continuously strived to increase awareness of safety issues among farmers which I believe is the key to changing the way we all think about farm safety on Irish farms.  We must all work together with the single goal of preventing farm accidents and therefore saving lives and minimising serious injuries.</p>

            <p eId="para_984">Council Directive 79/409/EC on the conservation of wild birds, commonly referred to as the "Birds Directive", requires all Member States to maintain and protect naturally occurring birds in the wild.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht have designated sites known as Special Protection Areas (SPA's) to give effect to this directive in Ireland.  These sites are formally notified to the European Commission and form part of a European network known as NATURA 2000 sites.  The Red Grouse is one of the species that must be protected under the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">Due to the on-going situation in the national finances, strict budgetary constraints remain in place and, as a result, management of the limited resources represents a very challenging situation involving difficult choices.  Apart from the financial constraints, the contract periods with farmers under Rural Environment Protection Scheme and the Agri-environmental Options Scheme are well advanced and it would not be feasible to introduce new measures into those schemes at present.  I am actively considering the possibility of re-opening AEOS to allow for the submission of applications either on an amended basis from the existing scheme and/or on a limited scale and would not propose the introduction of new measures at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">However, I will consider the possibility of including measures for the protection of wildlife birds in the context of any new agri-environmental schemes that may be introduced in future following the negotiations on the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy, subject of course to resource constraints.</p>

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_369">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_993">The market performance of the sheep sector, in common with other agricultural sectors, is a function of supply and demand. The long-term future of the sector will depend on its ability to satisfy the market and in order to do this well, it much focus on competitiveness, innovation and the demands of the consumer.  Food Harvest 2020 sets a target of 20% increase in output value for the sheep sector by 2010 and envisages that over the coming years demand for sheepmeat on the European market will outstrip production levels which should provide opportunities for exporting countries such as Ireland.  This should provide the potential for better returns, provided the industry can continue the market and product diversification which has been evident in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">The recommendations of the report focus on farm competitiveness and the processing sector. On the farm side, they emphasise the importance of the continuance of the application of on-farm labour efficiencies and new technologies, breed improvement and the production of a quality product.  On the processing side, the focus is on efficiencies, innovation and improved product range.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">While the recent decline in lamb prices gave cause of concern, it should be noted that this is broadly following the usual seasonal pattern.  As we enter June, prices traditionally decline as the influx of new season lambs suppresses prices.  The notable point for this year is that this seasonal pattern appears to have occurred earlier and suppressed prices for a number of weeks in May rather than the beginning of June.  The main reasons for this were:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_996">Lower demand in export markets, particularly in France;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_997">Farmers had been retaining hoggets in the expectation of an improvement in prices.  When the price improvement didn't materialise, this meant a lot of extra hoggets were delivered to the factories at the same time, which had the effect of reducing the average price.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_998">The sector did not get as big a lift from the new season lambs as in previous years.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">On the positive side, the market seems to have corrected itself and there are signs of stabilisation.  The weather over the coming months will influence the demand for mid-season lamb and good weather on the continent should have the effect of boosting demand and hence prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">In light of the recent fall in producer prices during the month of May and following consultation with the industry, Bord Bia brought forward its summer lamb promotion campaign to commence on 5 June. Furthermore Bord Bia has strengthened the TV advertising element of the campaign, by extending its duration from three to four weeks.  There has been significant public investment in the sheep sector in recent years.  Key supports for this sector include €7 million from the 2009 Single Farm Payment National Reserve under the Uplands Sheep Payment Scheme and €54 million for the three-year Grassland Sheep Scheme which commenced in 2010.  The grassland Sheep Scheme is proving to be a valuable support mechanism in terms of improving income and confidence in the sector.  The sheep fencing/mobile handling equipment scheme, which is one of five Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS), was re-opened to applications last December and the first tranche closed in February of this year.<i/> This scheme will enable many farmers in the sheep sector to complete the necessary investment works in order to maintain competitiveness and introduce increased efficiencies on their farm and so secure the future of their enterprises.  All of the supports I have outlined have provided a significant incentive to farmers to maintain their production levels, which is vital for the future of a viable sheep industry in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">In addition Teagasc has allocated almost €1.5 million for sheep research for 2012.  Bord Bia will also spend over €1.1 million this year on a promotional strategy for the Irish sheep sector which addresses the issue of safeguarding the future of the sector in the following ways:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1002">By encouraging Irish consumers to buy more Quality Assured lamb.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1003">By collaborating with its French and English counterparts in a campaign to reverse the decline in consumption of lamb on the French market, which accounts for over 50% of our exports.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1004">By working with individual exporter to increase the amount of exports to higher value markets such as Germany and Scandinavia and thereby reduce Ireland's dependency on the French market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">I very much welcome the fact that the declining trend in numbers in our national flock is showing signs of reversal and our sheep numbers are now increasing.  This reflects a growing sense of confidence amongst sheep farmers in terms of rebuilding breeding stock numbers which will ultimately lead to an increase in throughput. Whilst it is still too early to provide an accurate estimate for the 2012 lamb crop, it is estimated that it will be up in the order of 1-2%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">On another positive note, sheep meat exports to International markets almost doubled to 600 tonnes during the course of 2011. This generates a great confidence boost for Irish exporters.  While almost 99% of our lamb exports are to the EU, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of outlets available and to this end my Department, together with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to work to secure access to more third country outlets for Irish lamb.</p>

            <p eId="para_1008">I can confirm to the Deputy I fully intend to have a robust appeals system for those farmers who may find themselves adversely affected by the changes to the Terms and Conditions governing the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  Specifically, all applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.  The principles of<i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">Generally speaking, insofar as the rights of farmers to appeal decisions of my Department is concerned, the Deputy will appreciate there is already a well developed system in place whereby, in the first instance, a farmer is entitled to appeal a decision internally to an official of a higher grade than that of the officer who made the initial decision, with the further right of appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office, which is statutorily independent of my Department.  Thereafter, should the need arise, there is also the right of appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">Specifically with regard to the changes to the 2012 DAS Scheme, with the budgeted expenditure being reduced to from €220 million to €190 million, I decided it would be fairer to make the necessary savings by making technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria, thereby ensuring that the aid is focused on farmers who farm exclusively in DAS areas.  It will readily be acknowledged that it is these farmers who are making the more significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1011">To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1012">To maintain the countryside;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1013">To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems, which, in particular, take, account of environmental protection measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, especially from an economic perspective, as it contributes to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families.  Therefore, in proposing the changes in question, the intention is to better focus the Scheme, which is to the benefit of the majority of those farming in areas with recognised constraints, while at the same time attempting to cater for those genuinely prevented from achieving the revised minimums.  Furthermore, every effort will be made to accommodate all active farmers who may find themselves otherwise adversely affected by the changes introduced for the 2012 Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1016">As far as I can ascertain, there has been no specific research conducted in Ireland to date on the impact of forest thinning on badger movements and the spread of TB either by or on behalf of my Department or the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the primary organisation responsible for assessing impact on and managing wild populations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">Neither has my Department identified forestry thinning, which occurs on a regular basis during the growing phase of forestry, as a particular risk for bovine TB.  However, during the course of a study into the effects of major road realignment on badger movement, my Department had the opportunity to assess the impact of clear felling a portion of forest on badger movement.  The badger population in that local area did not appear to have any consequential altered movement pattern. There is evidence that in Ireland badgers prefer to inhabit pasture and field ditches and that badger setts are generally only found in the margins of forests.  Badgers will occupy more than one sett and regularly move between setts.  In view of this, it is unlikely that forestry thinning will have a significant impact on badger movements or the spread of TB.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">There is considerable research available to indicate that badgers have contributed to the spread of TB in cattle.  On the basis of this research, the TB eradication programme contains a wildlife policy element, involving surveying the land and removing badgers where bovine TB is found and where badgers are implicated in the breakdown.  In the context of implementing this policy, research which has been funded by my Department has found that any disruption of badger social groups resulting from the culling of badgers has not led to increased incidence of TB in cattle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">The badger removal policy has contributed to a significant reduction in the levels of the disease in cattle and badgers in recent years.  The incidence of TB in cattle herds has been falling steadily over the years, from a level of 7.53% in 2000 to 4.18% in 2011 and the indications are that levels are continuing to fall in 2012.  The number of reactors recorded in 2011 was, at 18,500, the lowest recorded since the TB eradication scheme was introduced in the 1950s.</p>

            <p eId="para_1021">As announced by the Government in February, consideration will be given to the possible sale of some assets of Coillte excluding the sale of land.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">As I advised the Dáil Select Sub-Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine when I met with them last Thursday in relation to the Estimates for my Department, a decision has not been made to sell Coillte.  We are examining options just as we are examining options in other areas.  The decision in regard to Coillte was to value it in terms of the value of the timber and its forestry and the way in which that type of sale might proceed so that it would not undermine any strategic interest the State may have in the ownership of forestry or land, or the carbon sink value of forestry in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">A valuation of Coillte assets is accordingly being finalised by the NTMA (NewERA unit) in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  While I have preliminary estimates of the valuation of Coillte, more discussion with NewERA and the NTMA is necessary in this regard.  When NewERA and the NTMA are satisfied they have an accurate valuation, I will submit a recommendation to the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">The identification of issues associated with possible options is also being undertaken as part of this exercise.  Such issues include Coillte's strategic importance within the forestry sector overall, possible implications for employment, recreational access to Coillte forests and the protection of those People's Millennium Forests located in the Coillte forest estate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">No decision on the possible sale of Coillte assets will be taken until the valuation process is finalised and all associated issues considered fully.</p>

            <p eId="para_1027">Volatility in dairy prices is caused by imbalances of supply and demand in international markets, which are cyclical in nature.  However, while there will always be short term fluctuations in dairy prices, the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  Growth in global population and wealth is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  Against that background, I believe that prospects and opportunities for the dairy sector will expand significantly over the coming years.  My Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry.  The best way to deal with market instability is to develop a competitive dairy sector that can deal with the challenges and benefit from the opportunities that a global market provides.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">The positive medium-term forecasts are what the Food Harvest 2020 report seeks to exploit in setting out the strategic vision for the agri-food and fishing sector.  From a dairying perspective, the ending of milk quotas in 2015 represents an exceptional opportunity to increase our milk output, and Food Harvest 2020 has targeted a 50% increase in milk production in the next decade.  This target is ambitious but I also believe it is realistic, because the dairy sector has the capability to expand at producer and at processor level, and to exploit the significant potential in expanding international markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">In that context, the Dairy Expansion Activation Group established to identify specific actions needed to deliver on the Food Harvest targets, has produced a Road Map setting out 55 actions required to achieve the 50% increase in milk production.  All of the stakeholders are being encouraged<b/>to discharge the responsibilities assigned to them, and the response<b/>will be<b/>monitored and reported on.  Key areas for action include the identification of markets, the improvement of efficiency at processing level and improving production efficiency at farm level.  While many of these actions will be taken at commercial level, my Department and its agencies are working with industry to provide a framework to support the necessary development.  I am personally chairing the High Level Implementation Committee in order to monitor progress and take appropriate action to support the successful implementation of Food Harvest 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">Exports of dairy products in 2011 were valued at €2.66 billion, an increase of 17% on the previous year.  Ireland already has access to markets worldwide and exports dairy products to over 80 countries.  Nonetheless I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa and elsewhere.  I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  As part of that effort, I recently led a trade mission to China to further develop this important relationship.  I met my ministerial counterparts in the Agriculture and Quarantine Ministries to help raise the profile of the Irish agri-food industry, including the dairy sector, in China.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">At farm level, it is important for producers to focus on profit rather than milk price, and therefore to focus on increasing efficiency and reducing cost.  My Department provides €6 million per annum through the Dairy Efficiency Scheme to encourage the adoption of technology and best practice at farm level.  This scheme will help to equip farmers with the knowledge and skills necessary to maximise their output, reduce their costs of production and increase margins.  In addition, a Dairy Equipment Scheme to encourage capital investment at farm level is available under the TAMS (Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme) to ensure farmers are equipped to gear up for expansion.  The scheme provides grant aid for milking machines, cooling equipment and other ancillary items.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">Furthermore, a number of incentives were introduced in this year's budget to encourage new farmers including a stock relief incentive for milk production partnerships, a stamp duty reduction on agricultural land and restructuring of retirement relief.  Also Teagasc, which is funded by my Department, provides research, education and advice at both farm and processing level and is working closely with industry in the critically important product development area, while Bord Bia is working with operators in the sector on the development of an accredited sustainability model.</p>

            <p eId="para_1034">The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) was established in 1997 as a cooperative and is registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  It has been approved under EU legislation (Commission Decision 2006/427/EC) by my Department as the designated organisation to carry out performance recording, assessment of genetic value and publication of breeding values for dairy and beef cattle in Ireland.

            <p eId="para_1038">The 2008 CAP ‘Health Check' review agreed to the abolition of milk quotas in 2015, and provided for a quota increase for all Member States in the remaining years.  Under those arrangements Ireland will have received an additional 9.3% in quota between 2007 and 2014.  However for some countries, including Ireland, these quota increases are proving insufficient to accommodate increases in milk production which have been driven by supply and demand dynamics, and the prospect of a quota free production environment post 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">I have been extremely active in seeking to secure a soft landing for all Member States in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015, as envisaged in the 2008 CAP Health Check agreement.  I have discussed the matter extensively with other EU Agriculture Ministers, including in bilateral meetings with my Danish, French, German, Estonian and Finnish counterparts.  Furthermore, officials from my Department have raised this issue at EU level meetings, and at bi-lateral meetings with other Member States.  The Commission is due to prepare the second interim report on the Health Check by the end of this year and in that context we have called for it to consider measures to ensure a smooth transition to quota abolition in all countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">To date, however, the Commission has resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check in an overall sense.  The Commission's view is supported by a number of Member States, some of whom are firmly against any further adjustment to the Health Check agreement.  It is also the case that only a minority of Member states is likely to be adversely affected by the current quota restrictions, and therefore persuading a qualified majority to agree to an adjustment of the current regime represents a significant challenge.  There are currently no signs of a breakthrough in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">At this point therefore, it would appear that since a majority of Member States do not support any further adjustment to the soft landing, farmers should plan for the continuation of the quota regime until March 2015.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_376">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1043">The Food Harvest 2020 report (FH2020) was developed by an industry-led committee which comprised key figures from industry, state agencies, academia and the farm bodies.  The report contains the industry's strategic vision for the sector and sets ambitious targets for expansion in the decade to 2020.  It contains 215 recommendations aimed at achieving sustainable growth, increased efficiency, higher productivity and competitiveness.  Since becoming Minister, and as Chair of the High Level Implementation Committee for FH2020, I have whole-heartedly embraced the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and I am totally committed to ensuring its success.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">The whole FH2020 strategy is built around the concept of smart green growth which means producing increased output in an environmentally sustainable way, and being able to prove this to the market.  It also means embracing changes in practices at farm level to reduce the carbon footprint of the food that is being produced.  Ireland's agricultural production is among the most carbon efficient in the world and our rain-fed, grass-based beef, milk and sheep production systems, which use very low cereal inputs, are making a significant contribution to tackling the challenge of sustainably increasing food output.  I am confident that implementation of identified changes in practices at farm level, and application of the smart, green growth principle to agricultural production, will reduce the carbon footprint of agricultural produce.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">Although there is no emissions reduction target for Irish agriculture, the sector continues to make incremental progress.  However, it is recognised that the emissions reduction potential of the sector is quite limited.  Since the 1990s, emissions have been falling slowly but steadily.  For example, between 1990 and 2006 the amount of methane produced per kg of milk dropped by over 12%, mainly due to the rollout of technological advances in dairy production.  Making better use of the land by producing more food and at the same time reducing the emissions per unit of food produced is therefore key to continued expansion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">The FH2020 High Level Implementation Committee has commissioned a team of independent consultants to carry out an environmental analysis of various scenarios involved in achieving the targets in the strategy.  The analysis is to examine the following environmental issues:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1047">biodiversity,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1048">flora/fauna,</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1053">climatic factors including impacts on greenhouse gas emission levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">The consultants are scheduled to deliver an interim report by the end of July with a final report due at the end of this October.  The findings of this analysis will help to inform decisions regarding national climate policy including how to meet the very challenging emissions targets that have been set for Ireland.</p>

         his views on what would be an acceptable level of flattening of direct payments under Common Agricultural Policy reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_377">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1056">One of the proposals in the CAP reform package currently under negotiation is to move away from direct payments based on individual farm historic production references to a system based on uniform regional or national rates of payment per hectare by 2019.  While I accept the need to move away from outdated historic references, I have serious concerns about the extent and pace of changes proposed by the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">Extensive modelling conducted by my Department shows that the application of a national flat rate of payment per hectare would result in average gains of 86% for some 76,000 Irish farmers and average losses of 33% for almost 57,000.  Similar levels of average gains and losses would occur with the application of flat rates on a regional basis.  These are average percentages, and some of the gains and losses would be far larger than this.  In general it is clear that the losses would be incurred by more productive farmers.  This would have undesirable consequences at a time when Ireland is trying to encourage sustainable intensification in the agri-food sector, as we strive to achieve the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020   strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">I have been pressing for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to Member States to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions, and to adopt a more gradual, back-loaded transition process, rather than the very rapid, front-loaded approach proposed by the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">This should be consistent with the Commission's desire to achieve a more level playing field while avoiding a disruptive level or pace of change.  The "approximation" approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average, is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard.  The Commission's "pragmatic" proposal for redistribution between Member States is, in effect, an approximation approach and provides a useful precedent.  Modelling in my Department suggests that the application of a similar system to the distribution of funds between farmers in Ireland would lead to much smaller gains and losses to individual farmers than a flat rate system, however the precise level of transfers depends on the details of the methodology used.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">I have been very active in seeking allies for this position, and I have been making significant progress, particularly with a group of Member States with somewhat similar concerns.  However, it should also be understood that a majority of Member States have no difficulty with the idea of flat rate payments, although they have concerns about other aspects of the proposals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1062">Although I am satisfied with the excellent performance of the agri-food and fish sectors since 2010 I am of course aware of the challenges which must be faced including increased cost of inputs such as fuel, feed and fertiliser as well as access to credit.  As I have stated before, agri-food exports are also subject to international commodity price fluctuations as we have seen in recent months in relation to milk prices. Teagasc research suggests that producer margins will fall in 2012 compared to 2011.  However, they also believe that the decline will not cause margins to go below those experienced in 2010, which overall was a good year for the agri-food sector.  Fuel feed and fertilisers are global commodities that have been subject to high volatility in recent years.  The EU is supporting the efforts of the G20 to deal with this volatility.  One of the measures that has already been implemented is an agricultural markets information system that provides detailed information concerning stocks and potential harvest data.  This will provide more certainty to international markets and help to reduce speculative pricing in the sector.  Work is continuing at both the FAO and within the G20 to monitor and manage price volatility for both food and inputs to food production.  Ireland must continue its discussions with its EU partners to create a CAP that meets global obligations in relation to trade and emissions while at the same time ensuring a properly functioning agricultural market for its farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1262">As I have stated previously, this is an operational matter for Teagasc.  It is responsible for the day to day running of the organisation including decisions relating to the network of offices.  Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act establishing Teagasc and the Minister does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of Teagasc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">The decision by Teagasc to close Kinsealy is part of a significant "Change Programme" to cut costs, improve efficiencies and streamline services.  The Programme involves the disposal of surplus assets, a significant reduction in the number of research and advisory locations and cuts in staff numbers.  In addition to moving to Ashtown, Teagasc is also closing 40 of its 91 Advisory offices throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">Teagasc prepared a detailed Business Case on the planned move to Ashtown and are satisfied that it will give rise to significant annual cost savings with an expected payback arising from relocation savings over a 7 year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">In current economic circumstances, it was appropriate for Teagasc to review their portfolio of assets and see how best they could be utilised for the overall good of the organisation and the agri-food sector.  Their approach reflected the recommendations in the "Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Programme Expenditure" published by the previous Government that opportunities for savings should be developed by rationalising the national network of Teagasc and Department locations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1267">Given the nature of any negotiation process, it is often difficult to accurately predict not only the outcome but even the timing of an outcome.  This is especially the case when the interests of 27 Member States have to be reconciled across the enormous range of issues covered by the Commission's proposals on the reform of the CAP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">It is important to note also that key CAP issues are in fact being discussed in two parallel tracks, namely:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1269">in the CAP reform negotiations in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and at official level in the Special Committee on Agriculture and four separate working groups, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1270">in the negotiations on a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) setting the EU budget for the period 2014 to 2020, which take place in the General Affairs Council and, ultimately, in the European Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">In addition, the European Parliament will have a key role in the process and in final decision making.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">As a Member State taking over the reins of the EU Presidency in January 2013, Ireland is committed to playing an active and constructive role in securing agreement on the reform of the CAP. However, to do this, three things need to be happen:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1273">there must be progress and ultimately agreement on the MFF,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1274">the substantial progress made during the Danish presidency regarding technical issues must continue through the Cypriot presidency, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1275">all three institutions — the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission — need to engage actively in the negotiating process, with a commitment to seeking workable compromise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">I have assured Commissioner Ciolos and my Member State colleagues that Ireland is willing to play a full role, both before and during our presidency, in seeking agreement on this vital issue, both for the EU and for Ireland.</p>

         asked the

         his plans to review the TB testing regime; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [28510/12]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_384">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1278">The bovine TB eradication programme includes a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing of all cattle in the national herd, the early removal of reactors, the payment of compensation for cattle removed as reactors, implementation of a range of supplementary tests such as post-derestriction and contiguous tests, a wildlife programme, and the depopulation of infected herds in some cases.  These measures have proven to be relatively effective in recent years as evidenced by the significant reduction in disease levels over the past decade.  For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.53% in 2000 to 4.18% last year and reactor numbers in 2011 were, at 18,500, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950s.  Reactor numbers and herd incidence have continued to fall in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">The eradication programme is scientifically based and my Department continues to monitor and review the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme on an on-going basis in light of experience and research.  In this context, my Department reviewed the programme last year and concluded that, if we want to progress towards eradication, it was necessary to address all other potential sources of infection, including from neighbouring herds and the movement of high risk animals, in addition to the emphasis which has been placed on badgers as a source of infection in recent years.  It also concluded that it was necessary to ensure that testing is conducted in a timely manner.  In light of this, my Department introduced a number of changes into the TB programme earlier this year to prevent the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds and to tighten up on overdue testing.  These changes were made following a number of consultation meetings with the farming organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">I want to emphasise that the changes are, firstly, based on research which demonstrates that there are increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals and, secondly, that they are designed to protect clear herds from buying in high risk animals.  For example, the restrictions imposed on the movement of inconclusive reactors is based on research which showed that standard inconclusive reactors which passed the re-test and moved out of the herd, subsequent to passing the test, were 12 times more likely to be TB positive at the subsequent test or at slaughter compared to all other animals in the herd.  Furthermore, the new controls on the movement of animals out of herds which have been identified as contiguous to a herd experiencing an active high risk TB breakdown are based on research which showed that the risk of such herds disclosing TB is almost 3 times greater than the risk in the case of herds tested on a round test.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">Following representations from the farming sector, my Department has reviewed the new arrangements. I have clarified that my Department will contact herdowners prior to restricting their herds under the contiguous testing programme and that herds which are trade restricted pending a test will not be excluded from the Russian trade.  In addition, I have made a number of changes to the new arrangements such that herdowners who, having genuine reasons, negotiate a delay (up to one month) with the DVO prior to the overdue date will not have any penalties applied.  In addition, herdowners who postpone their tests with the permission of the DVO or are contiguous to a high risk breakdown and are waiting for a test will be permitted to buy in animals for a limited period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">With regard to the four month period in the context of the contiguous testing programme, I have set out the position in response to the preceding Priority Question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">While I am very pleased with the improvement in the incidence of TB, my Department subjects the TB eradication programme to on-going review with a view to ensuring that there is a robust testing regime in place.  The prevention of the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds is an important factor both in achieving the goal of eradication and in continuing to secure funding from the EU.  My Department will continue to review and make changes to various elements of the programme as deemed necessary in light of experience.</p>

         if he will provide, in tabular form, the duration of each loan that Ireland has drawn down from the European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism; the cost to the EFSF and EFSM of raising funds for each of these draw downs on the open market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1285">The following tables, which have been provided by the NTMA, set out the funding operations done by the EFSM and EFSF where Ireland was a beneficiary.  In some cases funding operations were done on behalf of another country at the same time and this is also indicated.  The cost of funding to the lender may differ from the ultimate cost of borrowing to the borrower because of fees and other adjustments.  However, as there is no interest rate margin applied by the EFSF and EFSM to Ireland, these differences are relatively minor.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">Note that, in the case of the EFSF, it has moved to a pooled interest rate system, meaning that all beneficiary countries will pay the same interest rate.  However, this system was established in March 2012 at which point Ireland had received loans at definitive interest rates, some of which will become part of the pooled interest rate system.  This means that the two loans drawn from the EFSF before the establishment of the pooled system are at definitive interest rates whilst the balance will be based on the pooled system.  As the pooled system was on an interim basis from November 2011 to end-March 2012, the first three disbursements from the EFSF in 2012 were provided on an interim basis, and will be rolled over in due course at which point they will be part of the pooled system proper.  The pooled system means that the EFSF will no longer go to the capital markets to borrow specifically for Ireland and that the link between its market operations and its lending activities is no longer direct.</p>

            <p eId="para_1374">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) is a withholding tax system that operates in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors.  Principal contractors are defined in the legislation (section 530A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) as including "any board or body established by or under statute ... and funded wholly or mainly out of funds provided by the Oireachtas".  As such, school Boards of Management are principal contractors for the purposes of RCT.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">Principal contractors, including school Boards of Management, are and always were required to deduct tax from the payments made to subcontractors and pay it over to Revenue.  As it is recognised that it would be undesirable to deduct tax from compliant subcontractors, provision is made for compliant subcontractors to receive payments without deduction of tax.  The need to ensure tax compliance by subcontractors is particularly important where the Exchequer is the ultimate source of the funds being paid out by school Boards of Management and other principal contractors.  RCT plays an important role in ensuring tax compliance by subcontractors in these sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">From 1 January 2012, the Revenue Commissioners have made available a new online system for the operation of RCT that has significantly reduced the administrative burden associated with RCT.  This new system offers a fast, efficient and paper free system, which has streamlined the process for the submission of information and payments to Revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware of the difficulty some school Boards of Management may be having in fulfilling their obligations under the RCT system.  Revenue has met with the Department of Education and Skills regarding the obligations of Boards of Management under the RCT system and that further meetings are planned.  In addition, local Revenue offices have been contacting Boards of Management who are likely to be in receipt of State funding for construction projects with a view to assisting them with their RCT responsibilities.  Detailed guidance notes regarding the operation of RCT by school Boards of Management are being prepared and will be made available on the Revenue website and also made available to the Department of Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">Finally, having regard to the pressures on the public finances, it is important that the RCT system is implemented correctly in order to minimise tax evasion in the construction sector particularly involving substantial State funding.  The new online administrative system introduced by Revenue has significantly simplified the RCT process for principal contractors, including school Boards of Management.</p>

            <p eId="para_1480">The current Group A tax-free threshold (for gifts/inheritances from parents to children) is €250,000.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield from reducing the Group A threshold to €200,000 is estimated to be of the order of €15 million.  The Group A threshold has already been reduced by 59% from its peak level of €542,544 in early 2009.  Revenue does not receive information on gifts and inheritances which currently do not have to be declared so it is not possible to estimate the potential yield if such benefits were brought into the tax net by the proposed reduction.  The estimated full year yield from reducing Business Relief and Agricultural Relief from 90% to 75% would be in the region of €14 million and €35 million respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">It is not possible to estimate the yield from capping the level of business and agricultural relief at €2,500,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">It should be noted that these estimates are based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact from such changes, which could lead to a less than expected result from a change to the tax base.  In addition, the realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets which are currently occurring in the economy.</p>

The cost of reducing the standard VAT rate from 23% to 20% is estimated at €850m.  With regard to reducing the standard VAT rate on certain business activities from 23% to 15%, this would not be possible under EU VAT law, with which Ireland must comply.  The EU VAT Directive provides that Member States may only operate one standard VAT rate.  In order to reduce the VAT rate to 15% on accounting and legal services, this would require a general reduction in the standard VAT rate from 23% to 15%.  Such a move would cost over €2 billion and is not feasible in the current climate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1486">I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">All schools had been advised to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012 and schools will be notified shortly by their local SENO of their SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">The recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1510">Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. My Department has published the staffing arrangements at post primary level for the coming school year, 2012-13. The relevant Post Primary circular is 0009/2012 which is available on my Department's website. At post primary level, schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet their requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1524">I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 to 49, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">The new PMDS form came into use for the 2012 cycle which commenced on 1 January 2012 and replaces the three separate Role Profile, Interim Review and Annual Review forms which were in use previously. The 2012 cycle of the Performance Management and Development System ends on 31 December 2012.  The central aim of any performance management system is to support managers and employees in improving the performance of the individual and, in turn, the performance of the organisation.  The most important element in how effective performance management will be in an organisation is the skills and talent of line managers.  My Department is developing a range of tools to support line managers in developing good management skills.  In addition to the skills of line management, it is also critical that the performance management system itself is designed in such a way as to support management and staff in delivering high performance levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">My Department carried out a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the performance management and development system used in the Civil Service in 2010.<i>The Evaluation of PMDS Survey 2010</i>   identified a number of problems with how PMDS is currently operating.  My Department has been working with management and unions, in accordance with commitments in Croke Park to strengthen performance management in the Civil Service, and has agreed changes to performance management.  In 2011 changes were introduced aimed at improving the operation of PMDS. This involved streamlining the paperwork associated with PMDS primarily to create space for more discussion about performance between staff and managers. Critically, we are increasing manager accountability for managing performance giving a low rating to managers who do not manage the performance of their staff proactively i.e. a manager who has not been managing their staff (including the completion of PMDS for their staff) should not get a rating above 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">My Department alongside management of the Civil Service and unions is now engaged in a process of identifying ways to improve more fundamental problems with PMDS.<i>The Evaluation of PMDS</i>
                            <i>Survey 2010</i>  highlighted that one of the main underlying problems with PMDS is a perceived lack of fairness and consistency in the application of the system.  In this regard, my Department has given a discussion paper to the unions which outlines a broad range of options aimed at improving fairness and consistency and the operation of PMDS from both a management and a staff perspective.  The paper outlines possible changes to the competency framework; the ratings and the distribution of ratings; the rating scale used in PMDS; and with whom (i.e. what level of manager) the responsibility for overall fairness and consistency should lie.  This paper follows on from an agreement in November 2011 that the PMDS Subcommittee of General Council (management and unions) would address all of these fundamental issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">This discussion paper forms the basis of consultation and debate with the unions. It presents a range of options commonly used in organisations to help to ensure fairness and consistency in performance management systems. In any paper addressing fairness and consistency in performance management, one would expect to see a proposal to introduce mechanisms such as calibration or forced distribution.  While there are undoubtedly a number of issues with the forced distribution option, it does facilitate management within organisations to identify and differentiate their top performers; to identify developmental needs for more moderate performers; and to identify staff whose performance is below the standard expected.  The paper also contains a proposal to stop paying increments where an individual staff member gets a rating below 3.  This is based on the already agreed principle in the Civil Service that increments should only be awarded on the basis of a positive assessment of performance and commitment throughout the year.  The ultimate aim is to ensure that the PMDS system itself will support the improvement of individual and organisational performance across the Civil Service and that it is applied in a more fair and consistent manner.</p>

Applications from Bulgarian and Romanian nationals are subject to distinct and more favourable consideration as compared to applications from nationals of countries outside of the EEA arising from the provisions of their respective Treaties of Accession to the European Union.  As a result of this status, careful consideration of such nationals' applications must be given to ensure that the criteria under the employment permits schemes are accurately applied.  I am informed that exceptional delays have arisen in this area over the last few months due to competing priorities and the need to address a range of complex legal issues which applicants have raised.

            <p eId="para_1533">I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">My Department and its Agencies have already achieved a reduction of almost 24.5% in the administrative burden imposed on business; this amounts to annual savings for business of over €204 million.  I anticipate that further measures will be identified that will see the Department meeting its 25% target by the end of the year.  Details of all the initiatives making up the total already achieved are available on my Department's website.  Successful initiatives resulting in significant savings include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1535">In Company Law, savings of €82 million per annum have already been realised, more than €33 million of which are due to the work of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), as companies can submit their annual returns online via the CRO website and can now use digital signatures for the B1 Form and Accounts.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1536">In Health and Safety Law, a total of €123 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the HSA via two key projects: the BeSMART online tool for preparing the Risk Assessment and Safety Statement (€59m), and the SMP20 Guidelines (€64m), which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction exercise towards the 25% target by the end of 2012.  A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011.  Following completion of its measurement exercise, each participating Department must then immediately begin planning how it will achieve the remaining reductions necessary to reach the target.  The first cluster of Departments are expected to report to Government with Simplification Plans by the end of this month and the remaining Departments are expected to report by the end of the third quarter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">Work is continuing to identify new areas where administrative burdens on business can be reduced and in this regard the High Level Group on Business Regulation has prioritised a number of areas for attention in its Work Programme for 2012.  I understand that comparable figures are not available for all of the other Member States in the EU. However, I understand that the European Commission intends to report on its own Administrative Burden Reduction Action Programme early in 2013.  This report may include a summary of the progress made by all the Member States.  As far as a future EU strategy is concerned, we must await the Commission's report and its proposals in the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1540">Workers at the Lagan Brick factory in Kingscourt, Co Cavan have been involved in a protest outside the company's premises in a dispute over the decision by the company to close its operation on 15 December last with the loss of 29 jobs. The union wanted to retain maximum employment at the plant and secure satisfactory redundancy terms for any workers that would lose their jobs.  Subsequently, representatives of the company and the trade union SIPTU attended conciliation talks at the Labour Relations Commission on 10th and 16th January. These talks were reconvened on 6 February following consideration by both sides of an examination of the trading position of the company undertaken by an independent expert.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">Following the 6th of February hearing, SIPTU stated that it would be seeking the intervention of the Labour Court in the dispute, following the failure to reach agreement in the LRC talks.  However, I understand that Lagan Brick subsequently issued a statement to the effect that the company did not intend to pursue further negotiation with worker representatives in this matter. In a ballot conducted on Thursday 1st March, SIPTU members in Lagan Brick voted almost unanimously to take strike action in response to the company's decision not to attend the Labour Court, and that seven days' notice of strike action was served on Lagan Brick by SIPTU on 2nd March.  Official strike action began on 10 March.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">I understand that the parties subsequently engaged in direct discussions in an effort to resolve the dispute, with the assistance of a mediation panel under an agreed independent chairman jointly appointed by ICTU and IBEC. Unfortunately, that process also failed to reach a resolution.  I regret that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement to resolve this long running dispute.  I would urge the parties involved in this dispute to work together to break the current impasse by utilising the established machinery for dispute resolution, who are available to assist at short notice. In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court offers the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving such issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_1546">The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner's recommendation/decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">I am informed that if a Rights Commissioner decision is referred to the Tribunal for implementation, the Tribunal will endeavour to list this type of case as quickly as possible and will stream similar types of referrals together.  These can be dealt with relatively quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">However, if either party appeals a Rights Commissioner decision, it must go before the Tribunal for a fresh hearing. The type of claim, the fact that it is contested, the date of lodgement, current resources are all factors that impact on the time to hear the case.  I am informed that at the end of May 2012, the overall Dublin waiting period was 79 weeks and the overall country waiting period was 82 weeks. The Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding in an effort to distribute its existing resources in an even handed manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">The Tribunal increased the number of claims disposed of in 2011 by 11% against the previous year, to date 2012 continues to show an increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Substantial progress has already been made and a number of important priority actions that I identified last July have been successfully delivered within the target timescale. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure. The purpose of the Reform Programme is to provide a more efficient and effective system of resolving employment disputes. Substantial progress has already been made in this regard. For example, the establishment of a Workplace Relations Single Contact Portal from January this year has resulted in all complaints now being acknowledged and respondents notified within, on average, 5 working days of receipt of the complaint. In 2010 Rights Commissioner complaints were being acknowledged within an average of 80 days.   This service enhancement increases the likelihood of employers and employees resolving issues sooner and has substantially reduced the backlog for certain hearings. I understand that the backlog for Rights Commissioner hearings has effectively been eliminated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">The service improvements have also been underpinned by the launch from January this year of a Single Complaint Form for all first instance workplace relations complaints. A version of this Form which can be submitted online will be rolled out in quarter 3 of this year. A Pilot Early Resolution Service commenced on 14th   May this year. This service will provide the opportunity in certain cases for employers and employees to resolve issues without recourse to formal adjudication hearings, thus relieving pressure on adjudication services such as the Rights Commissioner Service and the EAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">The two tier model now being designed will deliver a just, fair and efficient adjudication service provided by independent, professional and impartial decision-makers with a target period of three months from the time of complaint to hearing, and written, reasoned decisions within 28 working days of the hearing with published decisions. Finally, I also intend to provide for a more effective method of enforcing the awards of adjudicators.</p>

            <p eId="para_1563">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently 93,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement, with €436m provided in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students.   For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities. In the case of Meath the following areas were isolated for consideration: Ashbourne; Athboy; Bettystown; Dunshaughlin; Navan; Trim; Ratoath; Kells; Laytown; Enfield; and the rest of Meath county as a whole. Current information shows there is accommodation available at the new maximum rent limits in county Meath.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">Analysis of the Ratoath, Dunboyne and Dunshaughlin markets shows that there are a limited number of rental properties available in comparison to those available in the rest of the county. However, according to one of the leading property websites, some shared accommodation is available within the prescribed limits. It is important to bear in mind that the purpose of the review is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas. Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and it must be stressed that there will be no case of homelessness from this measure.</p>

Other discrete elements of the new service model such as customer profiling ad Group Engagements are being rolled-out in advance of the ‘one-stop-shop' implementation and I expect that, as planned, these elements will be rolled out nationwide before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">The advisory group to which the Deputy refers has not yet been established.  I am currently examining proposals from the Department on the establishment and membership of this group and I expect to announce details shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1577">The focus of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">The person in question is currently in receipt of illness benefit. The eligibility criteria for participation in the BTEA scheme require a person to be in receipt of illness benefit for at least two years prior to commencement of their approved course of study.  However, if a person fails to satisfy the two year requirement on illness benefit, periods spent on other qualifying social welfare claims can be used to make up the two year qualifying period provided that at least 50% of the two years is spent on illness benefit.  The 50 % rule is relaxed for persons in receipt of illness benefit and subsequently qualifies for another qualifying illness related payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">A person in receipt of illness benefit can pursue a course of study while receiving payment without recourse to BTEA if it is medically certified that pursuit of the course will not impede his or her recovery.  The records of the Department indicate that no recent application has been made for BTEA.</p>

            <p eId="para_1581">The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of either six or nine months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least three of the last six months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register. It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The structure for achieving this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed. Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. The Department of Social Protection   continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.  However, there are no current plans to review the 78 days qualifying period.</p>

            <p eId="para_1669">The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of sick absence for an initial period of illness, is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1670">the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1671">the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1672">in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">Before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme, a range of complex issues need to be examined in detail.   The potential impact of such a scheme would depend on how these issues are addressed and how the scheme would ultimately be structured.  A preliminary analysis based on estimates of absenteeism in the private sector indicates that if a sick pay scheme with a duration of four weeks were to be introduced, it would add about €1 per week per employee to the costs of employment.   The analysis will be developed and refined as the consultations with key stakeholders progresses.</p>

            <p eId="para_1707">Earlier this year, at the request of the Government, Mr. Conor Skehan, Chairman of the Peatlands Council, convened a Peatlands Forum, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice John Quirke, and involving my Department, the IFA, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, Bord na Móna, and representatives of turf-cutting and environmental groups. This Forum allowed each community affected by the cessation of turf-cutting to put forward their views on the issues and follow-up steps were identified for each bog. The report on the Forum from Justice Quirke also recommended that a national plan should be prepared to examine how the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation are to be protected. This recommendation was agreed to by Government. Dáil Éireann also gave unanimous support to a Private Members' Motion, which called for such a national plan to be put in place. On the 3rd of April, I, together with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, T.D., met with EU Environment Commissioner Potoènik in Brussels, where we secured the support of the European Commission for developing a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan.   This plan will be developed over the coming 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">The plan will be wide-ranging, looking at the practical aspects of conserving and managing the affected bogs and will allow solutions for turf-cutters to be explored in detail. In the context of such a plan, it may be possible to bring some flexibility, within the terms of the EU Habitats Directive, that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites. The plan will be progressed both at local level for each site and through the Peatlands Council and my Department has been engaging with relevant communities in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1710">The<i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030</i> was published on 21 December 2010 and the <i>Programme for Government 2011-2016</i> states that the Government will support the Strategy and will deliver the achievable goals proposed therein. It is recognised in the Strategy itself that it is to be implemented on a phased basis over a 20-year period. During 2011, my Department focused on the establishment phase of the Strategy by setting up the operational structures to progress its implementation. </p>
            <p eId="para_1711">My Department is currently focused on advancing the Gaeltacht Bill 2012, which will provide, inter alia, for a new definition of the Gaeltacht based on linguistic criteria and for Údarás na Gaeltachta to be given responsibility for the implementation of the Strategy in the Gaeltacht. Following Government approval on 12 June for the text of the Gaeltacht Bill, I hope to present the Bill to Seanad Éireann next week. The Bill will provide for a language planning process whereby language plans will be prepared on a phased basis at community level for each Gaeltacht area. This process is a key component of the Strategy to ensure that the Irish language survives as a community language in the Gaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">While all initiatives undertaken by my Department in the Gaeltacht are closely aligned with the Strategy, I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to a particular initiative, the Family Language Support Programme, which I launched in April 2012. The aim of this programme is to support Gaeltacht families who are raising, or who wish to raise, their children through Irish.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">While I appreciate the significant pressure on resources at this time, I am satisfied that the funding available to my Department is sufficient to ensure that the Strategy will continue to be implemented on a phased basis in the Gaeltacht.  Further information on the implementation of the Strategy is available at<i>www.ahg.gov.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1723">The issue raised by the Deputy is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) a statutorily independent body and I do not have a function.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">However, I understand from the CER that ESB Networks Customer Charter provides for the requirements of customers with special medical needs (e.g. customers relying on electrically powered life support equipment), and vulnerable customers.  On occasion, ESB Networks has to interrupt supply to a customer on a planned basis, mainly where they are upgrading the networks to provide a more efficient service or where connecting a new customer requires an outage to allow them to work safely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">ESB Networks always give at least two days advance notice to customers where a planned interruption of supply is required.  This notice is sent by post to all of the addresses affected by the outage.  In order to ensure that they meet this target they generally send out the postal notifications two weeks before the outage date, so in practice, the majority of customers receive approximately one week's advance notification of the upcoming outage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">ESB Networks endeavours to do everything possible to reduce the disruption caused by these outages to their customers.  Measures such as cancelling or postponing an outage to another date to accommodate a customer's requirements and allow alternative arrangements to be put in place are regularly taken.  Staff do this by working locally with the individual, their carers or their family.  In a small number of critical cases a back-up generator may be provided but it is not current policy that a back-up generator be provided in all instances where a vulnerable customer is affected by a planned outage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">Unfortunately, electricity supply interruptions are a fact of life and severe weather events are a recognised threat to electricity supplies all over the world.  This type of unplanned fault on the network presents the greatest risk to vulnerable customers and where ESB Networks is aware of the special needs of any customer affected it will restore supply on a priority basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">It is very important that any customers with special medical needs, who rely on electrically powered equipment, have their details recorded on the Special Services Register (which is maintained by all Electricity Suppliers).  These customers should make contact with their Supplier to check if they are already registered correctly or, if not, to get details about the registration process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1731">The selection of schools for connection during 2012 was guided by the view that a geographical rollout will provide the project with the most economically beneficial method to achieve the project objectives.  This will allow for the aggregation of backhaul links to provide the optimum solution for the schools selected.  It will also allow service providers to provide the local school access connection in a cost effective manner to deliver multiple schools for similar locations at a reduced cost to the Exchequer.  In identifying the most appropriate locations to deliver the first round of increased bandwidth connections it was decided to concentrate on those locations receiving the lowest average speed under the DES' existing Schools Broadband Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">It is expected that the first 200 second level schools in the national roll out, will be connected by October 2012.  These include all second level schools in the following counties:</p>

In the meantime, the DES continues to operate its Schools Broadband Programme for all primary and post-primary schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1736">Ireland's telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the Commission for Communications Regulation's (ComReg) website at<i> www.callcosts.ie.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1737">The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  In the case of one such intervention, namely the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), services are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, 3, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in each of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.  That includes 85 EDs in County Kerry, which are listed in Appendix I.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  This Scheme, which is being rolled out this year, is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas who wish to avail of such services.  My Department has received 67 eligible applications from County Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">With basic broadband services available throughout Ireland, the challenge now is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  This Government accepts that the widespread availability of such speeds is required to deliver future economic and social development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">Following the recent publication of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), and a short public consultation on its findings and recommendations, I will be bringing proposals for a National Broadband Plan to Government shortly with a view to agreeing a comprehensive set of policy actions to underpin the provision of high speed broadband services on a national basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1914">Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs) and private contractors.  To date the scheme has completed energy efficiency measures in over 83,000 homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">At all times the scheme works to maximise the number of vulnerable homes to receive support, particularly when working from a limited budget envelope.  The focus of efforts therefore is to prioritise homes which have not received any measures previously, maximising the number of vulnerable homes that will receive some form of improvement.  Within this context, the best impact for homeowners and value for public funds can be achieved by limiting interventions to single visits per home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">The applicant received attic insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, low energy light bulbs and energy advice from Muireas (a CBO) in October 2010 which have improved the comfort and running costs of his home.  At the time however, Muireas did not provide a cavity wall insulation service.  Therefore, the home of the person in question was subsequently referred to another CBO to complete the cavity wall insulation.  Unfortunately, due to the unprecedented level of demand for the scheme being experienced by mid 2011, it was necessary to adjust the scheme rules to address the significant demand in homes where no works had been undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">As the applicant had already received works in 2010, which included all the measures which the originally appointed CBO was in a position to deliver at that time, regrettably, it is not possible to undertake cavity wall insulation in his home under the application made in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">Since the start of 2012, where a home is identified which require works beyond the capacity of the local CBO, the home is referred to a separate contractor to complete the works within one visit, thus maintaining scheme efficiency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hot line can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to<i>oireachtas@seai.ie</i>  and will be dealt with promptly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1921">The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).  Delivery of new social housing by the voluntary and cooperative housing sector is identified in the housing policy statement as a key supply source into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">To date, the HFA has received twelve applications for Certified Borrower status and awarded status to four bodies.  The Agency has received four applications for 98 social housing units in total (at a valuation of €13.4 million), two of which have been approved and the other two are pending a decision by the Agency's Credit Committee.  It is envisaged that further lending will be generated for the Agency in 2012, under this Scheme, with more AHBs applying for Certified Body status and subsequent loan applications for social housing schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">I am conscious that the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them.  I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions.  My Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse.  This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1938">In the case of complex regeneration schemes, project staff are involved at every stage in the project life cycle ranging from initial socio-economic appraisal, planning and design, preparation of contract documents, procurement of services and works contracts, construction supervision and post project review.  Depending on the availability of resources within individual authorities and the competencies and skill-sets required to progress projects through the various stages, project staff may be assigned to a regeneration scheme from within an authority's own staff complement or may be procured through open competition by way of fixed term or services contract.  Contract staff costs may be project-specific or may, in cases such as engineering services, health and safety services contracts or other specialist service provision, relate to a number of projects under a particular regeneration scheme.  Traditionally, professional fees were based on a percentage of project value/construction cost but are now generally based on fixed price/lump sum contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">In the case of two of the projects referred to, Cranmore and Mitchell's Crescent, a specific project team from within the local authority was assigned to the planning and supervision of regeneration projects and funding of €498,351 and €33,750 respectively, was recouped to the local authority in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1940">Based on the information available in my Department, it is not possible with the necessary degree of certainty to disaggregate project staff-related costs in the case of recoupment claims submitted in respect of individual regeneration projects.  Accordingly, my Department is working with the local authorities concerned to compile the information requested.  Given the constraints on staff time and resources in the relevant local authorities and the urgent need to progress regeneration work programmes, it has not been possible to complete this task so far.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
            <p eId="para_1944">I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 to 98, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1945">The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations of an independent assessment, to establish a public water utility company, Irish Water, to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.  Following further consideration as to whether Irish Water should be established as a new entity or whether existing bodies in the Semi State sector could undertake the function, the Government decided that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord Gáis Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">The proposed public utility model represents a major change with significant implications for local government, the water industry in Ireland and its many stakeholders.  Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, and these skills within the Bord Gáis Group will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation.  A phased transition is proposed to ensure continuity of service and the building of a fit for purpose organisation within a reasonable timescale.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">Work is now focused on the finalisation of an implementation strategy which will address transformation planning in more detail, and will recommend appropriate transitional arrangements.  The implementation strategy is being developed in collaboration with other relevant Government Departments, local authorities, BGE and NewERA.  The development and rollout of the strategy will also involve co-operation with local authorities and staff to ensure that the change is managed well.  The strategy will focus on maintaining the delivery of a critical public service during and following a restructuring process, and will give further clarity on the next steps that will be taken in this reform process.  While the independent assessment recommended the appointment of a management partner this was in the context of the establishment of a new entity, and was prior to the decision to establish Irish Water within the Bord Gáis Group.  It will now be a matter for Bord Gáis to consider the requirements for external advice having regard to the existing skills and capabilities within the Bord Gáis Group, and local authorities and the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1948">It is estimated that the overall water reforms the Government has planned will create 2,000 construction related jobs in the economy on an ongoing basis.  This will be achieved through the planned roll-out of the programme of water metering which will lead to the creation of up to 2,000 jobs for the duration of the metering installation programme.  A steady level of capital investment of potentially €600 million per annum in water services, facilitated through the new public utility would see this level of construction employment sustained on an ongoing basis through capital investment in new infrastructure.</p>

         if strong consideration will be given to amending the proposed grandfather clause for the Building Control Act 2007 which had intended to regulate the use of the title “architect” by empowering the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland but which is acting prohibitively against experienced architects who possess qualifications which were the accepted route into the profession in the past and who also have a wealth of experience arising from working in the industry for many years.

            <p eId="para_1960">I have no plans to amend the registration arrangement currently provided for under Part 3 of the Building Control Act, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">A number of routes to registration are provided for in Sections 14, 15, 16 and 22 of the Act having regard to the differing approaches to gaining the requisite knowledge, skills and experience adopted by individual applicants. Section 22, in particular, includes a provision to address the position of a category of practically trained persons who had already been providing architectural services in Ireland commensurate with those understood as being provided by Architects for the purpose of the Building Control Act 2007 for a period of ten years at the time the Act became law.   This provision is transitional in nature and enables this category of persons to become registered once they have been assessed as eligible for registration by the Technical Assessment Board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">Taken in their totality the various routes to registration provided for under Part 3 of the Act represent a registration process that is open, fair and transparent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">The Act does not seek to regulate the function or role of architects. Its purpose rather is to provide statutory protection of the title Architect so that only those who are suitably qualified and registered will be lawfully entitled to use the title.  Eligible persons who decline to register can continue to practice architecture and provide architectural services but they cannot use the title Architect or sign certificates to that effect.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1966">"The reform of personal insolvency law, the Heads of Bill which I have published, will involve the introduction of three new non-judicial debt settlement systems, subject to relevant conditions in each case. These are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1967">A Debt Relief Certificate to allow for the full write-off of qualifying unsecured debt up to €20,000, after a one-year moratorium period for debtors with "no assets — no income";</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1968">a Debt Settlement Arrangement for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt of €20,001 and over with two or more creditors;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1969">a Personal Insolvency Arrangement<b/>  for the agreed settlement of both secured and unsecured debt of €20,001 to €3 million with one or more creditors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1970">The Personal Insolvency Bill will also continue the reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, begun in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 will include, critically, the introduction of automatic discharge from bankruptcy, subject to certain conditions, after 3 years in place of the current 12 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">It is not for me to speculate as to the future conduct of any of the participants in an insolvency process. However, I am of the view that new personal insolvency laws, including the bankruptcy law reform, should provide a significant incentive for financial institutions to develop and implement realistic agreements to manage or settle debt with their customers. Such agreements should in time become the norm as the most sensible and cost-effective arrangements, particularly where the issue is one of dealing with repayment difficulties for a single major debt, secured or otherwise. These agreements could include measures to address mortgage arrears."</p>

The Service has indicated that its policy in considering the future operational viability of any venue is to consult with local stakeholders and that would be the case should the future of the venues at Ballina, Westport and Swinford fall for consideration in the context of the current review.</p>

In this regard I would advise her to include documentary evidence to show continuous residence in the State since October, 2011.

            <p eId="para_2088">Under the EU Regulations co-operatives were obliged to submit their final figures on the volumes of milk received during the last milk quota year and the relevant butterfat content information by 15 May 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2089">Following that, all superlevy payments must be made by the suppliers to their respective co-operatives by 1 September 2012.  The co-operatives are then obliged to forward the monies to my Department by 1 October 2012 and my Department has, in turn, to submit the monies to the Commission by end November 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">Based on the final declarations from the co-operatives, the overall level of milk deliveries for the Milk Quota year 2011/2012 has been calculated at 1.05% above quota, taking into account the adjustment for butterfat content and for the leap year. Based on these calculations, the final super levy bill is expected to be in the region of €16.5m.  The final calculation of the national position exceeds the earlier estimate by 0.36% (a little over one day's production), due to a significantly higher increase in the butterfat content in milk this year over previous years.  The increase in butterfat content in 2011/12 was such that the National Butterfat adjustment factor, at 102.893%, was 20% higher than that in the 2010/11 quota year.  This compares with an increase between 2009/10, and 2010/11, of just 3.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">This is a change to the aggregate reported production figure for the country as a whole compared to that estimated in April, and does not change the position of individual farmers, who have already been provisionally notified of their position by their co-ops.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">Factors such as good weather and growing conditions and continuing improvements in genetics can lead to improvements in butterfat content from year to year.  In quota year 2011/12, the increased use of ‘once a day milking' to mitigate super levy bills may have been an additional factor.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">The final position relating to individual co-operatives will not be available until all milk quota transfers, leases and allocations of flexi milk are assigned.  It is expected that this task will be completed by mid August.</p>

            <p eId="para_2095">The main objectives of the North-South Ministerial Council are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole.  The ultimate objectives are to establish equivalent internal arrangements with a view to achieving free movement of animals and animal products within the island.  There is ongoing co-operation through the dedicated working groups established under the North/South arrangements of which the hosting of the international vaccination expert's scientific symposium in Belfast in May is one recent example.  The ultimate goal of freer animal movement on the island will be progressed when the new EU Animal Health law which is expected to be presented to Council and Parliament by the end of 2012, is adopted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">I also very much welcome the Northern Ireland proposal to establish a body with a similar remit to that of Animal Health Ireland.  There is clearly an all Ireland recognition of the potential to improve the competitiveness of the farming sector through tackling production diseases.  I am encouraged by the approach being adopted by the Northern Ireland body to BVD eradication, which creates the basis for a coordinated programme to eradicate BVD from the island of Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_2099">I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 128 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">The purpose of the changes announced to the 2012 Terms and Conditions of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is to achieve the required savings, prompted by the budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme being reduced to from €220 million to €190 million.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that advance notification of such proposed changes would be self-defeating.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">However, In order to make these savings, it is proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria, rather than simply apply an across-the-board cut, by reducing the maximum payable area, or reducing the rates of aid payable, or both. Choosing to opt for the technical adjustments ensures that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2102">To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2103">To maintain the countryside;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2104">To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2105">Rather than simply apply an across- the-board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area as a means to achieving these savings, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme, namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2106">While changes are being introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision is being made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to an agri-environmental measure, such as a Commonage Framework De-stocking Plans, Rural Environmental Protection Schemes (REPS) or Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).</p>
            <p eId="para_2107">All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.  The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.</p>

        <b> Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</b>
         asked the

         if the cost benefit analysis report on the closure of the Kinsealy Teagasc facility, County Dublin is to hand yet; and when he intends to publish the document and report on it to Dáil Éireann.

            <p eId="para_2122">As I have stated in previous replies on this matter, the decision to close Kinsealy Research Centre is an operational matter for Teagasc.  They are responsible for the day to day running of the organisation including decisions relating to the network of offices. Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act establishing Teagasc and the Minister does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of Teagasc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">I understand Teagasc has prepared a detailed Business Case on the rationale for closing Kinsealy and transferring staff and activities to Ashtown Research Centre.  They are satisfied that the move will give rise to significant annual cost savings with an expected payback arising from relocation savings over a 7 year period.  The Deputy may wish to contact Teagasc directly for further information.</p>

            <p eId="para_2125">My Department has received about 270 applications for consideration under this year's New Entrants to Dairying Scheme.  The applications, which have been examined in my Department for eligibility, are currently being distributed to the members of the Assessment Panel for consideration. The Panel hope to be in a position to recommend a list of suitable applicants by mid August.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">While the Detailed Rules of the Scheme provided for the possibility of a meeting with the Panel it is not availed of, nor has the Panel visited any farm lands for reasons of practicability and to avoid significant delays in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2127">Applicants are required to submit detailed Business Plans and the Panel has a substantial volume of detailed documentation with which to base a decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_3896">There is good support from my colleagues in the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers for the Common Agricultural Policy and recognition of the importance of EU agriculture in the   context of Europe's economic and industrial recovery. This importance was acknowledged in the conclusions by the Heads of State and Government at the spring 2010 European Council and continues to be accepted by my Ministerial colleagues at each successive meeting of the Agriculture Council.  Proof of that commitment can be found in the fact that the CAP is 50 years old this year and it continues to be the only genuinely common policy in the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_3897">My own view is that food security in the European Union is the essence of what the new Common Agricultural Policy is about. Growing populations and increasing demand for protein-based foods, which is what we predominantly produce in Ireland through the dairy and meat industries, present a significant opportunity not only to continue, as the EU has been, to promote a sustainable way of producing food from an environmental and climate point of view but also to produce greater volumes of food.  I will continue to make the case for sustainable intensification of food production, which is what agriculture should be all about.</p>

            <p eId="para_3899">The Action Plan on Food Price Volatility and Agriculture adopted by the Ministers of Agriculture of the G20 in June 2011 underlined that to feed a world population expected to exceed 9.3 billion by 2050, agricultural production will have to increase between 50 and 70 percent, and by almost 100 percent in developing countries. The EU is a large food-producing bloc and must play its part in ensuring that there is sufficient food to feed not just its own citizens but the world.  For its part, Ireland has a strategy for food production in place, Food Harvest 2020, which outlines our plans for food production over the coming decade.  This industry developed report envisages a strategy of smart green growth.  The targets agreed by the industry include increasing output from the sector by 33%, increasing value-added by 40% and increasing exports to €12bn per annum.  There are also targets within each sector, including a proposed 50% increase in milk production.  I have also ensured that the targets are being monitored, and progress is tracked through the ‘Milestones for Success' reports that are being produced for that purpose.</p>

            <p eId="para_3904">I am of course in regular contact, both directly and through correspondence, with farming representative bodies, as are my officials, and I am aware of the challenges faced by farmers, including increased cost of inputs such as fuel, feed and fertiliser as well as access to credit.  Fuel and energy costs are a major part of overall costs for farmers.  One of the long-standing measures in place to assist them with these costs is the reduced cost of marked gas oil (also known as green diesel).  An additional relief in relation to carbon tax was also introduced as part of budget 2012, reflecting the Programme for Government commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3905">Other costs are also affected by price volatility in a global marketplace.  While farmers received higher prices for their product in 2010 and 2011 than they did in 2009, they are also paying higher prices for inputs and their margins are being squeezed.  Teagasc research suggests that producer margins will fall in 2012 compared to 2011.  However, they also believe that the decline will not cause margins to go below those experienced in 2010, which overall was a good year for the agrifood sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3906">As higher input costs and price volatility are global issues they must be addressed at a global level.  That is why the G20 has developed a number of measures, such as the agricultural markets information system (AMIS), to limit speculation and improve the information available to farmers when they are making decisions about production.  In tandem with this, Ireland must continue its discussions with its EU partners to create a CAP that recognises the challenges faced by farmers.</p>

        <b> Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</b>

        <b>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</b>
         the extent to which food exports to the EU and worldwide have increased in each of the past five years to date; if particular issues have presented which might show a need for renewed efforts arising from emerging competition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3908">Ireland's food and beverage exports are outlined in the table below.  As you can see, both 2010 and 2011 were very good years for Irish agriculture.  However, 2009 was a particularly bad year and I am conscious that in a global marketplace there are many challenges can cause difficulties for Irish farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3909">In 2010 a detailed analysis of the agriculture sector led to the production of Food Harvest 2020, which is a strategy for the sector over the coming decade.  This ambitious plan envisages strong growth in the sector.  In particular it is expected that milk production will increase by 50%,but also that output from the sector should increase by 33% and the value of exports to should rise to €12bn per annum.  Disruption in global markets, such as the current economic crisis, trade embargoes or political unrest, can all adversely impact on our ability to export our produce.  However, the Irish agriculture and food sector has shown itself to be extraordinarily resilient and innovative in finding new markets, as was shown recently with the highly successful trade mission to China.  I am confident that we will deal with challenges as they arise and continue to export our high-quality produce all over the world.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_4006">The decision to abolish milk quotas with effect from 1st April 2015 was made in the context of the CAP Health Check in 2008.  Ireland strongly supported their abolition, on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the Irish dairy sector to respond positively to market opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4007">The ending of milk quota regime represents an exceptional opportunity to increase milk output, and the Food Harvest 2020 Report has targeted a 50% increase in milk production in the period to 2020.  This target is ambitious but I also believe it is realistic because the dairy sector has the capability to expand at producer and at processor level. The Dairy Expansion Activation Group, which was established to identify specific actions needed to deliver on the Food Harvest target, has produced a Road Map setting out 55 actions required to achieve the 50% increase in milk production.  All of the stakeholders are being encouraged to discharge the responsibilities assigned to them, and the response will be monitored and reported on.  Key areas for action include the identification of markets, the improvement of efficiency at processing level and improving production efficiency at farm level.  While many of these actions will be taken at commercial level, my Department and its agencies are working with industry to provide a framework to support the necessary development, and I am personally chairing the High Level Implementation Committee, in order to monitor progress and take appropriate action to support the successful implementation of Food Harvest 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_4008">More than 85% of Irish dairy production is exported, and the price of milk in Ireland is ultimately determined by global demand and supply. Last year exports   of dairy products were valued at €2.66 billion, an increase of 17% on the previous year.  Ireland currently has access to markets worldwide and exports dairy products to over eighty countries and I am working with industry to further raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa and elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_4009">Milk production volumes are, to a great extent, determined by market demand and by price considerations. While the dairy sector has experienced severe volatility in product prices in recent years, primarily caused by an imbalance of supply and demand in international markets, the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  Growth in global population is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  Against that background, I believe that prospects and opportunities for the dairy sector will expand significantly over the coming years and I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_4010">While the supply management arrangements that currently exist will no longer apply after 2015, I am confident that the processing industry will work with the milk producers to ensure a coherent and thriving dairy industry post quotas that will exploit the undoubted potential in existing and new markets, maximize efficiency at production and processing levels and respond effectively to market demand.</p>

            <p eId="para_4016">Beef labelling in particular is subject to comprehensive regulations concerning the identification of bovines and the labelling of their meat. These provisions were introduced in the wake of the BSE crisis to improve traceability and food security throughout the sector.

            <p eId="para_4020">The pig sector remains the third largest individual component of the agrifood sector, with production, prices and exports all growing significantly during 2011.  The industry faces a number of challenges in the short and medium term and my Department will continue to assist the sector to resolve these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_4021">New EU Animal Welfare rules set down new standards in relation to the housing of sows and these are due to come into force on 1 January 2013. A significant number of producers have undertaken the necessary work required in order to upgrade their facilities in order to comply with the new rules. Teagasc has estimated that approximately 36% of pig units, housing some 44% of the sow population are presently compliant with the provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4022">My Department is aware of the scale of the challenge facing pig farmers in respect of the new requirements. To this end, the Department introduced a Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for Sow Welfare in June 2010. Grant-aid is available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of €300,000, i.e. a maximum grant of €120,000. A total of €13 million has been provisionally allocated to this scheme under the rural development Programme. It follows two earlier schemes in 2005 and 2007 and payments of €6.2 million have already been made under these schemes. At present, approximately 47 applications for grants worth some €4 million have been received under the current scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4023">My Department has written to all pig producers to remind them of the new requirements, and is monitoring the situation closely.</p>

            <p eId="para_4025">The levels of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and quotas for each fish stock each year are determined at the December Council of Fisheries Ministers.  The Council makes decisions based on scientific advice from ICES (the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas), and also on the views of the STECF (the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries), which gives the Commission its views on the economic and social impacts of the scientific advice. The decisions made annually take account of the available scientific advice and the results of various external international fisheries negotiations and cannot be predicted in advance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4026">Both Food Harvest 2020 and Action Plan for Jobs 2012 recognise that most of the growth and employment potential in the seafood sector is in the areas of processing and aquaculture.  Food Harvest 2020 aims to increase employment in the seafood sector as a whole, from 11,000 to 14,000 by 2020 and to increase revenue from €700 million to €1 billion by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_4027">On 25 May I announced €3.2 million in grants to 21 seafood processing companies to support investments worth €15.5 million in 2012.  These investments are projected to generate over 142 additional jobs and increased sales of value added seafood products of nearly €44 million by 2015.  These plans add to investment worth €7 million by 21 companies in 2011 and further investment worth €2.7 by 8 companies in 2010.  Together these forward looking developments are setting a clear path to achievement of the value adding potential of the seafood sector, as identified in Food Harvest 2020 and Action Plan for Jobs 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4028">The aquaculture sector is crucially important in achieving our value adding targets for the seafood processing sector as it has the potential to significantly increase raw material supply, independent of the annual TAC and quota negotiations and to provide significant direct and indirect employment in peripheral coastal communities.  To achieve that potential, BIM is promoting the development of 3 deep sea salmon farms.  It is expected that each farm will be capable of producing up to 15,000 tonnes of Irish organic farmed salmon annually, valued at €102 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_4030">Cattle prices are determined by supply and demand dynamics in the marketplace. The deadweight price for the benchmark (R3) steer category at start of June was €4.01/kg (excl. VAT) compared to €3.52/kg for the same period in 2011. The average steer price so far this year is 18.5% higher than last year. This trend reflects low supply availability as evidenced by reduced cattle throughput at Department-approved meat plants. Although more recent figures on calf registrations in 2011 show a likely reversal in this trend in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_4031">The export dependence of the Irish beef industry means that external market developments largely determine Irish cattle prices. At present, trade for prime beef is being boosted by ongoing tight supplies in both domestic and key export markets. Strong export demand is also generated by favourable exchange rate movement between sterling and the euro which continues to underpin the competitiveness of Irish beef exports. Currency movements have made it more attractive for Irish beef processors to ship product to our main export market.</p>
            <p eId="para_4032">Beef prices are currently performing strongly in the UK where producers are receiving the equivalent of €4.23/kg (dw excl. VAT), on average, for R3 prime males whereas the average of the EU-15 beef producing countries is €3.80/kg. Tight domestic supplies to date in 2012 (UK cattle throughput is down 8%) and lower availability in Ireland have contributed to a 23% price increase (in euro terms) over the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_4033">In its latest short-term outlook for the beef sector published in February 2012, the European Commission is forecasting that overall beef and veal consumption in the EU will fall over the next 2 years owing to supply constraints and high prices. An ongoing decline in the size of the EU beef herd over the past 4 years is expected to persist in the short run. Carcass prices for all categories of cattle and live animals are expected to remain high throughout 2012 as a result of limited supply availability and competition for earlier marketed cattle to offset high feeding costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4034">Current price levels in the Irish beef sector must be understood in the context of the economic variables outlined above. High weanling prices over the last 2 years have helped to stabilise the national herd and have encouraged producers to expand their herds. As with any product, however, prices can fluctuate for a range of reasons. The current high prices have injected confidence into the beef sector and allowed farmers to reinvest in the businesses. The prospects for the remainder of the year appear positive to the extent that supply constraints would indicate a relatively stable price outlook but the demand side in the EU remains particularly uncertain given the fragile macroeconomic environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4036">The market performance of the sheep and pork sectors, in common with other agricultural sectors, is a function of supply and demand. The long-term future of the sectors will depend on their ability to satisfy the market and in order to do this well, they must focus on competitiveness, innovation and the demands of the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4037">
              <i>Sheep sector</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_4038">Food Harvest 2020 sets a target of 20% increase in output value for the sheep sector by 2010 and envisages that over the coming years, demand for sheepmeat on the European market will outstrip production levels which should provide opportunities for exporting countries such as Ireland. This should provide the potential for better returns, provided the industry can continue the market and product diversification which has been evident in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4039">The recommendations of the report focus on farm competitiveness and the processing sector. On the farm side, they emphasise the importance of the continuance of the application of on-farm labour efficiencies and new technologies, breed improvement and the production of a quality product. On the processing side, the focus is on efficiencies, innovation and improved product range.</p>
            <p eId="para_4040">There has been significant public investment in the sheep sector in recent years. Key supports for this sector include €7 million from the 2009 Single Farm Payment National Reserve under the Uplands Sheep Payment Scheme and €54 million for the three-year Grassland Sheep Scheme which commenced in 2010. The grassland Sheep Scheme is proving to be a valuable support mechanism in terms of improving income and confidence in the sector. The sheep fencing/mobile handling equipment scheme, which is one of five Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS) was re-opened to applications last December and the first tranche closed in February of this year. In addition Teagasc has allocated almost €1.5 million for sheep research for 2012. Bord Bia will also spend over €1.1 million this year on a promotional strategy for the Irish sheep sector. All of the supports have provided a significant incentive to farmers to maintain their production levels, which is vital for the future of a viable sheep industry in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4041">In light of the fall in producer prices during the month of May and following consultation with the industry, Bord Bia brought forward its summer lamb promotion campaign to commence on the 5th June. Furthermore Bord Bia has strengthened the TV advertising element of the campaign, by extending its duration from 3 to 4 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_4042">I very much welcome the fact that the declining trend in numbers in our national flock is showing signs of reversal and our sheep numbers are now increasing. This reflects a growing sense of confidence amongst sheep farmers in terms of rebuilding breeding stock numbers which will ultimately lead to an increase in through-put. Whilst it is still too early to provide an accurate estimate for the 2012 lamb crop, it is estimated that it will be up in the order of 1-2%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4043">
              <i>Pig Sector</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_4044">The pig sector remains the third largest individual component of the agrifood sector with production, prices and exports all growing significantly during 2011. Ireland is more than 150% self-sufficient in pigmeat with the result that export values reached almost €400 million last year, an increase in value of 18% compared to 2010. Export volumes of Irish pigmeat totalled 168,000 tonnes in 2011, some 14% higher than the previous year. Finished pig supplies at export meat plants stood at almost 2.85 million head for the year, almost 10% higher than 2010, reflecting an 8% rise in the breeding herd combined with improved on-farm productivity. The industry supports over 7,000 jobs in farming, milling, processing and ancillary services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4045">From a National perspective, the Food Harvest 2020 Report targets a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020 and factors such as improvements in sow productivity and growing the size of the national herd will help to meet this target.  Through the TAMS scheme, my Department is providing critical investment support for operators to assist them in meeting new sow welfare standards from 1st January 2013.  In addition, Teagasc, through its Moorepark pig research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4046">Pigmeat remains the most consumed meat worldwide and I consider that the substantial trade surplus in pigmeat in Ireland and the measures being taken to improve efficiency and market access leave us well placed to avail of developing opportunities in international markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_4047">In so far as international trade in Irish pigmeat is concerned, my Department has been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4048">And of course Bord Bia continues, through its promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_4049">Prices during 2012 have been above the corresponding levels in both of the previous years. At the end of last month, prices were almost 9/c per kilo ahead year on year, which equates to an increase of more than 6%.</p>

            <p eId="para_4051">With effect from 1 November 2010, inter-country adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Hague Adoption Convention) or with countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  Kazakhstan has ratified the Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_4052">Over the past 18 months the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) has written to its counterpart Central Authority in Kazakhstan on three separate occasions to begin the process of developing an administrative agreement for intercountry adoption. The Authority advises me that to date there has been no reply from the Kazakhstani authorities to any of the contacts made by the AAI.  The Authority continues to indicate that it is open to discussing the issue of intercountry adoptions with its Kazakhstani counterparts at any time, and the most recent correspondence from the AAI was in March of this year. I understand that an official of the Irish Embassy in Moscow recently presented a copy of the previous correspondence to, and raised the issue of intercountry adoption with, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kazakhstan.  I understand the Kazakhstani authorities hosted a meeting on intercountry adoption on the 11th of May. I would like to point out that at no stage were the AAI, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Embassy contacted by the Kazakhstani authorities regarding the meeting. While it is, of course, a matter for each country to decide with whom it co-operates, as soon as the issue came to the attention of my Department, official contact was made with the Embassy in Moscow in this regard. The Embassy officials in Moscow are endeavouring to secure feedback from this meeting to assess its relevance for progress towards an administrative agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and Kazakhstan.</p>
            <p eId="para_4053">The Embassy has been asked to request information from the relevant authorities on the position for Irish couples hoping to adopt from Kazakhstan as soon as possible.  In the interim the AAI is currently completing a review of Kazakhstan's adoption legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_4065">Adoptions from Russia, effected  under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined,  and  recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2013.  As regards adoptions thereafter, Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  Therefore, future adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bilateral agreement.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "<i>the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.”  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention. </p>
            <p eId="para_4066">A delegation comprised of representatives of the Adoption Authority and officials from my Department held exploratory meetings with the Russian authorities in December of last year. The delegation visited Russia in relation to preliminary discussions around the potential for a bilateral on intercountry adoption.  This was a follow up to previous discussions which took place earlier in the year, on the initiative of the Russian authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4067">It is the role of the Adoption Authority to make an assessment of whether the intercountry adoption legislation and practices in a non-contracting state, in this case Russia, are in compliance with both Irish legislation and the principles of the Hague Convention. As part of this assessment the Adoption Authority has reviewed the draft bilateral agreement presented and has provided me with an initial assessment in this regard. As a result of this, the issues which may require further exploration with the Russian authorities are being considered. It is my intention to have any outstanding matters clarified as soon as possible and my Department will contact the Authority in this regard shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_4069">The Forum on Fluoridation advised in 2002 that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  The Expert Body advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups. I have no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4070">In 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published an opinion on the tolerable upper intake for fluoride from the diet. This concluded that the safe upper limit for fluoride intake from all food sources, including water, for adults is 120µg per kilogram of body weight per day.</p>
            <p eId="para_4071">A study by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), the Total Diet Study (TDS) published in 2011, shows that the average exposure of Irish consumers to fluoride from food is 9µg per kilogram of body weight per day. This represents 7.5% of the safe upper limit of 120µg per kilogram of body weight per day.  If exposure to fluoride from drinking water is included it represents 23.9% of this value on average. The FSAI aims to start the second Irish TDS  later this year. This will also include an analysis of fluoride in food.</p>

            <p eId="para_4073">The development of a National Carers Strategy to support carers and to address issues of concern is a key commitment in the current Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_4074">The Strategy will address the needs of informal and family carers. It will be conceptual and visionary and will establish a number of high-level principles, goals and objectives and a road map to implementation.   The State already faces challenges in maintaining existing levels of services from within limited resources and the Strategy is being developed in that context. The Strategy will not be an operational plan but will set the strategic direction for future services and supports for carers in recognition of their role and contribution to maintaining children, adults and older people with physical or mental health difficulties in their own homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4075">While issues relating to carers span a number of different Departments, the Taoiseach has allocated responsibility for co-ordination of the preparation of the Strategy to me with the support of the Minister for Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_4076">Work on developing the Strategy is on-going and a consultation process with other Departments took place in early 2012. A draft was completed at the end of March as a basis for final consultations with other Departments and with national organisations representing carers. Carers organisations made formal observations at the end of May.  It is hoped that a draft will be completed for submission to Government during the Summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_4100">The establishment of hospital trusts is an important stepping stone towards the introduction of universal health insurance which is the ultimate destination of the Government's reform programme.  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive the optimum service reforms. Performance improvement must be at the heart of the national reform programme: the creation of hospital groups and trusts is integral to a stronger and more systematic process of performance management for hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_4101">Earlier this week, I announced the appointment of Professor John R Higgins to work with the Special Delivery Unit (SDU)   in the role of Chair of a Strategic Board to assist the Department of Health in the design and establishment of Hospital Groups. As Chair, he will have a key role in progressing the creation of Hospital Groups initially and, ultimately, Independent Hospital Trusts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4102">I have also announced the appointments of Mr Noel Daly as Chair-designate of the Galway Roscommon University Hospital Group and Professor Niall O'Higgins as Chair-designate of the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Group. The term of the appointments is for three years and the boards of the groups will be established initially on a non-statutory basis.  I intend that the Chairs will be remunerated subject to the normal conditions.<b/>  The two new hospital group Chairmen, working in consultation with the Chair of the Strategic Board, will have key roles in the development of effective corporate and clinical governance structures for their hospital groups along with the quality and safety of systems of care in place for patients of those hospital groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_4113">The Health Sector is facing very significant financial challenges in 2012 and 2013. The HSE's National Service Plan was prepared in the context of the challenges faced by the health services this year in terms of reduced staffing levels, and a reduced budget, combined with increasing demand for services. It also took account of additional funding being invested this year in areas such as mental health services, primary care, the National Clinical Care Programmes and children's services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4114">The budget reductions, along with the structural changes being implemented are posing a serious financial challenge to the HSE, and the Executive is reporting a deficit in Vote terms of €169m at the end of May. Based on the current rate of drawdown on the Vote it is projected that there will be a deficit of €450-500m in 2012.   As set out in the National Service Plan, the HSE will seek to reduce and eliminate budget deficits while minimising the impact on front line services by fast tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reducing resources.  New models of care will be introduced across all services, which will treat patients   at the lowest level of complexity and provide quality services at the least possible cost.  The roll-out of the National Clinical Care Programmes and Special Delivery Unit initiatives will also deliver greater productivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_4115">The HSE has set out a number of further measures to address the emerging financial situation. These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_4116">Requiring hospitals to bring activity levels back in line with targets set out in the National Service Plan;</p>
            <p eId="para_4117">Reducing use of agency staff; and</p>
            <p eId="para_4118">Implementing reforms under the Croke Park agreement to achieve more cost effective use of human resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4119">The Board of the Executive has been provided with a range of cost containment plans which have been submitted to the Department. Following my Department's assessment of the plans, I intend to bring proposals on the matter to Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_4120">An independent financial expert has also been appointed to carry out a review of the HSEs financial performance management and control systems and it is intended that he will report back to the Secretary General of the Department by the end of June.</p>

            <p eId="para_4128">Section 11 of the General Medical Services (GMS) GP Capitation Contract, which was introduced in 1989, provides that the medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the Health Service Executive, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.</p>
            <p eId="para_4129">General Practitioners (GPs) who hold General Medical Services (GMS) contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders for services covered under the GMS contract.

            <p eId="para_4132">the GP may not charge the patient if they are eligible for free GMS services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4133">At my request, the HSE has written to all GMS GPs reminding them of their obligations under their contract in respect of services such as phlebotomy and advised them that charges should not be applied for such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4134">The HSE is encouraging eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services to seek a refund from the GP in question.  Alternatively, they may wish to follow up with the HSE and the matter will be fully investigated.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE's Consumer Affairs Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4135">It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_4136">The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to phlebotomy services and other such services will be considered as part of the new contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_4138">The most recent data on total expenditure on health in Ireland, which includes both public and private, refers to 2010 and is compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  This indicates total expenditure of €14,334 million of which €9,964 million relates to public expenditure and €4,370 million to private expenditure.  The latter figure includes expenditure on private health insurance (€1,817 million) and out-of pocket expenses (€2,489 million).  Further breakdown on types of private health expenditure are not routinely available from the CSO.</p>
            <p eId="para_4139">In the interpretation of these figures it should be noted that the OECD data differs from the Revised Estimates figures for funding of the health group of Votes. e principal reason for this is that, to enable international comparability, the OECD excludes spending on a range of matters such as personal social services.  It includes a much smaller amount related to spending by the Department of Social Protection on medical benefits.  The Revised Estimates for the Public Services show expenditure for the health group of Votes in 2010 of €15,178 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_4211">The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of the taxi industry under the Taxi Regulation Act, 2003 and is also the lead agency with responsibility for implementation of the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_4212">I understand from the NTA that work is progressing on all 46 Actions proposed and eight of the short-term actions have been implemented to date. Delivery of the actions concerning the enhanced level of information and data exchange between the NTA, the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners has been completed. In addition, the collaboration between the Garda Síochána and the NTA has been strengthened towards more effective ‘on-street' and a greater level of ‘off-street' compliance and enforcement as proposed under action 24 of the Review Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_4213">The timetable for implementation of the remaining actions is set out in the Review Report with short-term actions to be implemented this year and medium-term actions to be implemented after 2012. The NTA makes quarterly reports on progress to the Taxi Advisory Committee which includes representation from the key stakeholder groups including representatives of consumer interests and the taxi industry.</p>

         if he will consider asking the Chartered Institute of Logistics in Transport which administers the transport management CPC governing the educational requirement for those wishing to become transport managers to address the lack of course providers based in Sligo and the fact that there was no course provided there in the past two years (details supplied).

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Leo Varadkar)</from>
            <p eId="para_4222">I am informed by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, which is responsible for overseeing the Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) course and examination, that demand for the CPC has fallen by 67% since 2005. The number sitting exams in the country in 2011 was 402, and in 2010 was 517, spread over three exam sessions per year.  Demand per region is therefore quite low — in Sligo in particular, there were 7 candidates in total for the examination in 2010 and 4 candidates in 2011. Despite the low numbers, I understand these candidates had their courses provided in Sligo, at times which suited them. This year to date there are no candidates in Sligo for the CPC examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_4223">Given the relatively low numbers of candidates generally, it is not possible for every town to have its own resident course provider. The current service for Sligo is provided by a person based in Galway, and I understand that the Institute is satisfied that the CPC course service currently provided for the Sligo region is suitable to meet the demand there.</p>
