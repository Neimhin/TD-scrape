[27413/14]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_1">

            <p eId="para_2">This will be the Minister's last health questions before the summer recess. It would be appropriate for him to outline in detail the precarious financial position in which the HSE finds itself again where we are talking about a potential budget deficit of over €500 million, the warnings by officials from the HSE, and the concerns and the impact of this on front-line delivery of services. The Minister might outline in detail the actions he intends to take to address this spiralling problem for the HSE and the provision of funding.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Health<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">There has been significant focus recently on the challenging resource constraints within which the HSE is operating. While the budgetary targets this year are particularly constrained, it is important to recognise that similar financial and resource constraints have applied in each of the past number of years as a direct consequence of the emergency financial situation the State has had to address since 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The cumulative impact of this unprecedented period of financial and resource restraint has resulted in reductions in the health service budget of the order of €3.3 billion, that is, over 20%, with the numbers employed reduced by over 14,000 in the same period. On a comparative basis the OECD report, Health at a Glance 2013, shows that recent reductions in public health expenditure <i>per capita</i> in Ireland are the highest experienced in any OECD country with the exception of Greece.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> These challenges come at a time when the demand for health services is increasing each year which, in turn, is driving costs upwards. However, despite these resource reductions and increasing service demands, the HSE has managed to support growing demand for its services arising from such factors as population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, increased demand for prescription drugs, and new cost intensive medical technologies and treatments. The HSE is to be commended on meeting these increased demands on its services.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> That said, 2014 is proving to be a particularly challenging year for the health services. Cumulative net expenditure to the end of March is €114 million lower than in the same period last year, but given the extent and the phasing of the targeted budget reductions, the cumulative deficit of €80 million is higher than last year's €27 million. The Vote for the HSE is reporting a net deficit of €158 million at the end of May.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> As the Deputy will be aware, the expenditure ceiling for the HSE is decided by Government, among other things, against a backdrop of national budgetary objectives and the prevailing macroeconomic conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_9">Very difficult decisions were taken by Government in the context of the overall budgetary arithmetic. Certain savings targets required of the HSE at the time of the budget were considered so challenging that it was agreed that a separate validation exercise to assess their achievability would be undertaken by the Departments of Health, Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Taoiseach. While work continues on the maximisation of the savings achievable under the Haddington Road agreement, the initial savings targets under medical card probity were reduced by €110 million in the context of the Revised Estimates Volume, REV. Along with pay savings targets, and taking account of the reliance on agency workers which is further compounded by the European working time directive, it is clear that the challenges facing the HSE in 2014 were extraordinary from the outset.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> There is ongoing and intensive engagement each month between officials of my Department, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, and the HSE in the context of regular monitoring of expenditure. The HSE is proactively engaged in internal efforts to maximise savings and cost containment plans and to ensure that additional measures are identified and safely implemented to mitigate any projected deficits which are within HSE direct control, while engaging on an ongoing basis with my Department. I assure the Deputy that the national director for acute hospitals has written to all hospital groups-hospitals setting out clear key messages around the need to reduce costs safely and to submit additional cost containment plans. Additionally, a full round of high level performance assurance meetings has been completed and another round is starting. The director general has met the board chairs, CEOs and clinical directors of the ten hospital groups-hospitals with the greatest financial challenges to ensure the messaging is explicit right up to board level in terms of the hierarchy of performance management priorities, that is, service safety and quality first, financial management next and then all other priorities, including elective access for non-clinically urgent cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> Work is ongoing between the HSE and my Department on finalising projections to year end based on data for the first four months of 2014, in tandem with assessment of performance in the same period and risk to year end within its cost containment plans. It would be premature for me to comment further at this stage, pending the outcome of this work, but as the HSE has indicated, the scale of the risk and challenge in achieving financial break-even by year end remains extremely significant as predicted in the national service plan 2014.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">Year on year, our difficulty is that we highlight time and again the inadequacies in terms of the Estimate that is brought to this House. The Government will be well aware of it as well. Even the language the Minister uses in terms of the HSE service plan, for example, in the context of unspecified savings, is an indication that he is grasping for or pretending that he has the funding to run the health services for the year ahead. That is what is happening year in, year out.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> The Minister states consistently that there has always been a Supplementary Estimate from the Department of Health to the HSE. That has been because of a change in policy, but everybody knows that one addresses the Estimate from a no-change policy perspective first and if there are changes in policy, one either adjusts the budget forward or up or down in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">As they say, one can avoid the facts but they will not avoid you. Deputy Kelleher alludes to 2008. Would he tell us what the Supplementary Estimate was in 2009? Would he like to tell us what it was in 2010? In his party's last year in government, it was nearly €600 million in health. Let us deal with the facts. In 14 of the past 17 years there have been Supplementary Estimates in health. For 12 of those 14 years, the budget was increasing, and was quadrupled, and still they failed to keep it within budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> At a time when we have had to take €3.3 billion out because of the mess the Government of which his party was a member left this country in, we have had to take serious decisions about how the health service is run. The good men and women who work in the health service have managed to achieve a reduction in the number of patients who have to lie on trolleys for long periods of time and a reduction in the number of patients who have to wait long periods for inpatient treatment and, for the first time ever, and have quantified the number of outpatients and treated 95% of them within a year. The health service is improving, despite the serious challenges that it has to face.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">We consistently get the history lesson but the Minister does not live in the real world when it comes to the budgetary estimate process. Year on year, as I stated, we face a situation where the Minister presents a flawed budget to the House. That has happened over the past three years. I see no reason this year's budget was presented in any different way because it includes unspecified savings of €108 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> In October last, the Minister went to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance to look for €1 billion extra and he walked out of the room with €666 million less.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">That is what happened last year. It is not that I have a difficulty with credibility. The issue is the Minister's credibility with his Cabinet colleagues in the delivery of sufficient funding to provide a budget that will sustain health services. That is what we are talking about. In terms of a history lesson of what happened in the past ten or 12 years, people want to know what is happening this year in the health service.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">We have made it very clear what is happening this year. We have a national service plan for the HSE, in regard to which patient safety is a clear priority. There are other things in it, including an expansion of the transplantation service. Last year was a very successful year one, with more transplants carried out than ever before. We have also put in place diabetic retinopathy screening and colon cancer screening services. Many good things have been done, as well as maintaining the services. If it had been all about money, as the Deputy seemed to think when his party was rolling in it, it would have been able to fix the health service. Instead of reforming it, it just continued to throw money at it. As we all know, the Deputy's party leader was the creator of the HSE, which has become an absolutely devalued brand and which the Government is committed to replacing.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">In order to address concerns about persistent underperformance which had arisen in a number of hospitals in Galway-Roscommon, a CEO was appointed to the Galway-Roscommon Hospitals Group which was subsequently extended to become the West-North West Hospital Group in January 2012 and Mr. Daly was appointed chair of the non-executive board on 29 May 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> My Department and the HSE first became aware that an issue had arisen in the commissioning of the review of maternity services on behalf of the West-North West Hospitals Group from a media query on 19 May 2014. The director general of the HSE informed my Department on that day that he had requested a team from the HSE's internal audit unit to conduct a report on the matter. In the course of its investigations the HSE internal audit team was assured by the CEO that he had made the decision to source D &amp; F Health Partnership based on its suitability for the project and that the chair had no role in this. The investigation found that while Mr. Daly had disclosed to the board that he was a former employee and former director of D &amp; F Health Partnership, he had failed to disclose that he continued to hold a 50% shareholding in the company. The investigation also established that the procurement of services had not been in accordance with HSE national financial regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> On 22 May the findings of the audit were presented to the director general of the HSE who informed my Department and wrote to both Mr. Daly and the CEO to make it clear that further breaches of procurement rules would be unacceptable and that Mr. Daly should have made it clear to board members that he retained a 50% shareholding in the company concerned. The letter to the chair of the board also requested that the chair take immediate steps to ensure a register of members' interests was established and maintained at the hospital group in order that potential conflicts of interest would be avoided. It is important that anyone serving on the board of a public body make a full disclosure of his or her interests in order that potential conflicts of interest can be avoided. Mr. Daly did not want his reputation or that of the West-North West Hospitals Group to be compromised. I shared these concerns and accepted Mr. Daly's resignation.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">I have a number of questions. Did the Minister know Mr. Daly personally and, if so, for how long? Did he know in June 2012 when he appointed Mr. Daly to the position of chairperson of the West-North West Hospitals Group that he had been the founder, director and joint owner of D &amp; F Health Partnership, with a 50% stake in it? If he did know, why did he appoint him? If he did not know, does he agree that it begs the question of the basis on which he is appointing people to these positions if he does not know the very basic facts about them. He has indicated that Mr. Daly did not bring his position to the attention of the board. Did he not bring to the Minister's attention his other interests? Did Mr. Daly not see a conflict of interest? Does the Minister recall when appointing the new boards to the hospitals groups that he cited the need for an assessment of potential conflicts of interest of potential board members? Does he accept that there was a clear conflict of interest in this appointment?</p>

            <p eId="para_37">The last question is astonishing in some respects. Is the Deputy suggesting anybody with business interests is not fit to be chair of a board? I do not accept this. It may be the Sinn Féin way and the Sinn Féin's Ireland of the future, but it certainly is not the Government's view that people involved in private enterprise, with a tremendous skills set in terms of organisational and leadership skills, should be excluded from membership or becoming chairs of boards. I reject this out of hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> The Deputy asked me if I had known Mr. Daly before I appointed him. I did not know him and do not believe I had ever met him before then. Perhaps I had met him, but I certainly did not know him or of him. However, I was told about his curriculum vitae and the fact that he had been a great servant of County Roscommon, having been an excellent footballer who had represented his county, and had knowledge of the health service and that he would be an ideal candidate to be chair of a board. I was particularly taken by the idea that, being from County Roscommon, we would send a very clear message that the hospital groups would be representative of the hospitals in the entire group, not just the large university hospital at the centre of them. </p>
            <p eId="para_39"> I regret that Mr. Daly did not declare his shareholding in the company. I think he was concerned about his reputation being damaged and that of the group and that is why he stood down and I accepted his resignation.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">Does the Minister accept that his reputation is somewhat in question as a result of this appointment? Make no mistake about it, his effort to digress in regard to Sinn Féin's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> appointments is the nonsense he usually employs. What is the status of the HSE's internal investigation? What was the nature of the breach of the HSE's national financial regulations in the award of the tender to D &amp; F Health Partnership, as the Minister understands it? Will he confirm that Mr. Daly's D &amp; F Health Partnership was paid €20,000, plus VAT, for its report? What is the status of the report prepared by D &amp; F Health Partnership which recommended cuts to vital maternity services at Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe and Letterkenny General Hospital? Does the Minister recognise, despite his blustering comments, that, in this instance, there most certainly was a breach, a conflict of interest and a failure on his part and that of Mr. Daly and the system, if the Minister is dependent on others to advise and inform him properly and adequately before approving said appointments?</p>

            <p eId="para_41">Bluster and nonsense are more particular to the Deputy and his style, but I have made it very clear what happened, that Mr. Daly stood down and that I regret the fact that he did not disclose his shareholding to the board. The Deputy asked me a range of specific questions which I am not in a position to answer, but if he writes to me for further details, I will have no issue with giving him the full details of the procurement issue. Normally, in the procurement of smaller contracts of the nature we are talking about three tenders are required, but it is my understanding three tenders were not received, which is why the CEO of the hospital received the rebuke he did from the head of the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">Persons suffering from prescribed conditions can get free drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for the treatment of the conditions under the long-term illness scheme. Medical card holders are required to pay prescription charges. Prescription charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the long-term illness scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> In the case of persons who have both a medical card and an LTI book, it was HSE policy that they should use their medical card to access medicines. The main reason for this was that when a retail mark-up of 20% was payable to pharmacists for items supplied under the long-term illness scheme, it cost the HSE considerably more to supply medicines under that scheme than under the GMS scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> Following a review of the rates of fees payable to health professionals - under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 - my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, announced on 2 July 2013 the elimination of the retail mark-up. As a result, the HSE revised its policy on this matter and persons who have both a medical card and an LTI book can now access medication for their qualifying long-term illness condition or conditions under the long-term illness scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> The HSE is actively involved in the process of identifying any person who had eligibility under the long-term illness scheme and who, while having concurrent eligibility under the medical card scheme, paid prescription charges prior to 1 December 2013 for drugs, medicines, medical and surgical appliances related to their qualifying long-term illness or illnesses dispensed under the GMS scheme by a registered pharmacist. It is collating the details of the numbers affected and how much they will be refunded. It is anticipated that it will be in a position to make refunds to the relevant individuals in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">As this matter has been ongoing for a number of months, it seems strange that, even at this stage, we cannot obtain information from the HSE on how many people are affected. I have correspondence from the Minister going back to May in which he stated the process had started, yet we still do not have figures for how many are affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> There is also confusion about the timeframe for reimbursement. The Minister of State has mentioned that it will cover the period July to December 2013 but earlier in his statement he said it was HSE policy that people should obtain items using their medical card all of the time. Since prescription charges were introduced for medical card patients, those on the long-term illness scheme who were entitled to free care have also had to pay prescription charges, according to the Minister of State's response. The reimbursement period should pre-date July 2013 because people on the long-term illness scheme have been paying charges for a long time. The HSE should tell us how many are affected. It should also ensure they are reimbursed straightaway.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">The HSE has undertaken to expedite this matter as quickly as possible. As I indicated, it is hoped and anticipated that this will be done in the coming weeks. That is the position and, as the Deputy rightly said, it is related to the fact that people were paying GMS prescription charges they would not have had to pay if they had been able to use the LTI scheme book. The issue has been ironed out and, as I mentioned, the HSE is collating details of the numbers affected. I do not have to hand the exact number affected, but the Deputy and the House can be assured that anyone who is affected will be able to avail of refunds which will be made within the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">The Mental Health Act 2001 was introduced by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Micheál Martin, and marked a significant improvement in mental health care. I have tabled this question to establish why we are experiencing a delay in publishing the expert group's report on the Act. I am concerned that this is impeding human rights as set out in the philosophy of that legislation. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has explained that the report was delayed for a range of reasons, including the fact that the Assisted Decison-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 had not been published. In January she indicated that the review would be concluded in a number of months. When can we expect to have a realistic timeframe for the conclusion of the process and publication of the expert group's review?</p>

            <p eId="para_60">The expert group set up to review the Mental Health Act 2001 first met in September 2012 and was originally due to report in 2013. When it began its work, I made it clear to its members that they should take an open and expansive approach and consider all issues which they might consider were relevant and necessary for a thorough review, having regard to the terms of reference for the review. The interim review of the Act, published in June 2012, was, therefore, a starting point for a much more detailed analysis of the issues involved. In line with this approach, the group requested additional time to consider the implications for mental health legislation of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill which was published in July 2013. An extension of its timeframe was, accordingly, agreed to. </p>
            <p eId="para_61"> The Deputy will also be aware that the review takes account of the fact that the Mental Health Act 2001, despite what he has said, predated publication of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007. The convention provides for a rights-based approach to disability and certain of its articles have implications for our mental health legislation. In this context, the need to achieve a balance between individual human rights and the requirements for public safety have given rise to detailed discussion and analysis by the expert group.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> The Mental Health Act 2001 was introduced on a phased basis and fully enacted by 2006. It would not be usual to have a formal comprehensive review of legislation that has only been fully operational for less than a decade. The 2001 Act was fully consistent with prevailing approaches to rights at the time and continues to underpin a modern approach to regulation of mental health services in Ireland. I am satisfied that the extended timeframe which was necessary for the current review is not impacting on human rights issues within the mental health system. I expect to receive the expert group's final report by the third quarter of 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">Last week the Minister of State indicated that the review would be ready by the third quarter, yet we are experiencing delays in this process. I do not see urgency being demonstrated by the Minister of State in dealing what continue to be significant human rights issues within the mental health system. Last year 80 children were in adult wards in psychiatric units across the country. This is a significant human rights issue. One must look at what has happened in Carlow and Kilkenny concerning the loss of life and human rights. I am asking the Minister of State to pay special attention to this matter and accelerate publication of the expert group's review of the Mental Health Act 2001. In April the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said it was only a matter of weeks before the review would be published. Why are we experiencing significant delays? I ask the Minister of State to provide absolute clarity in order to ensure we can protect those who are most vulnerable. I am appealing to her to put in place the best form of legislative base to enshrine a human rights philosophy to protect the most vulnerable.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">That is the very reason for the delay, but the Deputy does not seem to understand this, nor does he understand we already have a Mental Health Act in place which, as he keeps telling us, his beloved leader published. It continues to provide the governance process by which mental health services are run. We have delayed publication of the review because we want to get it right. Unlike the 2001 Act, we want to ensure there will be comprehensive and rights-based legislation in place. That Act was appropriate for its time, but it is not appropriate anymore. I do not intend to rush this process because in dealing with very vulnerable people, and the people who care for them for whom we also have to care, we need to get this right rather than do it quickly.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I am delighted to hear that the Minister of State is concerned about the front-line staff who care for vulnerable people. She did not bother at all to respond to the front-line staff in Carlow for a significant reference period when they sent correspondence to her. She did not seem to take much action with respect to dealing or engaging with front-line staff. We have pointed out this issue consistently in this Chamber - the Minister of State fails to engage and fails to listen. She chooses whom she wants to listen to because they tell her what she wants to hear.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> In particular administrative areas, including Galway, north County Dublin, and Carlow and Kilkenny, she is listening to the wrong people and it is having devastating consequences. Rather than bat them over the head with A Vision for Change policy when people speak out or demonstrate some dissent about her approach, she should sit down and engage with the front-line staff - she may learn something.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">I met the same front-line staff on numerous occasions. When I met them first they told me they did not want the unit in Clonmel to close and they have not changed that position. Front-line staff in this instance, as the Deputy will know, are nine people out of 638. The rest of them are happily working and tell me that they are doing a very good job and that the new approach is the right one. Certain people are opposed and resistant to change, but I keep telling them that at the end of the day there is not an option. We are not stopping. A Vision for Change is the policy of this Government and was the policy of the Deputy's beloved leader and the previous Government. However, Deputy Keaveney may not know that; he is not in Fianna Fáil that long. This is where we are going. People have to get on board and be responsible, and they have to care for the people they are charged with caring for.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alex White<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_72">The long-term illness, LTI, scheme was established under section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970. Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI scheme. The conditions covered by the LTI scheme are as follows: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness in a person under 16; cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; Parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered under the LTI scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> My Department is currently reviewing the operation of the LTI scheme. It is expected that this review will be completed later this year. However, there are no plans to review the scheme along the lines of the current work of the expert panel recently established by the HSE to review eligibility for medical cards. </p>
            <p eId="para_74"> Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family pays more than €144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. Of course, the introduction of that scheme post-dates the LTI scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE may take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP-visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">I think there is a need to extend the scheme. There are a number of conditions, including Crohn's disease and colitis where people have lifelong conditions involving ongoing medical costs. It is strange to see the HSE recommending that people should apply for a discretionary medical card given the fiasco of the past couple of years with discretionary medical cards. The long-term illness scheme would provide relief for those many people. There are also people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease who have ongoing costs that could be covered by the scheme if the scheme was brought up to date and modernised. It would be of great benefit to those people. Rather than having to put them through the process of being means-tested through the medical card system, their conditions could be looked at and the benefit from the scheme could come from there. It should be reviewed and the list of conditions should be increased.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">The very real situation faced by people, mentioned by the Deputy, who have a long-term illness or medical condition and are above the means-test limit for a medical card, will be addressed in the new policy shift signalled by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Government last week, which is based on a review by an expert panel, and a paper and decisions in Government later this year. This will address the very real issue, on which I agree with the Deputy, faced by people who, although they are above means-test limit for a medical card, have a continuing medical condition requiring access to services. That is precisely what we are doing in respect of the decision the Government has made. The Government will certainly revert to the Oireachtas in due course as to how that will be addressed. I suggest to the Deputy that will cover in large measure the issue he is raising. Rather than adding new illnesses to the LTI scheme - nothing has been added to that since 1975 - let us now look to what the Government has determined which is to see how best to incorporate into the GMS persons who although they are above the income limits, perhaps in some cases substantially above the income limits and in many cases not so much above the income limits, but still have a medical condition or illness which is a problem for them. That is the real difficulty we have been struggling with in recent months and the Government made clear decisions last week on a policy shift there.</p>

Will it look at the medical need of a person rather than having a prescribed list of conditions?</p>

As I understand it - I do not want to mislead the House - I believe the terms of reference are currently being determined for the expert panel. Perhaps we will be in a position to report back to the House in due course as to the precise terms of reference. I think I am right about that. It is an important piece of work for the expert panel to address and it will do that. There is an undertaking that work will be completed by September.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">As the Deputy is aware, three reviews of the national ambulance service are currently under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> The national ambulance service has commissioned a national capacity review to determine the level and use of resourcing required for a safe and effective service. This independent review is being undertaken by the UK Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, an organisation with considerable international experience in operational and strategic reviews of this kind.</p>
            <p eId="para_84"> In the context of the development of the single national control and dispatch system, a review of the Dublin Fire Brigade emergency ambulance service is also under way. This review was commissioned by the Dublin city manager and the HSE’s chief operating officer, and is considering all aspects of Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance operations, including the capacity and capability of current ambulance services. The review will inform consideration of the best model for provision of emergency medical services in the greater Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> HIQA is undertaking a scheduled review of the national ambulance service, examining the governance arrangements for pre-hospital emergency care services, to ensure the timely assessment, diagnosis, initial management and transport of acutely ill patients to appropriate health-care facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> The three reviews are being conducted in parallel, in a concerted effort to examine our pre-hospital emergency care services throughout the country, with a view to identifying the best way to enable them to meet the challenges of the future. I am confident the recommendations will guide us in the provision of a modern, forward-looking service, capable of delivering the best possible outcomes for the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">I note from the Minister's reply that one of the reviews under way is addressing the capacity of the current service. Without questioning the industry of the people entrusted to deliver the review, I must ask whether they are looking honestly at the capacity of the ambulance service to deliver on a day-to-day basis. Does the Minister agree with the National Ambulance Service Representative Association's statement that targets are not being met because of a shortage of personnel, infrastructure, including an ambulance fleet, and funding? Has he, independent of the reviews, brought to an end the scandal of the misuse of rapid response vehicles as personal cars for managers, an issue that was highlighted some time past? Has he undertaken a comparison between the provision for the ambulance service in the State and the experience north of the Border and in Scotland, statistics for which I have cited to him on the floor of the House? Will he seek to establish a truly national ambulance service that would initially encompass cross-Border co-operation and ultimately provide for integration under an all-island ambulance authority?</p>

            <p eId="para_88">The use of response cars by ambulance service officers is making a real difference in improving response times for patients. Between 1 January and 1 April this year, officer vehicles responded to more than 630 incidents, over 250 outside working hours. On average, the cars responded to seven incidents a day, almost three of which occurred outside working hours. The vehicles can be tracked by control centres. For example, an officer working in Wexford but with a vehicle in Limerick after hours is available to respond to incidents in Limerick for that period. The response cars are a valuable additional response resource and the officers provide an emergency service in their communities outside normal working hours. They are not paid an on-call allowance and respond to these calls <i>pro bono</i>. Officers using the cars also attend and manage complex incident scenes such as multiple-casualty road accidents during and after hours. Examples include the recent chemical incident in Maynooth and the national ambulance service's response to the Altnagelvin hospital fire.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">The Minister chose to focus on only one of the points I raised. I again ask for his view on the case made by the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, the members of which are front-line service providers, on the shortage of personnel, infrastructure and funding. In my own region which comprises counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath ambulance service staff are expected to deliver the service with only 12 ambulances functioning and available at any one time. I know from direct personal experience both in December last year and January this year, which I have shared with the Minister, that the current provision is absolutely inadequate. I have appealed to him before and do so again to recognise that my experience is not unique to the region from which I come but is replicated across the State. How can this be acceptable? Will he undertake to deliver a truly State-wide audit of ambulance services with a view to increasing the number of front-line personnel and the level of infrastructure, including the ambulance fleet, in order to bring the service across the country up to a safe and efficient level? When will the reviews under way be concluded and when does the Minister expect to take possession of the relevant reports? In each of the cases he cited, will the report be published?</p>

            <p eId="para_90">On the last point, it is, of course, my intention that the reports will be published. The HIQA review of the national ambulance service will be a very comprehensive analysis of how to make the best use of the resources available to us. Response time requirements have been in place since 2011 - no such criteria applied before then - and everybody will agree that the people providing the service are very committed to it. However, there is no service so good that it cannot be improved. The Deputy referred to the position in Scotland which has a similar dispersed population. We will learn from our neighbours in any way we can. The objective of the three reviews to which I referred is to improve the service to the patient. The most important point, as the Deputy reminded me when he spoke about his own experience, is that the patient should receive the right treatment as quickly as possible. The ambulance that takes a patient to hospital is very important, but having rapid access to a skilled advanced paramedic who can administer care is the critical consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">7. <b>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</b> asked the <b>Minister for Health</b> the extent to which patients presenting for what are deemed to be non-emergency or non-urgent procedures are put on waiting lists for prolonged periods, often in very severe pain which results in great distress for them and their families; the effort being made to examine such cases with a view to ensuring the alleviation of pain becomes an issue in the determination of priority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [27007/14]</p>

            <p eId="para_92">This question relates to the number of incidents brought to my attention, whereby patients in need of particular procedures such as prostate operations, hip replacements and so on are being placed on waiting lists of considerable length. They are left, in the meantime, to suffer extreme pain which is highly distressing for themselves and their families.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_93">Management of all patients on waiting lists takes place in line with an agreed national policy on waiting list management that issued in 2013. This policy was developed to ensure all administrative, managerial and clinical staff would follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. The policy describes the process for assigning priority to patients and all patients, with every person added to the waiting list assigned a priority category of either "routine" or "urgent". Several factors determine prioritisation of the clinical urgency of a patient and his or her subsequent scheduling, including pain levels. The decision on prioritisation is a clinical one, taken by a doctor, as is proper.</p>
            <p eId="para_94"> In addition to the national waiting list management policy, a toolkit to support the successful implementation of the new policy has been developed. The performance improvement toolkit for scheduled care focuses on the organisational, procedural and operational changes necessary to improve patient experience of scheduled care. It provides an organisational assessment tool to enable hospitals to understand their current capabilities and performance. It also identifies areas for hospitals to focus on improvements based on the organisational assessment. </p>
            <p eId="para_95"> With the assistance and support of the special delivery unit, SDU, and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, 90% of adult patients were waiting less than eight months at the end of April, with 10% waiting for longer than the eight month target. That 10% comprises 4,462 patients, which compares favourably with the 5,302 adult patients who had been waiting for longer than eight months in April 2013. Even more significant improvements are evident in outpatient waiting lists, which indicate that 93% of outpatients had been seen within 52 weeks by the end of April, whereas only 73% of outpatients had been seen within 52 weeks in April 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> Should any patient consider that his or her clinical condition and-or pain levels are disimproving, it is recommended that he or she bring this to the attention of a GP who can bring it to the attention of the consultant, with a request that the level of priority of the patient be reconsidered.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and acknowledge that considerable progress has been made on waiting lists in general. Moreover, I fully accept clinicians' right and duty to make the clinical decision in the first instance. However, my question relates to the pain suffered by persons waiting for treatment. When one tables a parliamentary question about such cases, the standard reply is that patients whose condition has deteriorated should contact their GP. However, if the patient had not been concerned in the first place, he or she would not have contacted a public representative. Would it be possible to review the status of those patients who seem to be on a circular list and whose only means of accessing treatment quickly is to go through hospital emergency departments, with the consequent disruption of that service? I am not satisfied that every case is treated with the urgency it should be given, given the severity of pain suffered by patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_98">I can certainly consider the Deputy's suggestion on exploring how we might develop a separate route for patients who feel they are deteriorating, without requiring them to resort to attending an accident and emergency department. As a doctor, I am aware that if people are left to wait for a prolonged period, elective surgery can turn into emergency surgery. That is not something anybody would wish to see. It is only right and proper, however, that the clinicians make these decisions. It would not be proper for management to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> Major improvements have been made to waiting times but I acknowledge that they are still too long. We seek to continue to improve them through further reform of the health services and monitoring of waiting lists. Some hospitals have not been co-operating with the policy of seeing those who have waited longest first, once urgent and cancer cases have been dealt with. That is a problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">I thank the Minister for his reply. I hope he will be able to carry out a review of this issue. A case was recently brought to my attention involving an elderly lady who was awaiting a hip replacement. Although she was in extreme pain, her case was not deemed urgent or a priority. She had been waiting between one year and 18 months in that condition. In another case, a prostate patient was deemed as non-urgent. This unfortunate individual's family became extremely distressed at the extent to which he was in discomfort, screaming with pain on a daily basis. It was poor consolation to them when I forwarded them a reply suggesting that he should go to his GP. He would not have complained to me in the first instance if the situation had been the way it should have been.</p>

            <p eId="para_101">If I may make a general point, nobody should be in pain. Adequate pain relief mechanisms are available and a GP would be in a position to provide such relief. I accept, however, it is not ideal that people would take painkillers for prolonged periods when a procedure could resolve the problem in a more comprehensive fashion. As we all know, some painkillers have side effects which can be serious in their own way. I take note of what the Deputy had to say. We are striving to improve the system. It has evolved in a chaotic fashion over many years and through various Governments, and we are trying to put order on it to benefit patients by ensuring that those who are waiting the longest are seen first and that people are seen in chronological order as they are referred rather than permitting people who have only been waiting three months to be seen prior to those who have been waiting six months, nine months or a year. That has been happening in our hospitals.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alex White<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_103">The current eligibility system for health services, which has been in place since 1970, is based primarily on financial criteria. The Government has decided to develop a policy framework for eligibility for health services to take account of medical conditions, including new legislation as appropriate, and a HSE clinical expert group is to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as part of this process. The group has been asked to prepare an early report for the Minister for Health in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_104"> The Government was very concerned about the potential impact on the health of persons with serious illnesses whose discretionary medical cards and GP visit cards had been refused renewal since the centralisation of medical card assessment in 2011. Therefore, in the context of the development of an eligibility policy, the Government decided that medical cards and GP visit cards were to be issued to persons with a serious medical condition or disability who had the renewal of their discretionary card refused by the HSE, having completed an eligibility review during the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_105"> This arrangement applies in the following circumstances: during the period the person held a medical card or GP visit card issued on a discretionary basis but the HSE made a decision to refuse its renewal on foot of a completed eligibility review; the person completed the review process during that period - that is, provided the information and documentation required to assess eligibility; or the person has a serious medical condition which required that his or her case to be referred to a medical officer as part of the review process. It is anticipated that approximately 15,300 cards will be issued to people with serious medical conditions as part of this process. It is estimated that 5,288 people will be issued with a discretionary medical card, 2,899 people will be issued with a discretionary GP visit card and 7,118 people will be moved from a GP visit card to a discretionary medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_106"> It is also recognised that a small number of individuals may not have been able to complete their review during the defined period due to circumstances relating to their medical conditions, such as hospitalisation or a change of residence during treatment. Therefore, the director general of the HSE may act on his own initiative, to take account of an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal on a case-by-case basis to issue a discretionary card to such a person where he or she has a serious medical condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_107"> People do not need to make an application to receive a card because the HSE is working through its database as quickly as possible to contact the people concerned over the next few weeks to inform them that their card is being issued. If people do not hear from the HSE by mid-July, they should contact it on its Lo-Call contact number.</p>

            <p eId="para_110">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Over the past week the Taoiseach cited figures of more than 15,000 discretionary medical cards and 5,000 mercy cards. However, when I contacted the medical card section yesterday it had no information on the criteria or method for acquiring a mercy card. Many people with severe disabilities lost their discretionary cards, including people with spina bifida, Down's syndrome and cancer, resulting in severe financial hardship for the families concerned. How soon will cards be issued to such people, will they be given priority and will the cards be reissued automatically? Will the money spent over the last year by families who have lost medical cards be refunded?</p>

            <p eId="para_111">In the first instance, it is not proposed to issue refunds in these circumstances. This problem will ultimately be resolved only through a change in the legislative basis for awarding medical cards. The Government has now set in train a process to achieve that intended outcome. With regard to the speed at which this will happen, the HSE is working as quickly as possible to contact those concerned. We estimate it will take a number of weeks to resolve the issue. It is not necessary for individuals to the contact the HSE because they can rest assured that their cases will be dealt with in accordance with the criteria published last week. However, if people remain concerned and they do not hear from the HSE by mid-July, they are free to contact it on the Lo-Call contact number.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">I understand the Deputy's point, but the cards were removed for proper legal reasons. I am not saying that did not affect the individuals concerned. In terms of the actual position of the time, the HSE applied the law correctly. As legislators, we are trying to change the law. People often ask us why we cannot change the law if it is against us on a particular issue. We are setting out to do that, and that is why the expert panel has been established. We look forward to receiving support from the Opposition in dealing with the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">However, for the moment, what the HSE has done - it has been fortified by the Government announcement in respect of a change of policy - is to move to a position, as it were, in which all further reviews are suspended.

            <p eId="para_123">Despite the replies to previous questions, major difficulties remain with what are perceived as the criteria for discretionary medical cards. This is the case even for applications that have gone in over recent weeks and in respect of which people have been diagnosed with serious illnesses and have submitted their documentation. There is a major issue with the process. Reviews are still ongoing. We have people coming into our office who have a major difficulty with the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_124"> The Minister of State gave us figures and he alluded to changes in legislation. This matter is a priority and legislation should be before the House as soon as possible. The Minister gave us figures and stated there would be a report in the autumn, but that is far too late for the families concerned. These people have major medical difficulties and in some cases a terminal diagnosis. They are still waiting for medical cards and there is toing and froing with the HSE seeking clarification on pieces of paper and so on. It needs to be treated with more urgency than is the case at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_125">The determination of the basis for the awarding of medical cards on medical grounds, as opposed to means grounds, which has been the case since 1970, will be dealt with absolutely comprehensively through the expert panel. If we are to determine a basis for awarding a medical card where a person has a medical condition or an illness then there must be some basis for determining what that will be and what the grounds will be. The Government has correctly commenced its consideration of the matter by putting together an expert panel of medical professionals. These are people who work in medicine - clinicians who are in a position to list conditions and make an assessment of conditions and illnesses appropriate for access to services under the scheme. That is the job this panel will have to undertake.</p>
            <p eId="para_126"> I agree with Deputy Moynihan that this should be resolved as quickly as possible. However, there is no use in saying the legislation should be before the House as soon as possible unless the Deputy can suggest to me or unless someone has a view on what the legislation should contain. We want to get the legislation correct and we must decide the criteria for the awarding of what one might term medical medical cards.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">The Government and the Minister have constantly referred to changing the legislation and so on, but the practice in the HSE, which dates back to the health boards, has been to grant medical cards on a discretionary basis. I am unsure why the Minister of State is saying there no basis for it in law.</p>
            <p eId="para_128"> I have no wish to mention the exact details because the families would know that I am quoting their files on the floor of the Dáil, but some people who have been diagnosed with serious illnesses have approached me in the past week or two. The medical card section of the HSE is looking for pieces of paper with minute clarifications on this and that and clarifications in respect of income details. The people concerned may be on social welfare. This practice is continuing. As late as yesterday we had a major difficulty with a family of a person with an illness. The HSE was looking for scraps of paper, for want of a better term, and it is intolerable.</p>

The Government is now dealing with the issue of access to services. I am referring to necessary access that people with medical conditions and illnesses must have, even if they are over the means test limit. All Governments have been sticking to the 1970 Act, dating back almost 45 or 50 years, and held that unless a person satisfies the mean test, he does not get access to services. That is what we are trying to change and that is what we will change. That is what we are going to do properly and comprehensively through this review. The Government has indicated that it will come back to the Oireachtas in early course. We hope we will be able to do so, and we intend doing so in the autumn.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective of delivering a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective health system. Primary care infrastructure is being delivered through three mechanisms: direct build, a leasing initiative and a public private partnership initiative announced in the July 2012 infrastructure stimulus package. The development of primary care centres through a combination of public and private investment will facilitate the delivery of multidisciplinary primary care and represents a tangible refocusing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_134"> Considerable progress has already been made in the delivery of primary care centres. Since this Government came into office in March 2011, a total 37 primary care centres have been opened and infrastructure development is under way or at an advanced planning stage at a further 43 locations, where delivery is expected during the period between 2014 and 2016 or early 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_135"> As with all capital projects, the primary care infrastructure programme must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service. There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer. There is limited funding available for new projects over the period 2014-18 given the level of commitments and the costs of completion. The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet needs now and in the future.</p>

I commend the Government on the ongoing work and on the number of primary care centres that have opened, including those recently opened in Athenry and Loughrea in Galway. There is no update on the two projects that I mentioned. I spoke to the Minister of State before regarding Inisbofin. There was back-and-forth between the Department of Health and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht over which had responsibility for the project. There had been an issue previously that the Department with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the islands had responsibility for island communities. Anyway, I understand that has been cleared up. Perhaps the Minister of State could come back to me with details of the progress on that health centre as well as the centre in Corrandulla, which is currently closed, but which, I understand, is listed for refurbishment. This issue arose often during the recent canvas.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">Locals in the area must attend the primary care centre in Turloughmore. Their concern was that the Corrandulla centre may not re-open.</p>

            <p eId="para_139"> In recent weeks, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and I have had the honour of opening additional primary care centres in different parts of the country. One could see the value their communities placed in them and the incredible services they provided. I opened one in Schull in County Cork, another in Blanchardstown recently and one in Summerhill, County Meath. One has been opened per month since the Government came to office. We receive a great deal of criticism. Some is justified, but much is not. I draw the House's attention to the amazing work that is being done in the primary care sector, particularly in the provision of new buildings. The housing of services under one roof obviates the need for people to travel long distances, as was the case in Schull, for services that should be available in their own communities. This kind of change is taking place in our health services and is valuable to communities across the country.</p>

The commitment to develop a maternity strategy arises from my acceptance of the recommendations of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report into the death of Savita Halappanavar. That report recommended that a strategy be developed to implement standard and consistent models for the delivery of a national maternity service that reflected best available evidence to ensure that all pregnant women had appropriate and informed choices and access to the right level of care and support. The strategy will incorporate a review and evaluation of our current maternity services. This will give us the opportunity to take stock of the services that are provided to women and their babies in our 19 maternity hospitals and identify how we can further improve the quality and safety of the care we provide.

The sixth option - to do nothing - was dismissed. Of the hospitals in the group, Portiuncula is the safest, one of the most efficient and the second largest. This week, the group's management team issued a statement to the effect that the current review would be subsumed by the national review of maternity services. I am concerned by this, as it will not lead to the best possible patient outcome or the provision of the safest possible services.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">Sadly, the Deputy is prejudging the situation. The national maternity review being conducted by my Department is nowhere near finalised. I have made it clear on the floor of the House that, while the report commissioned by the west-north west group may be used to help inform the national review, it has no status in and of itself. My Department is conducting the review to ensure safe and comprehensive services while observing the underlying principle of our health policy, namely, that patients should be treated as near to home as possible in a safe, timely and effective manner. I ask the Deputy not to prejudge the national review's outcome. It may suit purposes locally to upset people and undermine their confidence in the hospital-----</p>

            <p eId="para_147">I thank the Minister for his clarification, but that was not my suggestion. I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the review that the Minister is spearheading, as a review of maternity services is necessary, given the death of Savita Halappanavar and events in Portlaoise. We all want a quality and safe maternity service. However, a report specifically focused its attention on Portiuncula Hospital. I want the Minister's assurance that the report in question, which is tainted in its content, never mind its origins, will make no input into the national review. There is an agenda in the west-north west hospital group to undermine services at Portiuncula Hospital, which is not in the best interests of women anywhere in the country.</p>

        <heading>State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014 [Seanad]: Second Stage<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T10:40:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_152">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_153">I thank the House for the opportunity to introduce this Bill. Deputies will recall that, 18 months ago, Shannon Airport was separated from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA. I will reflect in a moment on the performance of the independent Shannon Airport since then. Separation of the airport was just one part of a two-step process designed to deliver a new future for Shannon. The second part is the subject of today's Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> The main purpose of the Bill is to establish a new commercial State company, Shannon Group plc, which will incorporate the Shannon Airport Authority, SAA, and Shannon Development. The establishment of the Shannon group will complete the foundations to support a new future for Shannon and the mid-west region, as envisaged in the report by the Shannon Aviation Business Development Task Force of November 2012. In that report, the task force was satisfied that an independent Shannon Airport, coupled with a restructured Shannon Development, could develop and grow passenger traffic and the route network. It also anticipated that this could create new employment opportunities in aviation-related services in and around the airport. The task force pointed to the opportunities to develop and grow an internationally recognised centre for aviation services, known as the international aviation services centre, IASC, at Shannon. This could draw on its geographical location, good airfield facilities and ample adjacent land.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">It also has an existing foothold in aircraft leasing and maintenance operations with a skilled, English-speaking workforce and US pre-clearance facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> When we separated Shannon from the DAA, the first priority for the independent airport authority was to halt the dramatic and constant prevailing downward slide in passenger traffic over the previous five years. A decline on the scale suffered by Shannon - the airport lost two-thirds of its passengers between 2006 and 2012 - was always going to be challenging to address. However, the outturn for last year of 1.4 million passengers was an improvement on the 2012 outturn of 1.39 million. This reversal of the serious slide of previous years was a major achievement for Shannon in its first year as an independent airport and is a tribute to its board, headed by Rose Hynes, and to the management, headed by Neil Pakey, and all the staff. With the new routes already operational and increased capacity on existing services, Shannon is now looking forward to new and sustainable growth. Figures for the first five months of this year show passenger numbers overall are up by more than 10% on the same period last year with all air corridors - the UK, Europe and the transatlantic - performing well. There is a renewed energy evident at the airport. </p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I will now turn to Shannon Development. The Government decided two years ago to restructure this company. Its functions in regard to indigenous enterprises and foreign direct investment were transferred to Enterprise Ireland and the IDA and its tourism functions were transferred to Fáilte Ireland. The main benefits of this restructuring included the streamlining of Shannon Development's activities, the elimination of duplication of work by public bodies in the region and a more focused role for the remaining part of Shannon Development, namely, managing and developing its property portfolio including the free zone adjacent to the airport. That restructuring is now complete.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Shannon Heritage is a stand-alone and successful subsidiary of Shannon Development and is unaffected by these changes. The Government decided some time ago that Shannon Heritage will remain within Shannon Group pending a review of its most appropriate permanent location.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Considerable attention was given to the optimum legal structure for the merger of Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development. A number of different options were considered by my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. We worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General on this. Shannon Group will be the parent or holding company for Shannon Airport Authority and the restructured Shannon Development. Under this Bill, it will acquire all the shares of these two companies from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Both will maintain their separate legal identities as wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Shannon Group. In the new scenario, the restructured Shannon Development, which will be renamed Shannon Commercial Enterprises Limited, will have a commercial remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> This structure has a number of advantages. Keeping the businesses of Shannon Development and Shannon Airport Authority separate from each other will impose financial discipline on each of them and ensure that both will pursue a commercial ethos. The success of Shannon Group will be enhanced by ensuring that its two main subsidiaries are each commercially successful in their own right and do not cross-subsidise each other. This structure will also facilitate greater transparency in the application of State aid rules by Shannon Group and its subsidiaries. Any business arrangements between them will be on a commercial basis and will involve no cross-subsidisation of operations at the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> In the case of the SAA, the proposed structure avoids another transfer of staff from the airport authority to another company. Deputies will recall that when Shannon gained its independence from the DAA 18 months ago, all staff working in the airport were transferred from the employment of the Dublin Airport Authority to that of the Shannon Airport Authority. Despite the protections for those staff who were transferring, which were contained in the State Airports Act 2004 and in the TUPE regulations, their union representatives expressed unease and some reservations at the time about the consequences of transfer to a new employer. While I think it is fair to say the transfer went smoothly, there was a considerable burden on the SAA management in dealing with those concerns and all the administrative issues involved. There is some merit, therefore, for all concerned, in avoiding yet another staff transfer for those employed by the SAA. Similarly, the staff that manage and deal with the property portfolio in Shannon Development will also remain as employees of that company.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> The Government's objective in creating Shannon Group is to bring a unification of purpose to the two separate companies for the overall benefit of the business. This will also have indirect positive impacts for the Limerick-Shannon area and the wider region. As well as promoting a greater commonality of purpose, the new company will maximise the synergies between the SAA and Shannon Development to promote the development and expansion of the aviation services with the potential for new job creation as reported on by the Shannon task force in 2012. This will be greatly facilitated by the fact that the Shannon free zone lands are adjacent to the airport. However, this advantage of physical proximity needs a new dynamism to carry-through on the full potential of the Shannon campus.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> I would like to take this opportunity - as I did in the Upper House - on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and myself to acknowledge the contribution of the chairmen, directors, management and staff of both Shannon Development and Shannon Airport over the past two years in ensuring the smooth, ongoing, operation of the companies while also working together to prepare for the establishment of the Shannon Group. I believe that the pioneering spirit of the people who gave us the airport and the Shannon free zone in the first place has been rekindled and there are now exciting opportunities to exploit to ensure a brighter future for the airport and the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> While the central aim of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of the Shannon Group, there are some other important elements in the Bill that I want to mention. The first is the adoption of the "Alternative A" insolvency regime under the Cape Town convention. This Bill will provide for implementation of the special insolvency regime applicable to aircraft - known as "Alternative A" - that is set out in the Cape Town convention. Through enactment of the International Interests in Mobile Equipment (Cape Town Convention) Act 2005, Ireland was among the first countries to ratify the convention. It provides an international legal framework for the financing of high value moveable or mobile assets such as aircraft, trains and satellites. The convention has no meaning or effect unless and until a protocol is agreed and comes into force for each of the three asset types covered by the convention. </p>
          <p eId="para_165"> To date, only one protocol, the aircraft protocol, is operational. The 2005 Act gave effect to the aircraft protocol in national law. Essentially, the convention and protocol provide protection for creditors of aircraft assets in countries that have signed up to the convention. The "Alternative A" insolvency regime for aircraft assets under the Cape Town Convention and protocol essentially replicates the insolvency regime in the United States where enhanced equipment trust certificates, EETCs, have been successfully issued since the 1990s. These are an aviation-specific form of asset-backed security, where the secured asset is the aircraft and they have proved popular both for both airlines and investors in the United States. It is a matter for individual countries to specify the waiting period in the protocol following which, if a default is not rectified, the creditor is entitled to the automatic repossession of the aircraft. The vast majority of countries that have adopted the "Alternative A" regime have opted to replicate the 60-day period applicable in the United States. Under this Bill, we are also proposing to adopt a waiting period of 60 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> Ireland has always punched above its weight in the aviation sector and this sector is growing rapidly on a global basis. We have a particularly strong foothold in the aircraft leasing business with nine of the top ten global leasing companies located in Ireland. Adoption of this "Alternative A" insolvency regime for aircraft will support the development of aviation finance in Ireland and help maintain Ireland's leading global position in aircraft leasing where there is already growing competition from other jurisdictions that have already adopted the "Alternative A" regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> An exemption from stamp duty was provided by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act 2013 to facilitate the successful issuance of enhanced equipment trust certificates in Ireland and make this form of financing more attractive to investors. Together with the proposed implementation of the "Alternative A" insolvency regime, these measures will enable airlines and leasing companies to access finance on more competitive terms and will help sustain and develop the leasing and aviation finance sectors within Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I will now turn to the Irish Airlines (General Employees) Superannuation Scheme, IASS. I want to make special mention of section 34 of the Bill which provides for amendment to the existing statutory provisions governing superannuation schemes in our State airport authorities. This section will also facilitate changes, by the trustee, to the IAS scheme, which is the Irish airlines superannuation scheme. An important development since I was in the Seanad with this Bill has been the publication of the expert panel's final report on the resolution of the industrial relations issues surrounding the scheme. Deputies will recall that the panel was established in March by ICTU, IBEC, my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to identify how to resolve the IR issues relating to the problems in the scheme. This report is very welcome and points the way to finally dealing with the serious problems in the IAS scheme. The scheme, as Deputies know, dates from the 1950s and is a multi-employer scheme covering the majority of employees, pensioners and deferred pensioners in the State airports and in Aer Lingus. </p>
          <p eId="para_169">It also covers some of those who worked for SR Technics prior to closure of its operations at Dublin airport in 2009. All issues concerning the IAS scheme, including its rules and provisions, contribution rates and benefits are matters for the trustees of the scheme, its members, participating employers and, of course, the Pensions Authority, which is the national regulator of occupational pension schemes. I do not control the scheme and cannot impose or prescribe a solution for its problems. However, I do want to help and to see this long-standing issue resolved. I have done so through the expert panel and I am further assisting the process through the legislative amendments that I have provided for in this Bill, which I will explain later.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> Of the members of the IAS scheme some 69% were or are Aer Lingus employees, 26% were or are DAA-SAA employees and 5% were employees of SR Technics. There are approximately 14,800 members in the scheme, split into three groups of similar size made up of current employees, known as "active" members, pensioners and deferred pensioners, the latter being people who have left the company but are not yet drawing down their pensions. The scheme is currently closed to new members-staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> Under the IAS scheme, fixed contributions are payable by employers and members regardless of the funding position of the scheme. Both the benefits and the contributions are defined within the scheme rules. The scheme is registered and operated as a defined benefit scheme under the Pensions Authority criteria due to the benefits it seeks to provide and accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the sponsoring employers due to the fixed funding covenant. In March of last year, the IAS scheme reported a deficit on the statutory minimum funding standard basis of €769 million. This deficit has arisen over the years as the companies and members did not put enough into the scheme to match the benefits that were expected or promised. Resolution of the issues will involve contributions from all the parties involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Because of the priority position of pensioners under the Pensions Act 1990, prior to the amendments contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013, the residual funds that would be available for active and deferred members in the event of a wind-up of the scheme would be approximately 5% of benefit expectations. This is not an acceptable position and the employers and unions held extensive negotiations on the way forward under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and the Labour Court. This ultimately led to Labour Court recommendations of May of last year. The trustees of the IAS scheme issued fresh proposals to the employers and unions in February last. These proposals include a number of benefit reductions, which affect active and deferred members and also pensions already being drawn down. The latter is permitted under the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013. These proposals have been the subject of ongoing discussions since then and the trustees have also asked that the position of deferred members and pensioners be taken into account in those discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> The expert panel examined the complex IR issues that remain to be resolved arising from the trustees' proposals and the earlier Labour Court recommendations. The panel held a series of meetings with all the relevant parties including the DAA, SAA, Aer Lingus, the trade unions and representatives of deferred members and pensioners. I have asked that all parties engage constructively on implementing the panel's recommendations and I am hopeful that they will recommend acceptance of its findings. It is important to emphasise the panel's definitive view that these recommendations represent the best possible outcome that can be achieved. It is also the view of the panel that if this final opportunity to resolve this very protracted problem is not grasped now, the situation facing members of the IAS scheme will deteriorate further. I agree. </p>
          <p eId="para_174"> When, hopefully, the parties do reach agreement on the way forward, it will be important they have the necessary tools to ensure that it can be implemented. The amendments contained in section 34 of the Bill are designed to facilitate implementation of whatever proposals emerge from the current negotiations to resolve the IAS scheme difficulties. They do not pre-empt or anticipate what those solutions may be nor are they intended to undermine staff terms and conditions of employment. On the basis that the panel's recommendations will prove acceptable to the parties, it is important that the legislative framework is fit for purpose and will not act as a barrier to implementation. This was always the intention of the provisions in section 34 of this Bill, namely, to facilitate the implementation of whatever solution was ultimately agreed for the future pension provision of IAS scheme members.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> There has been some confusion about certain provisions in section 34, which I included to deal with a possible scenario - one which nobody wants to see - in which agreement on a way forward could not, ultimately, be agreed by the parties. This was no more than a pragmatic approach which I viewed as prudent given the complexities of this pension scheme and the challenges faced in resolving the current problems in it. Those particular provisions, which were intended to be used only in a fall-back situation, provide for a different option, an alternative to a forced wind-up of the scheme by the Pensions Authority, which would involve a somewhat better outcome for members. On the basis of the panel's report and views expressed in the Seanad and directly to me by some Deputies and by interested parties, including the unions and representatives of the deferred members and pensioners, I have decided to delete these fall-back provisions. I will be tabling an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage, along with some other amendments to bring greater clarity to some of the other provisions. I will take Deputies through this section in detail on Committee Stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_176"> In summary, provision is being made for employees, if they wish, to cease making contributions to the IAS scheme when they become a member of another scheme. One of the amendments I will be tabling on Committee Stage is to clarify that this option is entirely voluntary on the part of employees. It is a bone of contention among some employees who are members of the IAS scheme that they must continue to contribute to the scheme even though, given the substantial deficit in the scheme, any such contributions may accrue little benefit for them in the future. However, ceasing contributions will not solve the serious problems in the IAS scheme, namely, the deficit, which still must be addressed by the parties. Provision is also being made for new pension schemes in the airport authorities, which will require ministerial approval, that do not have to replicate the inflexibilities and flaws of the IAS scheme. This will ensure that if the parties agree that new pension schemes for future service are to form part of the solution to the problems in the IAS, the legislative tools are available to the airport authorities to establish such schemes. </p>
          <p eId="para_177"> There are approximately 1,250 staff in DAA and SAA that are not members of any occupational scheme pending the resolution of these issues. While they can avail of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, it is preferable that the airport authorities, similar to other companies, have pension schemes in place for their staff. When considering pension provisions it is important that we bear in mind the needs of all members of the current scheme and those employees currently not included in the scheme. There can be a tendency at times to focus on those with existing benefits rather than more broadly on all staff, including younger and newer employees. These full-time employees are unusual in the public and semi-State sector in that in many cases they do not have a pension scheme. The ladder has been pulled up on them due to the inflexibilities and unsustainability of the existing scheme. I want to put this right and to give them proper pension provision for the future. Clarification is also being provided on the powers of the trustee of the IAS scheme, particularly in the context of ensuring that an agreement among the parties on the way forward can be implemented. In the event that the panel's recommendations prove acceptable to the parties, and I hope they will, the trustees and the employers need the legislative amendments that I have included in the Shannon Bill. Those recommendations, or indeed any solution agreed among the parties, cannot be implemented without these amendments having been made. </p>
          <p eId="para_178"> I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Its main purpose is, of course, to establish the new commercial State company, Shannon Group, and to transfer ownership of SAA and Shannon Development from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to Shannon Group. Part 1 is made up of five sections dealing with the Bill's Title and collective citation, definitions, expenses, the making of orders and repeals. These are standard sections in a Bill of this nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> Part 2 is the key part of the Bill and provides for the establishment of Shannon Group as a public limited company under the Companies Acts, the issuing of 38,100 shares in the company to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the issue of one share, to be held in trust for that Minister, to each of the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association of the company. These latter are standard minimum requirements for a public limited company under the Companies Acts. The citizens of this country will be the ultimate owners of this new company and section 9 provides for the payment of dividends to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and for such dividends to be disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer. The remainder of Part 2 sets down the purpose, functions and general duties of Shannon Group and provides power for the company to borrow, subject to ministerial consents. </p>
          <p eId="para_180">An aggregate borrowing ceiling of €100 million for Shannon Group and its subsidiaries is specified in section 13, but this can be varied subsequently, if necessary and justified, by ministerial order.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Part 3 deals with the administration of Shannon Group and corporate governance arrangements. The board of the company will have ten members, including the chairman, the chief executive and two employee representatives. The chief executive of Shannon Group will also be appointed as chief executive of each of the group's two main subsidiaries, the SAA and Shannon Development. Initially, what this means is that the current CEO of the SAA and Shannon Development, Mr. Neil Pakey, will be the first CEO of Shannon Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> On staffing matters, provision is made in section 18 to confirm that the transfer of ownership of the SAA and Shannon Development to Shannon Group will not operate in a way that would worsen the conditions of service, or remuneration, of staff working in these two bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> In section 20 I took on board a suggestion made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications when it examined the heads of the Bill, that the members of the board of any subsidiary of Shannon Group should be appointed by the group board rather than solely by the chairman. However, subject to notifying the Shannon Group board, the Minister may specify any subsidiary for which he or she wishes his or her consent to be obtained for board appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Sections 21 and 22 provide for reporting arrangements in regard to Shannon Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Provision is made in section 23 for a pension scheme in Shannon Group and any such scheme will be subject to approval by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Standard provisions relating to the conduct of directors and employees of Shannon Group and its subsidiaries are also included in Part 3, as is a power for the Minister to issue directions and guidelines to the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Part 4 contains just three sections, the key one being section 28 which provides that, following the establishment of Shannon Group, all shares held by or on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the SAA and Shannon Development will be transferred to Shannon Group. The SAA and Shannon Development will then be wholly owned subsidiaries of Shannon Group and provision is made for the SAA to be re-registered as a private limited company, similar to Shannon Development. Simultaneously with this transfer of ownership, the existing directors on the boards of the SAA and Shannon Development will cease to hold office. This will allow the board of Shannon Group to make appointments to the boards of these subsidiaries under section 20, to which I referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> Part 5 contains a number of provisions that are relevant to State airports. Section 31 provides for the dissolution, for the time being, of Cork Airport Authority plc, but it also provides the power to reincorporate the authority at a later date. Essentially, the provisions in the State Airports Act 2004 which would facilitate the separation of Cork Airport from the DAA, if and when such a decision is made, are being preserved. Cork Airport Authority plc was incorporated in 2004, the then Government’s intention being to move relatively quickly towards the separation of Cork Airport from the DAA. However, that never happened and it was never envisaged that the company would remain in existence for a decade without the airport being separated from the DAA. The board of the Cork Airport Authority has only existed in skeleton form for some time. Even in the period before that, when a board was in place, there were significant corporate governance concerns on the part of directors about their being on a board in such circumstances. Fulfilling the normal expectations of the board of a public limited company is difficult, particularly given the statutory duties and obligations on it. I am, therefore, taking the opportunity provided by the Bill to bring this abnormal situation to an end, while preserving the power for the Minister to incorporate the company again at a future date.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> I am, of course, very conscious of the importance of Cork Airport in the social and economic development of the city and the wider Cork region, including its importance for tourism. That is why the DAA has established a new high level stakeholder body - the Cork Airport Development Council, CADC - to boost the development of the airport. The council held its first meeting in March and met again yesterday. The CADC which is chaired by the DAA chairman Pádraig Ó Ríordáin and also includes the CEO, Mr. Kevin Toland, will provide a forum for stakeholders, including senior representatives from the tourism and business sectors who have an interest in the development of Cork Airport, to engage with management at the airport and help to contribute to traffic and route growth. We should never forget that Cork Airport remains the second busiest airport in the State after Dublin Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> Section 32 provides for the renaming of the Dublin Airport Authority as "daa". The company has a strong preference to change its current name to the acronymic form daa and cease all references to the “Dublin Airport Authority”. However, each of its two airports, Dublin and Cork, will be branded separately. In the past ten years the name daa has become embedded in public and corporate consciousness as the master brand for the group. The acronym is used extensively across infrastructure, systems and other assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Section 33 contains a series of technical amendments to existing airports legislation, in particular, the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 and the State Airports Act 2004, which arise as a consequence of the renaming of the Dublin Airport Authority, the dissolution of the Cork Airport Authority and the power in section 31 to which I referred to reincorporate the CAA at a future date.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I have outlined the rationale for the provisions in section 34 dealing with amendments to existing legislative provisions governing superannuation arrangements in the State airport authorities and facilitate amendments to the IAS pension scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> Part 6 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to Shannon Development. Section 35 provides for the renaming of the company's official title, Shannon Free Airport Development Company, as Shannon Commercial Enterprises Limited to reflect its future commercial focus. Allied with this new commercial focus, section 36 provides for the ending, on a phased basis over four years, of Shannon Development's exemption from corporation tax and also removes the company's current exemption from capital gains tax. These types of exemption are only appropriate for non-commercial State bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Section 37 provides for certain technical amendments to other legislation as a consequence of Shannon Development's future commercial remit. This section also removes the Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development from the scope of worker participation legislation since these two companies will be subsidiaries of Shannon Group. As I mentioned, I am providing for two employee representatives on the group board.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> Section 38 provides discretionary power for the transfer of Shannon Customs Free Zone land from the Minister to Shannon Development. Since approximately 1959, the Shannon Free Zone lands have been leased to Shannon Development at nominal rent under long-term leases. When I published the general scheme of the Bill last year, the proposal was that these lands would be transferred to Shannon Development at no cost. It has since been clarified, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, that, subject to further analysis, such a transfer for no consideration could constitute State aid. For this reason, section 38 provides discretion - not a commitment or an obligation - for the Minister to transfer the relevant land to Shannon Development. This will provide time and space, following enactment of the Bill, for my Department to explore, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, options for the proposed land transfer that would be in compliance with state aid rules. The consequential amendment of the Customs Free Airport Act 1947 in section 39 will reflect the change in land ownership from the Minister to Shannon Development, if and when the lands actually are transferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Sections 40 and 41 provide for the transfer to Enterprise Ireland of Shannon Development's equity holdings in certain businesses in the Shannon Free Zone and, similarly, the transfer of rights, duties and obligations relating to grants awarded or approved to either IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland. These equity holdings arose from Shannon Development's enterprise and support development remit for indigenous companies. These provisions follow on from the restructuring last year of Shannon Development and the transfer of its non-commercial functions in regard to enterprise support to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> Provision is also made in section 42 for the transfer of Shannon Development's superannuation scheme, its liabilities, duties, obligations and funding to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The section also enables that Minister to appoint a specified agency of his Department to administer the pensions scheme on his behalf. These provisions reflect an agreement between management and staff in Shannon Development reached last year under the auspices of an independent facilitator that the staff remaining in the restructured company who number approximately 20 would maintain their public service pensions scheme arrangements. </p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Part 7 relates to some miscellaneous amendments which I am sure I can discuss further on Committee Stage. Parts 8 and 9 relate to the Cape Town Convention and amendments to the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act 1982 which I can discuss in more detail on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_198">It is welcome that the Minister is bringing this legislation before the House at this stage. As he is well aware, it has been promised for some time. The expectation was that it would have been tabled in the House towards the end of last year to allow the new company, Shannon Group, to proceed with its activities in line with the decisions the Minister had taken to make Shannon an independent airport. It is very clear that the delay in publication and introduction of the legislation has affected the company and new operation significantly, making it difficult for it to proceed as set out.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">I welcome the legislation and I welcome the fact the company is now in a position to proceed as effectively as possible to take on the new challenges that are provided by giving Shannon Airport the independent status the Government policy dictates. This Bill gives effect to the decision the Government took in 2012 effectively to separate Shannon from the DAA, leaving Dublin and Cork to operate within the foothold, if one wants, of the DAA.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> The legislation which led up to that dates back to 2004, as the Minister is aware. This set out an encumbrance on the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Finance at the time to establish whether Shannon and Cork could operate viably in a stand-alone capacity. I do not want to go back over the discussions we had here in 2012, when the Minister moved the implementation of the 2004 legislation, but I expressed concerns at the time and I still hold those concerns. Notwithstanding that, I recognise there is an opportunity now for the new independent entity to take on significant challenges. It is recognised that the chairperson, the chief executive and the management of the company are working exceptionally effectively to take on those challenges and to try to develop a viable path for the airport, which is welcome. I have said on record that I am very supportive of what they are doing, although I still retain the concerns I had at the outset. Moreover, I still want to point out that the decision to transfer Aer Rianta International from the ownership of Shannon Airport to the DAA was a retrograde step. It is a decision that, I believe, leaves Shannon Airport and the new company vulnerable to any market shock that might come in the future or any difficulty the airport might have in achieving its business plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> I want to reflect on the decision the Minister took to implement the 2004 legislation. This was based on the Booz Allen report which clearly stated that the viability of an independent Shannon was only possible if there was an association with the lands and activities of Shannon Development, and that an independent airport would not be viable unless there was between 3 million and 5 million terminal passengers. That begs the question of why the Minister has outlined today that there will be no cross-subsidisation between the activities of Shannon Development and the Shannon Airport Authority. The Minister relied on the Booz Allen report to allow this to proceed and effectively to make Shannon an independent entity, yet he is now suggesting it is possible for the airport to survive without cross-subsidisation or without the support of access to the activities of Shannon Development.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I have to pose the question of what has changed in the intervening period. My analysis of the business plan that was prepared at the time, which Booz Allen and various consultancy companies looked through, is that it charted projections which suggested that, in 2014, the airport would need to have reached an increase in passengers from the then number to approximately 1.9 million passengers. The Minister knows from the figures that the situation is fairly straightforward. In 2012, the decline was arrested in line with an upturn in the economy here and in Europe, together with the efforts of Rose Hynes and her management staff, and we saw a return to growth in that year. As the Minister outlined, there were 1.39 million passengers in 2013, an increase of some 5,000 passengers on the previous year, which is not a huge increase. The Minister also identified the expectation that there will be 10% growth this year, in line with the first months of the year. If that continues throughout the year, at best there will be an increase of 200,000 passengers, which brings us to 1.6 million passengers, well short of the 1.9 million that was projected in the business plan on which the Minister took the decision to separate the airport and take away Aer Rianta International.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> All of this means that the cushion Aer Rianta International would have given to the activities at Shannon Airport is gone. The projections are falling short of what the Minister predicted in regard to it being a viable airport and he is now saying that the activities of Shannon Development, which were identified in the consultancy report, are not going to be available to the company to assist it in its operations. Are we to take it, then, that the airport will either have to reduce its costs at a time when it is trying to grow its market or that it will have to engage in borrowing for day-to-day activities, which would not be a healthy approach for a new company starting out? I am somewhat confused. Perhaps we will get a chance to tease this out on Committee Stage but I have concerns based on the projections, the numbers and the lack of financial support for the day-to-day activity of the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> I must put all of that in context. Those are my concerns but there is also great opportunity when one takes into account that, under a single management structure and governance by a single board, there are huge opportunities to exploit the potential that lands in such close proximity to the airport can give. I am well aware of the efforts of Rose Hynes, Neil Pakey and others to try to build on the level of aviation activity that is already in place in the region and to try to grow this in a way that takes account of the critical mass of activity that exists, together with an uncluttered airspace, a very long runway, good hangar capacity in the region and the potential to build more. Of course, there are also great employment opportunities. Some of that was overstated, if not by the Minister then by his colleagues, in regard to the potential for 5,000 to 10,000 new jobs in the short term. There is no real sign of that, although that is not to take from the work that is under way. I do not see the same level of Government activity that took place in terms of announcements prior to the separation in trying to make the workforce and the region believe this was the right decision. However, while I do not accept that it was necessarily correct to cut it adrift without supports, there is real potential there and we have to harness it.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> It would be remiss not to identify and recognise the tremendous impact Shannon Development has had on the entire mid-west region. It has focused on activity in Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and south Offaly since 1959. It was the regional development agency and also acted as a tourism authority. It provided key insights, key ideas, capital investment and support for people who were starting to develop small enterprises both within the vicinity of Shannon and throughout the various different communities. I want to recognise the current board and staff but also the people who worked in the company in the past and who operated it so effectively and with such success over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> It is a pity the company has been obliterated in the way it has been by the Government and it is deeply disappointing that it is being effectively wound down in this way. It had a unique role in creating jobs and providing support to the companies that came to the region. It also had a transformational role in that many of the companies that started in the Shannon Free Zone and the various estates in that region in the early days have transformed the way they do business and have changed their product lines. In some cases, companies have gone and others have been found to replace them.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> All of that was done because there was a key regional focus, involving people who were located in the region, whose interests were in the region and whose desire was to ensure that the level of employment was maintained. I have real concerns about the way in which the activities and functions of Shannon Development have been transferred to Enterprise Ireland and, from the foreign investment perspective, to the IDA.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Once one cedes responsibility from the local to the national, the difficulty is that the focus, unfortunately, gets lost. While more than 100 US companies are operating in the region, employing somewhere between 7,500 and 8,000 people, it is the case that as companies change and move on, one will not have that local focus. I believe this has the potential to have a long-term negative impact on employment within the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> As the Minister knows, the activities of those companies generate about €3 billion worth of sales out of that region, with most of the activity being exported. About 90% of the goods produced there are exported, so that region has been a real success. It was part of a regional development policy going back to the years of Seán Lemass which was about trying to create a counterbalance between the east and west coasts. One had the airport and a concentration of foreign investment companies and indigenous companies working together and using that critical mass of activity to support and grow. I am concerned that anything that might weaken the potential of the activity there could have a long-term negative impact on the region. Notwithstanding that, many of the ideas that are now coming forward from the new Shannon Group have considerable potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> I am deeply concerned about cross-subsidisation and hope the Minister can discuss that at a later stage. There is other activity that was central to Shannon Development. The Minister spoke about Shannon Heritage and the activity there. He is still leaving open the possibility that this company or its activities could ultimately reside elsewhere. He is leaving it there for the time being. As far as I am concerned, that company needs to remain part of the Shannon Group. Again, if it is to be taken away and its assets, activity and revenue stream goes elsewhere, it will further undermine the future viability of the airport, which is the central aim here. </p>
          <p eId="para_211"> There are a number of other aspects to Shannon Development, such as Kilrush Marina. Sadly, the decision has been taken to sell this marina. While this may be the only way to deal with it, I have met people in the region who would like have seen it remain in State ownership so that its activities could be supported, invested in and increased. Due to the fact that the focus of Shannon Development is on the airport, sadly, a facility such as the marina is not going to get the level of State support it deserves to act as a generator of tourism activity and provide meaningful employment in an area that does not have much employment other than employment on the land. I assume the National Technology Park in Limerick will transfer in line with the other assets of the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> The Minister spoke about the superannuation schemes. He has clarified to some extent his recognition that the provision set out in section 33 is now in section 34 as a result of amendments he tabled in the Seanad. In the course of this debate, he indicated that he intends to bring forward other amendments. I must wait to see what they are and whether they address the concerns we have raised in the Seanad and the concerns I have about the potential impact on those deferred pensioners. Obviously, there is real concern among those who have deferred pensions and those who have yet to receive a pension. Any unilateral act that might happen as a result of this legislation would not be in their interests and would have been opposed by us had the Minister not indicated his desire to bring forward an amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_213"> There is another category of pensioner which has often been mentioned at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and in the Dáil. It relates to a group of employees of the Civil Service, as they were then. They were employed under Civil Service pay and conditions and were asked to transfer to Aer Rianta back in 1969 when Aer Rianta took over the management of Shannon Airport. The former Civil Service staff duly transferred to the new airport company over the following years. They did so at the urging of the Department at the time and on the very clear understanding that their transfer would not in any way involve any worsening of conditions of employment. Office Notice 4/68 was issued. This was confirmed in a number of ministerial statements to the Dáil which stated that in no case would any transferred officer's pension rights be less favourable than if they had remained in the Civil Service. This was on the Dáil record of 5 July 1973. Effectively, nothing could have been clearer in their understanding. I know this has been trundling around the Department for many years through successive Ministers, so I am not making a negative political point directed at the Minister, but it is an issue that should be addressed and about which I intend to bring forward an amendment. If I do, I hope the Minister will treat it fairly and accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> Nothing could have been clearer. The promised legislation was not enacted until 1998 but there was no reference to the staff or their conditions. The commitment had been given on the floor of this House but by the time the legislation surrounding it was dealt with in 1998, the provision was not there to give effect to the intention. I would contend that the people concerned transferred on a very clear understanding and that, therefore, that the State has a duty of obligation to which it must live up. If it requires legislative measures to deal with it, it can be dealt with through an amendment. There was no doubt in anyone's mind that the commitment to maintaining pension rights was unambiguous and no conditions were attached. It was accepted at face value and in good faith by all the staff. It has always been the practice to guarantee pension conditions to all public servants transferred to another State organisation, which is being done in this legislation. Some recent cases include Irish Water and the new Shannon Group provided for in this Bill. Around 25 former Shannon Development staff were given the same guarantee as the Aer Rianta staff. However, in the case of the Shannon Development staff, the guarantee was based on Civil Service staff who transferred to Aer Rianta, and I understand that they are the only group not covered by the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> In the late 1990s, the Aer Rianta pension scheme, which is linked to the consumer price index, CPI, began to fall behind the Civil Service scheme due to a combination of lower CPI and increased pay levels as a result of benchmarking in the public service. As there was cause for concern, the situation was taken up with the Department of Transport in 2002. However, the claim for pension parity with the Civil Service was turned down on the grounds that staff had joined an existing scheme, which made no sense and was never a precondition in my view. Despite the submission of further relevant factors over the intervening years, they were all ignored and it appeared that no proper investigation was ever undertaken by the Department, so each and every submission was answered with the same standard reply. It is worth the Minister's time to have a look at this. The usual reply was that Aer Rianta was complying with its obligations and the Department took advice from the Attorney General on the matter. There was no indication as to the nature of the query raised with the Attorney General and my understanding is that various different efforts to use the freedom of information provisions were met with a refusal to provide the information. That is not unusual, as there is an issue as to whether the release of advice from the Attorney General is permissible under FOI, but it requires a political response and should be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I will give the Minister an example involving members of the airport police and fire service who had worked at the airport. Some refused to transfer to Aer Rianta. They duly retired from the force and were granted and continue to enjoy a 50% pay-related pension. An officer who effectively transferred to the airport would have had a salary of £25,000 in 2000 and a pension entitlement of £12,500. The salary for that grade in 2014 is €52,000 and the pension entitlement is €16,000. The officer who remained within the Civil Service would have had a salary of £24,000 in 2000 and a pension entitlement of £12,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">However, moving forward to 2014, if the salary is commensurate with what it was then, the pension will be €24,500. The person who transferred over would have a pension entitlement of €16,000 in 2014 while the person who continued to do the same job but remained within the employ of the Civil Service would have a pension of €24,500. That is a difference of €8,500, or more than 50%, and it is an anomaly. My understanding is that this relates to approximately 50 people in both Cork and Shannon airports. We would do everybody a service if we addressed that matter during the passage of the legislation. I intend to table an amendment in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> The other provisions are relatively straightforward. We all accept dazzling is a reprehensible practice when one considers the potential impact on the safety of those on an aircraft and those who might be affected if it crashed. It needs to be obliterated. Perhaps there will be media comment on this issue during the passage of the legislation and that may help to address the sale of laser equipment, which sometimes falls into the wrong hands for such a dangerous purpose. The Minister referred to parking by-laws and other provisions and we support all of these.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> I welcome the Bill and the fact that the Government, following a protracted period, has ultimately gotten its act together. It means the management and board of the new company will be enabled to get on with their important work. I wish them well, while recognising the job in front of them. However, I continue to be concerned about the potential fragility of the operation of the airport component of the new company. The original business plan and the Booz Allen report made it clear that for a stand-alone airport to be viable would require between 3 million and 5 million passengers a year. That will clearly not be the case. The business plan was accepted by the Department of Finance and the Minister's Department on the basis that the airport would generate passenger traffic of 1.9 million annually by 2014 and 2.4 million by 2017. This equates to an increase of almost 1 million, but passenger numbers needed to increase by 500,000 by the end of this year. That will not happen and, therefore, I am concerned about the impact of this on the balance sheet and operation of the company. This was recognised in the Booz Allen report if the support of a revenue stream from the activities of Shannon Development could not be incorporated. Perhaps it a technical issue that can be resolved by virtue of where the assets reside in the group rather than in the individual companies, and if that is the case we can move on with some hope that it is not as significant an issue as it might be. However, I would like clarity on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> It is a cause for concern that the support of Aer Rianta International, ARI, is no longer available to the Shannon Group. When one considers how well ARI has performed over the past few years, with profits in excess of €30 million annually, that emphases the loss the airport has taken. Government backbenchers like to suggest that this is because of the 2004 Act. That was not the case, because the Act did not provide for the transfer of the assets of ARI to Dublin Airport. It had not been decided at the time, and a decision was taken by the current Government to provide for this in the enactment of the 2012 legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> I look forward to the Minister's amendments on the superannuation issue, which will be addressed on Committee Stage. I ask him to consider the case I have made regarding the employees who transferred from the Civil Service to the Shannon Airport company. I intend to table amendments on that. I will also table amendments to section 34 similar to those Fianna Fáil tabled in the Seanad. I would like to see the Minister's amendments in advance. If it transpires that they address issues on which I intend to table amendments, we can come to an agreement at that stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_222">The Bill has a misleading Title. It should be about the merger of a number of bodies related to Shannon Airport to streamline its development. This is what the Title would lead one to believe, but instead, the Bill is largely an attack on workers and their pension status. While it deals with the merger of these bodies to become the Shannon Group, this is not what has been a matter of grave concern to the members of the Irish Aviation Superannuation Scheme, IASS, since the legislation was published.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Section 34 provides for the companies of the IASS to unilaterally transfer members into schemes with different terms and conditions. The legislation permits the Minister to determine the acceptability of this new scheme as proposed by the companies. It does not allow such capacity to the members themselves. The new scheme can set the time and conditions of a member's retirement and another scheme can be proposed to amend the new scheme or revoke it as long as the Minister approves. The Houses of the Oireachtas will have a say on the acceptability of any new scheme but, again, the members will not. This is an utterly unacceptable section and has no place in this Bill. We oppose this section generally but we also oppose its inclusion in a Bill which is supposed to deal with something else.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> The major changes to pension schemes provided for in section 34 should have been the subject of separate legislation to the Shannon merger. Had that been the case, the legislation would have provided an opportunity to properly probe, discuss and even amend the relevant legislation. Sticking this section onto the Shannon merger Bill is a sinister and completely unacceptable ploy. It is unacceptable because, first, it bears no relation to the substance of the legislation; second, it will make sweeping changes to pension schemes; and third, the pension scheme to which it relates is the subject of an industrial relations process.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> I have had amendments refused many times because they were deemed not to be in keeping with the spirit of the Bill. The idea that one can call a Bill one thing and then use it to push through something entirely separate is wrong and an insult to the House and the legislative process. If the Minister wished to make these changes, he should have set out to do so in legislation specifically directed at amending the IASS. That is not the Minister's role, and we would also oppose that, but at least it would be a little more transparent. The IASS has 15,000 members, including workers from Aer Lingus and the DAA and some formerly of SR Technics. There are approximately 5,000 active members, 5,000 deferred members and 5,000 retired members. These people are rightly worried about this Bill. It gives powers to employers which change completely how private pensions operate in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> Section 34 must also be considered in the context of the Bill being drafted, published and debated in the Seanad prior to the completion and publication of the deliberations of the expert panel on the IASS. The expert panel has produced its report but it had not done so prior to the last time the Bill was debated in the Seanad on 12 June. We did not know what its recommendations or findings would be, yet the legislation sets down a pathway for companies to remove themselves from the scheme by unilateral transfer of members to new schemes. This Bill pre-empted a panel, which, though flawed, was set up to find a way to solve the pensions problem in Aer Lingus and the DAA. The Minister's actions have muddied the waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> The panel was established to examine complex issues that remained unresolved following Labour Court recommendations in 2013 as well as proposals by the IASS trustee issued at the beginning of this year. The expert panel has made recommendations and these will be considered by workers in the scheme and the trustees.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">It is right and proper that these matters be decided on democratically by the workers involved. They should not be decided on by the Minister or legislation he puts before the House while deliberations are still ongoing. On Committee Stage in the Seanad the Minister stated he could not impose or prescribe a solution to the pensions crisis in the IASS, yet through this Bill he seems to offer an opportunity for companies to remove themselves from the IASS and potentially avoid their responsibilities under it.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> The Aer Lingus and DAA pension is a defined benefit pension. We have all learned the very serious flaws of such pension schemes which are dependent on the performance of the market and which should never have been allowed to promise the payments they did. Aer Lingus and DAA staff benefited from these very attractive pension schemes. In the Seanad it was said they were even used to encourage some workers to retire early. Workers who are facing retirement in the next few years could face large reductions in their benefits. As I stated, the expert panel was flawed, especially in the lack of full consideration of the case of retired and deferred members of the IASS. They have nobody to speak up for them in this process and have had to band together to fight. The deferred members committee was recently allowed a meeting with the expert panel but only four days before the publication of its report and it had little or no impact. If the Bill is passed, why would the companies involved have any impetus to treat the expert panel or the workers' concerns with any urgency or seriousness? They will not. The Bill removes or threatens the pension entitlements of thousands of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The Minister is legislating for the winding down of the IASS by the trustees completely on their own terms. These are profitable, solvent companies that have serious deficits in terms of what they owe their workers in pensions. The Government is a shareholder in this private company. It could be argued that it is legislating in its own financial interests in the case of a private pension fund and the entitlements of private employees. This very dangerous practice by it sets a very worrying precedent.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> The Bill will repeal a section of the Aer Lingus Act 2004 which provides that members transferred out of the scheme should not have less favourable terms. If this section is passed, the Bill will not be in the best interests of the workers or their pensions. There is something very suspicious about how the Bill has been brought before the House and the provisions it makes to undermine the IASS. As my colleague, Senator David Cullinane said, it stinks. Sinn Féin will seek to amend it to delete all changes to the IASS and its superannuation schemes. Without their removal, we cannot and will not support the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_232">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak about the Bill. I represent a constituency that has many current, former and retired airport staff. My agenda in this debate will always be to preserve and create employment but also to treat people with respect and dignity, particularly the former workers and pensioners whose voices must be heard in the debate and the legislation. I will highlight some of the cases I have encountered in recent weeks and some of the letters I have received from pensioners on the matter, detailing the hurt it has caused them and their families. It is welcome that the Minister is in the Chamber because there is an urgent need for him to listen to such concerns and, above all, act on them. The people concerned have worked all their lives, built up the companies and made a significant contribution to them. That is the current position.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> One IASS pensioner wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_234">I am an ex-employee of SR Technics, made redundant in 2009. I am due my pension of €400 per week as advised and confirmed in writing by the IASS pension office. Under the Constitution, I am entitled to my Government pension as well as my occupational pension, as confirmed by the Taoiseach in the Dáil in response to a question as to why the bankers' pensions cannot be touched. [We should examine this issue in the broader debate.] The trustees of the IASS intend winding down the scheme to comply with their legal obligations. Aer Lingus has not complied with the 2012 outstanding court ruling in relation to the pension deficit and is flouting the law of the land with impunity. The Government, as a shareholder of both the DAA and Aer Lingus, is complicit in this appalling state of affairs, as well as other influential shareholders who stand to gain hundreds of millions of euro as a result of raiding my pension, which I was obliged to contribute to when I started in Aer Lingus.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">New pension legislation was enacted in 2013 and this correspondent asked me what impact it would have on his total pension income based on today's calculations and when the scheme is wound up. He says he needs this information to give his wife peace of mind about what she will have to survive on when he is no longer alive, as she will then automatically lose 50% of his occupational pension. He has also asked me to seek the interpretation of the 2013 pension law from the Attorney General, apply it to his circumstances and to advise him on the moneys she is likely to receive in the worst case scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Many others have contacted me on the issue. One constituent who wrote to me sent the same letter to the Minister which read:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_237">Section 32A of the Seanad Bill appears to give wide-ranging powers to the employers of the IASS to transfer members to a new scheme without consultation, particularly to the trustees to unilaterally make amendments to provide for the cessation of benefits and contributions by all members and their employers. This was not previously possible. The Bill is due for discussion, and must not be allowed to go through without a challenge. Section 32A of the Bill appears to be written solely to facilitate the agenda of the employers and the Government via the trustees of the IASS. It appears that my pension is being sacrificed in a bid to sell off the airline.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">These are the views of the people on the ground, former and current members of the schemes. While the Government, in particular the Minister, has stated it cannot interfere in the running of a private, commercial company, it can introduce and condone a Bill which removes all rights of almost 15,000 IASS members. Why was social welfare legislation not used to make changes to the operation of section 50? This would have affected all defined benefit schemes, whereas including the changes in this Bill ensures the changes are specific to the IASS. The recent expert panel findings will be totally ignored if section 32A is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> My constituent's letter also states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_240">The pension I paid for 34 years is being unfairly targeted and the Government is riding roughshod over my pension rights. Section 9 of the Aer Lingus Act 2004 states that IASS members could not be transferred to another scheme on less favourable terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I raise these issues on behalf of the pensioners to highlight the grave injustice against them. They are seen as a weak target and a soft touch. The Minister should listen to those who built up Aer Lingus and SRT, those who have ideas about the further development of the economy and job creation, as well as the pensioners who will suffer massive reductions in their pensions. They have rights and deserve to be treated fairly. The Minister must take up the fight and get on with dealing with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> I turn to the detail of the legislation itself. Its purpose is to establish a new State-owned commercial entity, Shannon Group, to which to transfer the ownership of the Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development. This is the positive part of the legislation. The objective is to build on the combined strengths of those two companies as a catalyst for the development of strategic sectoral opportunities, particularly in the aviation sector, including the expansion and development of an aviation services centre at Shannon. The Bill also provides for a range of other matters, including the Irish aviation services superannuation scheme, which I dealt with earlier. It will create an offence of dazzling the pilots of aircraft with lasers, update airport by-laws, establish a new insolvency regime for aircraft leasing companies and update travel trade legislation to meet EU requirements.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_245">There have been very serious revelations in <i>The Irish Times</i> today on the dysfunctionality and disconnect in the management of our health services. I note in particular the correspondence between the CEO of the HSE and the Secretary General of the Department of Health who, no doubt, was doing the bidding of the Minister for Health. The correspondence was on the HSE CEO's attempts to fill 253 vacant consultant posts nationally. It is now the case that 12% of consultant posts are vacant, which is causing a real crisis in the delivery of services to our people. The CEO was seeking a restoration of what was cut in 2012. The correspondence reveals that the figures produced in the budget to cut health by €600 million were never real. The HSE is at pains to point out in the correspondence that it never signed on for these figures or for Haddington Road notwithstanding that people claimed publicly that it did. It was then expected to deliver on the figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> We had further revelations in the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Professor Donal O'Shea on last week's decision to stop surgery for obesity in St. Vincent's University Hospital and the dysfunctionality the decision involved. The decision will cost lives. These are people who are extremely obese and need the surgery which has been stopped. Professor O'Shea wrote aptly that leadership is absent and chaos reigns. Last week, we had the revelations on the community mental health service where patients are dying in the care of the HSE itself. We had stark revelations on the programme "This Week" on Sunday.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> The foregoing reveals without any doubt that morale is extremely low within the health service. There is a complete absence of coherent management within the service and frontline services and the safety of patients are at risk, particularly in the context of the vacancies across the country in so many consultant posts. Does the Taoiseach accept that the figures produced in this year's budget were false and bore no relation to the reality of what could be achieved by the HSE? Does he still have confidence in the capacity of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to manage our health services?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_98">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_248">I do not accept the Deputy's assertions at all. In areas as significant as the Department of Health and the HSE, there will always be opportunities for differences of opinion to arise. I have no idea how letters between the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE found their way into to public domain. As Deputy Martin is well aware, things like this usually have a means to find their way into the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> I point out to the Deputy that there were 29,000 fewer patients on trolleys last year compared to 2011. The number of adults waiting eight months or more for day-care surgery is down by 99%. I recall that was going to be ended way back in 2004. Consultants now see and discharge patients on a 24-7 basis, saving the State hundreds of millions of euro, an issue that was not tackled in previous years. The establishment of hospital groups represents the most fundamental reform in the health service in decades. With on average one new primary care centre being opened each month, we are moving to community care facilities which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> I saw the article this morning on obesity. I understand that surgery is necessary in a number of these cases. I understand that there was an allocation made for 20 such operations this year and that has been gone through. I do not accept the Deputy's assertion on mental health services. I dealt with this yesterday. The current Government is the first in decades to remove the entire mental health service from being the Cinderella of health services and to make it mainstream. We ring-fenced money for that purpose. I note that the suicides discussed yesterday, tragic though they are in every case, happened in the care of professionals who have been speaking out about these things. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has taken a particular interest in this matter and has been consistent in seeing that the best services are made available to the people who require them.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The HSE has pointed out to the Department of Health the establishment of a reference group to provide support to HSE members and the management negotiation team during the LRC engagement in the context of the MacCraith report, which was published. The Department of Health will continue to work to implement the recommendations of the MacCraith report. The current difficulties with recruitment and retention of doctors relate to a wide-ranging and long-standing set of issues. That was the context for the establishment of the strategic review of medical training and career structures chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith. The review group has issued two reports to date and the final one is expected by the end of the month. It is a fact of life that while these things remain unresolved and we await the further report before taking further action, many of the positions are being filled through applications by agencies. That imposes a higher cost on the taxpayer and public service. This is an issue which requires further attention and it will receive it.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> The answer to the Deputy's final question on confidence in being able to sort this out is "Yes". The serious progress which has been made on the issues I have mentioned which were left lying around for years without attention speaks for itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">The Taoiseach might read the Mental Health Commission report due today. It states the complete opposite to what the Taoiseach has been saying. The commission is disappointed about the health services. Across mental health hospitals and mental health care facilities, 44% of all posts are vacant.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Some €15 million of the €35 million ring-fenced was taken by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly. The report reads as a damning indictment of what has been ongoing in mental health services. The first question I asked was whether the Taoiseach accepted the figures produced for last year's budget were false. He did not reply. What the director general is saying to the Secretary General of the Department of Health is telling when he says the decision is made elsewhere, without formal consultation with the HSE on the final proposals. We saw this last year and all of the problems emanate from the budget which was back-of-an-envelope stuff in terms of the budget negotiations. It is having telling consequences for patients. The Taoiseach mentioned 20 operations in the case of obesity-----</p>

          <p eId="para_276">For some time Sinn Féin has been trying to get the Taoiseach, other Ministers, particularly the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to set out in full the circumstances in which the Minister appointed the founder of and a 50% shareholder in a private health consultancy firm to the position of chairman of the West-North West Hospitals Group. The group then awarded the potentially lucrative public contract for a review and a report on maternity services in that region to the same private consultancy firm in direct breach of guidelines. Despite raising this issue with the Taoiseach and an Teachta Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin raising it directly with the Minister for Health, there has been no full statement on the issue. This flies in the face of the programme for Government commitment that "We will pin down accountability for results at every level of the public service – from Ministers down ... [and] will cut back the waste and political cronyism built up over the last decade". There is no accountability on this issue and it is a scandal that the Government is drip feeding the information instead of coming in and, transparently, doing its duty by telling the Dáil what happened and allowing us to make a judgment on it. My questions concern how the founder of and a 50% shareholder in a private health consultancy firm was appointed as chair of a public body by the Government and awarded a major public contract. Will the Government publish the HSE's review of how the firm was awarded the contract to examine maternity services in the region?</p>

          <p eId="para_277">As I mentioned to the Deputy yesterday, the second question on the Order Paper is a Priority Question tabled by a competent man, the Sinn Féin spokesman on health, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, and concerns that issue. The question reads "To ask the Minister for Health if he will set out in full the circumstances in which he appointed a founder and 50% shareholder in a private health consultancy firm as chairperson of the West-North West Hospitals Group which subsequently awarded a contract to said firm; if the potential conflict of interest was known to him when he appointed the person and, if not, when he became aware of same; the date on which he became aware of the breach of the financial procedures of his Department in the awarding of the contract; the further steps he has taken since the resignation of the person concerned; if he has considered his own position; and if he will make a statement on the matter". If the spokesperson, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, has issues arising from it, he can follow up on them with the Minister for Health. Perhaps Deputy Gerry Adams might communicate more clearly with him.</p>

I was here when that competent man asked the question and it is interesting that the Taoiseach should read it out in response to mine. The Minister did not answer it in full. If he had answered it, I would not be raising it during Leaders' Questions. What are Leaders' Questions about? They are about the Opposition getting answers about this and other issues of grave importance and accountability mechanisms in the public service.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">The circumstances are clear. A public contact was awarded to a private consultancy firm and the founder and a 50% shareholder in that private firm was appointed as head of the health service that gave the contract to the firm in which he was a 50% shareholder. Is that not wrong? He then resigned because of a conflict of interest and the review of maternity services was withdrawn. All of this emerged in a drip-feed of information. The matter was raised in the Seanad and in this House by Teachta Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin and by me with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who told me he had not been briefed on the matter and apologised to me privately afterwards. How is it possible that the Minister for Health did not know when he appointed the chairperson that this person had been the founder, a director and joint owner of the D &amp; F Health Partnership? How much public money was paid to the company? What is the status of the report which recommends cuts to vital maternity services at Portiuncula, Ballinasloe and Letterkenny? Will the Taoiseach assure those living in the west and north west that existing maternity services will be retained fully? Let me give him a wee bit of advice. Why did he not come here or get the Minister to come and make a full statement instead of it having to be dragged out of him like this?</p>

          <p eId="para_296">I want to give the Taoiseach an insight into the vicious assault on workers' wages and conditions which is under way in this country under his stewardship. I want to draw his attention to a delegation present in the Visitors' Gallery which has a keen and personal interest in this situation - a group of workers who did not know last Tuesday morning when they tried to go to work before 7 a.m. that they would be sitting here today. They thought they would be doing what many of them have been doing for years or decades - that they would be out collecting this city's bins. Instead, when they arrived for their ten-hour shift, they were met at the door with a new clock card system. This was a bit of sideshow. They had not heard of this system, but that was not the main issue. The real agenda came after that. They were expected to sign a new contract, with a cut of over 24% in basic wages, not to mention cuts in other allowances, with immediate effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> Let us be clear on this. These workers were not living the high life anyway. They have a modest wage as drivers and an even more modest wage as operatives. They were being asked to take a cut of between €250 and €270 per week for drivers and between €120 and €140 for operatives. How any of these workers could be expected to take a hit is beyond me. This was an orchestrated manoeuvre to undermine the unionised workers, because the employer immediately marched down to the High Court and got an injunction against them and, with the assistance of the local Intreo office, recruited people to take their jobs. The consequence of bringing people in with no training or experience was that the first truck that drove out knocked down and hospitalised Ray O'Reilly, who is in the Visitors' Gallery. The next night, another truck rammed three cars on James's Street and an ambulance and gardaí had to be called. I wonder whether there will be a fatality as a result of these antics. These unsafe practices will have far-reaching consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> The only way the Greyhound company can do what it is doing is by exploiting others to do the work in an illegal manner. What it is doing is making the routes longer and impossible to complete. What happens is that at 5 p.m., when the workers go home, a procurer of casual labour arrives at the car park in Woodies and, like a scene out of "On the Waterfront" selects people to work through the night to clear the bins that have not been emptied.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">It seems extraordinary that workers should be asked to take a cut of between €250 and €270 per week without any discussion or without any notice being given to them. I find it equally extraordinary that what appear to be untrained workers driving substantial trucks have been involved in the kind of incidents the Deputy has described. Clearly, the Labour Relations Commission has an opportunity to get involved here. The machinery of the State has worked exceptionally well in many difficult and sensitive circumstances over the years. I see the workers the Deputy mentioned in the Visitors' Gallery. I would expect that any company, private or public, would be amenable to the machinery of the State becoming involved in a dispute such as this. The danger arising from the incidents the Deputy has recounted is palpable. From the perspective of the Government, the capacity of the State to intervene is through the LRC and other mechanisms. I would be happy to see those mechanisms made available for these workers in respect of the company they are dealing with.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I am glad to hear the Taoiseach say the circumstances are extraordinary, but what I have said is true. If the Taoiseach really means what he says, I believe there will be a follow-on from this discussion. There were discussions under way in the company and there have been three Labour Court attendances over the past 18 months, but sadly the employer has either broken or not recognised any of those decisions. Instead, it has resorted to the costly mechanism of the High Court. A case for this morning was adjourned until next Tuesday.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> It is true that untrained workers are out on the streets. It is true that people nobody knows are being picked up in car parks and brought in to do the work of these unionised workers who pay tax on revenue.</p>

          <p eId="para_308">I want to put my question again. If the Taoiseach and all of us are appalled by what is being done, we must do something. Will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister with responsibility for jobs to get the NERA inspectors to investigate this company to see who these casual workers are, whether they are paying tax and PRSI and whether they have been trained? They are being super-exploited to undermine the work of the men who are here today.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">From what the Deputy says, the situation is even more serious than that. She has recounted that one truck smashed into three cars and another truck got involved in some other kind of incident. If that is the case, are these drivers properly licensed to drive trucks of this size, or should I understand that these are people who are incompetent and unqualified to drive trucks of this scale?</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> The Deputy raised a fundamental point. If workers in a unionised position working for a company were not even informed of the requirement to take a drop of between €250 and €270 per week, it seems extraordinary that this was done without any consultation. The Deputy also mentioned NERA. I will see it is contacted and will also ensure that the LRC is informed of the situation. It has a tried and proven record in many sensitive cases over the years.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">I wish to ask about a number of promised Bills in the health area. We have just had a discussion on the west-north west saga, involving the procurement of a report on maternity services, as well as the circumstances surrounding a shareholding of the then chairman of the West-North West Hospitals Group. The health care initiatives Bill will enable the HSE to set up subsidiary companies. Given all that has happened recently, it is legislation in which most Deputies will be interested and on which there should be prior consultation. Will the Taoiseach give an indication as to when he expects publication of that Bill, which is topical. It is No. 95 in the Government's legislative programme for 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> The health transport support Bill will provide for a scheme to make individual payments to people with severe disabilities who cannot access public transport as a contribution towards their transport costs. This is a very significant issue for those with severe disabilities. When can we expect publication of the Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> I seek information on the human tissue Bill in the context of the very shocking revelations in the <i>Irish Independent </i> today regarding the remains of deceased infants being used for research purposes in universities across the State for a prolonged period. The Bill aims to meet the key recommendations made in the Madden report on post mortems and the retention of human tissue after post mortems without consent. Again, the Taoiseach might indicate when he expects publication of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> The national paediatric hospital development board (amendment) Bill will provide for an amendment to the functions and membership of the national paediatric hospital development board. I ask the Taoiseach to give update me on the Bill, given the importance of the project and its centrality to the future care of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> We had a very damning report this week on the levels of alcohol consumption in the country. The report highlights the high incidence of binge drinking among adults and young people alike. I recall that the former Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Róisín Shortall, was strong in promoting the Bill, but for some reason it seems to have withered on the vine because I do not know where it is. It will provide for minimum unit pricing in the retailing of alcohol products, regulate the marketing and advertising of alcohol and sports sponsorship, provide for a structural separation of alcohol from other products and also for health labelling of alcohol products. Will the Taoiseach indicate what the Government's expectation is in terms of publication of the Bill and the timeline for progressing it through the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">Ba mhaith liom dhá cheist a chur ar an Taoiseach faoi chlár an Rialtais - i dtaobh an homeless prevention service agus i dtaobh free GP care - ach i dtús ba mhaith liom an deis seo a thógáil chun mo chomhbhrón agus comhbhrón Shinn Féin a chur in iúl do theaghlach Gerry Conlon, a fuair bás an deireadh seachtaine seo caite.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> Gerry Conlon, his father Guiseppe who died in prison, Paul Hill, Carole Richardson and Paddy Armstrong were the victims of a grave miscarriage of justice and spent 15 years in prison. As is well known, Gerry, on his release, spent his time working for other victims of injustice. I extend solidarity and my condolences to his sisters and entire family circle. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> The Taoiseach has committed to ending long-term homelessness, including youth homelessness and the need to sleep rough. Yesterday Fr. Peter McVerry warned about a tsunami of homelessness and described the current housing situation as "grim". He said his charitable organisation had seen a tenfold increase in the number of citizens it was supporting. Yesterday the Taoiseach agreed with me that the homeless crisis needed to be resolved. The homeless prevention service, recently established by the Government, is not working. Does the Taoiseach have plans to review the work of that service and, if so, when? </p>
          <p eId="para_333"> Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur maidir le plean an Rialtais i dtaobh free GP care. The Government will miss the July deadline for the introduction of free GP care for children under the age of six years. This was a central plank of the programme for Government and claimed by the Labour Party as a great breakthrough. The Government has already missed the March 2012 date for the introduction of free GP care for those included in the long-term illnesses scheme. Free GP care is supposed to be available for everyone by 2016. Does the Taoiseach expect to keep to that schedule?</p>

          <p eId="para_334">I never met the late Gerry Conlon, but I sympathise with his extended family on his death. I did, however, meet Paul Hill who said on Sunday that those who spoke about Gerry Conlon should look in the mirror and ask themselves some questions. We know that Deputy Gerry Adams was never a member of the IRA, but he has had extensive contacts with people in the IRA for many years. Some of these contacts will know exactly who was involved in the Guildford and Birmingham bombings. Perhaps one legacy from a tragic past might be those who know the truth coming forward, even after the death of Gerry Conlon, to say, "We are responsible; we are guilty; we were under orders." Perhaps the Deputy does not know them, but perhaps his contacts do. Perhaps this might be one of the greatest legacies of the tragedy of Gerry Conlon spending 15 years in prison with Paul Hill and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> I listened to Fr. McVerry speaking in respect of homelessness this morning. He pointed out the many issues which lead to people becoming homeless, including violence, alcohol misuse, psychiatric conditions, etc. As stated yesterday, €50 million has been allocated this year in respect of homelessness and a further €30 million has been allocated for the provision of facilities for those who are homeless. However, there can be no solution to the situation of homelessness which does not involve the building of houses. That is why those in the social housing sector and private construction companies need to get back on the pitch. Regardless of what is done with the current stock of available space, this problem will not be solved without houses being built first. More must be done - whether it be by means of expediting planning applications or whatever - to facilitate that. This issue is the focus of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and the Government, in terms of both the provision of resources and facilitating what needs to be done. The committee with responsibility in this area is working very well and it is constantly reviewing the position. The answer to the Deputy's questions is that one will not deal with homelessness on the scale that exists in this city in particular without providing more housing, be it in the form of social housing, from NAMA or by some other means.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> The deadline that was originally envisaged in respect of free GP care will not be met. However, the Government is working on the matter with a sense of priority.</p>

It is supposed to provide for a scheme to make individual payments to people with severe disabilities who cannot access public transport as a contribution towards their transport costs. In view of the fact that people who are living in remote rural areas and who do not have access to public transport are no longer getting assistance from the supplementary welfare budget and in view of the fact that the exceptional needs payment budget has been reduced steadily by this Government in the past three years, when will that legislation be brought forward?</p>

          <p eId="para_413">I am pleased to have the opportunity, as usual, to outline my expectations to the Chamber ahead of the European Council meeting taking place tomorrow and Friday. This will not be a business-as-usual Council, not only because of what we will discuss - we have several important items - but because of what we will remember. Prior to our opening session my colleagues and I will gather in Ypres for a solemn ceremony at the Menin Gate to mark 100 years since the start of the First World War. It will be a moment to remember all those who were lost in that terrible war, including 35,000 Irishmen. It will also be a moment to remember what the European Union has achieved in our once bitterly divided Continent. I will be honoured to represent Ireland at the ceremony and to reflect on both the past and the future with the 27 other Heads of State and Government in our Union. As we grapple with the challenges of the future, we must not forget the dangers of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> The first session of the Council will take place following the ceremony tomorrow evening. President van Rompuy has made clear that he wants leaders to focus on agreeing a strategic agenda for the EU for the coming five years at that session. This will be a key focus for me at this Council. Having considered our substantive priorities I expect we will nominate a candidate to be the next European Commission President the following day. I have already said publicly that I expect the nominee to be the candidate of the European People's Party, Jean-Claude Juncker.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> The agenda for the meeting is exceptionally full. On Friday the meeting will deal with the signing of association agreements with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova and approval of the granting of candidate status to Albania; the adoption of new strategic guidelines on justice and home affairs; the completion of the European semester 2014 by endorsing the country-specific recommendations; reviewing progress on the climate and energy framework to 2030; endorsing the adoption by Lithuania of the euro from 1 January 2015; and endorsing documents on the maritime security strategy and overseas development assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> I appreciate that there is an understandably high level of interest in the process of nominating a new Commission president and that this has attracted considerable international media coverage. At the informal summit on 27 May my colleagues and I gave President van Rompuy a mandate to undertake consultations on the nomination. These have been ongoing and the President will report back to this meeting. As I have stated, my firm expectation is that Jean-Claude Juncker will be confirmed as the nominee and will go on to be endorsed as President of the new European Commission by the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> I am, of course, acutely aware of the reservations that some member states, most notably our colleagues in the United Kingdom, have expressed regarding the nomination process. Clearly the incoming president must display an understanding of and interest in the sensitivities and relations that some countries find themselves in for a variety of reasons. I am confident that Mr. Juncker has the qualities and experience required for the job. I believe he is committed to delivering on our strategic priorities and to strengthening economic recovery and working to boost employment throughout the Union. I endorsed his election as the EPP lead candidate in Dublin in March and I will continue to support his nomination at the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> There is a danger that at this time of change the Union could get caught up in institutional processes and personnel questions and this must be avoided. The challenge is to focus on the real substance, that is, the issues that matter for the people of Europe and to set a clear strategic agenda for the period ahead. This will be my priority at the European Council. Quite frankly we must respond to the political message sent by voters across the Continent in the European elections who called on us to take the initiative and show clear leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> There is no mystery about what our headline messages must and will be. Jobs and growth remain vital for the future of the Union. We need to drive forward the areas that can make a real difference in sustaining the recovery. In doing so, we must strive to combat poverty and social exclusion. In fighting unemployment in all parts of the Union we must ensure that we get education and training right and that young people are given the skills they need for the modern and digital economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> Completing the Single Market, especially the digital single market, remains a core priority for me. Ensuring that our businesses, in particular the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, can access financing and operate in a supportive environment with the right conditions is essential. The opportunities offered by growth in trade are understood by all and we must continue to progress key trade negotiations, in particular with the USA. Energy security is another vital area essential for growth and the Ukraine crisis has thrown this into the spotlight.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> We live in a complex and globalised world. The EU has a unique role to play as a global entity in an often unstable environment. In focusing on economic growth, we must also ensure that we are not inward facing. The EU must enhance its efforts to shape our external environment in a direction conducive to spreading international peace, security and prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> The strategic guidelines on justice and home affairs are to be considered by leaders on Friday. The process of developing the strategic guidelines started when the relevant Ministers discussed the future of JHA at the informal council in Vilnius a year ago. Since then the issue has been the subject of intensive work. In March of this year Vice President Reding and Commissioner Malmström issued their respective communications setting out what they believed should be contained in the new guidelines. Broadly speaking, there has been little disagreement among member states. Most have emphasised that, following the development of an extensive legal framework over the past 15 years, the priority now should be a period of evaluation and consolidation. As such, the guidelines should focus primarily on ensuring optimal implementation of the existing legal architecture. At the same time Ireland and others have stressed that the guidelines should be flexible enough to allow for further legislative measures where there is clear and objective evidence that these are necessary and that any additional costs are justifiable. Several such issues have been highlighted, including trafficking in human beings, people smuggling, cybercrime, radicalisation and foreign fighters. These are challenges which the Union cannot address alone. The guidelines reflect this and call for improved links between the EU's internal and external policies. It is also worth noting that the guidelines to be adopted are less prescriptive than earlier programmes. This should allow the Commission and the Justice and Home Affairs Council more flexibility over the next five years. It is also expected that there will be some discussion on horizontal issues like data protection and free movement. We are actively participating in the data protection reform package which remains under negotiation. The EU Council is likely to highlight the importance of these discussions. I expect that Heads of State and Government will also affirm free movement as one of the fundamental freedoms of the Union, while also noting that possible abuse should be sensibly tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> The 2014 European semester process will be concluded on Friday when the European Council endorses the country specific recommendations, CSRs, to member states. Ireland is a full participant in this year's arrangements. Deputies will be well aware of the process from the good engagement which has taken place at committee level. The semester process brings together the different strands of the EU's stronger post-crisis economic governance arrangements. The key focus is on development and implementation of jointly agreed measures to support growth and jobs. We agree priorities at EU level and we apply them at national level.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> The Commission presented its CSR package on 2 June. These were informed by member state submissions and by the 17 in-depth reviews already produced in March under the macroeconomic imbalances procedure with one for each of the 16 member states identified in the alert mechanism report as being at risk for such imbalances and one for Ireland following our exit in December from the EU-IMF programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Following presentation by the Commission, the CSRs are settled within the Council on a comply or explain basis. This means the Commission's proposal stands unless a qualified majority of member states support an amendment. The Commission can also, of course, agree sensible changes to its own proposals. </p>
          <p eId="para_426"> Last week's meeting of employment Ministers on 19 June settled the CSRs relating to employment and social policies. Finance Ministers on 20 June settled the CSRs on budgetary and economic policies. The General Affairs Council then yesterday approved an integrated set of final CSRs for endorsement by Heads of State and Government at this week's European Council. These will in turn be reflected in a final Council recommendation adopted by finance Ministers in July.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> There are seven CSRs for Ireland. They address measures in the following areas: restoring balance to the public finances, including through the adjustment to be agreed in October that will bring the headline budget deficit below 3% of GDP in 2015; improving the cost effectiveness of health care spending in line with the future health reform programme adopted in 2012; strengthening our active labour market policies consistently with the work being taken forward by Intreo and SOLAS under Pathways to Work; developing in this context a more robust response to the particular challenges associated with intergenerational transmission of poverty through what are described as low-work-intensity households; streamlining our supports for SMEs and entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on access to finance, in line with the direction set under the Action Plan for Jobs; completing the work under way to deal with the post-crisis legacy of non-performing loans in the financial sector; and, finally, pressing ahead on legal services reform, including through the Legal Services Regulation Bill that we are committed to enacting this year. It is clear that the overall emphasis here sits well with policy orientations that we have already firmly established at national level, particularly through the medium-term economic strategy, the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Some minor technical and drafting issues were raised with the Commission. It was, in turn, happy to agree suitable amendments through the work of the committees that prepared last week's meetings of employment and finance Ministers. That is why we see these CSRs as broadly sensible policy orientations. They point in the same direction we have set for ourselves. That is what we should expect from the European semester process, and that is why shared analysis supporting shared conclusions is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> As part of its consideration of the semester, the June Council will also agree further steps in the area of regulatory fitness and performance, REFIT. Essentially, this means striking a better balance between the goals of EU regulation on the one hand and the administrative burdens it can impose on the other, particularly for SMEs, which will create most new employment. President Barroso spoke about this in last year's state of the Union address when he spoke about the EU needing to be big on big things and small on smaller things. Discussions on Friday will be informed by a new communication from the Commission on REFIT. This will set out welcome progress in the three key areas of withdrawing unnecessary propositions, simplifying what is in place and repealing what is out of date. The Commission has also produced an important scoreboard that will bring transparency to ongoing monitoring of progress. I will continue to support a high level of ambition for the REFIT programme that is consistent with a stronger overall emphasis on improving the business environment for job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> The Council will also take stock of the progress being made towards the final decisions to be made in October on the new climate and energy framework for 2030. A lot of work still needs to be done to address the issues that have been raised by member states in the discussion to date. Ireland faces a most serious challenge in meeting targets for 2020. The challenge will be more serious for 2030. The matter will be the focus of serious discussion and negotiations in order to make it possible for future governments to be able to reach realistic targets by 2030. Ireland is working closely with the Commission to reach a common understanding of the issues facing us in the transition to a low-carbon economy, including the issue of emissions due to our specific agricultural profile. This has already been acknowledged to be of particular importance to Ireland in the last European Council. The focus of this Council's discussions in this area, however, will be on energy security. I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, to say a few words on this and on the external relations focus of the European Council in his statement. I will, of course, be happy to report back to the House after the European Council. I have shortened my contribution by almost three minutes.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">This week's summit could be a profound one in setting the direction of Europe for the next five years. It will decide whether the European Union will again be a driver of growth or will double down on policies that have failed and will continue to fail. At every stage in the past five years, Europe's leaders have failed to show the urgency or ambition desperately needed by countries caught in the greatest economic crisis for 70 years. There has been a stubborn refusal to accept when radical changes are required. Worst of all, real damage has been done to the foundations of a Union that can only be effective when members understand the need for solidarity and respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> Today, the Union in general and the eurozone in particular are faced with the threat of deflation and falling growth rates. Even the most optimistic projections assert that employment and living standards will be squeezed for the foreseeable future if current policies are maintained. The economic forecasts of every international agency claim that the European economy is weak and threatened with significant problems. The President of the European Central Bank, ECB, has stated that extraordinary measures may soon be required to stop a new recession. This is the background to the summit and it demands a far more serious response than we have heard so far from the Taoiseach and his fellow members of the Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> In area after area, the Union's policies are simply not delivering. There is no plan for charting a new course. The European institutions badly need new leaders who understand the scale of the crisis and are not obsessed with justifying the <i>status quo</i>. It is the discussions about who these leaders will be that will determine whether this summit is a success or another missed opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> What is worst about the process so far is that the debate has all been about who will get the jobs and not what they will do in the jobs. There is no doubt that last month's elections saw large portions of the citizenry of Europe expressing their dissatisfaction with the current situation in the Union. As with most election commentary, many people are describing as winners groups that came nowhere near winning majority support. Let us get some perspective. In Ireland and Europe as a whole, more than two thirds of people voted for parties and candidates that were broadly pro-EU. Those who want to roll back or even abolish the Union did well in many places, but they are the voice of the minority.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> In our election, the exit poll confirmed what had been shown in every survey that had been carried out in recent years, namely, the Irish people want a Union that is more effective in doing the jobs we need it to do. We do not want the right-wing vision of a skeleton free trade area that maximises competition and minimises work and living standards. We do not want the extreme left vision of massively regulated markets and anti-business rhetoric. We do not want to dismantle the hard-won progress achieved over the past 60 years. What the Irish people time and again have said is that we want a Union that works better, understands the need for deep reform, takes credible action to support growth and living standards, talks less and achieves more.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> The first and most effective way of responding to this is in the three major appointments that are due to be finalised in the coming weeks. I have nothing against Jean-Claude Juncker, but it is absurd to claim that he is somehow the democratic choice of the people of Europe to head the European Commission. He has a substantial claim to be considered as the leading candidate for the role of Commission President, but to assert that any alternative would be anti-democratic is to adopt the fiction that these were a single pan-European election where citizens voted for both the Parliament and Commission at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> It remains the case that Ireland has not received full justice in its case for relief of the full impact of bank-related debts. Every independent report has made the point that the scale of these debts was significantly affected by EU policies that were doggedly enforced between 2008 and 2010 but have since been abandoned. Had the policies in place today been adopted then, there would have been no Irish bailout. During those years, Jean-Claude Juncker was president of the Eurogroup and was frequently a loud public advocate for the failed policies that caused so much harm. Did the Taoiseach seek commitments from Mr. Juncker before announcing his total support for the man? Did he seek assurances of support for Irish debt relief or did he just jump on the bandwagon? Equally important, did he seek any information from Mr. Juncker about how he proposed to revitalise the Commission and the Union?</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> I welcome Mr. Juncker’s intention to push for a social impact assessment to be added to the narrow financial provisions of existing budgetary regulations and bailout provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">If this is a signal of a wider radicalism, then he may be a good choice. However, his failure to comment on a wide range of other issues, such as the complete inadequacy of the banking union, is a cause for concern. He is also right that dealing with Britain’s threats to the Union must be a priority, but he is wrong in talking about the Single Market as the priority in this regard. If what we get is further pressure to gut the EU budget, to withdraw from vital social and economic activities, then it will be a major step backwards. It is hard to fault Mr. Junker for not saying more because our own Government has given no specifics about where it sees the future development of the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> The choice for Council President may actually be just as important as the Commission post. The national presidencies are becoming less influential and the Council has so far failed to work effectively in its much larger format. The agenda is increasingly getting diverted into formalities and minor incremental changes driven by advance agreements brokered between a handful of states. The Council must reassert itself as a forum where all states are treated fairly and where decisions do not have to wait for a major crisis before anyone does anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> As far as the role of High Commissioner is concerned, a strong personality who shows a commitment to European values and respect for the views of all member states is required. In the past year there has been much talk of a united European approach to shared foreign policy concerns, but this has been reflected very little in reality. Catherine Ashton has done well in setting up the European External Action Service. What has not yet happened is the adoption of a common understanding of what the service can achieve for us all. Whoever takes her place must be of senior status and capable of obliging the larger member states to take him or her seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> The summit is due once again to talk about the crisis in Ukraine. Due to the sheer number of international crises at the moment, Ukraine is receiving much less attention, but the situation continues to be very grave. For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, a European country has been unilaterally partitioned by a powerful neighbour which believes in its right to dominate all former satellites. When taking control of Crimea, Russia adopted a strategy of acting on the ground while angrily denying it in public. Since then the Russian President has confirmed that his government was lying when it denied actions by its troops. It is difficult to see circumstances in which Russia can be forced to reverse its partitioning of Crimea from Ukraine; however, we cannot let that distract us from recognising what is now happening there. The free media in Crimea is being destroyed. Civil society organisations are under daily pressure. The largest ethnic minority, the Tatars, are facing particular discrimination, with Russian efforts to actively undermine the traditional commemoration of the exile of Tatars under the Soviet regime. It is in fact a criminal offence to publicly state in Crimea that one disagrees with the Russian annexation. In eastern Ukraine, Russian-supported groups continue to push for the further partition of the country. The last time Europe saw such intimidation of a small state by a nuclear superpower was in 1968. Our history teaches us what can happen when a powerful neighbour refuses to respect the territorial integrity of a weaker state. We must stand with the democratically elected government of Ukraine and say to Russia that it will face real consequences if it continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> The ongoing use of gas supplies in support of state policy by certain countries has only reinforced the need for Europe to get serious about both energy independence and climate change. During the recession there was a major backing away from these objectives in much of Europe. Our Government has been a leader in trying to make sure that whatever is done about sustainable energy comes nowhere near matching the rhetoric. Energy is on the agenda for the summit and it is to be hoped that it will involve some concrete action.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> The summit will also sign off, as the Taoiseach has said, on the latest part of the ongoing European semester process for co-ordinating economic and fiscal policy. This is unlikely to get any attention but it is still very significant. For all the fine talk about supporting jobs and growth, the recommendations to countries that will be agreed by the Taoiseach and his colleagues see a doubling down on the policy of austerity for all. There are places where fiscal reality means there is no alternative to running a tight policy; however, in much of Europe a boost to demand due to looser budgets is exactly what is needed. To try and return to sustainable growth through monetary policy alone is simply ludicrous. It is not credible in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> The European Central Bank’s recent plans are unlikely to have a practical impact unless they are soon followed by full-scale quantitative easing. The bank's president, Mario Draghi, is clearly committed to doing as much as he can, but what is missing can be seen from a stubborn adherence to a policy which continues to suppress demand, leading to low growth, low inflation and low confidence. Why has Ireland refused to join Prime Minister Renzi of Italy in calling for a more growth-oriented approach to budgets? Why have we sat on the sidelines and nodded through recommendations which will achieve nothing but to undermine growth and limit living standards?</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> In starting this summit the Council will quite rightly remember one of those conflicts which made the 20th century the bloodiest in Europe’s history. It is absolutely correct to say that the European Union has given our continent an unprecedented period of peace between states. This should be noted and celebrated at the Council. What leaders would do well to remember is that the greatest cause of the First World War was a failure of leadership. Whether they were dynastic or democratic, Europe’s heads of state and government a hundred years ago could not see where their narrow view of national interests and stubborn adherence to failed strategies was leading them. It was a senseless and destructive war. Historians have shown repeatedly how millions died in a conflict between states too proud to understand their common interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Today there is a deep sense of drift in Europe. The extremes are still in the minority, but they have grown in strength. We cannot afford more of the same - more timidity, more delay. We need the leaders of Europe to recognise the deep crisis to which they have contributed and to commit to reforming both their work and the policies which are so clearly not working.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_448">I apologise on behalf of Deputy Adams, who cannot be here as he is attending a meeting elsewhere, and on my own behalf for my delay in my getting to the House. I was attending the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, at which we were dealing with the upcoming European Council meeting and at which the Tánaiste was present.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> Two weeks ago, citizens right across this State delivered a clear message that they could take no more of the Government’s brutal austerity policies. There was a strong vote against cuts and austerity in both the local and European polls. Sinn Féin elected an unprecedented four MEPs across the island of Ireland. The Sinn Féin MEPs will join a considerably enlarged GUE/NGL group in the European Parliament as a result of increased anti-austerity votes not only in Ireland but in Greece, Italy, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal. Governments must now heed that message and change their political direction. That is the message coming from all those countries and peoples across Europe. People voted for change, yet the European semester and the European Commission's country-specific recommendations are still pushing austerity in Ireland and right across Europe. These austerity programmes have been disastrous for middle- and low-income families. The message following the European elections, not only in Ireland but across Europe, is that people want a different approach. </p>
          <p eId="para_450"> Only yesterday I attended a pre-budget submission by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul at which it outlined its figures for children in poverty in Ireland, who number 200,000. I remember not so long ago when we were talking about 100,000 children. The figures are increasing all the time. The society outlined its vision for change, involving a much more inclusive Ireland, and it talked of the Government building recovery, but asked for what and for whom that would be. It talked of the vision it wanted for Ireland. Many Members would share this vision and the society's view that things have to change and that we have to approach matters differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> We have a two-tier Europe. The growth or stimulus necessary to create employment has not happened. Many economies across Europe are in the doldrums. The time for hiding behind the European Commission - the most vocal voice for austerity in Europe throughout the crisis - is over.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">People will no longer buy that. That was the message from the people in the recent elections in terms of the candidates for whom they voted.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> The EU Commission is right to point out that there are still issues with the health services, legal services and mortgage arrears situation in this State which this Government is failing to tackle seriously. While I am critical of the overall tone of the recommendations, I do not have a problem with some of them, including the need for progress on reducing legal services and drugs costs and so on. I recently raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. It is often stated that Ireland has a small population and should work out its own drugs bill. Is there a need for a European-wide review of the cost of drugs?<i>
						</i>Many drugs are produced by pharmaceutical companies located in Ireland yet drugs cost more in Ireland than anywhere else across Europe. The argument for this is again our small population. While the companies that have located here are welcome, Ireland has no separate agreement with them in respect of pharmaceuticals produced here. While I would welcome health savings, how and at what cost will these be achieved?</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> In relation to social inclusion, there is little doubt that increased labour market participation remains the best route out of poverty and that affordable child care will continue to play an important role in this context. I know from speaking to lone parents in my constituency and from parents in general that the problem is the unavailability of affordable child care. One of the recommendations of the CRS relates to child care. We are all agreed on the need for address of the child care issue and the Minister has undertaken to examine this area but what exactly is being done? This issue was identified years ago yet there has been no real roll-out of affordable child care facilities in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> We are at the top of the class in terms of austerity but at the bottom of the class on most other issues. The folly of this State signing up to ever-increasing budgetary control from Brussels is becoming clearer every day. At the end of the day, one can take what one likes from this report but there is a democratic deficit within the EU. This is being said not only by people in Ireland but by people across the EU. We know that there is a disconnect between the European institutions and people across Europe regarding the European project. This is being said not only by Sinn Féin and the Independents but by other organisations across Europe that are dealing with poverty. This needs to change. </p>
          <p eId="para_456"> In my view, we are only going through the motions here today. Unless there is substance in terms of what Government is doing, we will continue going through the motions. The Commission has its job to do but so does every Irish Government, which must be to stand up not alone for people in Ireland but people across Europe who are feeling the backlash of austerity. Right now that means standing up to Brussels and telling them the days of dictated austerity are over. The mandate recently given to Sinn Féin's four MEPs shows that the people are not inclined to accept Brussels word so easily. While it could be argued that the Sinn Féin vote in the recent elections was smaller than that of other parties, its vote across Ireland was huge. People are responding to what Sinn Féin is saying not alone about Ireland but also about Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> On climate and energy, I note that this European Council meeting will discuss the climate and energy policy of the EU. This is one of the greatest concerns for people. As we become more energy dependent, access to safe and reliable energy sources is, of course, of fundamental importance. An over dependence on energy sources from other countries can massively undermine the sovereignty and decision making powers of a state. Ukraine is a strong example of this. There is a need for Ireland to get its act together in relation to energy production. One of the gravest threats our planet is facing is climate change yet the naysayers continue to say this is simply a reaction of the planets and has nothing to do with man and his actions. The impacts of climate change are being felt every day on every continent. Therefore, as a State we need to look at reducing our carbon emissions. Ireland and the EU need to demonstrate leadership in tackling climate change. The development of the EU's 2030 climate and energy policy framework will play an important role in shaping the future of Europe and that of the rest of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Reports indicate that to keep temperature rise below 2o Celsius, the EU needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2020 and at least 55% by 2030. To achieve this, we need binding targets at national and EU level. We must ensure EU policies on renewable energy do not drive up demand for damaging land-based biofuels. The massive expansion of biofuels brings few or no climate benefits, while putting additional pressure on scarce natural resources and negatively affecting people's right to food. I ask that thee Taoiseach call at the Council meeting for the introduction of binding targets for carbon emissions reductions in the EU and to follow that up with the introduction here of binding targets as part of a climate change Bill. I ask that he also highlight the need for a genuine and robust cap to limit the use of land-based biofuels, which are negatively affecting food supply and production, particularly in the developing world. We know of countries where biofuels are killing off the environment, leading to an increased cost for foodstuffs in those countries. There is a need for all multinational companies to publish reports on all the work they do in countries where they have operations, including the environmental impact of their work, human rights concerns and taxes paid. This is especially necessary to highlight the work in developing countries. Consumers have the power, in terms of their spend, to influence the action of companies and many want to choose ethical strong companies that conform to their beliefs, but finding this information is difficult. Would the<i>
						</i>Taoiseach be in favour of the EU compelling MNCs to publish these country by country reports and will he raise this matter at European level? As things stand because these reports are not available it is not possible to identify the countries involved in this practice. It would be helpful to Europe and, in particular, consumers if these reports were available.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> On the foreign affairs front, the Middle East process is in crisis. As part of the drive to restart negotiations in the Middle East Israel agreed to release 104 veteran Palestinian political prisoners. However, last month Israel refused to release the final batch of 26 prisoners, which supposedly led to the collapse of the process. I welcome that the Tánaiste spoke out against Israel's actions in breaking the talks preconditions. There are currently 240 Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike because of Israel's continued use of administration detention, which basically amounts to internment on remand. Many have been on hunger strike for more than two months and 40 are now in a critical phase and in hospital. The Israeli Parliament is seeking to enact legislation which would permit the force feeding of these prisoners. The draft law, also denounced by human rights groups, is due to be debated in the Israeli parliament on Monday. Force feeding is a horrific procedure and is in total contradiction with internationally accepted medical ethics. We know from our own history that Irish republican prisoners died or suffered serious long-term health problems having been forced fed. We also know that others in Ireland have been force fed, including women's rights activists and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> The breaking news today is that 63 Palestinian prisoners, having reached a deal with the Israeli prison authorities and with the approach of Ramadan, have decided to suspend their hunger strike action. While facts are bare at the moment, I hope a deal, which could facilitate the ending of this hunger strike and save the lives of these prisoners, has been struck.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">It is important that Ireland exert whatever pressure it can on Israel to end its systematic use of administrative detention. This includes raising the issue at EU level. Does the Government support the demand for an end to the administrative detention of Palestinian prisoners by Israel? Will the Taoiseach raise the matter with other European leaders?</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> I am sure the Taoiseach heard about the disappearance and suspected kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers from an Israeli settlement in the occupied Palestinian territories. We all hope they will be released safe and sound. However, since the disappearance of the three, the Israeli military has killed three Palestinians and raided over 1,150 locations, including homes, charities, universities and offices, and detained 330 Palestinians. One of those killed was a 14 year-old child who was shot with live bullets in the chest by the Israeli army. Another was a 22 year old who was also shot by live bullets, this time in the head. Searching for the missing Israelis does not give Israel the right to kill three Palestinians, as has happened in the past week. It is collective punishment of the Palestinian population in the occupied Palestinian territories. </p>
          <p eId="para_463"> I hope the Taoiseach will raise these concerns, namely, the hunger strike, administrative detention and the collective punishment of Palestinians, at the Council meeting. Ireland needs to stand clearly on the side of human rights and equality.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_464">I am sharing my time with Deputies Shane Ross and Ruth Coppinger.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> I appreciate that the Taoiseach has had to go, but there are a few points I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, will pass on to him. I really want to focus on two areas. First, in a speech, the points made in which have been much repeated by the Government, the Taoiseach referred to the priorities of growth and employment, both for Ireland and the wider European economy. In the speech he also referred to the need to combat poverty and social exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> What I really want to flag is the question of whether the policy of producing jobs and growth is failing to acknowledge or address what is now becoming apparent as a really savage assault, under various guises, on the wages and conditions of workers in both the public and private sectors. It is either a direct assault by employers on pay and conditions or an assault through the use of so-called labour activation schemes which, in reality, create a new pool of cheap labour, whereby people are working for nothing or next to it. Obviously, this exacerbates the increasingly widespread phenomenon of the working poor. Often people work for very long hours, up to 60 hours a week, and are still poor and unable to pay their bills which are increasing daily with new charges, including water and property charges. Those who are making all the efforts to go out and work and want to contribute are suffering and having their wages and conditions assaulted by what is really a pincer movement involving governments and employers in the private sector. It means suffering for workers. Moreover, there is insufficient growth and a very serious danger of deflation or a lack of growth, as alluded to by Deputy Micheál Martin. In other words, there could be growthless jobs. This phenomenon is apparent in the economy and becoming increasingly apparent across Europe. One can create jobs, but if staff are not paid properly, they will have no money to spend. Thus, economic growth will not be generated. This can be part of a dangerous, deflationary cycle, which is exactly what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Deputy Clare Daly mentioned Greyhound today. Is it a coincidence that Bausch &amp; Lomb opts for a 20% pay cut and tells staff it will close down if they do not accept it, while Greyhound is implementing absolutely savage pay cuts of 20%? There are vicious tactics against the workers. Another dispute that has not attracted many headlines concerns what is happening in Cement Roadstone Holdings. There has been a dispute for several weeks in which the employers are seeking pay cuts of 20% for workers who are earning between €25,000 and €30,000 a year. They already took massive pay cuts in 2012. Now, a further pay cut of 20% is being sought by the company against the workers who are on salaries far lower than the average industrial wage. CRH is stating that if they do not accept the cuts, it will shut down the plants. It is taking out injunctions against the workers whose conditions should be contrasted with those of the bosses of such companies. As Greyhound is incorporated in the Isle of Man, we do not even know how much profit it is making. This year the director of CRH had a package, agreed at the AGM, of €7.2 million in total. This is unbelievable; it is the highest in the industry across Europe. As part of a remuneration review referred to at the AGM, it was said the executives of CRH were underpaid. This is unbelievable at a time when the wages and conditions of workers are being slashed with bully-boy tactics. What are the Government and European Union going to do about this savage assault by employers which is now an accelerating race to the bottom in terms of wages and conditions? Nothing is being done by governments about this and they are actively encouraging it with so-called labour activation schemes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_241">
          <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_468">I have little quarrel with what was included in the Taoiseach's speech. One could not really quarrel with it because there was not very much in it. My problem is with what was not in the speech. The most important point discussed by the Taoiseach was the nomination of Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker. He told us very little about this and what he said was very disappointing. I agree with Deputy Micheál Martin who said he hoped the Taoiseach had not sold his vote for nothing. I hope that, in return for offering support to Mr. Juncker, the Taoiseach demanded a price for his vote that was in the interests of Ireland. There is no evidence of this. Employing a couple of platitudes, all he said was that Jean-Claude Juncker had both the qualities and experience required for the job and that he was committed to delivering on our strategic priorities to strengthen economic recovery and work to boost employment, etc. This is meaningless stuff. I want to know what happened, why the Taoiseach gave his vote, what Mr. Juncker will do for Ireland and what the Taoiseach achieved for Ireland in giving his support to Mr. Juncker who is, after all, an old EU insider. I hope the vote was not just sold for nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> I am disappointed by the obvious enthusiasm with which we so readily appointed Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, not because of who he is but because we abuse the Commissioner positions ourselves. When appointing his own Commissioner, the Taoiseach should not appoint the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, or another Fine Gael loyalist. Let me list the nine Commissioners whom we have appointed to date, not because they did not have ability but because they all had something in common: Mr. Patrick Hillery, Mr. Richard Burke, Mr. Michael O'Kennedy, Mr. Peter Sutherland, Mr. Ray MacSharry, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, Mr. David Byrne, Mr. Charlie McCreevy and Ms Máire Geoghegan-Quinn. All are former members of a Cabinet. The position of Commissioner is regarded by political parties as just one of the spoils of war to be distributed when a vacancy arises to party members whom they wish to get rid of — in some cases, it is quite obvious — or reward for loyalty to them or, particularly, their leaders. I have no great ambition to keep the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government at home, but I believe it would be extraordinary and wrong to appoint someone straight from the Cabinet. The Taoiseach should look outside it. To start with, why should he not reappoint Ms Máire Geoghegan-Quinn? I do not know. That she is a Fianna Fáil appointee should be absolutely immaterial. Why should he not look beyond Cabinet Ministers and politicians to someone with real expertise, commitment and interest in the European Union? There is no sign that this is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">It is immediately apparent there is an unseemly squabble going on in the public arena about whether it goes to Labour or to Fine Gael. That is not the way a position of this sort should be considered or treated. It should be treated on its merits and, if the Taoiseach is not capable of moving outside the very narrow circle of political insiders, then a different means of appointing a European Commissioner should be introduced in this country. It is a shameful list that we have, not because they are not people with ability but because they were appointed for the wrong reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> The other thing I would have liked to hear the Taoiseach talk about, and he did not, is that this is the second anniversary, almost to the day, of him coming back in triumph and saying he had ensured huge sums of money were on the way from the European Stability Mechanism to the Irish banks. That is now a hollow claim and, as far as we can see, it is not going to happen. There is a little bit of shadow-boxing going on and an application is apparently about to be made, but there is not a hope in hell of us getting money from the ESM for legacy debt for the Irish banks. It is particularly difficult given the Minister for Finance is travelling to European capitals and to Washington, saying the banks are in good shape and do not need recapitalisation, and given AIB itself said last week that it is going to pay back every penny of the €20 billion. How can we ride both these horses at this time by saying we want money for that but also that the banks are healthy?</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> I believe the banks need money. We should admit it and then go to Europe with that case. We should say that recapitalisation is on the way and that we want some EU money for that. At the moment, however, the Taoiseach gives the impression he will not say boo to a goose, particularly when he is in the European capitals.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruth Coppinger<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_473">The Taoiseach's speech gave no signal of any change in European policies following the very clear message from the electorate throughout Ireland and Europe, where anti-austerity forces achieved major victories and many of the traditional parties of austerity were dealt a severe blow, for example, in Spain. The message from the electorate could not be any clearer. People are sick and tired of a constant diet of austerity after six years, but what is being dished up is a continuing menu of austerity. It is incredible that the Taoiseach is also clapping on the back Jean-Claude Juncker, who is an austerity hawk, who opposed any extension of deadlines for Ireland or any other country, and who is an ex-governor of the IMF. It seems that nothing has been taken on board by Fine Gael following the elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> Of course, this is not about individuals. It is about how successive Governments, under Fianna Fáil previously and now this Government, agreed to tie the hands of this country and other countries in dealing with our economic problems. In the country-specific recommendations under the European semester, there will be a limiting of the statutory scope for discretionary changes by Government, so if there is any attempt to move away from the policies of austerity, the Government's hands are tied. There will also be an attempt to raise revenues through broadening the tax base. Given we assume it will not be corporation tax, it will be more taxes on working class people such as the water tax, the property tax and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> The Taoiseach mentioned a number of issues that are lined up for Ireland. The first is improving the cost effectiveness of health care spending, which is code for more health cuts, and the introduction of universal health insurance, which I predict will be massively opposed by families in this country given it is essentially a "pay or die", American-style system. The Taoiseach spoke of active labour market policies consistent with work a person has been doing before, which means more JobBridge and more so-called labour activation measures. He also referred to concern about an intergenerational transmission of poverty. The Government has not shown any concern about the transmission of poverty and it is sitting idly by while there is a homeless crisis and while thousands of young people emigrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Most worrying for people suffering from the mortgage crisis is the completion of the work under way to deal with the post-crisis legacy of non-performing loans in the financial sector. Again, this is code for speeding up repossessions. As public representatives, we are already seeing this, and more and more people are contacting us who are either renting or living in houses that are about to be repossessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> The wealth does exist in Europe to wipe out mass unemployment, youth unemployment and all of the other social problems that are blighting the people of Europe. Unfortunately, however, it is concentrated in few hands. This wealth has to be expropriated and used to solve these fundamental problems to create a Europe for the millions rather than the millionaires, which the Taoiseach seems to represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> I want to finish on the issue of foreign policy because I note the Taoiseach said there will a ceremony in Ypres to commemorate the First World War. The EU is at a stage where this is very relevant because wars are being waged in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine. While the Taoiseach is commemorating the First World War with the other leaders of Europe, he should have a chat in particular with David Cameron about the role of the British Government in the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003, which has played a key role in the current problems in Iraq, where sectarian war is now breaking out. Instead of one Saddam Hussein, Western imperialism now faces a whole number of Saddam Husseins plus the rise of al-Qaeda-type organisations like ISIS and a shake-up of the entire region, with tragic consequences for the ordinary people of Iraq. Now that it is clear that weapons of mass destruction were an absolute lie and that oil was the basis of the invasion, it is incumbent on the Taoiseach to point out the role both of some of the member states in Europe, along with Bush in America, in that illegal invasion of Iraq and the consequences it has had for today, where divide and rule tactics are now being used between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims in the interests of Western imperialism.</p>

          <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_479">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach for facilitating me and Opposition Members. I am pleased to see the Taoiseach is prepared to allow us all to co-operate when it comes to EU matters as it is hugely important we do not bring our domestic disputes to the European stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> The selection of the President of European Commission is an immensely important decision that will be taken at the summit this week. I would like to lend my voice of support to Jean-Claude Juncker for a number of reasons, first, because he is a good candidate. There has been a lot of personalisation of this appointment in the past few days, some of it in very bad taste. Jean-Claude Juncker is somebody who has served his country with distinction as Minister for Finance during periods of unprecedented growth in his country, perhaps an example that could be followed by others, and has been a very effective Prime Minister, one of the longest serving in the world. He is somebody who, I believe, has shown great leadership at European level. He is also somebody who can help Europe to meet the many challenges that lie ahead, particularly when it comes to reintroducing a strong delivery of growth, opportunity and job creation to Europe's citizens and in terms of completing the Single Market and the sort of structural reforms that will genuinely lead to better prospects for Europe's citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> Second, I believe it is important because, whether we like it or not, all of the main European parties signed up to this concept of a top candidate - the Socialists, the Liberals, the EPP, the Christian Democrats, the Conservatives and the Greens. It is not an ideal format or solution but it was a small step in the direction of bringing greater democratic legitimacy to the election process at European level. The winners of that contest were the EPP and, therefore, I believe it is appropriate that Herman van Rompuy, as President of the Council, sought to find a consensus, or at least a strong majority, to endorse the leadership of Jean-Claude Juncker in the European Commission over the next five years. All of the political parties signed up to that and I believe it would send a very negative signal to the citizens of Europe if they suddenly decided to go behind closed doors and back to the sort of smoke-filled rooms we are used to, in order to arrive at a cosy consensus and to nominate somebody whose name was not before the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I am not sure how many European citizens were aware of Jean-Claude Juncker, Martin Schulz, Guy Verhofstadt or any of the other candidates. The answer is probably not very many but the fact is that the political parties committed to it and it is appropriate for them to see that process through. My preference would have been and remains a direct election to the presidency of the Commission. It is something Ireland should loudly advocate. We should not be afraid of treaty change in the future to allow that to happen. A direct election would engage all the citizens of Europe and give them a direct voice as to who will provide leadership in the European Commission and indeed across all of the institutions in the future, so it is something we should advocate for. </p>
          <p eId="para_483"> I agree very strongly with Deputy Ross. The opportunity exists for Ireland to do something radically different in terms of how we appoint our Commissioner by looking outside the old political circles and examining a new format. Some of my colleagues on the Independent benches in the Seanad have put forward a Bill in the past week that would give this Parliament and one of the Oireachtas joint committees the power to scrutinise the Government's nominee for the position of Irish Commissioner. I think this would be a really positive step forward. There is no reason the Government should not accept that proposal. I think we should be looking outside the old political circles. I do not believe it should be a member of Cabinet or that there should be horse trading between the two parties in Government to arrive at a sweetener, a prize or essentially an exit route for somebody from the current Cabinet. It would make sense and possibly bring this Government some way to the promised democratic revolution that quite clearly has not occurred. It would allow this Parliament to have a say in the sort of characteristics, traits, skills and abilities we would like to see in our Commissioner. </p>
          <p eId="para_484"> The role of European Commissioner cannot be overstated. It is a hugely important role where the future of the European agenda and the growth and job creation agendas will be shaped and where Ireland can have a powerful voice. It should not be a retirement home for failed or unpopular politicians or used to make room for new blood in Cabinet. It should be somebody of calibre and expertise who can serve this country and all of Europe's population with distinction.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_485">I thank all the Deputies for their contributions. The Taoiseach has asked me to update the House on a number of areas. I will also respond to some of the points made in the time available to me. Deputy Martin raised the issue of Ukraine and noted the seriousness of it. Further progress with regard to our relationship with Georgia and Moldova is a very important development that will take place at the forthcoming summit in the next two days. These countries have been directly affected by much of what has happened in Ukraine. That summit will see the signing of the deep and comprehensive free trade agreements covering all goods and services that form part of the association agreement with each country. The signing of these agreements will take place in the margins of the European Council. It is important to recognise that along with Ukraine, both countries were part of the Eastern Partnership summit and the partnership arrangement with the EU. Ukraine decided not to go down that route, but Georgia and Moldova have gone down it and have continued to find ways of deepening their relationship with the EU. The signing of these agreements at the summit across the next two days recognises the progress they are making and looks to find further ways of deepening their relationship with the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> I welcome the election of Petro Poroshenko following the presidential election on 25 May in Ukraine. The EU and Ireland have always stressed the importance of those elections. Many colleagues, including Deputy Boyd Barrett, have on a number of occasions raised issues relating to the legitimacy of elections in Ukraine and how an inclusive administration and government can be put in place. A point I made then and would re-emphasise is that the first step in doing this was the holding of elections, particularly the presidential election that took place. President Poroshenko has a very strong mandate in respect of reforms and doing all he can to turn Ukraine into a modern and democratic country in which different identities and minorities are respected and recognised by their own administration. We look forward to meeting the president in Brussels at the signing ceremony on Friday and to hearing his assessment of the current situation and what can be done to deliver a peaceful situation, particularly in light of the security situation in eastern Ukraine, which remains extremely serious. </p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The Heads of State and Government may also examine the worrying developments in Iraq, which were touched on by Deputy Coppinger. Ireland and other EU members are greatly concerned about the rapid deterioration of the situation in that country. It goes without saying that the activities of the forces there not only raise great concerns about Iraq but raise very grave concerns about the stability of the wider region. It therefore remains critical that all Iraqi political leaders come together in a more constructive and inclusive manner to overcome this crisis, reject sectarianism and promote national unity for all Iraqis.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> The European Council will also be asked to endorse a decision to grant EU candidate status to Albania. This is the very first step in Albania's acquisition of candidate status and its attempt to find a way to deepen its relationship with the EU while, at some point in time, developing the ability to begin the process of applying for accession to the EU. I visited Albania earlier in the year and saw at first hand the progress it has made, but also how much more it wants to do and how much more needs to be done. The granting of candidate status, which the European Council will be asked to endorse in the next two days, is a very important incentive and signal with regard to Albania's maintaining the work it is doing and continuing with its reform agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Deputy Crowe raised the issue of energy security. The March European Council asked the Commission to prepare a detailed plan in respect of this, looking in particular at how energy dependency can be reduced and what needs to be done from an interconnectivity perspective - in other words, the sharing of energy between different member states. The Commission issued its strategy relating to this on 28 May. It looks at medium and long-term approaches to energy efficiency and will also look to prioritise the needs of member states most likely to be affected by possible supply disruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> Deputy Martin asked how the EU would respond in a more long-term fashion to the crisis that has afflicted everybody. He also made the very fair point that despite the amount of attention garnered by extremist gains within the European Parliament, such people are still in the minority, and larger parties of the centre still have a majority. A strategy will be published by the European Council which will be very top-line but which will make very clear choices regarding how the EU will respond over the next five years to the social effects of the crisis with which we are all dealing.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> In respect of the points made by Deputy Ross relating to retroactive bank recapitalisation, I would make the point that Deputy Ross campaigned against Ireland joining the very fund which is capable of supplying this when he campaigned against the fiscal governance treaty that took place two years ago. He is criticising Ireland with regard to how we may handle an application to the fund, but let us be very clear that he did not want Ireland to have the ability to join that fund when he campaigned against the fiscal governance treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> Ireland has a very proud tradition of sending forward Commissioners who have done a superb job within the Commission - doing their job extremely well and advancing the interests of Europe.</p>

What is very clear, as has been identified in particular by Deputy Creighton, is that the work the European Commission must do in the next five years is absolutely vital. It is in our national interest to ensure we have strong Commissioners who are able to support and maintain the Community method and the interests of all countries, particularly smaller countries like Ireland which require the Community method to work well.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciara Conway<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_495">I am sorry to raise this issue but it is a crisis. This has been building for some time and it could have been avoided. I am sorry that anybody who has a serious skin complaint and who lives in the area served by University Hospital Waterford, UHW, does not have access to a dermatology service. There is no consultant dermatologist to serve the needs of the people who normally attend the former regional hospital and this is a disaster. Mr. Buckley is a retired consultant dermatologist but before he retired he went on record saying his position was untenable due to the volume of work. He stated: "It is a critical incident waiting to happen".</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> This is not only about a lack of consultants. Earlier this year, I raised the issue of up to 3,200 clinical letters that had yet to be processed. They have still not been typed or delivered. That means news, whether it is good or bad, has not been delivered to 3,200 people and that is not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> Against the background of the letters waiting to be typed, a respected consultant having retired and another consultant going on maternity leave at the end of May, two posts lie empty while a third post is vacant. I have a letter from Mr. Richard Dooley, the hospital manager, which points out that a recruitment process is under way to fill the vacancies. The third consultant post is being re-advertised because it was not filled the first time and the word in Waterford is this was because the package being offered was not attractive enough. One has to wonder if the process will be better second time around. Is a position in the dermatology unit in UHW more attractive now than it was previously? In the meantime the dermatology unit in the hospital remains closed. Anybody with a serious skin complaint such as melanoma - the south east has one of the highest rates in the State - must be referred to a unit in Cork and this only applies to high priority cases. This serious issue needs to be addressed urgently.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaudieCoffey" eId="spk_248">
            <from>Deputy Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_498">As a Waterford Deputy, I also have serious concerns about the cessation of dermatology services at UHW. In the past year, concerns were raised in the south east when the reorganisation of hospital groups was proposed. We received assurances from the Minister for Health and departmental officials that essential services would not be downgraded, which was welcomed. The Minister visited the hospital only recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> However, the issue Deputy Conway has rightly raised relates to the future of dermatology services at UHW. I fully support what she said. Dermatology is a key health service for people suffering with serious skin problems, including melanoma. Regular monitoring of these lesions is essential for successful patient outcomes. UHW has three consultant dermatologist posts. One consultant has retired, one has gone on maternity leave and, in correspondence I have had with the HSE, it says it has consistently advertised for a third consultant without success. This has resulted in patients from the south east being referred to South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital Cork, SIVUH, increasing the burden on the dermatology unit there. This is not good enough. It behoves us as public representatives to voice serious concerns on behalf of the people of Waterford and the south east. These need to be addressed without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_500"> I am not sure what the HSE and the Department can do because if they are advertising and no applicant is successful, we have a serious problem. One applicant was successful but when the contracts were drawn up, the applicant pulled out and we were left with no consultant in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> General practitioners have raised concerns regarding a backlog of communications between them and the dermatological unit in UHW. The HSE has addressed this by providing additional resources. However, this is a cry for help by two Waterford Deputies. The issue has been ongoing for a number of months. There has been continual correspondence between us and the HSE. It is with reluctance that we have brought our concerns to the House but we are seeking the direct intervention of the Minister of State and the help of the Department of Health to ensure these important positions are filled as soon as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Alex White)<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_502">I thank the Deputies for raising the issue and for affording me the opportunity to advise the House of the arrangements made for patients requiring dermatological services at UHW.</p>
            <p eId="para_503"> I assure the House that the HSE and the South-South West Hospitals Group are committed to ensuring the continuation of dermatology services for people in the south east, notwithstanding the temporary staffing and recruitment difficulties being experienced in UHW. I understand every effort is being made to fill the three vacant consultant dermatologist posts, two of which arose recently, one due to a retirement and the other because of maternity leave. Efforts are continuing to recruit temporary replacements until the posts are filled on a permanent basis. In the interim, UHW has put in place an arrangement with the dermatology service at South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, SIVUH, in Cork. Arrangements for urgent referrals for a dermatology service, for example, melanomas or suspicious pigmented lesions and patients requiring emergency dermatology review, should be referred to the dermatology department at SIVUH or to the nearest dermatology unit, as appropriate. Patients with an established diagnosis of melanoma will be followed up at a designated clinic in the dermatology department, SIVUH. In addition, complex dermatological cases such as those receiving biologic agents for psoriasis will be followed up at a designated clinic in the dermatology department, SIVUH.</p>
            <p eId="para_504"> I understand UHW will ensure ongoing and close linkages between its dermatology department and that of SIVUH through the making of arrangements for the clinical nurse specialist from UHW's dermatology service to attend the Cork-based clinics. In addition to the SIVUH arrangement, the hospital is also endeavouring to make arrangements with other hospitals in the surrounding regions to take some of the patients. All these arrangements will be kept under review and GPs and patients-clients will be updated accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_505"> I share the hospital's regret and that of the Deputies that, in the current circumstances, dermatological services have been curtailed. It is important, however, to acknowledge that the HSE has the capacity to recruit consultants and other front-line staff where there is an established service need, notwithstanding the requirement to reduce the numbers employed across the health service to meet fiscal and budgetary targets. In light of the difficulties experienced by some hospitals in filling certain consultant posts, the Minister for Health established a working group, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structure. The review is aimed at improving graduate retention in the public health system and planning for future service needs. To date, the working group has issued two reports. The first report submitted in December focused on improving the training experience for trainees. The second report submitted at the end of April reviewed career structures and pathways following completion of specialist training. The final report, which will deal with workforce planning, is due to be submitted by the end of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> I again thank the Deputies for the opportunity to discuss this pressing matter and I assure them and the House that the HSE is making every effort to secure the services of permanent consultants. While the closing date for applications for the third vacant post is tomorrow, 26 June, I understand the HSE hopes it may recruit two consultants under this process. In the interim, every effort will be made to continue to provide urgent services to patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_507">While I thank the Minister of State, I regret that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, is not here because the response was in direct contravention of what we were promised in the Higgins report. According to the response, the dermatology clinical nurse specialist will travel to Cork for clinics. We were told patients would not have to travel but that consultants would come to them. What plan, if any, is in place for the specialists in Cork to come and serve the needs of the people of Waterford? This is not good enough. It is not the health care to which we are entitled and which we were promised in the Higgins report. It makes a mockery of the name change to University Hospital Waterford which rings hollow in the wake of this mess. The south east, in which the hospital in Waterford is the leading cancer specialist centre, has the highest rate of skin cancer in the country, yet we do not have a consultant dermatologist. I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to do something very quickly to address this issue because this is contrary to what we were promised in the Higgins report.</p>

            <p eId="para_508">The HSE knew full well for some time that one consultant was due to retire, with the other to go on maternity leave, while the third post was advertised. I appeal to the Minister of State to use his good offices and officials to ensure the HSE will do all in its power to ensure the consultant posts are filled as soon as possible. The irony is that the dermatology unit in University Hospital Waterford was physically upgraded. The physical infrastructure is in place and we need the specialised staff which the people of Waterford and the south east deserve. We were assured of this in the House and correspondence when the new hospital groupings were established. Although we were informed that when specialist services were required in University Hospital Waterford, they would be delivered, it is not the case. While the HSE has stated it is a temporary problem, a temporary problem can lead to a very serious one for many patients who do not have access to these essential services. I want the Minister of State to take on board what Government Deputies are saying and ensure the problem is addressed as soon as possible.</p>

The closing date in respect of the third vacant post is tomorrow and the HSE hopes to recruit two consultants under this process. The matter is being addressed as urgently as is required and I accept what the Deputies said. On the future of dermatology services in Waterford, Deputy Paudie Coffey's statement on the physical infrastructure in the dermatology unit in University Hospital Waterford demonstrates the intention on the part of the HSE, the Government and the Minister to maintain these critical services in Waterford. There is no question about the intention to maintain these important and necessary services in Waterford. This is a temporary difficulty in the recruitment of consultants. As I indicated, there are issues about workforce planning, to which Professor MacCraith's report is relevant. I very much hope the recruitment process can be expedited and fully accept and share the Deputies' views.</p>

            <p eId="para_510">I am grateful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for selecting this matter which is of concern to all Members. We are aware that the Mental Health Commission has published its 2013 report today and of the concerns expressed in it about the 91 admissions of children to adult mental health facilities during 2013. We all have experience of the impact on families and individual children of the requirement to seek such help. We are aware of the inordinate difficulties with which families must contend, first, in dealing with a child who has mental health problems and, second, in dealing with a system that is, regrettably, not always as sympathetic or proactive as one would wish. To find, in addition to all of these problems, that so many children were placed in completely inappropriate adult settings at a time when, it appears, there were vacancies in the appropriate settings is particularly concerning.</p>
            <p eId="para_511"> The report indicates that although in 2013 there was provision for a maximum of 48 beds, they were not filled at all times. People were told beds were unavailable because the child and adolescent community mental health, CAMH, service does not operate an emergency response service, particularly at weekends. While we support the Government's ambition to develop and deliver up to 108 beds by 2015, we must judge the service based on what is available today. All the indications are that even the limited number of 48 beds are not in use full time and not accessible by those who need them.</p>

            <p eId="para_512">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue which, unfortunately, we have been raising for over a decade and a half. During that period the professionals have expressed concern about the proper care of children in need of psychiatric in-patient care. Having children, some under ten years of age, in the same ward as people aged 30 to 90 years is deemed by all psychiatrists, psychotherapists and general mental health service staff to be totally unsuitable and detrimental to their recovery. We must be concerned about the high number of children being admitted to adult psychiatric units. In 2013 there were 91 admissions to adult units, involving 83 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_513"> A Vision for Change 2006 included the recommendations of the expert group that mental health inpatient services for children up to the age of 18 years be provided only in dedicated child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units. The HSE has failed to meet the code of practice on the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001, as drawn up by the Mental Health Commission. The code of practice specified that from July 2009 no child under the age of 16 years should be admitted to an adult inpatient unit and that the same should apply from December 2010 to any child under 17 years and from 2011 to any child under the age of 18 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_514"> The length of stay varied. In this regard, Deputy Seán Ó Feargháil was correct to raise the issue of emergency care at weekends. With 60 beds available and 48 in use, 12 were available, although the statement told us none was available. Some 105 beds are promised by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_515">Perhaps the Minister of State might comment on the progress he expects to be made on the plans. I also draw attention to the fact that in the original plan 20 beds were to be provided in the mid-west region, but that has not happened and we are told it will probably not happen at all now. The Minister of State might have some information on this.</p>

            <p eId="para_516">I thank both Deputies for raising the issue for discussion. The Government has prioritised the reform of mental health services in line with A Vision for Change and is committed, in particular, to the delivery of more and better quality care in the community. To this end, funding of €70 million and 890 posts were provided to develop community mental health services in 2012 and 2013. In budget 2014 the Government again committed to ring-fencing a further €20 million for 250 to 280 posts to be recruited by the end of 2014. This means that despite serious resource pressures overall, funding of €90 million has been made available since 2012, specifically earmarked for new mental health and suicide prevention initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_517"> Acute inpatient admissions of children and adolescents are prescribed in A Vision for Change as being to age appropriate acute inpatient units which are approved centres registered with the Mental Health Commission. The provision of inpatient beds is an integral component of the range of services required to appropriately meet the needs of young people. Interventions are provided through community mental health teams in the first instance and, if required, access to the relevant inpatient service is provided. Nationally, inpatient bed capacity has increased from 12 beds in 2007 to 56 at present. There are 16 beds in Dublin, 20 in Cork and 20 in Galway, an increase of 400% in seven years. In 2008, 25% of admissions of children to HSE acute inpatient units were to age appropriate child and adolescent acute inpatient units. By 2013, this had increased to almost 80% of admissions. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, considers - and I agree - that this is still not acceptable, nor is it in line with Mental Health Commission regulations which require that all children under 18 years be admitted to age appropriate acute inpatient facilities, except in exceptional circumstances. However, Deputies will agree that significant progress is being made on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> The admission of children and adolescents to age appropriate child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, acute inpatient units reflects best practice and supports better outcomes for individuals. This is a key priority for the HSE and its service plan for 2014 includes a specific quality key performance indicator to ensure the focus remains on meeting this objective. Community child and adolescent mental health teams are the first line of specialist mental health services for children and young people. They provide acute secondary mental health care in the community. The assessment and intervention by such teams are determined by the severity and complexity of the presenting problem. The ring-fenced funding allocations for CAMHS I have outlined allowed for the provision of an additional 230 posts in 2012 and 2013, of which 80% are in place. Recruiting to the remaining posts is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_519"> The foregoing is proof in real terms of the Government's commitment to the continued development of mental health services for children and adolescents. It is in this context that the Minister of State will examine in detail the report of the Inspectorate of Mental Health Services to determine the scope for further improvements and ensure the HSE can continue to make progress towards achieving the desired best practice as resources permit.</p>

            <p eId="para_520">I accept that progress has been made. I also accept the expertise of my esteemed friend, Deputy Dan Neville, who has campaigned in this area for many years. However, people's eyes glaze over when they hear talk about the millions of euro expended in it. What they want to see is tangible improvement. They want to their adolescent children being able to find centres where they can be cared for when difficult and traumatic circumstances mean that care cannot be provided at home and to ensure the safety of the child and the family. All Members of the House went before the people to campaign for the amendment of the Constitution in the children's rights referendum. We said the rights of children had to take centre stage. I would love the Minister of State to provide the House with a commitment that in 2014 no child under the age of 18 years will be committed by CAMHS or any other State agency to an institution which is not age appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_521">I, too, recognise that the Government has allocated considerable funding to mental health services as promised and that progress has been made. However, I question the effectiveness of the HSE in using the funds to obtain maximum improvements to services. Does the Minister of State accept that one of the key aspects is to establish an emergency service, especially at weekends? Of all admissions, 23% took place on Saturdays and Sundays when emergency services were not available. If emergency services were to be introduced immediately, this would go a long way towards correcting the issues Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl and I have raised. We urge the Minister of State to ensure the moneys allocated to the HSE are applied to emergency services.</p>
            <p eId="para_522"> It is not a large number of children we are discussing, but it is a vital cohort for whom the service must be provided. I again draw attention to the concerns of the people who know about the admission of minors, some of them children under the age of ten years, to adult mental institutions. These children are in serious need of inpatient care. We do not want to see people going to mental institutions and units, but on occasion it is absolutely necessary. These are acutely ill persons in need of the maximum treatment leading to recovery. If we were even to get a commitment to the introduction of emergency services today, it would be progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_523">I thank the Deputies for their contributions. I understand Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl's point that sometimes people's eyes glaze over when figures are provided. Behind the figures, however, lies a considerable improvement in the real and actual experiences of people who need the services. For example, where more staff and resources are provided, even though we describe them to the House in terms of numbers, considerable improvements in the way the service is received are experienced by those who need it. I accept what the Deputy said about the objective of ensuring no child under 18 years should be admitted other than to an age appropriate, acute inpatient facility, other than in exceptional circumstances. That is the objective the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is committed to achieving.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> Deputy Dan Neville makes the point about the actual use of funds, which he understands very well. He is right to say those who know the services should always have their views taken into account and implemented as far as possible. Something in the order of 17,000 children are availing of CAMHS and all community teams screen the children and adolescents referred to their services on the basis of urgency of need. Children and adolescents in need of an urgent appointment are seen as a high priority, as one would expect, while those with a lower acuity may have to wait longer.</p>
            <p eId="para_525"> I accept what was said about the configuration of services and the importance of emergency services and will communicate everything the Deputies have said to the Minister of State who is very engaged with the issue and on which she has made considerable progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_527"> It is a very serious matter that nine clinicians in the area of mental health in the Carlow-Kilkenny, south Tipperary area have withdrawn their confidence in the HSE's management of the service. They cited nine suicides in the area over a period of just 17 months, as revealed in an investigation aired last Sunday on RTÉ's "This Week" programme. I have raised this as a Topical Issue, while our party leader raised it with the Taoiseach yesterday, because the HSE and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, must account publicly for the fact that these clinicians believe their concerns have not been taken seriously, despite being raised repeatedly.</p>
            <p eId="para_528">In a letter received by RTE under freedom of information, the nine doctors wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to express "serious concerns" about local services in light of the nine fatalities. The doctors questioned the safety of governance in the service and said they felt devalued and ignored in their attempts to raise their concerns internally in the HSE. That a group of front-line clinicians should feel strongly enough to co-sign such a letter is alarming. The clinicians highlighted nine deaths in the period from August 2011 to January 2013. What makes this most worrying is that they raised their concerns first in November 2012 and by the following June they were writing to the Minister of State to say that those concerns had not been properly addressed. The clinicians said they were not informed of the outcomes of HSE reviews of these tragedies. The fatalities concerned included three suicides of inpatients by the same means, four suicides in home-based settings, and a further suicide in a crisis house.</p>
            <p eId="para_529"> I have a number of specific questions. Did the Minister of State act on the consultants’ call to intervene with the HSE to ensure proper investigation of incidents and that review findings would be properly communicated and appropriate reforms implemented? Did the Minister of State accept the contention of the HSE briefing document supplied to her, which claimed the fatalities in the service are not out of line with figures for the preceding 11 years, citing Central Statistics Office statistics for Counties Carlow and Kilkenny and south Tipperary? What does the Minister of State say to retired consultant Alan Moore, who said on RTÉ that CSO figures do not reflect the number of suicides occurring in hospitals, which he believes is unusually high? Can the Minister of State confirm that an investigation is being carried out by the Irish Mental Health Commission into governance structures within the service and that a separate review is under way by Dr. Colm Henry of the national lead clinical directors programme? </p>
            <p eId="para_530"> It is also serious that the local consultant group has described clinical governance systems in the area as unsafe and that participation in them would be a dereliction of duty. This is serious. These revelations came just three days before today’s publication of the annual report of the Mental Health Commission, including the report of the Inspectorate of Mental Health Services. That report shows that only 44% of psychiatric hospitals and mental health facilities are compliant with staffing level regulations. I ask the Minister of State to answer the questions posed.</p>

            <p eId="para_531">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. I thank the Deputy for raising this issue for discussion. As Deputy Lynch has indicated on several occasions in the past, the HSE has been reconfiguring mental health services in the Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary, CKST, area to provide a modern mental health service in line with the recommendations in A Vision for Change, including the strengthening of community mental health teams for adults and children. It is acknowledged by the HSE, and by the Minister of State, that the CKST mental health services have undergone a radical reform programme and that considerable work has been done to date to achieve this fundamental objective. Significant additional investment has been provided to underpin this reform. It is also noteworthy that the mental health resources allocated to CKST on a per capita basis are some of the highest in the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_532"> Arising from concerns at both clinical and management level in this area, two reviews have been undertaken in recent months relating to governance and patient safety issues in the CKST service. In 2013, the HSE quality and patient safety, QPS, division commissioned a review of governance structures within CKST mental health services. The findings of the review are being finalised. In March 2014, on the initiative of the Mental Health Commission, the Inspectorate of Mental Health Services carried out a targeted intervention in safety and governance for service users in CKST. The outcome of this comprehensive review of service delivery in the area will be reported to the executive of the Mental Health Commission as soon as possible. </p>
            <p eId="para_533"> Following completion in 2013 of a national QPS audit by the HSE of sudden and unexplained deaths within community mental health services, the HSE mental health division has progressed implementation of its recommendations over the past year. These include engaging with the Mental Health Commission to consider how to encompass the expansion of community services within the notification process and offering additional training in HSE incident management policy and procedures to staff in the mental health services, which incorporates a formal recording and reporting process. I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, who welcomed the significant governance and management changes which have taken place in the CKST area in recent times, a process that is continuing. We recognise also the significant leadership being provided by consultants, other health professionals and HSE management in this process. We share the common goal of having the best possible mental health services in this particular area, as we are doing elsewhere in the country. We urge, therefore, that all parties in the CKST region facilitate implementation of the recommendations that may arise from the reviews when these are finalised, in tandem with co-operating on all remaining policy and service management issues reflected in A Vision for Change. Our priority must be to continue to strengthen the community mental health teams in this area to meet the needs of all service users.</p>

            <p eId="para_534">I appreciate that the Minister of State is delivering a response on behalf of his colleague, but the critical questions were about whether the Minister of State had acted on the consultants' call to intervene with the HSE to ensure proper investigation of the incidents and whether the review findings would be properly communicated, with appropriate reforms implemented. The Minister of State said that the findings of the review commissioned by the HSE quality and patient safety division are being finalised, that the Inspectorate of Mental Health Services carried out a targeted intervention into safety and governance for service users in CKST, and that the outcome of this comprehensive review of service delivery in the area would be reported to the executive of the Mental Health Commission as soon as possible. This is work in progress and has not reached a critical point. If we were to look at the shelves for matters pertaining to Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary, we would find reports aplenty that have not been acted on. There is a serious problem in progressing with the required speed reviews and reports that are pertinent to the level of service provision in mental health services and across the health services generally, particularly where there is the potential for loss of life. On many occasions we have had documented tragic outcomes in respect of the general hospital network, but we are talking specifically about service users within the mental health services. In the view of the clinicians, there is an inordinate level of suicide in this area. It is a hugely worrying situation when clinicians of experience act with such unanimity. It is an alarm bell ringing loud and clear for all of us to hear. I must ask the Minister of State to speak to his colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and to appeal to her to make the necessary interventions of which I have spoken and to encourage the conclusion of the process of review and reporting and, most critically, to oversee and ensure implementation of all recommendations at the earliest possible date.</p>

            <p eId="para_535">That will certainly be done. The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, will do so. I reassure the Deputy and the House in respect of the apprehension that reports could be prepared and concluded with no action taken. Following the completion of the QPS audit in 2013, the HSE mental health division has been progressing the implementation of those recommendations. As well as the two examples I gave in my initial contribution, I should report to the House on tangible work that is ongoing and critically important in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_536">First, the mental health division has ensured there is engagement with the Mental Health Commission to consider how to encompass the expansion of community services within the notification process. Second, additional training is being offered in HSE incident management policy and procedures to staff in the mental health services, which incorporates a formal recording and reporting process. Third, all executive clinical directors, area directors of nursing and integrated service area, ISA, managers have been written to and reminded of their responsibilities in regard to the notification and investigation of sudden and unexplained deaths, in line with legislative requirements, policies and procedures. Fourth, all of the mental health services are reviewing their internal clinical protocols to ensure the clinical director is formally advised in writing of an incident and that this notification is formally recorded. Fifth, the national mental health division has formally appointed an assistant national director for quality and patient safety and he is formally notified of all sudden and unexplained deaths, in accordance with the policy requirement, with immediate follow up put in train. Sixth, all executive clinical directors and ISA managers have received the final quality and patient service audit, QPSA, report and have been reminded of their obligations in regard to the creation and management of records of incidents.</p>

            <p eId="para_537">I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise the issue of the need for the Minister to provide an update on the provisions in place to assist primary schools in the teaching of foreign languages within our education system. Every Member will know and appreciate the importance of modern languages and of familiarising ourselves with such languages, particularly in the ever more globalised and interdependent world in which we live and in which our economies and societies operate. We also know, and this is clear both from the point of view of experts and anecdotally, that the earlier a person learns a language, the greater his or her ability to soak it up, absorb it and become familiar and fluent with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> I wanted to raise this issue because I visited a school in County Wicklow recently, the Jonathan Swift national school in Dunlavin, and was struck by the efforts being made there to teach the school pupils Spanish. I wish to share some of the comments made by the school principal in an e-mail to me. She said that the children are very much at a disadvantage for their future careers because of the lack of other language skills. To this end, the school was part of the initiative and pilot scheme for modern language tuition, which has since been abandoned. It had built up a lot of resources and skills from being part of this programme, so decided to keep it going using its own resources. The children love learning Spanish and it has improved their attitude to learning Irish greatly, which they now see as another language. This school has been extremely creative. It has a Spanish secretary within the school, it has twinned with a Spanish school and the students come on exchanges. I visited during a recent exchange when there were teachers and students from Spain there. The school has been creative and has developed a culture and relationship with other schools. </p>
            <p eId="para_539"> I understand the modern languages scheme was a pilot scheme and know there is a body of work being done in regard to literacy and numeracy and how modern languages can fit into that. However, there is a need to report progress on this. This is not just my opinion. As recently as the week before last, the Minister for Education and Skills urged more Irish students to learn Chinese and pointed out the importance of Mandarin as the most widely spoken language in the world. He also spoke about how big a market the Chinese market is from the economic point of view. Therefore, I know the Minister and Minister of State recognise the need for educational skills in the area of languages.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> However, when it comes to where we stand globally and in regard to our European colleagues, the situation is embarrassing. An OECD report from last year, June 2013, entitled Education at a Glance, used the school year 2010-11 as a reference point. It found that modern foreign languages account for an average of 6% of compulsory instruction time across the OECD at primary level and 7% of compulsory instruction time across the EU, in contrast to a near negligible amount in Ireland for that age group. When we look at the table on page 18 of that report, we see the "No Grade" that Ireland gets.</p>
            <p eId="para_541"> I know the situation here is further complicated by the fact that our students, quite rightly, learn Irish as well, that there is a limit in terms of the length of the school day and that the Government has focused on numeracy and literacy. I understand the rationale behind that. However, we must recognise the importance of modern languages. We must work out how we can fit this into our curricula and into numeracy and literacy, because foreign languages can be dealt with in that context also.</p>
            <p eId="para_542"> Learning and introducing people to languages at second level, when their European and global peers have been introduced to a foreign language perhaps ten years earlier, puts our students at a disadvantage. The Minister of State and his ministerial colleagues and people in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will have seen that when it comes to trying to fill vacancies, including the PayPal jobs in Louth, there is a demand and requirement for applicants to have a second modern language. While we cannot fix this overnight with our primary system, we can send out a clear message that we want our students to be more proficient in modern European languages and languages like Mandarin Chinese, as the Minister suggested.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_543">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position in regard to the teaching of modern languages. There is considerable investment by the Department in language provision across all levels of education and officials are currently working on the development of a language strategy which will address language learning at all levels of education, including primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_544"> At primary level, the Department's policy, as detailed in the Government's National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy 2011, is that pupils will learn two languages, English and Irish. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently developing an integrated language curriculum for primary schools, in the context of the national literacy and numeracy strategy. A consultation on the draft curriculum from infants to second class is under way and will remain open until 11 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> The new curriculum is drafted in the belief that language plays a vital part in the expansion of the student's conceptual framework and growth of the student's conceptual knowledge, dispositions and skills. The draft curriculum underlines that language learning is a developmental process, in which students engage at their individual rate or pace. Learning languages, whether at home, in an early years setting, in school or in community settings enables children to extend their linguistic experiences and to deepen their understanding of and connection with culture and heritage.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> Within the draft language curriculum, integration is defined in terms of interaction between the three strands of oral language, reading and writing; connecting language across the curriculum; and the transfer of skills learned across languages. Although discrete language skills associated with each strand are essential, engaging with all three strands together enables the child to become a more effective communicator. In this context, it is important to note that Ireland is a linguistically and culturally diverse country which has two official languages, English and Irish. However, most schools and classrooms include children whose home language is a language other than English or Irish.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> Languages, by their nature, are interconnected and developing skills in one language will help children develop similar skills in another language, provided they have adequate exposure to the language and adequate motivation and opportunities to engage with the language. An explicit focus on integration between languages enables children to make cross-lingual connections and to develop an awareness of how language works, which leads to learning efficiencies for students. The intention is that the new integrated curriculum will provide primary students with an excellent base to transfer to learning modern foreign languages in post-primary school.</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Harris<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_548">I thank the Minister of State for that informative and timely reply. I welcome the development of a language strategy and look forward to seeing how that will interact with our numeracy and literacy strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> The Minister of State correctly pointed to the complexity of the Irish education system, in terms of this country having two official languages, both Irish and English, and I understand from engaging with parents and teachers that our curriculum at both primary and second level can be quite jam packed. However, we must look at how we integrate the learning of modern languages within the context of our overall numeracy and literacy skills within our schools. To that end, the most constructive line in the Minister of State's response is the one that stated: "However, most schools and classrooms include children whose home language is a language other than English or Irish".</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> This is about how we harness the potential of the diversity within our classrooms, where we have children in our classrooms whose native tongue is not Irish or English. Rather than making them conform to the school setting, how can we encourage the other children to benefit from the experience of having a linguistically diverse classroom? This is something we should examine. We must get to a point where our students are leaving primary school not as linguistic scholars, but with a foundation in European languages or languages like Mandarin Chinese. This is perhaps a policy decision that needs to be taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_551"> I call on the Minister of State and his officials to look at the example of Jonathan Swift national school, which has not received extra funding. The funding stream has gone since 2012, but it has continued in a progressive and creative way to keep the links with the Spanish school, to keep the twinning programme going and to keep up the exchange. It is not just an exchange of language.</p>
            <p eId="para_552">It is also an exchange of culture. I would also encourage the Department, in the context of European funding for twinnings, to look at how we can encourage more schools to twin with other European schools. Much of the debate to date has been about why the pilot scheme was axed and what would replace it but let us be creative about embracing foreign languages. There are many resources in schools, including secretaries, ancillary staff and students who come from foreign countries. Let us look at how we can harness those resources and pull everything together in the context of our literacy strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_553">I agree completely with everything Deputy Harris has said. The wonderful twinning opportunities available through the Comenius project are only now becoming apparent to a number of schools across the country, which allow for intercultural exchanges between schools across the teaching profession and the student body. I agree with the point the Deputy makes about availing of the opportunity to benefit from the fact that there are many children in school here whose native language is neither English nor Irish. There are significant opportunities that have yet to be developed in that area and we need to think through how we can do that. We should never underestimate the power of schools to innovate and provide new learning experiences with very few resources. I have seen that happening in the context of technology and digital learning in schools. When teachers and students combine their innovative and creative skills, they can be quite powerful. What has been achieved in many schools in the field of digital learning could also be replicated in the area of enhancing foreign language skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_554"> As I pointed out earlier, a new language strategy is being developed which, when finalised, should ensure that language learning is considered as a coherent whole across all levels of education. At primary level the focus of the new curriculum, for the moment, must be on English and Irish. The integrated approach should help children to transfer skills acquired in one language to another language and so establish a sound foundation for the learning of a foreign language in post-primary school. I must reiterate the importance of a continuing focus on the implementation of the literacy and numeracy strategy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_555">I want to deal with the pensions issue primarily but first I wish to make a few points about the operation of Shannon Airport itself. Yesterday I had the privilege of spending the day in Ennis courthouse with peace activists Niall Farrell and Margaretta d'Arcy who were before the court for breaching airport by-laws and who faced the criminal charge of allegedly interfering with the proper use of the airport when they went onto the runway in September 2013. During the course of the trial yesterday the defence presented very compelling evidence which proved that Shannon Airport is not being used in a proper manner and is in fact a key strategic hub and part of the US global military operation, facilitating the movement of over 2 million US troops to Iraq, for example. During the course of the trial, defence expert Dr. Tom Clonan made the point that he had met representatives of Hezbollah who had remarked on the airport in County Clare and spoke of their disappointment with the Irish Government in that regard. What is going on there is not only wrong for the people of the Middle East; it is also exposing Irish citizens, at best, to hostile scrutiny and at worst, to danger by making them targets. In fairness, the judge was very strong in his summing up yesterday. He told the authorities at Shannon Airport that he recognised the seriousness of the matters raised in the court. He said that it beggared belief that this would be treated as a criminal matter and that the authorities at Shannon Airport should deal with it themselves. The peace activists were sentenced to two weeks imprisonment, suspended if they agreed to certain conditions. We all know that Margaretta d'Arcy will not be agreeing to those conditions and will probably end up back in jail. The point that came across strongly was that the Government and politicians generally have ignored this issue, as have gardaí but conscientious citizens will not allow it to be ignored. We can call Shannon Airport whatever we like. We can reconstitute it, as this Bill does, but as long as it operates as a cog in the US war machine, it will never be a proper airport. We must deal with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> I turn now to the most controversial aspect of the Bill, that is, its impact on the IASS pension scheme and specifically the provision which allows workers to be taken out of that scheme without their agreement or consent. As workers have said, the Bill removes all existing safeguards. I must declare an interest here - I am a member of that pension scheme having been an employee of Aer Lingus. I am aware that the Minister justified this in the Seanad on the grounds that it was allowing employers to take their members out of the scheme without being constrained by the fact that it was a multi-employer scheme and that they could negotiate with their members on that. However, that avoids the key problem here, namely that negotiating with and hearing the views of the members of that scheme has been hugely problematic. We saw that clearly with the expert panel and its total lack of engagement. When this Bill was before the Seanad, which was prior to the expert panel producing its report, the Minister said that it would be hard to imagine that the expert panel would not deal with existing or deferred pensioners. In fact, that is exactly what it did. The expert panel excluded existing pensioner from its adjudication. </p>
          <p eId="para_557"> The deferred pensioners have highlighted very clearly the problems that exist. The Pension Ombudsman does not represent them on this issue, nor does the Pensions Board. The industrial relations bodies are precluded from dealing with them under current legislation and the companies will not deal with them. The trustees are on record as telling them to go to the unions because they have all the strength while the unions are telling them to talk to the trustees. This group of people, numbering over 5,000, does not have a voice in the process. To add insult to injury, their colleagues in the UK and US who worked with them under the flag of Aer Lingus will have all of their pension rights secured but this group will not. </p>
          <p eId="para_558"> The deferred pensioners have made the point that this provision in the Bill is unprecedented in that it would allow two solvent companies to wind up their defined benefit pension scheme without fulfilling the minimum funding standard. In effect, it replicates a wind-up which is precisely what the Minister claims he is trying to exclude. That is a real difficulty. People also object to the fact that this legislation is being rushed through just before the recess, as happened with the Social Welfare Bill before Christmas which also impacted on peoples' pensions, despite the fact that problems with this scheme have been well known for some considerable time.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> The Minister made a number of errors this morning in his opening statement. First, he said that the scheme was now closed to new entrants which is not strictly true. What has happened is that the employers are refusing to allow new entrants to the scheme. There is nothing to preclude that from happening other than the fact that the employers have chosen not to allow it. More importantly, the Minister has said at every stage of the debate that the problems with the scheme are primarily the fault of the workers.</p>

          <p eId="para_561">He said that the pension contributions were insufficient, which is incorrect. It is certainly not correct from the workers' point of view. The pension contributions of the staff were set by an actuary and were reviewed every three to five years to make sure that they would meet the benefits required under the rules of the scheme. Pensioners paid into the scheme for a period of 45 years. Over the course of that time, the contribution structure for the pensioners increased seven times for those on an uncoordinated pension. What happened during the same period? The employers' contribution decreased three times. In addition, the actuarial report was based on certain assumptions with regard to the so-called early leavers, namely, the deferred group. These were people who were enticed out of their jobs on the solid promise of an expected standard of living in their retirement years. They had a legitimate expectation and in a recent court case relating to IBM in Britain, it was stated that it is a reasonable expectation which should be protected in law. </p>
          <p eId="para_562"> The major drawback with the scheme was that it never provided for the massive staff reductions which took place over the years. When the actuary and the trustees became aware of this problem they pointed out to the employers that if they continued with their massive staff reductions, significant stress would be placed on the scheme. All of the issues were well flagged. The attitude of the employers was that they did not really care because they were going to establish their scheme in any event. The problem with the legislation before us is that it lets those responsible off the hook. The Bill does not contain any reference to an employer covenant. Instead, the victims, namely, those whose pensions are going to be affected as a result of poor management decisions, are going to be obliged to pay the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> One of the other reasons there is a problem with the scheme relates to a number of ill-judged and ill-timed decisions taken by the trustees of the scheme. The Minister is aware that the scheme sold assets of €1.4 billion in 2001 as part of a freeze and de-risk strategy. This equated to utter lunacy on one level, particularly when one unravels what the trustees actually did. The trustees took the decision to sell a number of assets which were the property of the members of the pension scheme. In other words, it sold a prime commercial portfolio and shareholdings and reinvested the moneys they obtained in sovereign bonds. The latter under-performed massively in the context of the yields achieved. The trustees decided to divest themselves of the assets to which I refer at a time when commercial property prices were beginning to rise. As a result, one of six properties sold by the IASS to IPUT for €58 million was valued at €67 million by the end of last year. This means that the assets of our pension scheme were literally given away for no valid reason. The rent roll on the property in question was €6.5 million annually. The proceeds of the transaction to which I refer were invested in bonds which under-performed. </p>
          <p eId="para_564"> Even more sinister, another property - that formerly owned by IASS, located across the road in Molesworth Street adjacent to the offices of Jones Lang LaSalle and currently home to the Passport Office - was purchased by IPUT. That property is subject to a planning application which includes the Passport Office and the offices of Jones Lang LaSalle. The people who are the potential beneficiaries of the sale were also the advisers to the IASS at the time the sale took place. The decisions to which I refer have impacted upon the pensioners involved and the legislation before us penalises them rather than addressing the issues to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The Minister has previously stated that he cannot interfere in the activities of a private company. The DAA is a fully public company and there is still a 25% public shareholding in Aer Lingus. What is happening here is a case of double standards. It is ironic that soon after the Bill went through the Seanad, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation amended the relevant legislation as a result of concerns expressed with regard to the transfer of Forfás workers to various bodies. Those concerns related to the fact that the terms and conditions of the workers in question would not be sufficiently protected and that remuneration and non-remuneration aspects were not adequately covered. The Government is saying that the rights and pension of those public sector workers can be enshrined but that those of the members of the IASS, who historically operated as part of a public scheme, cannot.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> On Committee Stage we will debate the fundamental problem that exists, namely, that the legislation exposes existing pensioners, deferred members and those paying into the scheme, overrides the limited protections that are currently in place and allows decisions to be made without their being consulted. In addition, those who previously made poor decisions - the employers and the trustees - will not be obliged to take responsibility for their actions. Instead, the Minister is choosing to penalise the members of the scheme. Section 34 of the Bill must be deleted.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_270">
          <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_567">I wish to focus my comments and add to what Deputy Clare Daly has been saying. I am particularly shocked by the position in which the deferred members find themselves. I do not understand how what currently exists could have been allowed to develop under any fair system of judgment or decision-making process. I can only conclude that the deferred members have been treated as they have because they are the weakest members of the pension scheme. The Minister will be aware that in this instance deferred pensions are being paid to people who, as Deputy Clare Daly pointed out, decided to take voluntary redundancy at a stage of their lives when it seemed suitable to do so. They got a deal which seemed fair at the time and were provided with advice by both of the companies involved to the effect that they would receive a lump sum, a small income stream and, on reaching the requisite age, a guaranteed pension. Apparently, a large amount of the latter is now going to be denied to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> I have spoken to members of the pension scheme and some of the leaders of the action group about this matter. They are realistic in that they understand the reasons it may be necessary for them to take a cut, they are of the view that said cut is discriminatory in that it is greater and more damaging than those being visited upon others. Let us move away from the argument about cuts to pensions for a moment and concentrate on the case of the deferred members. As the Minister and everyone else knows, those with deferred pensions are weakest of all those involved. There is nothing they can do because they cannot withdraw their labour anymore. They walked out into a limbo with a guarantee that was based on a certain amount of goodwill and they now feel totally and utterly betrayed because they are the weak link in this tripartite pension scheme. The Minister should reconsider his position. He should not stand aloof and say that it is not his place to interfere in the business of a private company, namely, Aer Lingus, in circumstances where employees or former employees of the DAA are involved. The Minister has brought forward a Bill which specifically changes the terms upon which the latter obtained their pensions. In my opinion, he cannot have it both ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> The position is even worse than I have described. Wherever the deferred members turn, they hit a brick wall. The trade unions have told them to go and jump in a lake because they cannot represent them because they are no longer employees. They have not received a positive response from the Pensions Ombudsman, the Pensions Authority or the Labour Court. Aer Lingus and the DAA have behaved in an unscrupulous and disgraceful manner and left them in a very difficult position whereby they could face near penury. They are completely disillusioned as a result of the actions of the expert panel and the trustees. The Departments of Social Protection and Transport, Tourism and Sport are washing their hands of the matter and are refusing to accept - in any meaningful way - representations.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> What is proposed here is a very cynical manoeuvre. The Minister should think again and actively intervene. He must understand the feeling of real injustice among the members of the pension scheme. Let us consider what is happening to them. They have stated that 50% to 60% of their benefits could be removed as a result of the enactment of the Bill. I accept that it is a once-off situation but they also state that their employer can move them from one pension scheme to another. In that way they will not realise the benefits that will accrue to current members. This is because they will be moved into a pension scheme that has no value in terms of increasing in the future or the others who are currently there will be moved into another pension scheme or will be the beneficiaries of a separate scheme, which will give them a huge advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">They are looking for only one thing. They are looking for fair play and a certain degree of honour, which they were promised in the first place. I simply cannot understand it. It prompts a serious question which all employees in the private and public sectors must now face: how can anyone take voluntary redundancy in the future if the agreement is not worth the paper on which it is written? The people concerned accepted a voluntary redundancy deal. They gave up not only their employment but also their prospects of future employment on this basis. They now find that the requirements of their employers are so ruthlessly implemented that they can no longer depend on them to honour the original agreement, although there may be a case for a reduction or dilution. </p>
          <p eId="para_572"> Let us compare their position with that of those who are continuing in the same pensions scheme. The Act breaks the honourable link that was in place. I appeal to the Minister to recognise this. Why is a difference being made between one and another, if not simply to kick them in the teeth because they are vulnerable? It seems the company is taking on the people concerned because they have absolutely no way of fighting back. What will happen, as sure as night follows day, is that this issue will end up in the courts. The Minister will be aware that an action group has been set up by the people concerned who are desperate and frustrated and they will take him and others to the courts. This is unnecessary; it is discriminatory. I am unsure of what the merits of the case are, but certainly it is very unfair. Approximately 5,000 people are involved in the exercise, in other words, a large number feel unjustly treated. I appeal to the Minister to at least intervene or else repeal or delete section 34 which is the offensive part.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_271">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_573">I am pleased to contribute to the debate. This is a good news day for Shannon, the mid-west and the wider region. I commend the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for bringing forward the legislation. I have always been of the opinion that it is impossible for a person to compete with his or her employer, but Shannon Airport was operating under the Dublin Airport Authority and effectively competing with its employer. My view has always been that this is impossible. It has now broken from these shackles. The fact that it is now independent and doing well is testament to the merits of making it independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> The legislation is set out in a structured way. It provides for Shannon Group bringing together the Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development. This is being done in a structured way. It allows the land bank and buildings available to the Shannon Airport Authority to be used in a way that could bring about synergies. This is closely linked with national aviation policy, on which we are in consultative mode. I gather submissions are due to be made by early July. The policy will allow for an international aviation services centre and a centre for business aviation at Shannon Airport. It has a history, from leasing to repairs, and there are fantastic companies in the area. The fact that we intend to put in place an international aviation services centre and a centre for business aviation is welcome. No doubt these plans will find their way into the final report.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> On passenger routes, Shannon Airport has come a tremendous distance in 18 months. Additional flights have been added recently. On transatlantic business, United Airlines operates a daily service from the airport to Chicago, with 88% additional capacity compared to last year. Delta Airlines operates a daily flight to New York, while US Airways operates a daily flight to Philadelphia and Air Transat a weekly flight to Toronto. Coupled with this business is a long-standing relationship with Aer Lingus which now operates daily flights to Boston and six weekly flights to New York. One sign of positivity is that these flights are now available all year round for the first time since 2009. There are nine new United Kingdom or European routes on which services are offered by Ryanair. Aer Lingus Regional operates a service on a new route to Bristol.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> Let us consider the United Kingdom market. Shannon Airport has always been synonymous with Limerick city and when there are extra flights, it has a major impact on the entire mid-west region. In fact, it has been estimated that over 35% of the people who come from the United Kingdom spend time in Limerick. We hope this figure will increase. The corresponding figure for the European market is over 36%, which is fantastic. This shows the benefit Shannon Airport brings that in the short time since it became independent we have seen a significant increase in the number of airlines flying into and out of it, as well as an increase in the numbers of passengers. A terrific management structure is being put in place, which is most important. I am a firm believer in putting people with great experience into the right positions. Mr. Neil Pakey was manager of Liverpool John Lennon Airport. He has come to Shannon Airport and made it a great success in the relatively short time he has been with us - I hope he will be with us for a long time - under the stewardship of Ms Rose Hynes, chair of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> When I was reflecting on the matter, several points struck me. Recently a report was published by Professor Jim Deegan for the Shannon Airport marketing consultative committee. In it he put forward the case that Shannon Airport should be prioritised to be awarded the fifth freedom of the air. This relates to the freedom of airlines to fly in other countries' airspace. Shannon Airport already provides pre-clearance facilities. I call on the Government to support the calls for it to be given this status on the basis that it has pre-clearance facilities and is now independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> It is an old-fashioned term, but there is a need for balanced regional development. Clearly, Shannon Airport provides a counter-pole to the eastern seaboard, in particular, Dublin. It is fair to say that in any objective assessment of Ireland there is too much of a concentration of the population in Dublin. To ensure a sustainable future for Ireland Inc., we need to provide a counter-pole along the western seaboard in terms of population, tourism and other industries. Shannon Airport is located centrally along the western seaboard. It provides an economic engine for the entire region in bringing people into the country and accessing export markets, which is very much to be welcomed and advocated.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> This is well crafted and good legislation. One of the issues that has come up relates to pensioners, to whom reference was made. Several former employees of both organisations and people with deferred pensions have come to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">They have asked how this legislation will impinge on their rights. This matter relates to section 18(4) of the Bill. Is there merit in the Minister considering how to accommodate these pensioners to ensure their rights are maintained and they receive equity of treatment? This issue is of major concern to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The Bill provides a new dawn for Shannon Airport and the region. The airport must continue to thrive in its core activity, that being passenger transport. It must continue to develop its aviation services in terms of aircraft and training. Will the Minister also consider awarding the airport the fifth right?</p>

          <p eId="para_584">I apologise for interrupting Deputy O'Donnell and agree with his points on balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> The Bill concerns itself with the reorganisation and restructuring of Shannon and Cork airports. It makes provisions for pension schemes and the commercial relationships between the airports and State agencies. However, it also represents a determined intent to transform, modernise and prepare our airports for commercial interaction in what has become an incredibly competitive industry. Across the Continent, airlines are engaged in what can only be described as intense and sometimes vicious competition on particular routes and in particular regions. Due to the European recession, that competition has resulted in difficult business decisions being made, the results of which are well known domestically. Unfortunately, airports like Sligo and Galway no longer provide commercial services, some airlines have gone out of business and routes have been discontinued. For this reason, it is all the more important that the Government should step in during hard economic times and protect vital regional infrastructure. This should not be done stupidly or at any cost by pouring money into chronic loss-making entities, but by investing in regional airports with an understanding of their critical nature to regional economies and of the social benefits gained from direct air services.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> The impact of a regional airport goes well beyond the direct effect of an airport's actual operation on its immediate location. Accessibility through direct air services is important to regional business growth and consumers. If we are to achieve appreciable growth rates in the coming years, we must continue investing in an efficient transport system, one that allows us to take full advantage of the Internal Market and globalised trade. This is what the Bill is concerned with.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> It has not been easy for my regional airport in Waterford and the past few years have been a struggle for everyone involved, but it is fair to say that the work and patience displayed by the Minister and departmental officials are paying off. Like others, I have made the case in recent years that the Government's financial investment in Waterford Regional Airport would eventually produce an economic dividend for the region. The figures supplied to me in respect of the first five months of this year strongly indicate this is the case. I hope they represent a turning point after a number of difficult years.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Flybe operates two commercial routes to the UK from Waterford - one to Birmingham and the other to Manchester. There was an increase of 74% in passenger traffic on those two routes in the first five months of this year compared with the same period in 2013, amounting to more than 12,000 inbound and outbound flights. The take-up of seats or passenger load figures continues to increase. The increase in the Birmingham service is 70% plus and the newer Manchester route is improving steadily, with an increase of more than 60%. Some of the factors in these substantial increases are good marketing, an uplift in the UK economy and, perhaps most importantly, a determination on the part of the Minister, the Department, the airport's management and everyone involved to make this work. It is working. Slowly but surely, Waterford is proving business can be found if an airport sticks at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> This is not to say that there are no unresolved issues. Money continues to be raised on the ground to supplement a Government investment that I hope will continue. The planning process for the runway extension is nearing completion and an arbitration process will proceed within the coming months, all of which should amount to an additional 200-250 m of runway. Talks are continuing with commercial operators regarding the restoration of the Waterford-London route. We are hopeful that the figures for the first five months of this year will help in that regard. It is also fair to say that the region's local authorities have helped a great deal by making the airport a priority and stepping up their involvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> This Bill and primary and secondary legislation like it are vital to economic recovery. For my region, they are fundamental. Thankfully, the Department and the Minister seem to share this view and are actively working on that basis. I am not going to bash the previous Administration but, for the life of me, I could never understand why barely a penny was invested in Waterford Regional Airport in the years when we had money to spend on infrastructure. There were plenty of announcements by sitting Ministers, but nothing happened. This Government has initiated a process with the airport management that is contingent on money being raised locally. I hope it will lead to additional business. The key factor is that the Government has the imagination to see the possibilities and to invest in critical infrastructure when times are tough. The figures I have cited should go some way towards reassuring the people central to these decisions that a focused regional airport strategy can work.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> When the National Treasury Management Agency Bill was before the House a couple of weeks ago, I referred to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, that formed part of that legislation. The fund consists of €6.8 billion of public money, which it is hoped will link with private funds in commercial investments around the country. The weakness in the fund is that no consideration for a balanced regional spread has been included in the legislation. Almost all of the money could conceivably end up where it has exclusively gone for the past 20 years, namely, Dublin, Cork and Galway. I hope that the Bill will be amended in the coming weeks to include references to the balanced regional development to which Deputy O'Donnell alluded and to have the ISIF administered on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">That aside, our continued targeted investment in regional airports achieves the same thing to a great extent because the allocation of foreign direct investment is lopsided and goes, for the most part, to three particular locations. It is important that we stay the course when it comes to Shannon, Cork, Waterford and the other regional airports and hopefully this legislation will achieve the same thing and make investments in these regional airports more important than ever for the obvious reasons, namely, attracting new inward investment from outside the area and especially overseas companies, retaining existing companies in the area, securing the expansion of existing companies in the face of competition with other countries, promoting the export success of companies located in the area by providing passenger and freight links to key markets, adding to the quality of life of citizens by enabling ease of travel, and attract inbound tourism to any area, generating employment in the tourism industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> I appreciate the work the Minister and his Department have put into the Bill and hope they will consider what I have said. The 74% increase in passenger numbers at Waterford Regional Airport this year, albeit from a very small base, is not only significant for my constituency but it should be significant for all regional airports and for everyone working in and associated with them. It is also significant from a policy perspective. When a recession bites it is even more important that a government spends its money wisely. I hope the 74% increase in passenger numbers at Waterford Regional Airport demonstrates that additional CAPEX and OPEX funding for Waterford and the other regional airports is smart business and is a positive for the country's economy as a whole.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014. It has been generally welcomed across the House and I share in that welcome. It sets up a new commercial semi-State company, Shannon Group plc., which combines the Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development and it should act as a lynchpin in terms of the future development of the mid-west region by allowing the airport to concentrate on its own business and the lands available around the airport to develop infrastructure that can support the entire region, and that is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> There is, however, one significant blemish on Shannon Airport - a matter the Government should have moved to deal with - the use of Shannon Airport by US troops and our facilitation of an illegal war in Iraq and facilitation of the United States in projecting its military power around the world by allowing Shannon Airport to be used by US forces as they travel to the Middle East to impose their imperial will on the people there. We should have addressed that, as should this Bill. I hope Shannon Group plc will make a strategic decision to move away from and end the practice of allowing US troops to come through Shannon Airport. As this company starts off and sets its corporate goals and policy to develop the region, the perception of such practice at the airport will certainly hinder its development. The programme for Government commits that, "We will enforce the prohibition on the use of Irish air space, airports and related facilities for purposes not in line with the dictates of international law". We can see how that has come to be developed into the continued support for the use of Shannon Airport by the US military, turning a blind eye to rendition flights through Shannon with little emphasis being placed on the fact that armed military aircraft have come through Shannon Airport also. It augurs very poorly for the future development of the airport. As the airport looks to its future development, it should not continue this business as a practice into the future. I hope it will decide to end it. Given that the Government did not have the guts to do it, perhaps the new company will realise the commercial value in presenting a corporate image of itself that presents Ireland as a country that is good to visit and good to do business in and not associate it with illegal wars around the globe. Perhaps the group will decide to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Aside from the use of Shannon Airport by the military, this legislation has the potential, as has been said by other Members, to counterbalance the unbalanced development in the State in terms of regional development. We can see the development of the east coast taking place as Government policy has focused on that region to the detriment of the rest of the country. This legislation should provide the midwest with an opportunity to counterbalance that development by developing the wider region. I note from the submissions made to an Oireachtas joint committee by Galway, Shannon and Limerick chambers of commerce that the legislation has a wider reach than the Shannon and Clare areas and the potential it provides for development within the midwest is vital. I hope the airport will be able to grow passenger numbers and not be subservient, as it has been in the past, to Dublin Airport and grow the region on that basis. That is an important aspect of the Bill and an important aspect of the creation of the new company. It builds from the establishment of the Shannon Airport Authority 18 months ago, which I note has seen a slight increase in passenger numbers this year. I wonder if these passenger numbers include the American military or are commercial passengers. If the latter is the case, that is welcome and it is good to see an increase in passenger number which shows, even at this early stage, that the possibility of having an independent airport authority has allowed Shannon Airport to start to develop its business for the benefit of the entire region.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> I share some of the concerns other Members expressed about the potential impact on pensioners in that it appears the group can decide to move existing and deferred pensioners on to a new scheme that might undermine their terms and conditions and the amount of pension benefit they get. The Minister should examine that matter to ensure they are protected and be satisfied they can be protected under the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The legislation offers an opportunity for the mid-west and Shannon Airport to develop further but the ongoing facilitation of the use of Shannon Airport by the American military is a blemish on the card of Shannon Group plc. I hope the company will decide to end that business when the Bill is passed and they have control over it.</p>

        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_279">
          <from>Deputy Patrick O'Donovan<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_602">I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Bill. From my viewpoint, representing the mid-western region, the Bill is long overdue. The reason the Bill is important will have been clearly visible to anyone who has been using Shannon Airport in recent years. The carpark at the airport, which is a good indicator of how an airport is performing, was getting increasingly easier to access, which indicates that fewer people were using it. The separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority was initiated under the Government as a measure designed to prevent the airport from falling into further decline. In the period since the Booz report was published, the discussions that took place on foot of it in government and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications proved that the recommendations brought forward and the legislation before us was the right thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> It was a little disappointing to hear some Opposition spokespersons earlier bemoan the introduction of the Bill as a little late. The simple reality is that they had 14 years to deliver the Bill and did not do so and on their watch, especially in the years from 2007 onwards, the decline in Shannon Airport was very visible.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Shannon Airport has a wider impact than on County Clare alone. It is on this basis that I speak. Shannon Airport has its foundations in my constituency in the port town of Foynes on the banks of the Shannon Estuary. It was there the first commercial flight from Ireland to North America took off in 1939. It was a Pan American Yankee Clipper Flying Boat which flew to North America via Newfoundland and connected for the first time the west of Ireland and the Shannon Estuary to North America. The mid-western region has since had a strong affinity with the aviation industry and North American regions serviced out of Foynes and Rynanna, now known as Shannon Airport. I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and others will be in the port of Foynes in the coming weeks to celebrate the 75th anniversary of that historic event, which led, as we know, to the birth of Shannon Airport, now an independent Shannon Airport which has seen passenger numbers increase following severe declines, including from €3.6 million at its peak to €1.4 million at the time this intervention was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> There is another important Limerick dimension to this, namely, the land bank which the new Shannon Group will own. From my point of view, there is an opportunity now for the Government and the new Shannon Group to work towards the provision of balanced regional development. Shannon Development owns a considerable land bank in my county. For example, in Limerick it owns 250 acres in Plassey, 300 acres in Raheen, 220 acres in Askeaton and 15 acres in both Kilmallock and Newcastle West. Under the stewardship of the very able chairperson, Ms Rose Hynes and chief executive officer, Mr. Neil Pakey, who I believe have transformed the airport, there is a willingness now to transform the industrial remit of the new Shannon Group company. </p>
          <p eId="para_606"> The Government has in the past few years focused on aviation and aviation services as one of the stimuli that will reverse the neglect to which the mid-western region was subjected for many years under the previous Administration. This is due in no small way to the fact that the Minister for Finance happens to be a native of the Foynes area. This focus, together with the designation of the tier 1 port at Foynes, the unification of the Limerick local authorities, the transfer of Shannon Development's role to the new Shannon Group, the establishment of the LEOs, with the educational infrastructure such as Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, the University of Limerick and Mary Immaculate College, puts the region as a whole in a much stronger position than it was in at the time this Government took office. If one needed any clear indication of what is happening in the region one need only look to the skyline in the Limerick city area to see that the cranes have returned. They were sorely missed. </p>
          <p eId="para_607"> I welcome the Bill. I believe some of those who are opposing it do so for opposition's sake, which is their job. It is a pity they do not see the positives in it. Before he left the Chamber Deputy Thomas Pringle asked if the transformation in Shannon was due to real people. I can tell him that the transformation in Shannon is due to real people, real passengers, real flights and real connections being re-established. An important element of that is the removal of the over-reliance on one airline. I believe the new board, CEO and chairperson have been every effective in terms of building a relationship between the airport, which is the most westerly airport on the island of Ireland and, perhaps, in the European Union, and further afield. </p>
          <p eId="para_608"> The Minister previously announced funding for the N18, Limerick to Galway Road. Now that Shannon Airport has the independence it needs to drive the economy of the mid western region, there is an opportunity for the Minister to look at how Shannon Airport and the Shannon Foynes Port Company, could achieve more together. I have raised in the House on several occasions with the Minister the need for connectivity of the port of Foynes, which is across the river from Shannon Airport, to the remainder of the national road and rail networks. It is a key part the national infrastructure to which the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport should turn its attention. Everybody is aware of the current condition of the road network. It is in dire need of upgrade. That being said, the connection being achieved between Galway and Limerick through Shannon and Ennis will definitely provide something of a counterbalance for the west-mid-west region to the burgeoning east and south regions. There are those who believe that Shannon Airport is getting an unfair advantage. Historically, it has been starved of inward investment and Government attention or any real reform that would have allowed it to achieve its full potential as Ireland's transatlantic hub. </p>
          <p eId="para_609"> There are opportunities arising from this. I would like to see the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation engaging on a much more regular basis with the new Shannon Group when established. In regard to the land bank across the mid-west, particularly in my own county of Limerick, it is important that we do not, in the words of a former Member of this House, have the rabbits running around the land as much as running around the runway. The person to whom those words could be ascribed would himself be smiling today in that it is passengers boarding planes in much larger numbers than was the case up to the point when this Government came to office rather than rabbits that are running around the runway at Shannon Airport. I have no doubt that that growth will continue. This is a good day for the mid-west and Shannon. Perhaps at some point in the future - this may be a little controversial - consideration could be given to the name of the airport reflecting its nearest city. That being said, this is historic legislation that gives one of Ireland's most important pieces of infrastructure its independence and lets it determine its own future, which I wholeheartedly support. I wish the airport and everybody associated with the very best.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Murphy<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_610">I, too, welcome the Bill. While it is predominantly about the independence of Shannon Airport I know having heard the Minister's contribution earlier and having read it that it makes reference to Cork Airport and moves towards its independence. Many of the points made by Deputy Patrick O'Donovan also apply to Cork. Of significant importance has been the focus of the Government on regional development. Previous Governments spent a great deal of time and effort on decentralisation, gateway towns and so on and so forth. As soon as that process commenced, backbench Fianna Fáil Deputies stepped up crying, "My town, my village", which I suppose is understandable. </p>
          <p eId="para_611"> The reality for a small country like Ireland that is dependent on its capital city is that to have proper regional development one must first break off the bigger regions and cities. It is interesting to note the following in relation to the two other countries that like Ireland were in programmes. Almost half of the population of Greece lives in Athens city and more than 40% of Portugal's population lives in Lisbon. In terms of the European Union, Dublin which is home to almost 30% of Ireland's population, comes third in this regard. What always fascinates me is that when people talk about Cork city they are focused on the boundary and when they speak about Dublin they often include four or five other counties. Nonetheless in the Dublin region there is a disproportionate population when compared with the remainder of the country. </p>
          <p eId="para_612">Everybody accepts that rebooting and driving the economy must start in the capital city. However, what we have started to see happen is that the other engines such as Cork city, the mid-west region and Galway are also starting to attract significant investment. It is to be welcomed that cities such as Cork, Galway and, to a slightly lesser extent, Limerick, in addition to the mid-west, are following closely the growth and job creation evident in Dublin. To that end, I compliment the Minister. The spine of roads between Cork and Limerick and also between Limerick and Galway represents the next stage of infrastructural development in the country, as the Minister will acknowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> Cork Airport, in particular, has always played a very important role in the economy. Cork people, including politicians, are more than aware of its importance. However, I still feel the potential for co-operation between airports is enormous. When I was Lord Mayor of Cork, a delegation from the west coast of the United States flew to Shannon Airport from where they travelled to Cork city centre to meet me and a certain group. They complimented us immediately on having a transatlantic airport so accessible to Cork city. They were talking about Shannon Airport. They had travelled for two and a half hours to an airport in the state of California. We know from data collected on many flights leaving or entering Shannon Airport on transatlantic routes that approximately 50% – in some cases, more – of the passengers are travelling either to or from destinations in County Cork. Perhaps the mistake we have made politically is to posit the existence of an either-or scenario. Certainly, airports have the potential between them to develop transatlantic flight status.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> There is a view - it is being addressed to a certain extent in the Bill - that Cork remains in the shadow of Dublin. The question of the title, Dublin Airport Authority, is being addressed. It always gives the impression that Cork is a junior partner in the context of activities in Dublin. As the Minister acknowledged, we must not forget that, by some distance, the second biggest and busiest airport in the country is Cork Airport. Cork is the second largest centre for large multinationals in the region. While those who visit Cork infrequently are happy to do so via Shannon Airport, Dublin Airport or, perhaps, London, the reality is that many executives and others who work in some of these large companies, both international and Irish, have for a long time requested and required a transatlantic option from Cork Airport. I fully accept that the decision is a commercial one for the airlines, but there is a strong belief that until Cork Airport is completely independent, it will not be able to offer the same negotiating terms — competitive terms — as some of the other airports. There is no ambition in Cork to replace routes from Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> Let me consider the issue of the debts of all airports. Terminals were developed in different economic circumstances, certainly in Dublin and Cork. From my experience of having flown from terminals in both cities, they make travel extremely pleasant. That said, one would have to agree that, given their scale, the debt that hangs over both of them seems excessive. However, the money has been spent and the importance of airports to an island economy cannot be overestimated in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> Given what is happening in France and Belgium, I ask the Minister to point out to his colleagues in the other ministries for transport around Europe, when he gets a chance to do so, that a dispute essentially about what the French Government will charge airlines for flying through its airspace, bringing ordinary citizens of countries all over Europe to their knees, is totally unacceptable. During the years the French, in particular, have believed it is totally appropriate to comment on issues in Ireland and how we conduct ourselves, perhaps in taxation matters. It is appropriate, therefore, that we be able to comment on how the French conduct their industrial relations and this affects other member states. This issue will have to be addressed at the highest level.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> I do not expect the Minister to comment on my next point. We have a magnificent airline. Not everybody loves Ryanair, but we should realise it has driven down the cost of air travel all over Europe. Many of its flights have been grounded and many ordinary people who work very hard, very many for 50 weeks a year, have had holidays and other travel arrangements significantly affected. The Minister, given the State’s relationship with the airline industry generally, is in a stronger position than most to make this point to his colleagues in both Belgium and France.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> All airports are vital to us in the Republic. I welcome what the Minister has done for Shannon Airport. We are watching closely, enthusiastically and optimistically in the southern capital in the hope Cork Airport can continue to join Shannon, Dublin and other airports in being a driver of economic growth, bringing visitors to our beautiful country and allowing people to travel abroad to promote their businesses and the country for many generations to come.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_619">I am sharing my time with Deputy Róisín Shortall.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> I am thankful to have the opportunity to speak about the Bill. Like many Deputies and the Minister, I have received many letters and e-mails specifically on the implications of section 34 on the Irish aviation (general employees) superannuation scheme. Delegations have also approached me about the issue. There is grave concern and anxiety among many of my constituents about the effects of this section, particularly on the deferred members of the superannuation scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I welcome the majority of provisions included in the Bill which create Shannon Group. This will involve creating an umbrella group with responsibility for Shannon Airport, the lands around it and the companies operating there. This follows the report of the Shannon aviation business development task force of November 2012 and the separation of the Shannon and Dublin airport authorities. People who represent Dublin have no problem with Cork Airport also receiving its independence or being included in any name. The three international airports and also the airport at Knock are vital for the future development of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Section 6 permits the creation of the new Shannon Group and section 10 outlines the functions. It has to be said, of course, that Shannon Airport and the mid-west generally have suffered in the economic crash since 2008, with a huge decline in passenger numbers at the airport itself. Thankfully, I note that its most recent annual report indicates a slight recovery, with an increase in passenger numbers. Hopefully, the provisions of the Bill before us will build on this improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I also note that some restructuring has already taken place at Shannon, with the Shannon Airport Authority plc having taken over the management in the last year and a half. The chairperson, Ms Rose Hynes, has indicated in the 2013 annual report that there is a positive future outlook for Shannon Airport based on the improvements that have taken place in passenger numbers and in business at the airport recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> An over-reliance on military stopovers in the past ten or 12 years provided short-term gains but it was unsustainable. We remember the US military stopovers and also remember constantly questioning the Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, about these matters when he was in the seat opposite. Ireland's role in US military stopovers at Shannon Airport was, on balance, damaging to the reputation of our country. Over the years, I have strongly supported the distinguished activist, Mr. Roger Cole, and the Peace and Neutrality Alliance organisation in their brave stand against the militarisation of Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> The Shannon Free Airport Development Company, SFADCO, was a very successful and innovative company in terms of the economic development of the country. I note the new CEO, Mr. Neil Pakey, is developing new structures and improving the management of Shannon Airport and its associated companies. There has been a recent increase in the number of routes from Shannon Airport, including the provision of a range of new routes by Ryanair, and Aer Lingus is also extending its services from Shannon Airport, with new routes to Bristol and Malaga and increases in the Manchester and Birmingham routes. United Airways is also planning to increase capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> Shannon Airport was always a standard bearer in the avionics and aviation engineering area, as well as in aircraft leasing and financing. Again, there is huge potential to develop these industries further in parallel with developments in the Dublin Airport region. Therefore, I welcome Part 8, which provides for the final step in giving effect to the Article XI (Alternative A) of the Aircraft Protocol to the Cape Town Convention, as the Minister told us. This means we will now replicate the 60-day waiting period for creditors which is the general <i>modus operandi</i> in the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> I particularly welcome the inclusion of the "dazzling" offence in section 44. The Minister said there were 281 reports of lasers being shone at aircraft in 2013, with 60% of these taking place in Irish airspace. As transport spokesperson for the Labour Party, I remember this was a complaint we received in the vicinity of Dublin Airport on a number of occasions. It is a very serious crime and a potential disaster for crews and passengers, so it is good it is included here at long last. In addition, I note traffic management powers have been given to the airports, and these are also long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> Part 9 contains amendments to update laws concerning tour operators. However, the Minister seemed to be saying that we are not able to defend the 1982 Act and, in other words, EU-based travel operators can come here and operate very freely without licence, based on the reasoned opinion the Minister received from Europe. In his response, the Minister might indicate how Irish customers can be protected in regard to foreign travel companies and foreign airlines, which are so extensively used here.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> I am very concerned about the contents of the Bill which relate to the IASS. The new section 32 of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998, as amended, seems to give large powers to trustees and companies and, at the same time, remove powers from members and deferred members. Deferred members of the IASS are particularly concerned about this provision, as the Minister knows. I understand there are close to 15,000 people involved, with approximately a third being active current members, a third being pensioners and a third being deferred pensioners. The Minister told us earlier that 69% of the members work or worked for Aer Lingus, 26% for the DAA-SAA and 5% for SR Technics.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> The current pension concerns relate directly to the trauma suffered by workers at SR Technics when it closed a number of years ago. The closure was totally unnecessary and stupid. It was carried out by Sheik Mohammed Bin Maktoum of the United Arab Emirates, who simply wanted to move the large aviation engineering centre at Dublin and Zurich to the Middle East as a successor industry for a time when the oil begins to run out. As a result, many of our workers lost their jobs and had to retrain, and they are now desperately concerned about their pension entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> In March this year the IASS scheme had a maximum funding standard deficit of €769 million. The impact of the Pensions Act 1990 meant that residual funds available for active and deferred members would be only 5% of the expected benefits. There has also been the recent controversy in regard to the Aer Lingus CEO, Mr. Mueller. I welcomed the Government position, which followed my own call in regard to the approval of a large pay and bonus package for the Aer Lingus CEO at a time when its pension fund continues to be in crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> There are grave concerns at the treatment of the IASS fund in the event of full privatisation. The Minister might give his view as to whether workers who gave 30 to 40 years service in the semi-States are now being unfairly targeted. Does the present fund meet pension regulations standards? What solution is the Minister coming forward with to protect the fund?</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> I note the recently published report of the expert panel on the resolution of the industrial relations issues in the IASS dispute makes key recommendations. The expert panel based those recommendations on earlier opinions of the Labour Court but, significantly, it has recommended increased contributions by both Aer Lingus and the DAA to the IASS pension fund. In the case of Aer Lingus, the panel has recommended that it would put in a total of €146.7 million for active employees and, in the case of the DAA, the panel recommends an increased contribution of €57.3 million and a further €850,000 from the DAA to deal with the resolution and wind-up of the Aer Rianta supplemental superannuation scheme, ARSSS. Significantly, the panel's report mentions the situation regarding deferred members. The report notes that meetings took place and recommends that the companies should amend the manner in which funding for their former staff who are deferred members of the IASS is to be made available so as to alleviate as much of the impact of the IASS trustee proposal as is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> The Minister maintained earlier today that section 34 was designed to facilitate in a pragmatic manner the implementation of the expert panel's report, and he also said he would amend some of the provisions of section 34. However, he continues to support new pension scheme provision by the DAA and SAA which he says will not replicate the so-called inflexibilities of the IASS. To many of my constituents, this just reinforces the grave and ongoing concern among deferred pensioners, especially about the future of their pension entitlements and the lack of any consultation with them on any future pension changes, which section 34 seems to copperfasten. The question is why the Minister has come forward with section 34. He said it was to facilitate the response of the expert panel but what it has done is create huge anxiety and concern among people who have given lengthy service to our airline industry in Dublin and who now feel desperately threatened.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> The Minister should withdraw section 34. Given a failure to do this, the Bill has to be opposed, despite its positive aspects for Shannon Airport and other areas of our aviation administration. I ask the Minister to rethink and, in his response, indicate clearly how the mess in this area can be cleared up. He is the responsible Minister.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_636">I thank Deputy Thomas P. Broughan for allowing me to share time. </p>
          <p eId="para_637"> I want to confine my comments to what was originally section 33 of this legislation in regard to the pension provision of the IASS. I make the point that it is very unsatisfactory to deal with such a significant issue in the context of a Bill which is designed to address something entirely different in regard to developments in the Shannon area. While I am not going to comment on that, in general terms, those proposals are to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">It was wrong to include such a provision in this legislation - originally in section 33 and now in section 34 - because it means that it has not received adequate attention or consideration. When the Bill first appeared, the explanatory memorandum stated that section 33 provided for amendments to the existing superannuation provisions governing the State airport authorities and also facilitated changes to the Irish Airlines (General Employees) Superannuation Scheme, IASS. It does not give any idea regarding the provisions of that section. I think this is misleading and indicates that it was a mistake to include it in this legislation. Equally, the Bill digest produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service includes virtually nothing on these provisions. When I queried that, the view was taken that there is nothing new in this but this is not the case. </p>
          <p eId="para_639"> This legislation has very significant implications for a very large number of people, particularly those living on the north side of Dublin, many of whom live in the Minister's constituency. Those most affected are the 5,000 or so deferred pensioners from the IASS. These people have been particularly badly treated over the years. They were very much encouraged and in many cases pushed to leave what were very secure jobs they held for many years in the national airline and Aer Rianta. The Government of the day regarded them as surplus to requirements. In order to slim down Aer Rianta and the national airline, they were enticed and in many cases pushed to leave. Life became very difficult for many of those people and the squeeze was put on them to leave the companies in a number of attempts to reduce the workforce. </p>
          <p eId="para_640"> When they agreed to accept offers made to them, those offers were very serious offers that were in writing. All of the people received one of these letters of offer which set out their entitlements. There is a very strong case for the view that these letters of offer constitute a very clear legal contract between the individuals and the company. Details and guarantees were given that when these people reached the retirement age of 65 years, they would have a very specific and clearly defined pension entitlement. It now seems that a very definite attempt is being made to withdraw the guarantees that were given and to renege on the agreements that had been reached in good faith with the people concerned from the two State companies. </p>
          <p eId="para_641"> We know that deferred pensioners are in a very difficult situation in so far as they are not entitled to any kind of serious representation or consultation. This is a major problem. They have been overlooked to a large extent by the representative bodies. Of course, we know that deferred members are not allowed to have union representation and are not represented by the Pensions Ombudsman or the Pensions Board. The Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Social Protection are leaving it all at arm's length and saying that it has nothing to do them and that these are semi-State companies. If that view is taken and followed through on, it would be fine but it does have something to do with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport when he is prepared to introduce legislation to seriously curtail the entitlements people understood they had. He is entering into it and playing a part in the very basic legislation that underpins what deferred members believed was a right they had. </p>
          <p eId="para_642"> This legislation seeks to remove members from the scheme and over-ride what everybody understood were the existing rules. An attempt is being made to do that without a single safeguard for the members of the IASS. I think this is extraordinary. It seems to be unprecedented in law and is impossible to defend. It gives very wide-ranging powers to employers to transfer members to a new scheme without any consultation. In particular, it gives very wide-ranging powers to the trustees to unilaterally make amendments to provide for the cessation of benefits and contributions by all members and their employers. We know that under the law as it stood this was not possible. It seems that under the provisions of this legislation, the employers on one occasion only can direct that any one or more of the current or former employees must transfer to a replacement scheme. The amount to be transferred will be determined by the trustee on the advice of the actuary. All of the powers are with the trustees and employers and scant regard has been paid to the entitlements or rights of the deferred members. </p>
          <p eId="para_643"> This legislation effectively allows two solvent companies to wind up a defined benefit scheme without fulfilling the minimum funding standard as required by the Pensions Act. Allowing Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority to transfer members into a new scheme without preserving their defined benefit for past service effectively replicates a wind up. I know the Minister has said in the Seanad that it is not a wind-up because if it was the equivalent of a wind-up, there would be nothing left. However, it is in effect the same as a wind up even though there is funding there. What it means is that the benefits and entitlements which all the members understood they had are now being extinguished. In effect, the Minister is proposing to give the powers that would be allowed in a wind-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> It is very hard to understand why he decided to take this course of action. We were waiting for the report and deliberations of the expert panel. It has been a provocative move to include in this legislation relating to Shannon a provision that has such far-reaching implications for so many people in terms of their income in the future. It is an unacceptable approach to tackling a difficult issue. The fault lies with the actions of a number of the Minister's predecessors. Nonetheless, two State companies entered into legal agreements with their deferred pensioners. These agreements by law should stand. They do stand in the absence of the legislation proposed by the Minister to extinguish these rights. This is not an acceptable way to treat people and it is not acceptable for the Minister to say that these are commercial semi-State companies and that it has nothing to do with him. It does involve him. He has facilitated the ill-treatment of people through sponsoring this legislation. If nothing else, as a 25% shareholder in Aer Lingus, he also has a clear responsibility to ensure that the company of which he is a part and the Dublin Airport Authority treat people properly and with dignity and respect legal agreements that were reached in the past, however inconvenient they may be to him at this point.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Deputy Pat Breen<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_645">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is a parochial issue for me. I was disappointed that Deputy Pringle criticised US military traffic through Shannon Airport. This business has passed through the airport since the Second World War and has generated significant revenue for the people of the region and I am supportive of this. The United States and the airport have developed a strong relationship over the years and it is important to acknowledge the contribution that has been made by that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, my good colleague from Limerick, suggested the airport should be rebranded as Limerick international airport. The Shannon brand is famous all over the world and changing the name would be a bad idea at this stage because this is a good brand. No matter where one goes, people have heard of Shannon Airport, and it is important to build on the brand, which has given so much to the region over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> I pay tribute to the Minister and his commitment to developing the aviation industry. The industry is worth €4.1 billion annually and it supports 26,000 direct jobs and 16,000 jobs in the supply chain. It is significantly important in generating economic activity, particularly given the fact we are an island nation. Having well connected air access is critical, particularly in boosting inward investment and tourism. For the first time in 20 years, the Minister has published a draft aviation policy and this will play a major role in ensuring we maximise the benefits of the industry and the role it can play in our economic recovery over the next number of years. He is presiding over the most radical overhaul of our airport infrastructure, which is in stark contrast to his predecessors. The indecision of the previous Government regarding the enactment of the State Airports Bill 2004 stymied the industry. This was particularly true in the case of Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> The establishment of Shannon Group will facilitate the development of core and non-core aviation business at the airport and adjacent to the airport, where there is a substantial land bank which can be utilised to generate more aviation-related activity. Setting the airport free from the control of the DAA has allowed for the rebirth of the innovative and enterprising spirit that marked the early years of its development and, in only 15 months, the transformation has been remarkable. An air of confidence has returned and the airport's international credibility has been restored. The pro-tourism budgetary measures introduced by this Government, especially the abolition of the travel tax, have contributed significantly to the airport's return to profitability. I commend both Ryanair and Aer Lingus on their positive response to the abolition of this tax. The airport's traffic has increased significantly over the past number of years and it returned to profit in its first year of independence, which is remarkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> Historically, Shannon Airport had a strong share of the transatlantic market, but when the open skies policy was introduced it lost a significant share of the market. I am delighted that the new airport authority is working hard to win back this business. Last year transatlantic traffic increased by 18% and new routes to Chicago and Philadelphia were introduced. This growth will accelerate this year, given the return of year-round Aer Lingus services to New York and Boston using new narrow-bodied Boeing 757 aircraft. This will increase capacity and tourist numbers in the country, particularly from the east coast of the United States. United Airlines, in particular, and Delta Airlines should also be commended as they provide a year-round service, with United Airlines increasing the number of flights into the airport by 90 this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> I was delighted to represent the Government in the absence of the Minister at the launch of the Boston service earlier this year and I have not witnessed such confidence at the airport among staff and tourists for a number of years. One will notice this confidence every morning in the airport. Airport management is also making significant strides in expanding its short-haul network. The addition of eight Ryanair routes was a major boost, and five of these routes - to Berlin, Fuerteventura, Krakow, Paris and Warsaw - will be retained this winter, which will double the airport's capacity during that season. Aer Lingus Regional has also bolstered its commitment to the airport, and a new route to Bristol will bring in 200,000 passengers before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> I expect management to continue to build on the growth it achieved last year. There is a dynamic board under the chairman, Ms Rose Hynes, and we are fortunate to have secured the services of Mr. Neil Pakey as chief executive officer. He has huge experience, as he has transformed Liverpool and other airports. He is an asset to the Shannon Group. The most important people at the airport are the staff, because they are determined to make it succeed, and their efforts must be commended. What the management and staff have achieved in only one year as an independent airport is remarkable, especially when this is benchmarked against other European airports. According to Airports Council International, almost half of Europe's airports were loss-making last year, at a time when the numbers using air travel had increased. Airports in countries that have been hit hardest by the recession, such as Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus, are enjoying the greatest recovery in the aviation sector. I suspect the reason for the increased demand is that low-cost operators are using these countries. Ryanair is a model in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> It is important, therefore, that Shannon Airport continues to expand its short-haul network and to pursue a two-airline strategy, which is important. Competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus is the key to ensuring the airport does not become over-reliant on one airline, and I am pleased that one of the key proposals in the aviation policy is that the State will continue to pursue such a strategy, which is important. A scenario cannot arise again similar to that which occurred in early 2010, when the airport was deserted because it was over-exposed to one airline. Thankfully, that has changed, and the mood is different.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> The advantage of the formation of the Shannon Group is that it will allow the region to refocus on maximising its potential. In the early years of the airport's development, the late Mr. Brendan O'Regan recognised the need to expand the infrastructure around the airport, and the pioneering initiatives undertaken at that time included the setting up of an industrial estate, a model that has been replicated in many other countries, such as China. I visited such a development in Shenzhen. Most Chinese delegations that travel to Ireland want to visit County Clare, not because of its beauty but to see how the Shannon free zone worked. They also take in the Cliffs of Moher, which is important for tourism. Shannon Development was set up to manage the world's first industrial free zone. It was the only regional economic development agency and it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the contribution made by the management and staff of Shannon Development down through the years. They pioneered and delivered a number of significant initiatives and their contribution to the development of our region should never be forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> The Shannon Group will have access to the property assets and strategic lands, including the land banks, adjacent to the airport. This is important because it will allow the group to push ahead with the development of an international aviation centre of excellence. The Shannon region has a strong international reputation for aviation-related business, with up to 30 companies involved in aviation-related industries located there. Two of our largest maintenance, repair and overhaul, MRO, companies are based at Shannon Airport - Shannon Aerospace and Transaero - and the University of Limerick provides an aeronautical engineering degree course, which ensures a stream of highly qualified graduates is available. International students have also been attracted to the region, given its reputation for excellence.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">We also have a strong international reputation in aviation leasing and Ireland is one of the leading players in the industry, on which we want to build at Shannon. With nine of the world's largest aircraft leasing companies based in Ireland, it is estimated that 3,000 aircraft - 50% of the entire global fleet of leased aircraft - are managed here. Avolon which in four years has become one of the top global leasing companies was founded by a Clare man, Mr. Domhnal Slattery, in 2010. I hope we can further exploit opportunities in this area and hope the Minister of Finance will create more opportunities in the budget in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> In my capacity as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, opportunities often arise to meet CEOs of airlines and aviation companies in general and I am aware that many airlines are discussing developing routes to Shannon Airport. Airlines make money when their aircraft are in the air. They can avoid long inspection delays at US international hubs by using the US pre-clearance facilities available at Shannon Airport, which means that when flights arrive in the United States, they are classified as domestic airline flights and land at domestic terminals. This is a very attractive option for airlines from the Middle East and Asia, in particular. There is potential to develop further business, especially on the cargo side, at Shannon Airport if the US pre-clearance facility were extended to cater for freight. If the airport were in a position to provide cargo pre-clearance facilities, it would be in a stronger position to compete for this business. I ask the Minister to pursue this possibility with his US counterparts when he is next in Washington DC.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> Like many speakers, I am concerned about the existing, retired and deferred pensioners of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, under section 33 of the Bill, now section 43. While the expert panel has published its recommendations, including that Aer Lingus and the DAA make additional contributions to plug the €780 million shortfall in the scheme, there remains considerable concern among the scheme's members that, without an amendment to this section, their future benefits will be undermined. Many speakers have raised this matter. There are approximately 5,000 deferred members of the scheme, workers who left Aer Lingus and the DAA under the various redundancy schemes and spent 20 to 30 years working for these companies but who have not yet reached retirement age. They would have reasonably expected that when they reached retirement age, they would have receive the pension deferred for them when they left the company. They are very concerned that this may not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> This section has been designed to facilitate implementation of proposals that emerge from the negotiating process to resolve the funding issue. The main contention is that, without amendment, the section could give wide-ranging powers to employers to transfer members, without consultation, to a new scheme. Concerns have also been expressed by many in the Shannon region and County Clare that the trustees of the scheme could make amendments to provide for the cessation of benefits and contributions by all members and their employers. The staff and pensioners have told me that their pensions have already been depleted owing to a number of factors. They fear that if total power is transferred to the IASS employers and trustees, their situation will deteriorate even further. Like other speakers, I ask the Minister to amend the section to address these concerns in order that there will be no confusion about the intent of the section and to clarify that it is not being introduced to undermine the members of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> As Chairman of the foreign affairs and trade committee, I meet airline CEOs, particularly from non-EU countries, and the issue of fifth freedom of the air rights is regularly raised with me. Fifth freedom rights would apply where non-EU airlines were allowed to pick up and drop off passengers at Irish airports <i>en route</i> to the United States. I very much support the recent call by Professor Jim Deegan, head of the department of economics and director of the national centre for tourism policy studies at the University of Limerick. In response to the publication of the national aviation strategy, he prepared a paper on behalf of the Shannon Airport marketing consultative committee proposing that the Government prioritise the awarding of fifth freedom rights to Shannon Airport. The airport is well placed, has the facilities, is not overcrowded and would be a great hub for many long-haul carriers to land at, use the pre-clearance facilities and travel on to the United States. Professor Deegan's contention is that it would help to redress the economic imbalance between Dublin and the remainder of the country and complement the development of international aviation services at Shannon Airport. I concur with his views and ask the Minister to consider them.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> The liberalisation of rights should not be extended to all Irish airports because extending fifth freedom rights to Dublin Airport would probably undermine the operations of the national carrier, Aer Lingus, in Dublin. It is important that we stimulate business at the other airports. Dublin Airport does not need these rights because it has sufficient business and is operating close to capacity. However, if these rights were transferred to other Irish airports, including Shannon Airport, it would benefit the national economy and play a significant role in assisting the new airport group at Shannon to grow its transatlantic business, both passenger and cargo.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> Today marks a very important day for Shannon Airport. The passage of the legislation will end the uncertainty that hindered the airport's development from 2004 until 2011. Shannon Airport is strategically the most important piece of infrastructure in the region, underpinning thousands of jobs in its industrial and tourism hinterland. We have seen the positive impact of Ryanair's increased service from Shannon Airport and how busy the airport is in the mornings. There has been an impact on tourism in County Clare. Tourist numbers have increased in Kilkee, at Loop Head, Spanish Point, Ballyvaughan and Killaloe and this is directly attributable to the increased connectivity with Shannon Airport. The Wild Atlantic Way has been a great success for the west coast and was a very cheap project because the route along the beautiful coastline was already there. All it meant was the commitment to erect additional signs and have various points along the route to attract tourists to the entire region. Last year 18,000 people visited the newly opened Loop Head Lighthouse which this year, with the Cliffs of Moher, is one of the strategic points along the Wild Atlantic Way. It is a tremendous success for tourism on the west coast from County Donegal to County Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> Cork Airport also has a very important role to play and it is important that the two airports work together, although they must also compete. We are very lucky to have two transatlantic gateways into Ireland, a small country of 4 million people. I visited the Czech Republic this year and Prague, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, does not have a year-round transatlantic service. Our two direct transatlantic links, through Dublin and Shannon airports, are extremely important. We should preserve them and hold onto what we have, ensure Irish carriers serve both airports and attract other airlines from the United States and the Middle East to use the pre-clearance facilities available here.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Given the determination of the management of Shannon Group, I have no doubt that the region has a bright future. I wish it well. I thank the Minister for his commitment to the region. Without it and were it not for the fact that he was direct, straight and got the business done, we would still be in limbo.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_664">The way we structure legislation is very important. My first impression of the Bill is that while there are connected matters within it, they are only tenuously related to each other. We have Shannon and Cork airports, DAA pensions, the Cape Town Convention and tour operators all falling under one Bill. It is important to have well crafted and tidy legislation. We must consider how people will view the legislation looking back and how easy it will be to navigate. I have concerns that a great deal is going on in the Bill. I would like to see the ratification of international conventions provided for in stand-alone legislation. It makes sense. When legislation contains as many matters as the Bill, it can be confusing.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> Rather than making a typical Second Stage statement, I will raise a number of questions. I would like to know, with regard to the establishment of Shannon Group, what the broad philosophy will be in terms of its ownership into the future. Is it intended that it will be 100% State-owned or is there a plan? There are a number of things in the Bill that suggest otherwise. I would appreciate it if the Minister dealt with that issue in his response to the debate. Will the legislation prevent Shannon Group from selling any shares to non-governmental organisations or diluting its 100% ownership of any of the four subsidiary companies - Shannon Commercial Enterprises, Shannon Heritage, IASC, and Shannon Airport? Will the Minister explain why it is forbidden for the shares in Shannon Group to be issued without ministerial consent, while that is not the case with Cork Airport? There is something different happening with both. Why is one approach being taken with one and another approach to the other?</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> It is clear that the Government has bent over backwards to ensure the smooth setting up of this new entity, Shannon Group. The €100 million debt owed by Shannon Airport to the DAA has been cancelled or, in any event, what was a shared liability will be a DAA liability. We already know the DAA is struggling. There is a huge pensions black hole. Is this going to contribute to a difficulty for the authority? When a sizeable portion of Aer Lingus was sold off in 2005 and 2006, the CEO made the point that some of the money should have been used at that point to cover what was known to be a large hole in the pension fund. That did not happen under the previous Government and the problem has become worse. I ask the Minister to address the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> We have transferred 75% of the staff costs of Shannon Development to other public bodies. What is the exposure of organisations such as the Institute of Technology Tallaght? Was it a natural fit and did they require the personnel transferred to them? I am not 100% sure of the position. We seem to have transferred the pensions liability to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. What is the exposure in that regard? In relation to Shannon Group, we have transferred the entire €200 million property portfolio to Shannon Development. There is a big asset transfer, but it must go there as it will be the basis for the legal entity. All Shannon Airport lands will also be transferred to the Shannon Group. There is also Shannon Heritage. The Department of Finance is foregoing taxation which might accrue in a commercial sense, which I understand as it is almost accounted for there. However, it appears that all of those things add up to a significant question mark. The question mark is over packaging something. It is fine if it makes it viable and it functions as an entity in its own right, but if we are packaging it to strip out any of the liabilities and make it attractive for sale, I have serious concerns. I would like to know what the objective is in order for me to establish whether I can support the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> I am absolutely in favour of balanced regional development. The airport has the potential to be a serious asset for the region, as it has been in the past. The region is not well populated, which is part of the problem. The Minister announced two years ago a plan to merge the Shannon Airport Authority with the Shannon Development free zone. At the time, he said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_669">We want to recapture the pioneering spirit of the people who gave us the airport and the Shannon Free Zone concept, so that we can provide exciting and innovative opportunities which benefit business, tourism, and job creation in the region, and across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">It is good for the greater Dublin area to have balanced regional development. It is not one at the expense of the other. The congestion in Dublin would give way to a more normal arrangement if there were more balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> This must be seen as a driver for the region. I am very concerned that instead of being a resource for the mid-west, it may become a nicely packaged opportunity for an investment fund to purchase, with some of the costs accumulated to date having been stripped out.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruth Coppinger<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_672">My focus is on section 34 of the Bill which will have very serious consequences for workers in the airline sector. Why is the Minister facilitating solvent companies in taking thousands of workers out of a pension scheme, particularly when negotiations have not finished? The provisions will have a devastating impact on the workers who paid into the scheme, as they will lose up to 50% of their income.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> Like all of us, the Minister will have received letters and e-mails from staff in Aer Lingus, the Dublin Airport Authority and SR Technics. One correspondent makes the point that part of the reason there is a danger of collapse in the scheme is the failure of Aer Lingus to fund it properly, coupled with the fact that a previous Government implemented cost reduction measures which saw many people leave the airline at 55 years of age, which was very early in their working lives. Huge amounts of money were paid out as a result. Previous Government policies therefore ate into the contributions. All of the e-mails written anticipate a 50% loss of income when these workers retire. In other words, they face poverty in their old age, having paid into the scheme for 20 or 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> These are solvent companies. Aer Lingus made a profit of €39.5 million last year. Its passenger numbers increased by 12%. The Dublin Airport Authority made a profit of €26 million, also seeing an increase in passenger numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">There is no reason these companies cannot contribute and sustain a viable pensions scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> This is part of the race to the bottom, whereby pensions are to be raided and cut back to facilitate companies. The Minister is well aware of SR Technics, as many people who live in the Dublin West and Dublin North constituencies worked there. The company was closed in February 2009, with the loss of 1,100 jobs. These losses were needless, as it was viable for the company to conduct other business or it could have been taken over by the Government. The workers were dumped on the scrapheap a few years ago and will now find out, whenever it emerges from the four walls of this Chamber, that they will lose 50% of the pensions scheme and have no say in whether they are taken out of or left in it. Recently I visited the picket line of the Aer Lingus cabin crew and all of the workers used the phrase "race to the bottom". They see management of Aer Lingus trying to get rid of them off the books by using bad rotas and attacks on their conditions. They will be replaced by a flexible bunch of young people who will be chewed up and spat out without any pension liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> Major pension companies have been exhorting governments and employers to get rid of workers from defined benefit schemes into defined contribution schemes, to the extent that it is anticipated that one third of those in such schemes will be lost by 2020. This is part of a policy of employers and the Government. Some 65,000 workers have been affected by the loss of these schemes since 2008 and many more are on the verge of collapse. It seems the Government and the Minister are facilitating workers in ending up in these situations with, effectively, a gun to the head in the negotiations under section 34 of the Bill. Companies are using the recession to rationalise and cut back and every worker knows that pensions are up for grabs. It is scandalous that the Government is facilitating this. When word gets out, whatever losses were suffered in the recent local and European elections will become serious when workers in various constituencies find out that the Government is allowing this to happen.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_678">I welcome the opportunity to speak about the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014 which also has an impact on airports other than Shannon Airport. It has an impact on all three State airports and their workers, in particular, Cork Airport. I will concentrate on the pension provisions for workers, as mentioned by Deputy Ruth Coppinger, the impact of the changes in the ownership structures of the State airports and the future and potential of Cork Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> The issue of pensions has been raised by many people working at Cork Airport who are concerned about the pensions scheme. In March it was reported that the scheme had a deficit of €769 million and everyone acknowledges that this is not a sustainable position. It is a source of grave concern for those who worked for years thinking they had a secure pension to look forward to on retirement that perhaps it might be not paid now. </p>
          <p eId="para_680"> The Minister has informed us that the expert panel was formed to investigate how a financial resolution of the industrial relations issue relating to the pensions scheme could be secured. The expert panel has consulted various parties, including representatives of employees, and made recommendations that need to be considered in detail. Just because an expert panel makes a recommendation does not mean that the concerns of workers have been adequately addressed, nor does it mean that the workers have been reassured about the future of their pensions. Everyone accepts that the difficulties with the pensions scheme pose serious challenges. A solution must balance the interests of employees, pensioners, deferred members and employers. It is vital that certainty is provided for those who rely on the pensions scheme to provide for future income. I ask the Minister to ensure he remain vigilant on this issue in order that, after the Bill is passed by the House, there will be continued dialogue between all parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> One of the main parts of the Bill, Part 5, deals with the restructuring of the various airport companies. Section 30 deals with Cork Airport Authority plc. It provides for the dissolution of the Cork Airport Authority and gives the power to reincorporate the authority at a later date, which I welcome. This move reflects the reality in which Cork Airport has found itself since the passsage of the State Airports Act 2004. How we remember the previous Government's proud boast in 2004 that Cork Airport would be debt free and that it was envisaged that it would be separated from the other State airports. For a variety of reasons, that has not happened and, at this juncture, is not immediately realisable. Since 2004 the Cork Airport Authority has effectively been a shelf company. Although it had a board of sorts, it had little autonomy and was operating under the control of another group. I commend the Minister for his initiative on this point. Unlike the previous Government, he has been more proactive with regard to the airport. There was a lot of rhetoric from the previous Government about the provision of a new terminal building, but they were false promises and the false rhetoric has now come home to roost. Dissolving the Cork Airport Authority, in the context of the reality of public policy since 2004, makes sense. There is no point in having a company in place for the sake of it. It is in the interests of the airport and the Cork region that the management and operational structures in place facilitate the day-to-day activities of the airport and its ability to grow. There is no point in having a company in place that is the relic of an outdated policy long left behind. It is welcome that the Minister is allowing for the Cork Airport Authority to be re-established at a later date under section 31. When the time comes, it may be financially feasible for Cork Airport to be a separate entity, when it has the ability to operate on its own. The Cork Airport Authority could then be re-established.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> When the Minister took office, he conducted a comprehensive review of aviation policy and restructured the State airports. This decision effectively spun Shannon Airport from the airport group, making it an independent airport that could compete against the other two State airports. The decision was taken in considering the overall detailed picture, both historic and future, facing all three airports. It recognised the business opportunities, the opportunities for growth at the various airports, as well as the financial challenges at the time. The result has been the creation of an independent Shannon Airport and leaving Cork Airport operating under the umbrella of the DAA. We now have a situation where the second busiest airport in the country, Cork Airport, has to compete against Shannon Airport, while not having the same freedom to take commercial decisions that could enhance its business and business case.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> I accept the reasons for not making Cork Airport independent, the two most significant being that the airport's operating costs exceed its revenue and that the level of debt arising from the new terminal building puts it in a difficult position. In the short term, in order that the issue of debt can be addressed and that the pensions issue can be resolved, this is the correct decision. However it was made, the climate in which Cork Airport operates is difficult. This can be seen by the number of new routes opened up from Shannon Airport at a time when a similar number of new routes have not been opened up from Cork Airport. Despite Cork Airport being in proximity to a much larger population, the politics of the decision within the aviation sector means that one prominent airline has been slow to consider Cork Airport for the introduction of new routes. This is at a time when Cork has the roads infrastructure that allows people to travel faster to it from Portlaoise. From areas in Munster, it is perhaps faster to travel to Cork Airport than to Dublin Airport. </p>
          <p eId="para_684"> I have outlined some of the challenges facing Cork Airport. Unfortunately, they can be seen in the continued decline in passenger numbers. Last year the airport welcomed 2.3 million passengers through it, but this represented a decline of 3.5% on the figure for the previous 12 months, a trend that has continued for too many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> I welcome the appointment of Niall McCarthy as CEO, who has shown himself to be a breath of fresh air in Cork. Despite the fact he may have difficulties with his staff in bringing about change, I hope that as CEO of Cork Airport, he can bring about a new dawn for the airport, because staff and management have worked hard together to return passenger numbers to growth and are actively engaged with airlines to bring this about. I commend them for this. While the airport faces challenges, a number of route options are available. Last year, 16 airlines served 54 separate routes and the five scheduled airlines, Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus regional, Ryanair, Jet2.com and Wizz Air, offered a total of 44 scheduled destinations from Cork last year. In the past eight years, only once were there more scheduled routes available from Cork. That was in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> I also want to highlight the excellent customer service available at Cork Airport. Last year the airport was ranked as the world's best regional airport for customer service by both business and leisure travellers. The airport came first for overall customer satisfaction in the global airport service quality, ASQ, regional survey of passengers, carried out on behalf of Airports Council International, ACI. This is an achievement that needs to be broadcast widely and it was only possible because of the efforts of management and staff at Cork Airport. For this they must be congratulated. When passengers use Cork Airport, they have a great experience, but for many the difficulties begin before they ever get to the airport. The decision not to use Cork Airport is often down to a lack of route options.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> The lack of options can be seen when we look at a map of Europe. There are no direct flights to Madrid or northern Spain, Rome or southern Italy, Germany, apart from Munich, Denmark, Scandinavia, Austria, Switzerland and the majority of eastern European countries. The fact that huge swathes of Europe are not directly accessible from our second city and second busiest airport is a major concern. However, of even more concern is the fact that there is now no direct air link between Cork and Dublin. I still do not buy the argument given by those involved in the industry in regard to the lack of that service.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> We are aware of the challenges for Cork Airport, but we must set out a positive way forward. I welcome the Minister's decision to establish a new high level stakeholder body, the Cork Airport development council, which will provide a forum for senior stakeholders from a range of sectoral and geographic backgrounds who have an interest in the development of Cork Airport to engage with management at the airport and help contribute to traffic and route growth. This initiative has the support of the business community in Cork; it was part of the publication - A Ten Year Masterplan for Cork Airport - published by Cork Chamber last January. I believe the plan now needs to be centred on development and hope the development council remit will include the creation of a long-term plan to develop Cork Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> The Cork Airport development council established by the Minister has representatives from organisations such as Fáilte Ireland, the Cork Chamber of Commerce and even EMC, which among others will ensure that local views will contribute to the future development of the airport in order that it meets the tourism and business needs of the region. This will ultimately benefit the economy of the entire Cork region and the wider national economy. The first item this group should focus on is expanding the air connectivity available from Cork. In looking at this, a priority must be developing air links with key international hubs, with flights at times that suit businesses and business people. In tandem with this, we must protect and develop key routes such as Heathrow, Gatwick, Amsterdam, Paris, Frankfurt, Munich and Rome, but perhaps more important an air link to Dublin. Despite the fact we have a very good road link, an air transport link is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> Having this range of flight options will ensure that passengers using Cork Airport, for both business and tourism, can get direct flights to key international hubs, enabling them to link to destinations across the globe. This is why Heathrow is so important in the context of Cork. Focusing on these routes will enable Cork businesses to grow and expand internationally. This will benefit the international schools in UCC and CIT and the many leading international businesses in the pharmaceutical and IT areas and the tourism sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> One challenge we must consider in the context of Cork Airport is that of transatlantic flights. These would be a huge addition and are not just a pie in the sky aspiration for Cork, if they can be delivered. When I was on the regional authority, we met with representatives from Nova Scotia. Having links with the United States and Canada should be a medium-term goal for the airport, and given the population base of the region and the large number of multinational businesses located in Cork, there is a demand for these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> Regrettably, the challenges facing Cork airport are compounded by the high level of debt that the airport carries. An article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> by Joe Gill on 9 April summed up the situation very well . He wrote: "In the same way that puppies are not just for Christmas, expensive airport terminals are in place for decades and carry with them residual borrowings." We cannot escape this, but that said, all parties involved in Cork Airport must continue to explore ways to reduce the debt levels it is carrying. Reducing this burden will allow the airport to reduce prices and attract airlines. Unless the debt is reduced, the ability of the airport to reach its full potential will not be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> The reason Cork Airport was not made an independent airport was because the debt levels it would have to carry would not make it a viable commercial entity. That is acceptable and fair for those of us who are passionate about Cork Airport. However, the airport should not be expected to operate under the restricted umbrella of the DAA and still be subject to the same debt levels as if it was an independent airport carrying the full debt. Across the country businesses are dealing with the consequences of over-borrowing, borrowings made in a market that no longer exists and borrowings that must be repaid at a time when incomes have fallen. In this regard Cork Airport is dealing with the same problems that continue to affect so many parts of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> I hope the development council will be the catalyst that will enable Cork Airport to grow in order that it can reach its full potential. We have a fantastic and committed staff there. We have seen that the staff members serving on the board of directors are passionate about the airport. They represented their members well, but saw the bigger picture of Cork Airport. I hope the input of people from outside of the DAA group will facilitate a detailed consideration of how to restructure the debt at Cork Airport in order that it does not continue to be a heavy weight preventing the airport attaining its obvious potential. </p>
          <p eId="para_695"> I have focused on Cork in my presentation. As someone from the second city and as a person passionate about the airport, I see this as an issue that must be allowed to be debated in this Chamber. I hope we will have a wider debate on the use and growth of Cork Airport and I hope the aviation sector will also have an honest debate on Cork Airport. It rankles with people in Cork and the area around Cork Airport that airlines come to other airports and offer a wide range of routes. Our objective is to grow and develop Cork Airport in order that it can offer choice to the business community, the tourism sector and passengers who want to come in and out through Cork Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> I will finish by referring to section 44. I commend the Minister on the issue of dazzling in the context of the offence created in the Bill. It is important we protect our pilots and air traffic controllers. It is a concern that there have been incidents regarding the use of lasers and laser beams at some of our airports. I was stunned to hear from people in the airline industry that there has been a wide range of reports of this offence occurring. It is important to legislate for this and I commend the Minister for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> This may well be the Minister's last Bill before the reshuffle. If it is and if he is moved, I commend him for the work he has done in this area.</p>

Cork Airport is more accessible than Shannon and Dublin Airports and offers a great passenger experience. The city of Cork is a great place to come and stay if one is flying out in the morning. There are a wide range of activities in Cork city, the tourism potential is vast and the shopping, cuisine, night life and entertainment are fantastic.

          <p eId="para_703">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important Second Stage debate on the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014. This Bill is positive for Shannon Airport, County Clare and the mid-west region generally. On many occasions I have sought an update on the status of this Bill during the Order of Business in this House and in discussions with the Minister. It is good that it is being debated here today and will be enacted prior to the summer recess.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> I sincerely congratulate the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on the dramatic changes he has brought about at Shannon Airport in the last three years. Throughout its tenure the Government has prioritised Shannon, and the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill is the final piece of the legislative jigsaw which will lead to a bright future for the mid-west region. The airport has always been recognised as the engine of the mid-west, strategically located between the cities of Limerick and Galway, with Ennis, the county town of County Clare, nestled between the two. Recognition and rhetoric are easy, but ensuring that Shannon Airport fulfils its undoubted potential has been more difficult to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> I recall meeting Deputy Leo Varadkar in the weeks after he was appointed Minister in 2011 and anxiously putting in front of him a document entitled Shannon: A New Beginning, which I drafted with the assistance of others from the Shannon region. I am more than pleased to say that the proposals in that document have been implemented by the Minister to a significant extent. Back then I suggested the future of Shannon depended in the first instance on a restructured airport, independent of others and properly resourced. Most importantly, the airport needed to be independently empowered in a manner capable of achieving success. While we are still in the initial phase of that change, the new structure is clearly identifiable and progressing. There is a renewed energy and vitality in the airport. The structure is based on a clear strategy of independence for Shannon, with responsibility lying with those at board, executive and staff level for its future.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> There is, of course, a further implied responsibility on the people of the mid-west to support this vital piece of infrastructure, and especially now, as this Bill puts in place the final elements of the plan envisaged in the report presented by the Shannon aviation business development task force in November 2012. The number one priority for the new independent Shannon was to bring about an end to the dramatic reduction in passengers using the airport over the previous five years. The passenger data for those years, from 2006 to 2012, illustrated a most depressing and frightening trend of large-scale losses in passenger throughput, with over two thirds of business at the airport lost. The new structures as introduced by this Government have brought about a halt in the devastating passenger decline, with an initial modest growth in passenger numbers in 2013. More importantly, in the year to date, passenger traffic is up by 10.4%, and when one compares May 2013 with May 2014, traffic is up by 20%. This growth is mainly due to increases in scheduled services by both Aer Lingus and Ryanair and is also due, in part, to the abolition of the travel tax and the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sectors. </p>
          <p eId="para_707"> While these figures are hugely encouraging, big challenges still lie ahead. The Minister and the Government have clearly delivered on their responsibilities and the challenge now is for all of us who are stakeholders in the Shannon region to deliver on the opportunity created by the Government. This is the implied responsibility to which I referred earlier. In this regard, I compliment the chairperson of the new Shannon board, Rose Hynes, on the energy, commitment, flair and skill she has shown in the past two and a half years. She has been a significant player in the creation of a new atmosphere and renewed confidence in the Shannon region. Under her guidance, the airport authority has achieved its stated goals for 2013, including stabilisation of the financial position and putting a stop to passenger decline while entering passenger growth mode, together with achieving greater connectivity. I also pay tribute to Mr. Neil Pakey, the new chief executive officer, who has proved that he is a world-class addition to the team at Shannon Airport. I also compliment members of the board, the management team and employees on their hard work and commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> One of the initiatives needed now is to enhance the level of engagement of the new Shannon with all of the stakeholders in the region. In this regard, I am interested in the Minister's reference to the initiative undertaken by the DAA in Cork, with the setting up of the Cork Airport Development Council, CADC. I have from the outset argued that such a forum would be worthy of consideration in Shannon. It would tie in all of the stakeholders who are not necessarily directly represented on the board. Such a forum, as is the case with Cork Airport, should include senior representatives from the business, commercial, tourist, leisure and community sectors in the mid-west region and further afield, with a view to creating a stronger sense of ownership from as broad a region as possible. Such a structure existed in the 1990s with the Shannon status committee, which was probably the only time in the history of the airport that an interface between those responsible for the running of the airport and the broader community who depended on it was in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> As well as taking the decision to create an independent airport in December 2012, the Government also made the decision to combine the airport with a restructured Shannon Development. Following the enactment of this legislation, Shannon Airport will become part of the Shannon Group plc, a new commercial semi-state company with a clear strategic and commercial mandate. Shannon Group plc will comprise four strategic business units, combining the property ownership and management activities of Shannon Airport together with the activities of Shannon Commercial Enterprises, which is the restructured Shannon Development, Shannon Heritage and the International Aviation Services Centre. Shannon already hosts 40 aviation-related companies, and this legislation will act as a driver for further growth in this industry. I am pleased to see the two-pronged structure for Shannon and it makes sense that those responsible for the airport and the separate commercial activity in the region will now be reporting and answerable to one board. In my opinion, the lack of clarity and unity of purpose between the entities that were previously responsible caused problems on occasion. </p>
          <p eId="para_710"> As the whole process comes to a conclusion with this Bill, the focus in the past 18 months has almost exclusively been on Shannon Airport. It would be remiss of me and other Members of this House not to place on the record the significant contribution made by Shannon Development to the region since its inception in 1959. It has served the area well and with distinction. In developing and operating 52 business and technology parks around the greater mid-west area, Shannon Development has a unique insight into what works throughout the region. The expertise it developed with respect to tourism and the introduction of specific tourism products is another area in which Shannon Development excelled. I fully expect that as a primary part of this new entity, it will bring a unique perspective and expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> I note in the recent Seanad debate that Independent Senator Sean D. Barrett gave us the benefit of his knowledge of the efficiency and cost base of our three main airports. He particularly identified the poor productivity levels at Shannon compared with Cork. Obviously, this is a challenge for the new Shannon management and structure, but I believe it can be significantly addressed by increasing passenger numbers and levels of activity at the airport without increasing the operational cost on a pro-rata basis. He raised a valid point and one that must be kept under constant review.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> I made reference at the outset to my early meetings with the Minister following his appointment, in which we both reflected on the concerns for staff in any restructured Shannon Airport. My concern for Shannon Airport was not just with regard to the urgency of revitalising the airport for the benefit of the whole region. I was always conscious that revitalisation of the airport could not and should not be done at the expense of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The employees at the airport, past and present, are key stakeholders and their views and opinions are critical and invaluable in all major decisions on its future. In that regard, I acknowledge the constructive and sensitive comments of the Minister in both the Seanad and this House on matters pertaining to the pension entitlements of the staff at Shannon Airport. There is no doubt that this is a significant issue and, like many other Members, I have received representations in respect of it. I hope, however, that the legislation will not be defined by this matter alone. It is ultimately in everybody's interests that Shannon Group, as an economic entity, be both vibrant and profitable and that it be able to contribute to the future stability of the airport and offer a return on pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The proposals contained in the Bill fit very well with the sense of empowerment, responsibility and innovation at the core of the thinking of the men and women who developed Shannon Airport during the past 70 years. I particularly highlight the debt owed to people such as the late Dr. Brendan O'Regan and those public servants of Aer Rianta whose vision not just for the airport but also its ancillary activities always ensured the airport punched above its weight. Innovative products and initiatives such as Bunratty Folk Park, the Shannon School of Catering, the Aeroflot fuel farm, the industrial park at Shannon and the international duty free service are all landmarks in the proud history of the region. Those to whom I refer would strongly support the new structures being put in place, particularly as they dovetail with the spirit of innovation and can-do attitude displayed by the individuals in question. I am sure Dr. O'Regan would see this as a great challenge and opportunity to which everyone in the region should respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> I thank the Minister for displaying such interest in the Shannon region, persevering with this issue and bringing about a structure that is clearly working for the benefit of the region. I compliment the management, board and staff employed at the airport on the sterling work they are doing on our behalf. I look forward to the Bill's passage through the House.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_716">I thank Deputies Joe Carey, Kieran O'Donnell and others for their kind words about my role in respect of the Shannon Airport project in the past couple of years. I also thank my officials and advisers in the Department who made an enormous effort to get us to this point. I further thank the staff, board members and others at Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Deputy Timmy Dooley and others referred to the viability of Shannon Airport. It is important to point out that since Shannon Airport gained independence from the DAA 18 months ago, it has shown that it is able to stand alone. It has halted the decline in passenger numbers and there is going to be renewed growth this year, both in the numbers of routes and passengers. The latter is very much normal growth brought about by airlines in increasing the numbers of passengers into the airport. The number of military flights has actually been falling in recent years. While it is true that the airport will not reach the passenger levels forecast in the 2012 business plan, these forecasts were very ambitious, rightly so. Factors which contribute to this are lower than anticipated transit traffic such as that of a military nature and a delay in concluding an agreement with Ryanair on new services. The agreement to which I refer has now been concluded. However, post-2014, the Shannon Airport Authority, SAA, expects terminal traffic levels to catch up with the business plan estimates, albeit military traffic is likely to remain on a downward trajectory. In effect, the airport is lagging just one year behind the traffic estimates in the business plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> Under the corporate structure outlined in the Bill, the SAA and Shannon Development will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of Shannon Group. That is deliberate and one of the reasons is to ensure there will not be cross-subsidisation between these two entities. While this structure has many advantages, my Department worked closely with the Attorney General's office to ensure state aid rules would not be breached. I have no doubt but that Shannon Airport can and will prosper in its own right under the board and management now in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> Aside from halting the disastrous fall in passenger numbers last year, the airport also broke even financially. It had been making losses since 2008. There has not really been a negative impact on the airport as a result of the delay in establishing Shannon Group in legislation. Last year was about stabilising the airport which had previously been in free-fall and the board, management and staff are to be congratulated on their success in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> On the IAS scheme, some time ago I heard Ms Ingrid Miley, RTE's industry and employment correspondent, refer to the scheme as the most complex industrial relations matter she had covered for some time. The issues relating to the scheme are complex, partly because the scheme is complex, inflexible and involves multiple employers. The issues relating to the scheme have been ongoing for a number of years and a resolution is urgently required. We will serve no one's interests by kicking it even further down the road. The objective of the Bill is to facilitate implementation of whatever solution we all hope will emerge from the parties to the scheme. The report the expert panel brought forward last week is extremely important in this regard. As stated in my opening contribution, I will be tabling amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. These will include removal of the provisions to which Deputy Dessie Ellis and others referred and which would have permitted the employers to withdraw from the scheme. I reiterate that these provisions were intended to be used only in a fall-back, as an alternative to a forced wind-up of the scheme by the Pensions Authority. We are taking the steps to which I refer in order to ensure that where such a wind-up occurred, there would be a better outcome for members.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> It is important to point out that Aer Rianta International was not referenced in the 2004 State Airports Act. That was because it was never intended to move it from the ownership of the DAA - previously, Aer Rianta - to which it had always belonged. It was always the intention that while the debts associated with Shannon Airport would remain with the DAA, Aer Rianta International would also remain with it. Aer Rianta International operates in a rapidly-changing, highly competitive market and needs to adapt in order to survive and prosper. The global travel retail market is large, growing and profitable. Aer Rianta International can maximise its potential within DAA ownership, benefiting from the latter's funding, borrowing and balance sheet capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> A number of Deputies referred to civil servants at Shannon and Cork who transferred to Aer Rianta in 1970s. I understand this issue was reviewed during the years on a number of occasions by a number of my predecessors, the Department's legal adviser and the Office of the Attorney General. The position remains that Aer Rianta - now the DAA - complied with its obligations to this group of people on retirement in accordance with the terms agreed to at the time. The individuals in question accepted a contract of employment with Aer Rianta in 1974. However, in response to the concerns raised by Deputies about this matter - much has changed in the interim - and without making any commitment, I will ask my officials to examine the matter afresh and make a formal submission to me on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> There are no plans to change the current arrangements for the use of Shannon Airport by the US military which involve a long-standing practice in place for well over 50 years. Deputies will be aware that the transit of foreign military aircraft through Shannon Airport is subject to strict conditions. Permission to land is only given on the condition that aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and do not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question do not form part of any military exercise or operation. As stated, the volume of these flights has been decreasing in recent years. Rather than being part of what was referred to as an American imperialist scheme in the Middle East, in many instances, the military aircraft in question carry soldiers who are transiting to and from bases in countries such as Germany where they are present at the invitation and request of host governments. I was somewhat confused when one Deputy suggested Hezbollah was very disappointed by us. Neither I, the Government, my party, nor the country has ever really sought the approval of Hezbollah. Perhaps the Deputy meant something else.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Deputy Timmy Dooley suggested Shannon Heritage remain part of the group. I have no difficulty with this. If it is not broken, one should not fix it. However, it is intended to carry out a proper review in due course in order to determine what other options are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> Deputy Dessie Ellis and several other Members suggested it might be sinister that we had included several other provisions in the Bill. It is the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill, not the Shannon Group Bill, and includes a variety of measures pertaining to State airports. Shannon Airport simply happens to form the main part of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> Deputy Dessie Ellis suggested deferred members had been granted a meeting only four days before the expert panel published its report. It is important to indicate that it was actually the second meeting they had had with the panel.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> Deputy Finian McGrath pointed out that he represented many airport staff and former staff. He told me with some passion that we should listen to people on the ground. I agree with him - I imagine every politician does - but we must also have regard to the fact that we represent others. We also represent the 1,000 people working at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports who do not have the benefit of any pension scheme. We represent in all of our constituencies tens of thousands of taxpayers and ordinary citizens. Whoever is responsible for the deficit in the scheme, it is certainly not these taxpayers and ordinary citizens. We must ensure any solutions to these problems recognise the fact that the tens of thousands of taxpayers and ordinary citizens who live in our constituencies have their own debts, deficits and problems and should not be held responsible for the deficit in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> Deputy Clare Daly made a valid point in respect of deferred members not having access to the industrial relations machinery. I gather that in the past they had access to the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and the Labour Court, but that access was removed. The Deputy makes a good point in that regard, but it is beyond the scope of this legislation to change the way the Labour Court and the LRC work. It is something that should perhaps be considered elsewhere and could involve me and, more particularly, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, who are responsible for pensions and industrial relations policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> Deputy Clare Daly also suggested I was somehow blaming the workers for the deficit in the pension scheme. That is certainly not the case and very much misrepresents anything I have said on the record or elsewhere. What I said was that the reason there was a deficit in the scheme was during the years the companies and members had not made the contributions that might have been necessary to meet the promises given or their expectations. That is different from suggesting the workers are to blame and, certainly, I do not take that view.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> Deputy Clare Daly pointed out that the Irish airlines superannuation scheme had made some poor investment decisions. That is the case, but it is a private pension scheme. Many pension schemes make investment decisions that work out, while many make investment decisions that do not. That is in the nature of financial investment, private sector investment in particular. I do not believe the public and taxpayers should be responsible for the investment decisions of others from which they would never have benefited had they gone the other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> While it is absolutely the case that many in Aer Lingus, in particular, were encouraged to retire or take early retirement, it is also worth pointing out that these packages were agreed with the trade unions at the time. Those who left the companies often received generous exit packages and, furthermore, some, in fact, returned. There are deferred pensioners from an airline who now work for the airport and <i>vice versa</i>. That should be taken into account also. I was accused of double standards at one point, but that is happening to a fair degree all around.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Deputy Kieran O'Donnell and others raised the issue of fifth freedom air traffic rights for Shannon Airport. What is envisaged under aviation policy is that Ireland as a whole would take a more liberal approach in respect of fifth freedom air traffic rights such that if airlines wished to fly in and out of Irish airports, they would be allowed to do so. We are going to try to minimise the restrictions when it comes to fifth freedom air trafic rights. It will not be a free-for-all, but we are going to take a liberal approach using a case by case assessment. It is suggested that we extend these rights to all airports, not only Shannon Airport. The idea is that the airports in Dublin, Cork and Knock or any international airport would be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> Some Deputies made good points about regional development. I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy on the matter. We should never see regional development being confined to Dublin and the east coast. That is a flawed way of looking at it. In reality, when the greater Dublin area competes for investment, it tends to compete not with other parts of Ireland but with Tel Aviv, San Francisco, Amsterdam and Luxembourg. When we compete for tourists, we compete not with the west of Ireland - the experience of a city break in Dublin is very different from a holiday in the west - but with Copenhagen, Edinburgh, Amsterdam and such places. Often it is the case that when something is lost to Dublin, it is lost to Ireland. We should consider regional development differently and ask what each region can do best and most competitively and then support it to do this. This could mean, for example, promoting pharmaceuticals and maritime activities in Cork, tourism in the west or food production in the south east. However, the view that somehow it is possible to move investment, spending and development from Dublin to other parts of the country by Government fiat is simply mistaken in what is a globalised environment. This also applies when it comes to fifth freedom air traffic rights. If we only gave such rights to the airport at Shannon and not Dublin, what would we do in the case of an airline that only wished to fly to Dublin? Would we indicate we did not want it to fly Ireland at all? There could be such a scenario, which would be a mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> Deputies Dara Murphy and Jerry Buttimer spoke eloquently about Cork Airport. They have pointed out, rightly, that it is the busiest airport in the State after Dublin; that although passenger numbers may be down this year, the airport has a new management team; that it is well run; that it serves over 50 destinations; that it scores highly in terms of customer service, which is a tribute to the quality of its staff; and that it is pursuing various opportunities in respect of new routes, particularly to places without many connections to Cork Airport, for example, northern Germany, the Nordic countries and Spain.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> One issue stands out in Cork which makes it different from the airports at Shannon and in Dublin. At Shannon and in Dublin the split is roughly 50:50 in terms of inbound and outbound passengers. Cork Airport is different. Fully 70% of passengers are leaving, while only 30% are coming to visit Cork. That is why we need to have a broader approach to the airport, rather than one based solely on aviation. It should take into account tourism, in particular. Cork has a considerable amount to offer tourists and I am keen to see far more people flying to Cork Airport for holidays, whether in the city or other parts of Munster.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> Deputy Róisín Shortall referred to some legal agreements in place for deferred pensioners. If there are such legal agreements, ultimately decisions will be made in the courts, not in Parliament. We cannot adjudicate on legal disputes.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> Deputy Catherine Murphy asked if it was intended that Shannon Airport would remain 100% in State ownership. I can confirm that this is the case, but obviously it is for future Governments to decide for themselves. Certainly, it is the decision of the Government that it will remain in State ownership in its entirety.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> Deputy Catherine Murphy also asked about the laying of orders. The orders that would be made directly by the Minister would be under sections 28 and 38 transferring ownership of the Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Commercial Enterprises to Shannon Group and ownership of the land at Shannon Airport which Shannon Development currently operates from the Minister to the company. These orders will implement the parts of the legislation that have been debated and decided on by both Houses. Therefore, there is no reason for the House to consider them a second time.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> Deputy Thomas P. Broughan raised the matter of travel agents. An updated package travel directive is at an advanced stage of consideration in the European Parliament. Its implementation will allow us to update all related legislation in Irish law such that Irish travel agents and tour operators will be able to compete on a level playing field with their counterparts in other European countries. The current amendment is simply a temporary holding measure until such time as the new directive comes into force and a comprehensive revision of the legislation can take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> Reference was made to deferred members. It is important to point out that the expert panel made recommendations in this respect. It recommended that the trustees and employers engage under agreed principles in respect of the deferred members. I understand these discussions are ongoing. I hope whatever outcome is reached in the process, the deferred members will be treated no less favourably than other groups affected by the pensions dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> Forfás is not a commercial body, unlike the Dublin Airport Authority or Aer Lingus, and is completely different in this context. The IAS scheme is a private one and has serious solvency issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The amendments included in the Bill are designed to facilitate a resolution of these issues and nothing more.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> I have probably covered everything raised by Deputies. I thank everyone for what has been an interesting and pertinent debate.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPerry" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy John Perry)<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_746">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I am pleased to present the Friendly Societies and Industrial and Provident Societies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013 on Second Stage. It addresses two separate bodies of legislation, both of which operate under the Registry of Friendly Societies, namely, the legislation governing friendly societies and the legislation governing industrial and provident societies under which many co-operatives are registered. In this sense, the Bill represents a response to our commitment in the programme for Government to work to ensure a level playing field between co-operatives and the other legal options for structuring enterprise activities and provide a framework for the full potential of the co-operative model to be realised.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> The Bill received broad support in its passage through the Seanad, where just one substantive amendment was made. This related to the application of examinerships to co-operative societies. The amendment arose from the introduction late last year of the ability for small private companies to initiate the examinership process in the Circuit Court rather than the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> Both bodies of legislation addressed by the Bill date back to the late 19th century when friendly societies and industrial and provident societies developed as part of a mutual self-help movement that included co-operatives, building societies, savings banks, credit unions and trade unions. Given Ireland's rural economy, the emphasis was mainly on farming co-operatives and agricultural banks on the industrial and provident societies side, whereas friendly societies, many offering insurance-type services, making payments and offering support at times of death, illness or inability to work, were largely an urban phenomenon.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> As Deputies well know, co-operatives have played a significant role in our economic and social development during the years, particularly in the agrifood sector through groups such as Kerry Group, Glanbia and Dairygold. People will also know about the work of co-operatives through the livestock marts that operate in nearly every county or even more directly through their group water schemes which account for more than one third of all registered co-operatives. Housing co-operatives also play a significant role in the provision of group and affordable housing for people with modest incomes through a mix of renting and ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> Co-operatives are owned and democratically controlled by their members. It is important to recognise the contribution they make and appreciate their real value and worth. They are rooted in the community, offer jobs to local people, can be stable employers because their members live in the community and offer a strong alternative to more investor-driven businesses. The Government is committed to assisting this particular form of enterprise to expand, develop and continue to have a positive impact on business.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> The picture is somewhat different nowadays on the friendly societies side. While no one would deny the good that these societies have done in their day and, in the context of the small number that remain, continue to do, it has become clear in recent years that this is not a corporate model of choice in the 21st century. In fact, just three of the existing 47 societies have registered in the past nine years. It could be argued that the friendly society model has been a victim of its own success. As many of the activities carried out under the friendly societies umbrella developed, they became independently regulated sectors, for example, insurance and medical benefits societies, or were replaced by State-provided welfare systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> The Government is concerned about a prudential supervision gap. While the Central Bank regulates savings, loan and insurance activities carried out by entities involved in the provision of financial services with a view to protecting the financial interests of members of the public doing business with the provider of the financial services, it does not do so where these activities are carried out by friendly societies. This is a source of some concern, given the potential risk to the interests of certain members of the public who may not be aware of their exposure and believe they are protected by the general regulatory activity of the Central Bank. As such, it is in the public interest to restrict the operation of new entities. However, the Registry of Friendly Societies has no expertise in this regard and there is no existing legal basis for such supervision, nor would it be practical, given the number of societies involved, to develop a dedicated supervisory regime within the existing registry. The most realistic institutional option for introducing an appropriate system of supervision is the Central Bank which is at the centre of financial supervision and financial stability oversight and has a responsibility to provide, in a fully integrated and co­ordinated manner, for the prudential supervision and stability of all types of financial service within the financial system as a whole. To avoid the possibility of other bodies moving into this unregulated space, it has been decided to close registrations to new friendly societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> Our reasons for amending this fairly ancient legislation instead of introducing a new Act or Acts are twofold. First, we needed to avoid diverting effort and resources away from the work on the Companies Bill, with which all Deputies are familiar from its recent passage through the House and which is the current priority in this area. Second, the Companies Bill, when enacted, will, to a certain extent, impact on how related issues in the co-operatives area will operate. There is no principled reason for the approach taken by that Bill on matters such as registration and financial reporting not to apply to friendly societies and co-operatives in due course also.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> This Bill is aimed primarily at easing the regulatory burden on co-operative societies and making it easier to start up and run a co-operative as an alternative form of enterprise organisation. It will address particular problems that have been identified in the co-operative sector and help to ensure this model will thrive and grow to its potential in line with the commitment in the programme for Government to promote appreciation of the co-operative as a form of enterprise organisation. The Bill also recognises the changing environment in which friendly societies operate and the lack of prudential supervision governing activities that, if carried out by other entities, would be subject to regulatory oversight and seeks to address these issues. When the Companies Bill is enacted, the intention is to prepare modern legislation to cater for the co-operative sector and existing friendly societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> Let me turn now to the Bill which is set out in four Parts to give more detail on some of its main provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, which comprise Part 1, are general sections only, dealing with citations, construction and commencement, definitions and provide that expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill may be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> Sections 4 to 8, inclusive, make up Part 2 of the Bill which relates to the operation of the friendly societies legislation. Section 5 provides for a significant change to that Act, that is, the termination of registration of societies under this legislation. Only 47 societies remain in existence, of which just three are new entrants in the course of the past nine years, giving a clear indication that the friendly society model is no longer favoured by newly establishing organisations. This change will mean, in effect, that the friendly society model will continue only for a closed group of societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> Section 6 places a restriction on existing societies establishing a loan fund, as provided for in section 46 of the principal Friendly Societies Act 1896, where they do not already have such a fund in place. This has been a little used provision - just three societies have a fund in place and this change will not impact on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> Sections 7 and 8 are two technical amendments which will facilitate the operation of the Friendly Societies Acts. Section 7 removes the role of the Minister in relation to cancellations of friendly societies. Under the current legislation, the Registrar of Friendly Societies must receive the prior approval of the Minister before cancelling societies. It is proposed to remove this role in relation to friendly societies and also later in the Bill to industrial and provident societies. The Minister has no such role in relation to a company strike-off and such a role for a political authority is inappropriate in modern times. </p>
          <p eId="para_761"> Section 8 removes the restriction in the current Act providing that the registrar must be physically absent for the powers, functions and duties to be exercised and performed by such other person as the Minister may authorise and allows another person to act alongside the registrar.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> Sections 9 to 12, inclusive, make up Part 3 and relate to the operation of the industrial and provident societies legislation. Section 10 sets out a number of amendments to the principal Act of 1893. These relate to issues which were identified through a consultation process as being practical and immediate difficulties being experienced by co-operative societies in relation to the current legislation. It is considered that the proposed amendments will ease the administrative burden for the co-operative sector. I will detail some of the main changes. Paragraph (a) provides for the removal of the upper limit on the interest in a society which an individual society member may hold, where a society so specifies in its rules. The existing upper limit is €150,000, or 1% of the total assets of the society, set in 2005. This limit is generally suitable for all categories of society, although there is a risk that it may deter the formation of new societies having small memberships but high capital requirements, for example, wind farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> The original rationale for having a statutory limit on individual shareholdings is believed to be connected with the notion of equal participation by the members of a co-operative enterprise. This objective, however, can be fully achieved by co-operatives themselves through the medium of their own rules and without the need for legislative intervention. Paragraph (b) provides that an appeal from a refusal by the registrar to register a society, or to register a society's rules, may be made to the Circuit Court, rather than the High Court as at present. This should reduce costs for societies. </p>
          <p eId="para_764"> Paragraph (c) makes two technical amendments, including providing for the removal of the requirement for the Minister to approve the cancellation of a society's registration. Paragraph (e) provides that annual returns to the registrar may be submitted on one of two dates during the year, depending on the date of a society's financial year, that is, the date to which their balance sheet is made up. This allows societies freedom regarding their choice of year end and extends the timeframe for the submission of the return. The current system is restrictive and causes difficulties for societies, the annual business cycles of which do not accord with the dates set down in the Acts such as dairy societies which wish to bring their reporting year into line with the dairy production year. </p>
          <p eId="para_765"> Paragraph (f) extends the right of members or persons having an interest in the funds of the society to inspect the books containing the names of members to include their holdings in the society, whether in shares or loans. I understand this is already the practice among many co-operative societies. </p>
          <p eId="para_766"> Paragraph (g) provides for a right for non-members to inspect the books containing the names of members and their holdings in shares at reasonable hours at the registered office of the society. The section is modelled on a similar provision in the Companies Acts. Without this amendment, non-members would have no ability to access the membership or holding details of a society, in the absence of the triennial return, the requirement for which is being abolished.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> The co-operative sector has sought the abolition of the requirement for societies to submit, at least once in every three years, a return, known as a triennial return, of the members and their holdings to the registrar. The sector has argued that the information is out of date too quickly to be useful and imposes an unnecessary administrative burden on societies. Section 11, therefore, in accordance with what proved to be general agreement that this return served no useful purpose, abolishes this requirement. Section 10(g) provides that both members and non-members will now be able to access information on members and their shareholdings directly through the co-operative society.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Section 12 provides for a number of amendments to the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act 1978. It provides for an increase in the amount which a society may raise by way of subscription for shares, without the written permission of the registrar, from €12,697 - £10,000 - to €30,000. It also extends the provision whereby certain funding sources are excluded from the requirement to obtain the written permission of the registrar to include moneys advanced by a public body to a registered society. This will remove the need for societies to seek the prior permission of the registrar before they can accept funds from a public body or where the amount of share capital raised in any period of six months does not exceed €30,000. The change meets the concerns of some societies affected, particularly building co-operatives, that the current restrictions are excessive.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> Sections 13 to 25, inclusive, make up the fourth and final Part which provides for the examinership provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990, as amended, to be made available to co-operative societies. Examinership is a mechanism used to enable companies in financial difficulties to be put back on a sound footing and avoid liquidation. Currently, this mechanism is not available to industrial and provident societies. The practical effect is to limit the restructuring options available to a co-operative society in the event that it gets into financial difficulties. While I am not aware of any particular instance in which the examinership mechanism may be required by co-operative societies, it is considered desirable, particularly in the current economic climate, that the mechanism be available for use by any society which might need it. The co-operative movement has also signalled that this matter should be addressed as a priority. The intention is that the law on examinership, as it applies to companies through the 1990 Companies (Amendment) Act, will apply in the same manner to industrial and provident societies. </p>
          <p eId="para_770"> Sections 13 to 25, inclusive, provide for such necessary definitions, changes and modifications as are needed to apply the legislation to industrial and provident societies. The amendments are, effectively, technical amendments necessary for the understanding and effective operation of the legislation in its application to co-operative societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> A small number of sections or parts of sections of the Bill are, for various reasons, disapplied for the purpose of the Bill's application to industrial and provident societies, for example, section 6A is disapplied as the provisions of the Companies Acts in relation to receivers do not apply to industrial and provident societies. Again, I will detail some of the main provisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_772"> Section 15 construes phrases in the 1990 Act which apply specifically to companies to the nearest equivalent definition or meaning for industrial and provident societies. </p>
          <p eId="para_773"> Section 16 applies section 2 of the 1990 Act, as amended by the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, which allows certain private companies to initiate proceedings in the Circuit Court, rather than the High Court. This section also establishes what is meant by a "small society" which is not an existing concept in terms of co-operative societies. The criteria used to define a "small society" are similar to those used to define a "small private company".</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> Section 17 deals with the issue of who may petition for protection of the court, with certain modifications needed with regard to industrial and provident societies. It specifies the number of members of the society required to present a petition. The number proposed in this regard equates with the existing proportion of members who are permitted by the 1893 Industrial and Provident Societies Act to request the registrar to investigate a society. For ease of reference, the section also restates and updates the references to the list of societies comprehended by section 3(2)(<i>c</i>) of the 1990 Act. By restating the list in this Bill, the necessity to refer to Acts other than the 1990 Act is avoided. Additionally, as the list is not directly applicable to all industrial and provident societies, non-relevant elements are excluded. The section also expands the definition of "director" to include the committee of management or other directing body of an industrial and provident society.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> Section 20 substitutes the reference in sections 7, 18 and 24 to the Companies Acts with the Industrial and Provident Society Acts to reflect the fact that the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts rather than the Companies Acts provide the governing legislation for societies. </p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Section 21 removes the reference to "shadow director" which is not a term which has an equivalent meaning in the context of an industrial and provident society.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> Section 25 restates the offences in the 1990 Act and has been updated to equate with the provisions in the Companies Bill 2012 which is before the Seanad. The section provides that summary proceedings in relation to an offence under this section may be brought by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> I look forward to hearing Members' views this evening and in our future consideration of the Bill as it progresses through the House. I commend it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_779">Fianna Fáil welcomes the easing of the regulatory burden on co­operative societies through the elimination of some of the discrepancies under which the current regulatory system favours the company model. We also support making examinership, currently available only to companies, accessible to co­operative societies. The Irish word "meitheal" sums up the principles of the co-operative movement, namely, people working together for the betterment of their community. In an increasingly globalised world, there has never been a greater need for the principles of the co-operative movement to be applied in a practical manner, supporting local employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Fianna Fáil has concerns regarding the prohibition on the registration of new friendly societies. While the sector has gone into decline in recent times, many friendly societies provide a valuable service in niche areas. In contrast, the sector appears to be doing well in the UK, with more than 10,000 societies there under the control of the Financial Conduct Authority. Given the lack of competition within the domestic banking sector and the difficulties experienced within the industry in Ireland in recent times, it could offer a valuable alternative means of providing pensions, savings or co-operative banking to people in a cost-effective manner. Rather than closing off this form of enterprise, the Government should be examining how the sector can be assisted in meeting the needs of the modern economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> As stated by the Minister of State, co-operatives are businesses owned and operated by and for their members. The distinguishing feature of a co-operative is that the members have an equal say in the running of the business and a share in the profits. The sheer breadth of the co-operative sector can be seen from the website of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, the umbrella organisation for co-operatives in Ireland. ICOS serves more than 150,000 members and directly employs 12,000 people in Ireland. It has seven core sectors: multipurpose dairy co-ops; livestock sector co-ops; store, trade and wholesale co-ops; service-related co-ops; community-oriented, culture and leisure co-ops; food, fishing and beverage co-ops; and advisory and education-related co-ops.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> Co-operative societies are an undervalued form of enterprise. Fianna Fáil welcomes the move to reduce the regulatory burden placed upon them and to make them a more attractive business form. There are numerous examples of successful co-operatives around the country allowing people to work together to create sustainable enterprises, particularly in the agricultural sphere. Since the establishment of the co-operatives in the agriculture sector, particularly the dairy sector and livestock marts throughout the country, they have been invaluable. Some of the smaller co-operatives that opted to remain on their own despite the challenges in the sector have been very competitive. Some of the small co-operatives in Cork, including North Cork Co-op, Bóthar Buí Co-op and Drinagh Co-op, have been paying the best prices to their primary producers, the farmers. The House will later resume its debate on the Irish beef industry. The model of the co-operative movement and the value it has created cannot be underestimated.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> For a long time credit unions were viewed as friendly societies, which came within the remit of the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. However, owing to the financial issues that have arisen, they have moved into the mainstream financial area. There are also many co-operatives in the social housing area, made up of sheltered housing agencies coming together to form co-operatives in order to draw down funding. The <i>modus operandi</i> of these co-operatives has been second to none. In the UK, a number of co-operatives are being established in a raft of sectors. As I stated earlier, the small co-operatives have best served the primary producers, which is the purpose for which they were established. While some co-operatives are huge global enterprises, the primary function of the co-operative movement is to serve its shareholders and the people they represent. </p>
          <p eId="para_784"> On the extension of the examinership option to co-operatives, there was a significant reform of examinerships last year as part of the Companies Bill. Fianna Fáil supports the extension of the examinership option to co-operatives. For legislation to be successful, it must be endorsed by the relevant professions, accountancy and legal. Also, the Judiciary needs to be trained in the complexities of co-operative society restructurings. Solicitors, barristers, auditors and accountants should be required to post prices for their services, including hourly rates, on the relevant regulatory website. All professionals should be required to provide clients with meaningful cost estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"><b>
						</b>A number of concerns were raised in the Seanad about the prohibition on the registration of new friendly societies. It is true that there has been a significant decline in recent times in the number of friendly societies here. There are currently only 47 in existence, with only a limited number having been registered in the past ten years. However, many such societies provide a valuable service to their members. During the debate on the legislation in the Seanad, Senator Seán D. Barrett highlighted the case of the public service friendly society which provides access to low-cost illness protection, specified illness cover, travel insurance and help for members struggling with school costs. While the Government appears to be willing to close the book on the era of friendly societies, it is a very different situation in the UK, where more than 10,000 such societies are in existence, managing the savings and investments of 4.5 million people and total funds of £15 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> The decision not to allow any new registrations is a sign that the Government is willing to allow the sector to wither away. While the structure may have fallen out of favour in recent times, it would be better to examine whether it could be reformed and a new regulatory model put in place before consigning it to the annals of history. Given the lack of competition within the domestic banking sector and the difficulties experienced within the industry in Ireland in recent times, it could offer a valuable alternative means of providing pensions, savings or co-operative banking to people in a cost-effective manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">The purpose of the Bill is to provide for various amendments to two bodies of legislation, the Friendly Societies Acts and the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts. The main amendment in the area of friendly societies provides for the closure of registration of new societies. It is vital that we re-examine this. Co-operatives throughout the country have done extraordinary work. We should always give tremendous credit to those who were members of the boards or committees of various co-operatives. Over recent years, committee members have become board members. When they were set up, contentious issues arose right across rural communities in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> It would be remiss of me not to mention Mr. Liam Moynihan, who passed away this morning. He was a member of Kanturk Co-op Mart and a former member of Boherbue Co-op, one of the oldest dairy societies in the country. I pay tribute to him and all board members who served on co-operatives. Sometimes they were pilloried over what they did in their communities, but they always had the best interests of those communities and societies at heart. They always worked extremely hard with the management of their co-operatives to ensure the accounts and dividends were in order and that new businesses would be fought for. At times, they stood in the way of management that was perceived to be going in the wrong direction. Right across the country, we should always pay tribute to the board members, because they were operating on a voluntary basis. Until recent times, they were by and large untrained. I speak in particular of agricultural communities. They had very little training to be on boards but had their communities' best interests at heart. Some went on to be on national boards, such as that of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society. All contributed enormously to their own communities. I ask the Government to try to reinvigorate the original spirit of the co-operatives in regard to housing and so forth. Those concerned have done invaluable service. In the United Kingdom, there are co-operatives pertaining to nearly every aspect of life, even in the funeral business.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> I welcome the thrust of the Bill. The few points I am most concerned about are on friendly societies. I commend everybody who has worked in co-operatives since their inception in the late 19th century. The co-operatives were a breath of fresh air in communities that had few if any prospects. I am thankful for having had the opportunity to speak on the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_790">Ní Bille conspóideach é seo. Mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit, is freagra é do na gealltanais d'earnáil na gcomharchumann a bhí sa chlár Rialtais. Ní chruthaíonn sé, mar a bhí geallta ag an Rialtas, creat chun féidireachtaí iomlán samhail na gcomharchumann a bhaint amach, go háirithe i réimsí cosúil le cúram leanaí, oideachas, tithíocht, aisfheistiú tithíochta, cosaint an chomhshaoil, cúrsaí iompair agus cúrsaí sláinte. Caithfidh mé a admháil go gcabhróidh an Bille seo le ceardchumainn a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh. Tugann an Bille deis do na comharchumainn tairbhí, ar nós scrúdú atreoraithe, a bhaint amach. Ach mar is eol don Aire Stáit, tá an Rialtas seo ag druidim chun deiridh. B'fhéidir go dtiocfaidh an deireadh le teacht an bhuiséid 2015. I mo thuairim, is é trademark an Rialtais seo ná teip polasaí a chur i bhfeidhm. Dá bhfaigheadh an tAire Airgeadais euró as gach teip an Rialtais gealltanais a chur i bhfeidhm, bheadh críoch leis an ngéarchéim eacnamaíochta sa tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> Cúpla bliain ó shin, d'fhoilsigh Sinn Féin plean cuimsitheach le fostaíocht a choinneáil agus a chruthú. Leagamar amach tábhacht agus luach ghluaiseacht na gcomharchumann, go háirithe mar fhreagra don chúlú sa gheilleagar. Faoi láthair, tá 12,000 comharchumainn san Airgintín, le ballraíocht de 9.3 milliún duine. Shábháil oibrithe sa tír sin níos mó ná 200 gnóthaí teipthe a bhí ag earcú 15,000 duine. Seo ceacht uafásach tábhachtach don Rialtas seo. Ba cheart go mbeadh an ceacht seo foghlamtha le sé bliana anuas - go gcaithfimid féachaint thar na samhlacha gnó traidisiúnta. Ach leis an fhírinne a rá, is léir go bhfuil drogall ar na hAirí agus ar na bainisteoirí Rannach sinsearacha an samhail mhalartach a thuiscint. Is é tuairim earnáil na tionsclaíochta gur in ainneoin an cúlaithe sa gheilleagar agus an suaitheadh fisiceach, níl aon ghá don Rialtas nó do na Ranna réiteach uaillmhianach a thógáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> Some 123 million co-operative members own 160,000 co-operative enterprises employing 5.4 million people across Europe. That is a phenomenal figure, which shows the energy and dynamism that exists within the sector. The Government acknowledged the potential of the co-operative movement in its programme for Government commitments three years ago. This Bill does improve the lot and function of co-operatives across the country, but there is no doubt in my mind that even after three years, the Government has not lived up to its objectives or the commitments made in the programme for Government. Ireland ranks among the lowest in the European Union for co-operative membership, enterprises and employees. If one explained to staff of the former enterprise agencies, the county enterprise boards, that one was seeking to set up a co-operative to sort out a particular business need, they would probably have stared back at one, wondering what one meant. At policy, departmental, ministerial and enterprise agency levels, co-operatives’ function and ability to tackle some of the major economic challenges were just not understood and, therefore, not acted upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> In the document we launched a while ago, we identified a number of challenges facing the sector, including those addressed in this Bill. We also examined the need to develop management and entrepreneurial skills, the lack of data on co-operatives and the lack of understanding of the model among policy-makers. Critically, we acknowledged the need to recognise the value of co-operatives on a social basis and as economic contributors. We set out an initial strategy to develop the co-operative sector and identified the need for a co-operative model to be seen as an option for struggling viable businesses. The Government is not doing enough to support Ireland's indigenous business sector. Unfortunately, as I have stated here before, the cutbacks affecting Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards, and the similar cutbacks affecting foreign direct investment organisations such as the IDA, indicate that the focus of the Government is heading continually towards foreign direct investment at the expense of indigenous business. We should realise that the sectors are not independent of each other but actually interdependent. The Government's enterprise strategy is staid and its failure on co-operatives is an example of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> Although the Bill is uncontroversial, I wish to note the comments made by Senator Sean Barrett when the legislation was making its way through the Seanad. He robustly argued against the Government's decision to introduce an extinction clause for friendly societies. The Minister of State will have noticed that there are just 48 such societies remaining, with just three having registered over the past nine years. These societies provide for small life assurance benefits and sickness and death benefits for members. I could understand it if the Minister were making a decision to wind down the societies on the basis that something was going wrong with them, such as a scandal or problem, but that does not seem to be the reason they are being wound down. It seems the Government is not providing proper oversight of these organisations and is therefore seeking to wind them down.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The Minister of State mentioned the prudential supervision of friendly societies. As Deputy Moynihan noted, Britain has a totally different attitude in this regard and, obviously, it has seen the benefits these very small organisations bring to their members. They usually provide a service as efficiently as, if not better than, traditional institutions, and at a lower cost to their members. In Britain, the newly-formed Financial Conduct Authority is responsible for the oversight of 10,000 friendly societies, which manage the savings of 4.5 million people, which is not small fry.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> Although he was asked why he was seeking to shut down the societies rather than develop them, I believe the Minister of State failed to offer any real explanation. This is another example of the Government's refusal to see beyond the traditional model of enterprise. Ireland has a very long and proud history of properly functioning co-operatives. The first thing we need to get into our minds is that the co-op is a model for a functioning, dynamic, profitable business, and that it offers economic solutions just as any other business can. It often does it more efficiently, for less cost and to the greater benefit of its members.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> One of the major problems we have in society today is that there is a yawning gap between the earnings of management and those of the workers on the floor of a factory or an organisation. The co-ops typically do it in a different fashion. They have greater pay equality and a far more equal structure, and we need to take that on board. We need to make sure that the local enterprise organisations, or LEOs, that the Minister of State has worked upon previously are fully tooled up to deal with developing that end of the market. Co-ops have provided housing, finance and jobs in this State when nobody else would. As the previous speaker said, they enabled an agricultural revolution at the end of the 19th and the start of the 20th century, when a whole new sector of our society found itself owning land for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> It is vital that we see the opportunity here. I welcome the benefits this Bill has created but I am still am not convinced the Government is taking this sector seriously. I will conclude my remarks by noting that while the Minister of State may bemoan my critical stance on this issue, I do not denigrate the work that has gone into this Bill. However, it is my job to hold the Minister of State to account. The Government promised big in the programme for Government but, unfortunately, has not delivered over three years in. I believe there needs to be a level playing field for co-operatives and that the Government needs to be ambitious for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> Caithfidh go mbeidh fís uaillmhianach ag an Rialtas nuair atáimid ag caint faoi chomharchumainn. Ceapaim go bhfuil deis caillte againn sa Bhille seo.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_800">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which I welcome. I also welcome what is an important debate. I feel strongly that we need change and reform. We must constantly be vigilant and efficient when dealing with our financial services. We have to learn from the huge mistakes of the past and bring a bit of common sense and professionalism into our financial services, banking and the broader economy. The days of the gombeen men and women have to go, and reform is the only way that counts. If we do not do this, we let the country down but, above all, we let the citizens of the State down. It is important that we say this in regard to the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> The Bill provides for the introduction of a number of changes to two codes of legislation, the Friendly Societies Acts and the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts. The Bill provides for the closure of registration of new friendly societies. The amendments in regard to co-operative societies are aimed at easing the regulatory burden on co-operatives and making the option of examinership available to the sector. These are positive measures in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> As I said in my introductory remarks, it is important that we do not take our eye off the ball when it comes to developing the Irish economy, financial services and, in particular, the SME sector. We have to look at this as a national asset and a wealth that we possess. Small businesses that employ between five and 20 people are at the heart of the economy, and they need a break and a lift. Issues such as commercial rates have to be dealt with. The important thing in regard to the SME sector is its results and the number of jobs it supplies, even in the downturn. We have to make this a part of the strategy. We regularly hear members of Government saying that the only game in town in order to get out of this mess is jobs, jobs and jobs. While I agree with that, I also feel that we have to focus strongly on the SME sector of the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> We cannot rely totally on foreign investment. We have a very constructive and open policy in regard to the 100,000 to 120,000 jobs that exist as a result of the foreign investors. However, we need to realise that we have four times that number in employment in the small and medium enterprise sector. Given the Minister of State's specialisation in this area, I believe he will agree with the points I am making. Small businesses are making a massive contribution but they are also delivering on the ground in the local economy. That is the important thing. We need to up our game and, as we do so, we need to ensure that we assist these small businesses to get off their knees and get through these very difficult times.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> It gets up my nose when I hear some people talking about particular aspects of different industries. We had this recently in regard to the broader debate on health and the alcohol issue. However, people often forget that 92,000 jobs are indirectly or directly connected to the drinks industry. This is something we must also consider. We must not blame people who want to go out and have a drink in moderation and enjoy life. Moderation is everything in life, and that is how people should approach it. It is also important to look at new ideas in regard to developing the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> Friendly societies developed as part of the mutual self-help movement in the 19th century, which included co-operatives, building societies, savings banks, credit unions and trade unions, and those societies are registered generally under the Friendly Society Acts 1896 to 1997. The various objectives of those societies that were registered included permitting the carrying out of financial activities, including the provision of financial benefits in regard to illness, old age or death and savings and loan activities, health insurance, life insurance and personal loans. As State intervention increased in the 20th century for the common good through the introduction of State-sponsored social welfare, coupled with the growth and development of the insurance business as an industry sector, the social purposes of the friendly societies begin to decline. There are currently only 35 of those societies active, of which six have been in operation for over 100 years, and many are at a relatively low level of activity. Just over half are involved to one extent or another in the provision of financial services or benefits to members, and these are mostly medical and death benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> The five largest societies, in terms of both assets and annual income, hold assets of more than €150 million, and their volume of business in 2011-12 was approximately €70 million. Four of these societies have a predominantly public sector membership, two offering what might generally be termed health insurance - St. Paul's Garda Medical Aid Society and the Prison Officers' Medical Aid Society, both registered with the Health Insurance Authority as restricted membership undertakings. The fifth is the last remaining active specially authorised loan society, a society which is authorised to grant loans to members. In all, 16 societies hold assets in excess of €1 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">There are just six societies that have been on the register since 2000, none of which is involved in the provision of financial services for their members.</p>

          <p eId="para_809">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate in respect of the crisis in the beef industry. This crisis affects 100,000 farms across the country. The most recent figures on farm income have shown that the average farm income in the beef sector is around €11,000 and when one compares that to the average income in the dairy sector of somewhere near €64,000, it highlights the extent of the crisis in the beef sector. Beef farmers are left at the mercy of the processors for their income who through the marts keep the price at the levels that suit them. I wonder whether an actual "market" is in existence in this country at all. The Minister of State said last night in his contribution that the relationship between processors and farmers is an interdependent one and farmers and processors always fight their own corners to get the best prices. I do not know where he gets this view of the relationship. I am not from a farming background but I do know that the relationship is far from interdependent. It is one where the processors dominate and dictate the price that farmers can achieve for their cattle. Measures spoken about by the Minister of State such as the Beef Pricewatch online tool do very little to help farmers improve the value of their cattle because the price variation appears to be limited and the additional cost involved in getting cattle to the location where they can get the best price could undo any of the value achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> Farmers always cite the example of the price of meat in the multiple retailers in the country to highlight how they are being short changed on their cattle but we export 90% of the beef produced in this country and focusing on the retailers does not really address that issue. Even if the retailers paid a realistic price for cattle, it would only affect 10% of the beef produced here. The focus must be on the processors and factories in respect of the price for farmers. When we have a situation in this country where the entire market is dominated by very few players with one dominant player, there will not be competition in respect of prices for the primary producer. We will continue to see a situation where primary producers will see a loss of up to €300 per head when they sell their stock. Small producers will never be able to secure fair prices from dominant processors. That is the simple fact of how a market economy works, especially one that is dominated by very few operators. It is interesting that the Competition Authority has never looked into the beef industry and how the pricing system operates. I think it is about time that it did so. Although the authority is quite toothless, it may find within itself a way to look into the operation of the beef market in this country. </p>
          <p eId="para_811"> Over the last 15 years or so, many small abattoirs have been hounded out of business by the enforcement of stricter and stricter standards on them that have left them unable to continue to operate. In one case that I know of personally, a small butcher who had an abattoir where he used to slaughter his own cattle was forced to spend over £30,000 as it was at the time to upgrade his facilities. Within months of reopening, he was visited again and told that he would have to spend an additional £20,000 and at that stage, he decided to give up and close his abattoir. It was not financially viable for him to continue. This has happened to hundreds of small processors around the country and, significantly, the effect of this was that it has removed them from the marts bidding against the large processors for cattle. It was a convenient way of getting rid of competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> The motion calls for the introduction of a beef regulator and I would support this call. The Minister has convened a round table to discuss recent challenges but I wonder why such a "softly, softly" course of action is being taken. The beef sector needs determined action. If the processors do not want a regulator, let them open their books to the Competition Authority to examine and let us see how the market is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> Live exports could help with boosting competition for animals in the State. I have heard anecdotal evidence that independent processors in the UK are wary of buying live cattle from Ireland because large processors control the offal rendering business in the UK and they are afraid that they would not be able to have their meat and bone meal dealt with if they entered into the market for live cattle from here. Finally, I urge the Minister to work harder to resolve the labelling difficulty that has closed off the sale of cattle into the Six Counties because farmers need access to whatever markets they can get, however limited, to ensure the market is not totally operating against them. I urge the Minister to take action on that as quickly as possible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_814">One of the conversations I have had with farming friends concerns labelling and their very real fears that beef is coming in from outside Ireland and being labelled as Irish. In spite of all the assurances, how can the Minister ensure that this does not happen? Another conversation really brought the collapse in beef prices home to me. One of my friends bought a cow for €900 in October 2012, kept the cow for 20 months, brought it to the market about two weeks ago with its bull calf and got €1,020. This is not much of a return for 20 months feeding and looking after that particular cow. This story really brought home what part of the motion is about, namely, the collapse in prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> However, I also want to raise another issue that is missing from the motion. This is the EU-US free trade agreement known as TTIP and the dangers it could pose for the Irish beef industry, suppliers and consumers. Even though there have been assurances from the EU Commissioner for Trade and from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that Europe would be protected from cheap imports that could include hormone-treated beef, cloned animals and genetically modified organisms, there are real fears around this area, particularly given that statements from the US side are not at all reassuring. It is clear that the US side has a very different interpretation that could have a disastrous effect on our beef industry. </p>
          <p eId="para_816"> I listened to what the most senior diplomat from the US side, Anthony Gardner, had to say. In his speech, he was supposed to be allaying European and Irish fears but in fact his words were far from reassuring. If one listens to those words, it would appear that the US is pushing for an opening of competition in EU markets to genetically modified foods and cloned animal meats while I thought the fact that he refused even to mention beef hormones was very telling. </p>
          <p eId="para_817"> The Commissioner and the Minister have said that foods are not in the first negotiating round of TTIP and that if beef is to come on to the agenda, the EU and US could only agree to a tariff rate quota for hormone-free beef. However, it is a well-known fact that issues that are not in the first negotiating round of trade agreements can soon be brought into negotiations. We must consider the statements of the US negotiators and the power of the agribusiness lobbies in the US, which have been very explicit about this. There is no room for complacency because the beef industry is our flagship industry and the trademark is very high quality. Consumers rely on that in Ireland and throughout the EU where most of our beef goes. </p>
          <p eId="para_818"> We know that the beef industry has many challenges and we are hearing about them this evening. An influx of competition from cheap unnatural meat imports could really destroy it. There is a need for a full public debate and an independent impact assessment of this because the Ministers and Government seem to be in favour of it. I know the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has looked for an impact assessment from a foreign consultancy but we need to hear from Teagasc, the IFA, the local beef co-operatives, the Irish consumer and the voices of our ordinary Irish farmers and their communities. To date, the people who have spoken out about TTIP have been food professionals - those who rely on the quality of Irish food. They are the ones who seem to be most concerned at this stage. The Irish beef industry could be a perfect case study in an independent assessment of the impact of TTIP on Ireland. The debate cannot be concluded tonight. We need that economic impact assessment and analysis and when we have it and apply it to the beef industry, this debate should be continued. </p>
          <p eId="para_819"> There are related concerns about food quality labelling, animal welfare, the EU's precautionary principle and dairy standards. Investor-state dispute mechanisms in TTIP represent a contentious issue because that means that foreign companies would be able to sue governments, national and local, because of consumer protection laws that they claim infringe freedom of competition. This is a real danger of lower prices in addition to the dangers pointed out in the motion. These lower prices will push Ireland into lower quality markets for animal feeds and meats and we could lose our competitive advantage.</p>

          <p eId="para_821">I welcome this opportunity to speak about this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Deputy O'Sullivan validly pointed out that the debate should be ongoing and should not end tonight. I welcome the fact that this issue is being debated. The Minister is not present because he is meeting the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Tom Vilsack, in the US, and I am glad his mission is going well as he attempts to open a new market for our beef. The core issue is demand. There are complications and problems at the British end and we must be proactive in tackling the cartel system among processors here.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> There is an upcoming North-South Ministerial Council at which the Minister will meet the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland. I am sure the Minister of State will be present as well. Will the officials ensure that the issues of labelling, animal welfare, data sharing and beef finishers in Northern Ireland having access to local marts are on the agenda? If the last issue was addressed, this would enable beef finishers from the North to go to marts in Raphoe, Carndonagh and Milford in my county, for example, to buy animals for finishing in the North. The cattle that cross the Border could end up in the grey area of being classed as nomadic cattle, and we must get around that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> While it is not related to the motion, it is important that time is given to the commonage issue, which is complex and has created fear among many sheep farmers. We should not kick the can down the road on this as our predecessors did on many issues. Time and space must be provided to arrive at an agreeable solution to commonages. There are many problems and time needs to be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> There is a serious crisis within suckler herds and the bull beef sector. Many farmers are talking about getting out and the processors will have to step up to meet the challenge. They will have to deal with the honest reality that if they do not have primary producers, they will not have beef. They may think they will have access to cattle from Poland and other countries. They must be conscious that the suckler herd is being depleted and bull beef prices have decreased 30% on last year while costs have continued to increase.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_303">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_826">I welcome this debate on an important part of our agriculture sector and our economy. A total of 78,000 farmers are engaged in beef production. While I welcome the motion, the Opposition has offered few solutions. There is grave concern about beef prices in the farming and rural communities. Given what has happened over the past number of months and what might happen in the autumn, farmers in the west are wondering whether there will be beef rearers and fatteners to purchase their weanlings. This is causing significant concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> We are, thankfully, a beef-exporting nation. We exported €2.1 billion worth of beef in 2013, which was a 10% increase on 2012. Like any exporting nation, Ireland is affected by external circumstances, including supply and demand. Over the recent past - this is probably a reflection of beef prices over the last number of years - we have seen increases in the supply of product, but we have also seen, unfortunately, a reduction in consumption in our markets. Consumption has decreased in the UK by 10% over the past year, while it decreased by approximately 5% in the EU between 2010 and 2013. According to basic economics, when supply increases and demand drops, unfortunately, prices drop.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> To stabilise and increase prices when consumption falls, one can first try to market the product more extensively. I welcome the additional €500,000 the Minister has allocated to Bord Bia to market our saleable high-quality product, which is grass-finished, hormone-free and highly traceable. Second, one can pursue alternative markets. The Minister is currently in the US developing that market for Irish beef and he has negotiated the reopening of markets in the Middle East and elsewhere. Third, cattle must be exported by boat. As previous speakers said, while the live trade has increased, some animals are exported for breeding. We need to ensure more boats are licensed but we must be cognisant of the high standards applying to such boats because we do not need an international incident that will destabilise the beef sector and cause an international outcry.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> Northern Ireland is part of this island. While there are issues regarding whether beef is British or Irish, will the Minister of State consider a new "Island of Ireland" label, which will account for cattle born in the South that are reared and fattened in the North? That is a major concern to many farmers who sell cattle in our marts.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_304">
          <from>Deputy Pat Breen<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_830">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I agree with the Minister of State that beef prices are down and a number of issues are at play. This is not only a problem for Irish farmers; farmers are also experiencing reduced prices in the UK. I have met representatives of farming organisations in my constituency and they are rightly concerned, as we all are, about this. I was a little amused that Deputy Ó Cuív criticised the Government last night when the approach he advocated last year in the context of CAP reform was to move everyone to a flat rate of greening payment. This would have been detrimental to many of our most productive beef farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> The beef industry is important to the economy, with 56% of our 140,000 farms engaged in beef production. They produce more than six times what is required for domestic consumption and, therefore, it is important to have strong export markets to ensure increased prices for our producers. There is increasing frustration among beef farmers at the prices being offered by meat factories. The Minister, through the beef forum, is working with processors and producers in an effort to improve the position of farmers. However, the best way to guarantee a better price for them is to open new markets for beef products, given that we export 80% of what we produce.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> In my capacity as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have witnessed the work of our embassies, Bord Bia and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in reopening markets in Japan, Singapore and Egypt. I expect more markets to open later this year, including Lebanon and Namibia. The Minister is in the US this week and he is having a successful visit. I hope the US and Canadian beef markets can be opened shortly as well. I visited the Middle East last month and I met the Minister for Industry and Commerce in Bahrain. We discussed the reopening of beef markets in the Gulf Cooperation Council states. The six countries involved work as a bloc and I understand talks are at an advanced stage with them. The Department is working closely with their veterinary officials to ensure difficulties can be overcome and beef exports can resume. These states are importing beef from Australia and New Zealand and it would be much more convenient for them if they could import from Ireland. I am confident that these markets will open sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> Having a strong live export market is the best way to ensure stable beef prices for farmers, and that is the Minister's priority. Last year, the value of live exports increased by 11% to €240 million and, as a result, markets in Libya and north Africa have reopened, which is positive. I commend the Minister on his work on behalf of beef farmers. The Minister of State is a farmer and understands the current position, as he is constantly in touch with farmers. Instead of working against the Government, the Opposition should work with us in the interests of Irish farmers.</p>

          <p eId="para_834">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I refer to the data relating to deadweight prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">In 2010, when Deputy Ó Cuív was a prominent member of the Government, the deadweight price was €291.40 per kilogramme compared to today's average of €379.51. Although many beef farmers are put to the pin of their collars, they have invested a lot in their animals. Government policies and organisations such as Teagasc have encouraged them to hold onto their animals. Given that 50,000 excess animals must be disposed of between now and Christmas, it is no wonder the price is depressed. Beef consumption has decreased. In the UK, our nearest neighbour where we have traditionally had a significant position, consumption has decreased by 8%. UK farmers are developing their own beef and have taken advantage of cheap grain to fatten up their animals. It is quite a predicament.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> The main priority is to develop new markets and I compliment the Minister, who is in the US. We already have market access to countries such as Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran, and there are ongoing negotiations with the US and Canada. We need more markets for our live exports. Although live exports have increased, they must increase further. Farmers are under pressure and need our assistance and support.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Factories seem to be full of excuses for declining to pay farmers the top price for their animals. Factories do not hesitate to impose penalties to reduce the price per kilogram and, naturally, this has an adverse impact on farmers. The issue of price fixing by factories has been thrown around by farmers and in general discourse. A farmer who phones different factories on a Friday will get different prices; on Monday the farmer will get the same prices from different factories, whether they sell to Italy or to Tesco in the UK. Why is this the case? There is abuse of a dominant position, which the Competition Authority must address.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Heydon<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_838">The point on competition is key. Lack of confidence in the system is a problem in itself. The Government continues to work towards addressing such issues. It is crucial that we can tell our primary producers that the system is beyond reproach. I talk to many farmers in the marts who tell me that the factories are accessing the animal identification and movement, AIM, system and that there are competition issues. We need proof, and when we get it we will go after anybody involved vigorously. The beef crisis is causing real hurt and harm to farming families. There are 140,000 farms in Ireland, 78,000 of which are involved in beef production. Given that Ireland produces six times more beef than is required for the domestic market, 90% of our output is exported. When our supply increases, the on-the-table price decreases, and that is the case across the UK, Europe and the world. This lower price for beef compared to last year's prices is hurting us. In this situation, one of our main goals is to open new markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> I have difficulty with the processors and factories in this country when we discuss a very ambitious kill target of 40,000 per week. Whenever we go above 30,000 per week, factories struggle to find markets. That is why the Government is pushing. We have given more money to Bord Bia, which is working with the Irish embassies to open up vital trade to additional markets in Japan, Singapore, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon and Libya. The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, is in America. Last Thursday, like Deputy Ó Cuív, I attended a function in the US Embassy with the US agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack. When one realises Mr. Vilsack controls a budget of €150 billion, one understands the potential of accessing a market such as America. The Minister is in America increasing those markets. FDA approval would also be a phenomenal help in accessing China and Korea. That is why the Minister's time is much better spent there doing the work and representing farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> The quality payment scheme, into which the IFA entered with Meat Industry Ireland in 2009, must be revisited. Is it supplying the best return for proper beef producers? As we go into a time of major growth for our dairy sector, we must be careful our beef industry does not become a mere subset of our dairy sector. It is an important industry in itself and we should reward farmers who produce U-grade cattle.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Bannon<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_841">Given the proper support, the agriculture sector has the capacity to lead economic recovery. The previous Government, under the watch of Deputy Ó Cuív, slashed every available farm gate scheme, including REPS, the disadvantaged area scheme, young farmers installation aid, the early retirement scheme and forestry supports. I could go on and on. The effects of the cuts were devastating to the industry and rural communities. Under Fianna Fáil, between 1997 and 2010, farm incomes fell by more than 17%. Since this Government took over, we have stabilised and increased prices and farmers' incomes. The Government will invest more than €12 billion in agriculture between 2014 and 2020, comprising €8.5 billion in direct payment to farmers and more than €4 billion towards rural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Agriculture is at the heart of the working life of people in Longford-Westmeath and throughout the country. While farming has had to deal with more than its fair share of setbacks in recent years, farmers in this constituency have displayed great resilience in dealing with, and bouncing back from, the effects of the recession. A thriving farming sector and supports for the industry remain a priority for me. While our food prices are the second highest in Europe, the farmer who produces the food is being denied an income. Farmers need to reinvest and develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> Cattle prices have fallen by nearly 18% since this time last year and in real terms, this means that while in June 2013, farmers were selling steers at a base price of €4.60 per kilogram, today they struggle to sell them at a base price of €3.70, if they can get them killed. Farmers have major problems getting their cattle killed in factories throughout the country. This is not just a case of selling below cost. Factories are refusing to buy stock or delaying purchase for one or two weeks. They are controlling the entire trade by dragging down prices for animals, which is crippling farmers. The beef barons who control the trade are importing cattle from Poland. I ask the Minister to clarify this very serious matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> Live exports are vital for price competition and we must seriously consider the removal of the roadblocks impeding the live trade to Northern Ireland. The increase in cattle killed to more than 30,000 head per week in 2014 and the resulting price and income difficulties can be directly related to the reduction in live exports in 2012, highlighting the importance of a strong live trade for the sector. The beef barons must be controlled and forced to pay farmers a decent price for their cattle. If the situation is not tackled, it will leave the CAP deal useless as farmers will abandon farming. We must act fast to stabilise cattle prices and restore confidence to avert the coming crisis in the autumn.</p>

          <p eId="para_845">It is opportune that we are having a discussion on the beef industry this week. As Deputy Seán Kyne said, Ireland has a great system of beef production and a great product to sell, but there is no doubt that people involved in the industry are under severe pressure to say the least. I am referring to people who are not normally looking at the glass half empty. They are under severe pressure and considering leaving the sector. For that reason, the discussion is important. The Minister is doing good work to open markets, but I often wonder if enough is being done to follow up on the opening of these markets to ensure we are selling product into them. While it is welcome that the Minister is in the United States of America this week, it is no use opening a market unless we sell something into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> Like previous speakers, I refer to the moving of the goalposts by factories in respect of the quality payment scheme agreed in 2009. A great deal of work was done at the time between the farm organisations, the factories and Teagasc. We must look at moving back towards the agreement, in which regard the Minister and his Department must be proactive. </p>
          <p eId="para_847"> On Northern Ireland, there is a political solution that can surely be reached at a time of tremendous co-operation between the North and the South. Cattle born on this side of the Border end up on the other side and we should be able to have a new arrangement reached in that regard. It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> There have been significant increases, particularly this year, in the level of live exports, with 20,000 more animals exported to date in 2014 than by this time last year. Certainly, there is significant room for a further increase. If necessary, we should look at the regulations which apply. The Minister of State might correct me if I am wrong, but in Ireland we seem to have a stricter application of some EU regulations to live exports than other member states. Obviously, as an island country which produces six times more beef than it needs, we must have a floor in the market. </p>
          <p eId="para_849"> In respect of the current system pertaining with the factories, many speakers have referred to the need for real competition. Real competition can only be provided if there is something competing with the factories. We have not exploited this to its full potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> The dry stock sector is at a crossroads. There has been a massive increase in costs, the loss of certain schemes and a depletion in the quality of the herd in which we have invested so much in the past few years, particularly in the suckler cow sector. Unless we do something radical, people will leave. On Friday I met a man optimistic about the future of agriculture. He took up farming at ten years of age on the death of his father. He is a winter beef finisher and talking about leaving. It accounts for most of his business. When people like him are talking about leaving the beef sector, something radical must be done. I urge the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_851">It is fair to say there has always been a healthy distrust between the farmer and the factory. It has certainly not changed dramatically in the past few months. It is a problem which has been encountered before and it will be encountered again. The first thing to do when there is a problem is to acknowledge it. We must acknowledge that many people are under a great deal of pressure. For those looking in from the outside, the issue is to understand why there is such a problem. Anyone involved in calf-to-beef production, whether at 18, 22 or 24 months, puts a great deal of time and effort into getting an animal ready to bring to the factory. It involves great expense to get a product ready for a particular market and to find when one goes to the factory, which is one's payday, that the goalposts have suddenly been moved is not only massively frustrating, it also causes huge financial loss. The spec or carcass weight sought may have changed. We must acknowledge that there is a problem in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> In acknowledging that there is a problem we must try to see two steps down the road to determine what may happen next. Our next big problem might arise in September and October. If one is going to the mart with weanlings in a couple of months time, what beef producer who was badly burned will turn up to take the plunge again? He or she is not going to do it. Unfortunately, that will lead to problems with the suckler cow herd. If it costs on average €700 to keep a cow, one will have already lost money unless a weanling can get a very good price in the factory that day. We must very careful and the factories must be clued in. One can burn the producers only so many times before they leave the industry altogether. One will then be left with a far greater problem. We are talking about quality product leaving the market altogether. We have a very good system for rearing and finishing cattle, but the entities within it who need to work together are not doing so. The producer and the factory have different aims, but they need each other, no matter how they look at it. The alternative is the live export market. I agree with Deputy John Paul Phelan completely. For many years we continued to welcome more markets opening, which is happening, but we need to see the cattle actually moving. We need to see cattle of different quality moving also. In a private industry where price is dominated by supply, if there is no supply, one will have to pay more. We must get this right quickly. We must understand matters could get a great deal worse if we are not careful.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> I have no doubt that the Minister and the Minister of State acknowledge that there is a problem, but we must ensure it is fixed in the next number of months. If not, we will be back here not only having lost beef producers but also many suckler cow producers.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McCarthy<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_854">The beef sector plays a hugely important role in the rural economy, supporting some 7,000 processing jobs. Profits are spent locally. It has been calculated that for every €1 of output produced on cattle farms, an additional €1.49 is generated in the local economy on foot of the multiplier effect. We must ensure this important and vibrant sector has a bright future.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> Between Bord Bia and the meat industry, a good job has been done to support and promote Irish beef and open new markets, including Japan, Singapore, Egypt, Iran and, soon, Lebanon and Namibia. The Minister expects to gain access to the United states and Canada in the next six months and intensive work is being done in China and Korea also. That said, the Irish farmer has had to put up with a great deal in the past couple of years. There has been a disproportionate shouldering of the burden, with rural areas hit particularly by the recession. Difficult budgetary decisions have impacted, as has the fodder crisis. Recently there have been flooding problems which have, by and large, affected those who are the subject of the motion. There is a genuine fear among some that the future is not bright.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> One sees the level of profits which continue to made by processors and supermarkets. There is nothing wrong with this provided the farmer gets a fair share. The profitability must be spread in as fair a manner as possible. It is clear that there is a lack of true competition in the market, which is harmful to the economy and livestock farmers, in particular. There is a mystery surrounding the pricing arrangements arrived at between plants and their retail customers and it is a significant issue. Courtesy of the Department and Teagasc, there is total transparency when it comes to quantifying every cost incurred at farm level. The same cannot be said about meat plants and supermarkets, which situation must be rectified if beef producers are to have any confidence in the meat industry. There is a fundamental need for farmers to receive realistic prices for the beef they are producing.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> The past few years have confirmed the extent to which producers are reliant on the direct support payments they receive from Brussels. In four out of five years the single farm payment has been the funding stream which allows most livestock enterprises to break even. If the situation is left unchecked, it will do more harm than any scheme or subsidy could ever hope to remedy. On the recent campaign trail I went to a bull beef producer whose shed was full of animals. He has been encouraged to build up his herd, but there is now no return to be made. It is exceptionally frustrating for farmers who were encouraged to increase production to find that suddenly the market is not as was promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> This is a significant challenge for the Government, particularly in terms of the bull beef crisis, which is severe.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">If it is not confronted, it will get worse. The biggest loser will be the Irish economy because we will not see people staying in the industry and we will see turnover, with new people getting into it.</p>

        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_311">
          <from>Deputy Patrick O'Donovan<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_860">I welcome the opportunity to speak on an important motion. I welcome the acknowledgement in the contribution of the Minister of State that the Department sees the plight of farmers across the country. The Minister of State knows my constituency very well and it suffers from a double whammy of severely disadvantaged land and a constituency based on the milk and beef sectors. From attending marts like Kilmallock, the Minister of State knows what farmers are saying. Deputy Martin Heydon is correct when he states that there is a problem when people talk about potentially leaving the industry. Representatives of farmers and individual farmers who have come to me have made clear they do not want a quick fix, an easy solution, a knee-jerk reaction or throwaway political comment about problems going away. They are not interested in point scoring and they want a long-term solution into the autumn and next year. Many of the people I have spoken to are carrying debt in the overhang from the fodder crisis. This had a devastating impact on the western seaboard where they were disproportionately affected because of the land quality. The debt hangover from last year and the inflated price of last year was combined with the collapse of the British market this year, on which we are over-reliant.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> If we can learn anything from the past number a few weeks about the export market, it is that the solution must be driven by exports. There are not enough people in the country to consume enough beef. We need an export led solution. Our over-reliance on the British market has been exposed as a weakness. The challenge is to build the brand of Irish beef. People might scoff at the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine being in America while this is being discussed but there is no better time for him to be there because it proves that the Government is serious about delivering new markets for Irish farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> The political opportunism of some people in this House is exactly what farmers did not want to hear. These are the same people who barely mentioned agriculture in budget speeches when they were in government. They have forgotten about this and, as pointed out by Deputy James Bannon, they eroded farming schemes. I support the comments of Deputy Paul Connaughton about the need for a long-term solution that involves all stakeholders. I welcome what the Minister is doing. In acknowledging the crisis, we must be realistic and must not inflate people's expectations in the manner in which some Members are doing. It is exploiting people's vulnerability at a difficult time for many farming families.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_863">I propose to share time with Deputies Charlie McConalogue, Michael Moynihan and Barry Cowen. I commend Deputy Ó Cuív on tabling this motion. It is important to discuss this issue, something we do not discuss frequently enough. Many people referred to the problems of the price of beef in many European countries. I was interested in analysis by <i>The Farming Independent</i> last April. It shows that Irish beef producers have experienced price declines up to six times greater than their European Union counterparts. This is a worrying analysis and prompted the IFA livestock chairman to say that the Minister should remember he is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and not the Minister for factories. There was a feeling that he was defending factories, which all Members agree do not need defending. It is a major credibility issue for the Minister if he underestimates the level of frustration and anger at farm level. I support what the IFA said about continually pressing Bord Bia, the Minister and the Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive, Michelle O'Neill, to insist that Irish cattle are not blocked from markets. I welcome every effort to find markets but there are artificial and anti-competitive barriers that should be removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> I also support the call of Deputy Ó Cuív for a regulator to ensure farmers get a fair price for beef and to ensure they are not taken advantage of or used by pawns in a big business cartel, which is what happens. We must have a regulator backed by real powers of investigation to redress the imbalance. The heart of rural Ireland is being damaged by the crisis and there is not a level playing field between producers and processors. Every document produced by the farming organisations makes clear that the average family farm income is very low. The figure last year was €21,400 compared to the average industrial earnings of €32,000. With the livestock industry worth €2 billion to the economy, we must be careful that we support the industry in every way.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> The collapse in beef prices is having a negative effect on the livelihoods of all beef producers. There has been a collapse in the bull beef price over the past 12 months and factories have changed the age and weight specifications required to slaughter cattle. The Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, stated that little over one quarter of all Irish cattle slaughtered in Irish beef export plants are paid a quality assurance bonus despite the fact that 87% of farmers are quality assured, leaving one quarter getting the bonus and three quarters not receiving it. We must push continually for the live export trade, which is particularly important in the west of Ireland, as a good alternative to any monopoly set up by the factories. We should also make every effort to maintain contact with the Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government in respect of finding new markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> The price of beef has fallen in the past 12 months and, given issues concerning over-age cattle and heavier store cattle, it is important to examine every area of the country. I make a particular case for the west. The president of the ICSA quoted a Teagasc national farm survey from 2013 showing a 22% collapse in suckler incomes and a 39% reduction in sheep incomes. In such situations, farmers earn less than they would receive on social welfare payment so we must consider the issues of smallholders. There was a beef open day on Wednesday, to which the Minister of State referred, and Teagasc talked about the most efficient high-performance suckler farms making only €4,000 per year on a 70 cow, 100 acre unit. If bigger, more efficient farmers are not making money, it is unbelievable to think what smaller producers are doing. In light of these figures and the fact that direct supports to farmers are declining, it is baffling that anyone could say this is a good time to be in farming. In conclusion, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, talked about cattle sales falling by €106 million as beef prices continue to slide. It is particularly concerned on that issue.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_313">
          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_867">I join my party colleagues and Members on the Opposition benches in commending Deputy Ó Cuív on tabling this motion and ensuring there is a strong focus on agriculture during Private Members' business. It is particularly important given the difficulties faced by so many farmers. It is also important because of the misconception, often among Ministers, about the health and wealth of farm incomes. The perception built up in the earlier stages of the recession, when farming was holding its own and had one or two good years compared to the wider economy, which was declining rapidly. The perception is still in existence among many of those in government when the reality is that farm incomes and the farming sector have been struggling significantly in the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">I do not believe the Government has realised that or reflected it in its policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> I want to focus on three specific areas in my remarks. First of these is the crisis in the beef industry, which is the main focus of the motion put forward by Deputy Ó Cuív. However, I also want to touch on the GLAS scheme and difficulties in regard to farm assist for many farm families. On the crisis in the beef industry, the motion calls for a beef regulator to be established. Although none of us can be sure as to the impact this may have, I believe it would be a worthwhile step that could go some way to ensuring a stronger focus on what is going on in the factories and to ensuring farmers receive a fair price at the factory gate. The Dowling report which was published following round table discussions recommended this.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_870">No, no.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_315">
          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_871">It has been recommended, and I believe it would be a worthwhile step. As Deputy Connaughton pointed out earlier, there has traditionally been significant conflict between farmers and the factories. There has also been significant single ownership of many factories, which only enhances this conflict. There is a need for assurance to farmers that they are getting a fair price and that different factories are not reducing or increasing prices at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> Along with ensuring monitoring of prices and that farmers are getting a fair crack of the final price, it is crucial there is competition through live exports. We could do with putting emphasis on ensuring export avenues are open and that difficulties are not placed in the way of this safety valve, so that farmers who fail to sell to the factories have an alternative available. More export opportunities would also provide competition for the factories and ensure competition in regard to the prices being offered by them. </p>
          <p eId="para_873"> I mentioned earlier the impact of the crisis on farm incomes, which is nowhere more pronounced than among what bull beef producers, in particular, have experienced this past year. It went from a situation where farmers were encouraged and advised to produce more bull beef, but once they had their sheds filled they found the goalposts had been changed, with specifications and grading requirements changed. This has resulted in a situation where many of them have found themselves losing from €200 to €300 per animal when it comes to selling it on the factory floor.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> When we look at what has happened with farm incomes over the past three years, we can clearly see the difficulty farm families are experiencing. For example, on cattle rearing farms, the average income in 2011 was €19,183. This dropped to €17,800 in 2012 and to €15,595 in 2013. This is a continuous drop over the past three years. In the sheep sector, average income was €19,000 in 2011. This dropped to €18,200 in 2012 and to €11,160 this past year. Again, we see a definite trend of decreasing farm incomes. The overall average farm income is given a healthier reflection due to the fact that dairy farms tend to have better incomes, which raises the overall average.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> If we look at the case of suckler farms, the income on the average suckler farm last year was just under €10,000. However, figures show that the average single farm payment to cattle rearing farms was €15,000. Therefore, the average suckler farm was eating into its single farm payment to the tune of €5,000 - or one third of its single farm payment - in order to produce young cattle. It has been the ongoing situation for a number of years that average farm income on suckler farms has been less than what the single farm payment would be. This situation cannot continue. Any Deputy with links with the farming community will know that at markets and marts across the country, the number of cows being culled and removed from production is increasing all the time. Even young farmers who would have invested significantly in recent years are questioning their future in farming. In many cases, they would get out of farming if there was alternative employment available.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> This brings me to the farm assist payment. This is an issue I have raised with the Minister for Social Protection on a number of occasions. Since the Government has come to power, it has made changes to the system, so that instead of 70% of a farmer's annual income being assessed towards farm assist, the full 100% is now assessed. The farm assist payment brings the farm income up to the level of what a farmer would receive on unemployment benefit or on the dole. Now, what happens is that every penny a farmer earns on the farm comes off their farm assist payment. Anybody in any other employment area who finds himself on the dole only wants to remain on it for a short period, until he finds alternative employment. It is not meant to be a baseline where somebody will sit for a long time. However, this is now what is expected of the farming community. Farmers are expected to accept a farm assist payment which is at the same level as the dole, but also to accept a situation where they must work 40 to 50 hours a week in order to achieve that payment. That is unfair and does not acknowledge in any way what those farm families contribute to the local community through living in it and through the revenue and turnover farms generate.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> This position is unsustainable. It sends a clear message to farmers that in the same way as people not from the farming community who are out of work and on the dole are encouraged to take up employment when it becomes available, they should do the same. People on smaller and medium sized family farms who are availing of farm assist are being given the message that they should give up on farming and find alternative employment, because they are given no reward whatsoever for their daily enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> The other issue I wish to raise is the new GLAS scheme, the replacement for the AEOS and REPS, and the difficulty the proposed regulations will cause for commonage farmers. A minimum of 50% of all farmers with access to commonage are being required to sign up at the one in order for any one of them to be eligible. Last week, based on a reply to a parliamentary question asked by Deputy Ó Cuív, I pointed out that previous experience of AEOS and REPS indicated that 24% of farms with commonage rights would have signed up to the previous REPS or environmental schemes. Therefore, it is no way realistic to expect a minimum of 50% to sign up now. The Minister needs to reverse his plans in this regard or we will have a further significant proportion of lower income farms affected by the proposal.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_879">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the crisis in the beef industry and commend my colleague, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, on putting forward the motion and on the work he has done in the agriculture sector over the past while. I commend him also on the challenges he has made in the sector with stakeholders in regard to funding and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">A number of speakers have suggested that the motion is opportunist but the stark reality is that there is a crisis in the farming community and if we cannot reflect the concerns of farmers on the floor of Dáil Éireann, we have no business being in here.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> I wish to deal with a number of issues, the substantive one being the price that farmers are getting for beef at the moment. In recent years there was a huge push on farmers and finishers to go into bull beef. The argument was that this was what the market wanted and that farmers should get big animals to the factories. All of a sudden, however, almost overnight, the factories pulled the price and said they were no longer interested in this type of cattle but wanted the smaller animals. I have a big issue with that because it did not happen overnight. </p>
          <p eId="para_882"> We must have a fundamental look at the advice given at farm gate level. Farmers are the most adaptable group of people in the entire country. They have constantly reinvented themselves in terms of changing farm practices to ensure a viable income for themselves and their families. I have met farmers in my constituency clinic who have shown me the difference in the price they got for cattle in December and the price they got in February or March for similar cattle. That must be looked at. </p>
          <p eId="para_883"> In the past three or four years, much discussion has centred on emerging and new markets, the targets to be met under Food Harvest 2020 and so on. The focus has been on getting into the emerging markets but we have never really examined what products are needed for those markets. We have developed the dairy products that are needed over many years through companies like Kerrygold and so forth. It is high time we made sure that we are producing a beef product that the markets want because farmers will adapt to changing demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> Regardless of whether the report recommended a regulator, the stark reality is that we need a regulator for this industry and that need did not arise today or yesterday. There is no point in pussy footing around on this issue. A regulator is needed and I compliment my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív on his efforts to bring this issue to the fore. I have a small suckler herd myself and am well aware of the limitations within the agricultural sector. We need a regulator because farmers have been fighting with the factories for decades. We should take that as a given following this debate. We must put in a regulator and face them down. </p>
          <p eId="para_885"> I have met farmers who appear from the outside to be strong, efficient and doing well. However, due to difficulties as a result of illness, problems with machinery and so forth, they have no cash flow. I have met many such farmers, as have other Deputies in this House. They have financial commitments, with children at school or in college but have only a single income in the household. They are experiencing enormous difficulties. As is the case with many other rural Deputies, I have been negotiating with banks, co-ops and marts on their behalf. </p>
          <p eId="para_886"> Farmers are also very concerned about departmental inspections. I spoke to the Minister privately last night on this matter. An individual who is very involved in the agricultural sector and has his finger on the pulse said to me recently that the inspection regime within the Department is out of control. The special investigations unit and other units within the Department need to be less rigid. I have seen numerous parliamentary questions tabled recently with regard to people who made genuine mistakes in terms of how they conducted their business. These are hardworking, decent farmers and that deserves recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> The thrust of tonight's debate is that we have a crisis at farm gate level. Last year, the price for beef was good, though not extraordinary. If I took anything from the Grange beef open day last week it was that many suckler farmers are fearful they will not be able to sustain the production of high-quality cattle. Numerous reports have indicated that in the past farmers got into producing continental cattle and then, almost overnight, the factories decided they did not want such animals. </p>
          <p eId="para_888"> We need a blueprint and a road map for the agricultural sector. We must accept that there is a major crisis in the beef sector. Next autumn, when the weanlings hit the market, people will be careful not to get burned again. Those who invested heavily last year have been left very sore. The problem will spiral again and people will be left with debt they cannot service, families they cannot feed and commitments they cannot honour. We must face up to this crisis. There is no point in Members opposite saying we should not be raising this issue. Now is the time to deal it. We have a world-class product which is sought after all over the world. We should be marketing it properly. We should also ensure the best possible advice is given to farmers at farm gate level. Never again should it be a case of everybody putting their eggs into one basket, producing a particular product only for the factories to say they do not want it when it is ready for slaughter. It was not last November or December that the factories made that decision. </p>
          <p eId="para_889"> As I said at the outset, farmers will adapt and do whatever is necessary. They are used to running their businesses and ensuring they have a product for market. Whatever else we take from this debate, it must be accepted that we need a regulator for this industry and it is high time the Government acted in that regard. It needs to face down the people in the industry who argue that we do not need a regulator. The industry must be regulated, once and for all. We must also ensure that farmers are respected. In the past two to three years, farmers enjoyed a reasonably good income, despite the enormous difficulties caused by the fodder shortage in 2012 and 2013. Now, however, it is the multinationals and the major companies that are being wined and dined and the primary producers are being forgotten. We would not have one gallon of milk or one pound of beef were it not for the people who are willing to get their hands dirty in the morning and go out and farm. We need to acknowledge that. These people are as good as those in any other sector and it is high time we, as a House, acknowledged that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2014-06-25T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_890">I join my colleagues in thanking Deputy Ó Cuív for tabling this motion. Deputies on all sides of the House, from all parties and none, recognise the value of agriculture to this economy, especially in these straitened times.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The beef sector has particular value to both the economy and the communities we serve. As many speakers indicated, buoyancy in the sector can only benefit everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> As is often stated, our reputation in this area has grown in recent years. Ireland is now one of the leading producers of beef and we have a product that is clean, green and of the highest quality. However, many Deputies on all sides, particularly those on the Government side, have acknowledged the grave problem that exists in the beef sector. For example, Deputy John Paul Phelan stated earlier that a radical change is required in the context of how we address this issue. Deputy Connaughton referred to factories that have the potential to ruin producers. A number of speakers highlighted the fact that recent figures indicate a loss of income for farmers of anything up to 22% and a drop in price of up to 20%. It appears, however, that the Government does not believe this crisis to be of a magnitude that the remainder of us believe it to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> On Leaders' Questions this morning Deputy Clare Daly raised the issue of the employees of the Greyhound waste management company. One can empathise with the plight of those workers on whom the bombshell was dropped last week regarding a 20% to 25% reduction in wages in order for the company to maintain its viability. The Taoiseach was aghast and flabbergasted when that issue was brought to his attention and referred to the various arms of the State - the Labour Court and so forth - which might assist in negotiating a settlement at the company. The motion before the House contains a mechanism by means of which issues affecting the beef sector which are not currently being dealt with might be addressed. I refer here to the appointment of a regulator to address the obvious and ongoing difficulties which have not been resolved despite many negotiations between the producers and the factories.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> We all recognise that the Government has a responsibility in respect of this matter. However, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a particular responsibility to lead and not be led, and to listen to the various stakeholders. I am sure he listened attentively in recent times and is <i>au fait</i> with the problems that exist. He must now proceed to offer solutions. Round-table discussions - to which much reference has been made - are not the means by which this crisis can be dealt with head-on, by which to bring about the radical change required, as Deputy John Paul Phelan noted, or by which to address the issue of factories being in a position to ruin producers. What are required are initiatives. Our duty, as an Opposition party, is to provide alternatives and solutions which the Government can evaluate before coming forward with suggestions of its own. That is the purpose of the brief few hours of Private Members' time allocated each week. Our motion contains proposals that the Government can either take on board or offer alternatives to.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> The first point we make is that a beef regulator is required in order to address the lack of fairness that exists between producers and the factories. The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, and the line Minister must make an effort to address the labelling issue that exists in the North and the UK. I ask that this be done as quickly as is humanly possible and that the Minister of State inform the House of the progress that is made at the earliest opportunity. It is also necessary that an update be provided in respect of markets, be it in Russia or in the US, where the Minister is at present. Is there going to be an overall EU agreement or is our product going to be recognised for what it is, namely, vastly superior to that of many other member states? If those issues are addressed, the Minister of State might then be in a position to inform the House of a mechanism by means of which the relevant reductions might be offset. If the latter are offset, the industry might be allowed to prosper again and become what it is expected to be. It must be remembered that all of this has massive implications for the 2020 programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_896">I am replying to this debate on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who unfortunately is unable to be present. I assure Deputies that he will read the blacks in order to familiarise himself with the contributions of Government and Opposition Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> This debate has given rise to much discussion in respect of the challenges currently faced by the beef sector. The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, clearly acknowledged the drop in prices this year as compared with the record high prices achieved this time last year. Those on the opposite side of the House stated that we do not recognise the existence of a problem. We do recognise that there is a problem and we will deal with it. Prices this year have been more favourable than those achieved in most other years and they remain above the EU average. It would neither be appropriate nor possible for any Minister to intervene in respect of price. As Deputy Ó Cuív is well aware, to do so would be illegal. The Opposition seems to be suggesting that there is some political magic bullet by means of which the current beef price issue can be resolved. When he is summing up, I would like Deputy Ó Cuív to supply his proposals as to how this crisis might be resolved.</p>

          <p eId="para_899">The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is fully committed to dealing with this issue. The round-table discussions he convened have provided stakeholders with both a forum to express their views and an opportunity to meet the challenges that exist head-on. The description of these discussions as talking shops shows a lack of understanding of what is really involved. As the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, outlined, a number of key outcomes have emerged from the discussions to date. I refer, for example, to greater transparency in respect of price via the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's website, legislation for producer groups, an additional markets fund for beef and greater levels of communication between processors and farm bodies and organisations. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, both met the Northern Ireland Minister, Michelle O'Neill, MLA, in order to discuss the issue of live cattle being transported to the North in order to be finished. Deliberations in that regard will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> It must be recognised that UK retailers have a clear preference for animals born, reared and slaughtered either in Ireland or the UK. As the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, made it quite clear - and despite some of the claims made by those opposite - there are no barriers to the trading of live cattle from this jurisdiction to Northern Ireland or Britain. In fact, live exports to both destinations are significantly up on the same period last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> One of the issues that arises in the context of establishing a regulator is that the Competition Authority already has a remit to ensure that markets function properly. If Deputies have evidence to the effect that markets are not functioning properly, then I ask them to bring it to the attention of the Competition Authority for full and immediate investigation. One Deputy stated that the Dowling report recommends the appointment of a beef regulator. I have read the recommendations contained in the report and I am not aware of any such proposal. It is unfortunate that Deputy McConalogue has left the Chamber, because it was he who made this assertion. I would like him to read my copy of the report, because it is the real version.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> The Government's commitment to the beef sector is without question. Under the new CAP, €295 million has been set aside for the beef data and genomics scheme. The new GLAS scheme will be worth over €1.4 billion to the economy. In addition, the making of €10 million in payments under the beef data programme commenced this week. These payments will assist 26,000 farmers throughout the country. Under Fianna Fáil's proposals in respect of the CAP, the single farm payments of beef farmers - including those in my constituency in Wexford and throughout the remainder of the south east - would have been dramatically reduced. That is a point which has been overlooked by the Deputies opposite during this debate. Perhaps Deputy Ó Cuív might be able to educate some of his party's members with regard to the nature of Fianna Fáil's real proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_904">I assure him that those proposals would have destroyed the agriculture industry here.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> Deputy Ó Cuív has tried unsuccessfully to use cynically the fact that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is away this week for his own political gain or for his party's political gain. In reality, Deputy Ó Cuív knows well that the Minister is in the USA negotiating access for the beef market there which has not been open in years. He is meeting retailers to develop Ireland's presence there. The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, discussed access to the Chinese market during a high-level visit last week. Markets in Lebanon, Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran have also been opened.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> The Government fully recognises that beef farmers have experienced challenging times in recent months. We are taking action, where possible, to support the industry through a difficult period. We will drive on with that commitment and continue to prioritise the Irish agrifood industry as we have done since we took up office in 2011.</p>

          <p eId="para_908">I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for putting down this important motion. I had hoped that we would have a constructive debate tonight and I believe we were having a relatively constructive debate until the Chief Whip entered. It should be noted that the Chief Whip sits at the Cabinet table. That he takes such a partisan approach to such an important debate is reprehensible and regrettable. We all have our views about the seriousness of the situation. This is not necessarily to suggest that anyone on any one side of the House has all the solutions, but in fairness to Deputy Ó Cuív he has published proposals in the past. He has put forward a motion tonight. If the Government could see its way to support the motion it would at least give confidence to the 100,000 families who are at their wits' end. They are struggling to stay in business and need to see support coming from those of us in this House rather than see us squabble over minor insults that the Chief Whip might have perceived from things that were said. What we really need to do now is put an appropriate plan in place and take views from all sides, in particular, the views of the people whose livelihoods are most affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> There is little doubt that the Government must look to the greater industry. It is widely accepted that the former Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, produced a document, Harvest 2020, which received critical acclaim throughout the political sector and the industry. The current Minister makes many announcements, visits many factories and participates in many appropriate photo opportunities. However, the real work in delivering for Harvest 2020 will come about if the Government puts its support behind the beef sector. It is the case that milk is doing well and has been doing well. Obviously, there are challenges ahead for that sector as well but we are dealing with the beef industry. We cannot allow the suckler cow herd to continue to drop or watch cows being sold off year after year and not replaced. This is happening, frankly, because farmers cannot afford to replace them. They are selling off the cow to put a child through college, to pay the capitation fees or bills and to pay for the inputs because the costs of inputs are rising significantly and we have seen a significant reduction in beef prices in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> Any of the Teagasc reports produced shows that a farmer needs at least €4 per kilogramme to reach a basic margin. More likely, a farmer needs to get €4.50 to have a feasible enterprise. They are taking €3.75 at the moment and sometimes €3.70 or €3.50. The factories are not living up to the commitments that they made throughout the sector. This requires a co-ordinated approach by Government. The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, made the point that it would be illegal for the Government or that it would not be possible for the Government to insist on the price that the factories sell beef at, but we know that. It is as obvious as night following day but there is more the Government could do in putting it up to the industry and challenging the industry to treat farmers more fairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> The Irish Farmers Association has referred to how "the failure of Minister Coveney to challenge the factories on the beef price and specification issues at the Beef Forum is being used by the factories as a licence to drive on and implement these severe cuts across the board". The IFA is demanding that the Minister should stand up for farmers and take firm and decisive action with the meat factories. It is as simple as that. It is clear that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has not intervened to assist the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> The IFA is also demanding that roadblocks be removed since they are impeding the live trade to Northern Ireland which is vital for price competition. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, knows that and he needs to do far more in a proactive way to support the live export trade, which is essential for price competition. That has been true from time immemorial and it has been a feature of previous Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> Much criticism was made of a former leader of our party in respect of certain activities that he participated in but he certainly believed in the beef industry and in the necessity of having competition in the market. When Charlie Haughey went to Libya some time back with Alan Gillis of the IFA, they showed the necessary support for that sector. They were not prepared to be fobbed off by the processing sector. This is the type of intervention, a hands-on approach, required to ensure that the sector is capable of providing for the wider economy in terms of the jobs it can create and maintain and, more important, that it can keep a sustainable livelihood for 100,000 farm families.</p>

          <p eId="para_921">It should be ten minutes. We have proposed solutions. We proposed the appointment of a beef regulator. We proposed bringing forward urgently the legislation for producer groups. We proposed dealing with the logjam which means that a farmer cannot export cattle live to Britain from Dublin in lorries. We proposed dealing with the labelling issue which means that cattle born and bred on this island and slaughtered on this island can either be sold as Irish cattle or British cattle. One would think with all the <i>détente</i> under way it would not be beyond the wit that if we could have the people as Irish citizens, then surely we could have the cattle from this island labelled as Irish too. We have proposed solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> It has become apparent in recent weeks that there is a trail of destruction following the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in his role as Minister and as President of the European Council. In time his period in office will be seen as a period of major failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> Another thing that is becoming apparent is that the Minister cannot accept criticism. The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, knows that we agreed to a change in the rota for parliamentary questions on agriculture. Then the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine asked us to go back to the original date but did not turn up. Why did he not turn up? It was because he said that the American Secretary of State was in the country. I got an invitation to a reception approximately three or four weeks before the American Secretary of State came. I am sure that if I knew he was coming then the Minister knew well in advance that he was coming to the country. At the end of the day four times on four different days the Minister did not turn up in the House. I accept he is in America this week but that means it was all the more important that he should have turned up last week. The reality is that he does not seem to think that answering to the people elected by the people is of importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> I noticed today that one of the backbenchers became rather concerned about Ireland's access to Europe. I assure that backbencher that if we need meetings with senior officials in the Commission we will get them with the Commissioner himself. The difference is that when we get those meetings they listen, unlike the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_927"> I keep hearing about the €12 billion the Minister secured. This was the first time ever that the CAP budget was down. Let us put the €12 billion into perspective. The Government will spend €12 billion in seven months on social welfare. The Minister has got €12 billion but not for seven years because, as I found out yesterday, there is a sneaky clause termed N+3. As such, that money does not need to be spent until after eight years have passed. This effectively decreases the budget per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> This year between 5,000 and 10,000 farmers have seen cuts of up to 10% in their single farm payments. They are beginning to see that the money promised is melting away. For the past two years I have been saying the greatest issue in agriculture, particularly in productive counties such as Wexford, is getting a good price in the market, be it for liquid milk, beef, vegetables or anything else.</p>

What are we doing with the CAP moneys? Compared with this time last year, a much higher percentage of the amount a consumer pays for beef is going to processors and retailers than to farmers. The main indirect beneficiary is the retailer. The Government has put the money through the farmer to rich and powerful vested interests because it will not tackle them.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> It is interesting that the Government claims it cannot have regulation or control price. I would like to have a real debate on the issue.

          <p eId="para_958">Their allegation is that, when the scandal resulted in much tighter inspections by supermarkets of what they were buying, the beef that was intended to be sold into the market could no longer be sold. I am only saying what is being alleged. If we had a regulator, he or she could find out whether the allegation was true. Regulators check to ensure there is no abuse of a dominant position in the market. That is what we need.</p>
