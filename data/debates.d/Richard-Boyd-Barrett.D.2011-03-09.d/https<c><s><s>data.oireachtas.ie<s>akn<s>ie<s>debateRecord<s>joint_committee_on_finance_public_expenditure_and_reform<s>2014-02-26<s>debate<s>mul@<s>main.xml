          <p eId="para_21">We will now deal with matters relating to the sale of the IBRC mortgage loan book. Before we commence business, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off to avoid interference with the broadcasting of the meeting. The meeting is being broadcast, not on cable but on a webcast, and there will be people watching it. Any mobile telephone interference creates technical difficulties. If there is interference, I will disrupt the meeting. If there is a difficulty, I will ask those concerned to leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> I welcome to this afternoon's meeting the special liquidators for IBRC, Mr. Kieran Wallace and Mr. Eamonn Richardson, and officials of the Department of Finance, Ms Ann Nolan, second secretary, Mr. Anthoine Mac Donncha, head of the legal unit, and Mr. Gary Hynds, assistant principal. The witnesses are here to discuss matters relating to the sale of the IBRC residential mortgage loan book. This discussion will begin with opening remarks from Mr. Richardson on behalf of the special liquidators. Following that, questions may be put by members to the special liquidators or officials, as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I ask Mr. Richardson to proceed with his opening remarks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Eamonn Richardson<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_25">My name is Eamonn Richardson and I appear here today with my colleague and fellow special liquidator, Kieran Wallace. We thank the committee for this opportunity to present on the special liquidation process as it impacts on IBRC mortgage customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> With the committee's permission, we have an opening statement which we would like to provide to it. I will highlight some of the key contents from that statement. Then we will be available to take questions from the committee. The members of the committee will be aware that we retain obligations of confidentiality towards individual borrowers of IBRC and we are unable to discuss the specifics of any particular account or borrower. Furthermore, the sales process for the residential mortgage portfolio is ongoing with final bids due on 14 March 2014. As I am sure the members of the committee will appreciate, there are certain matters that remain commercially sensitive in relation to this transaction which we are unable to discuss.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Mr. Wallace and I were appointed as joint special liquidators on 7 February 2013 under the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013, IBRC, Act 2013. The passing of the IBRC Act and the appointment of the special liquidators was part of the promissory note transaction which yielded significant benefits for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> On our appointment, we were instructed by the Minister for Finance to arrange for the valuation of IBRC's loan assets by independent advisers. In this regard, the special liquidators appointed PwC as independent advisers to value the residential mortgage portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> PwC was also appointed to provide independent advice in developing a robust and credible sales strategy for the sale of the residential mortgage portfolio which would ensure that maximum value was achieved for the benefit of all creditors of IBRC. We understand the committee sought a copy of this report issued by PwC. In view of the commercially sensitive nature of the material contained in that report, we regret that we are not in a position to make this available or to put it into the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> It is also worth noting that, per the ministerial instructions, the assets of IBRC could only be sold at a price equal to or in excess of the independent valuations obtained. Should a bid in excess of the independent valuation obtained not be received, the loan asset will transfer to NAMA at the independent valuation price.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> I will give a general update on our loan sales processes to date. For operational reasons, the loan assets of IBRC have been divided into six portfolios, code named Evergreen, Sand, Rock, Salt, Stone and Pebble. The Sand portfolio comprises Irish originated residential mortgage loans with a par value of €1.8 billion. In total, there are 15,734 borrower groups comprising 24,632 loans for sale across the six portfolios. Thirty-three of these borrower groups, representing 0.2% of total borrower groups, were or are being offered for sale on a stand-alone basis. No IBRC borrower is being provided with an exclusive opportunity to buy back his or her loans at a discount, and each sales process is a competitive sales process involving third parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> Within the Sand portfolio, there are 11,825 individual residential mortgage customers comprising 12,702 mortgages with a par value of €1.8 billion. Following receipt of legal advice, we corresponded with these residential mortgage holders and provided them with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid on those loans. We received 1,224 residential mortgage holder representations. The special liquidators have reviewed and considered each representation. In addition, the representations were considered by PwC in delivering its sales strategy advice to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The valuation of the Sand portfolio was completed on 11 November 2013, with the sales process commenced on 14 October 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">As indicated, we expect to be in receipt of final bids on the portfolio on 14 March 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> We did consider the concept of selling individual mortgages but for a number of reasons we could not proceed with that. We can discuss these with the committee in more detail later. However, some of the issues we encountered included the cost of running such a process; timing; the independent advice received from PwC; borrower-only bids; the confidentiality of personal information that would be in the public domain; delivering best results for the creditors, including the taxpayer; and the execution risks associated with such a strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> We confirm that since the commencement of the special liquidation, the residential mortgage holders have continued to enjoy the protection of the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, and other protections in Irish consumer law. We have established a robust residential mortgages credit committee process and have reviewed mortgage accounts for forbearance, restructuring and enforcement measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Of the 12,702 mortgage accounts in IBRC, 10,622 relate to mortgages on a borrower’s private dwelling house, PDH. Of the PDH accounts, 4,175 are in arrears. Over the past, year we have been engaging with borrowers to address these arrears. A key development we have achieved to date is that we have concluded restructuring with 38% of the customers in arrears, with a further 6% in the final stages of completion. In addition, we are working towards a solution with 42% of the remaining accounts, which, with borrower co-operation, we will endeavour to deal with before the sales process. We do not currently have sufficient information to devise a solution in respect of 14% of our customers. Further information is being requested from these borrowers with a view to working towards a sustainable solution for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> We are currently making approximately 16,000 customer interactions per month across the full Sand portfolio. Efforts to contact borrowers are via telephone and letters, and we are urging borrowers to re-engage with us and work towards a sustainable solution. We are in monthly contact with in excess of 98% of our customers in arrears. Any IBRC borrower can repay all borrowings with IBRC at any time up to the end of the sales process. The full amount, or par value, of all borrowings outstanding at the time must be repaid.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> Some concerns have been expressed on the intentions of third-party purchasers of the Sand portfolio. In this context, it is important to note the objective of any third-party purchaser will be to make a financial return on the purchase. It is unlikely that this purpose could be achieved through actions that would make it more, rather than less, difficult for borrowers to comply with the terms of their loan agreements. Third-party purchasers will be required to honour the legal terms of the underlying loan agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> We can confirm that the third-party bidders who are bidding on the residential mortgage portfolios have confirmed they will be directing that the mortgages be serviced in accordance with the terms of the CCMA should they be successful in acquiring those loans. We are satisfied that the voluntary nature of this arrangement strikes a fair balance between the interests of the mortgage holders as well as the interests of the creditors of IBRC.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> The sales process for the Sand portfolio is ongoing and it is, therefore, too early to comment on what percentage of it will be sold to third parties or to NAMA at the valuation price. We will continue to work with residential mortgage holders who are in arrears and we are willing to correspond with them pending the sale of the portfolios to third parties or to NAMA to arrive at sustainable solutions for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> I thank the Chairman and other members of the committee for their time. We are now available to take questions on our statement.</p>

We have employees who are owed moneys in respect of contractual entitlements and suppliers who were owed money on the date on which the bank went into liquidation.

          <p eId="para_53">That brings me on to the next question. There are resolution targets. The delegation mentioned its own resolution targets in its opening statement. I will return to this later. Under the existing scheme, set out around April of last year, very specific targets were set for the banks. There are percentages of 25%, 35%, 50%, etc. There was a carrot-and-stick approach. The stick approach is that if financial institutions do not meet their targets, capital penalties will apply to them. The loan book being sold contains people with performing mortgages. They may be performing just by their fingertips but there are people in resolution processes, as has been explained. I will go into the detail of the resolution process later. What is the position on the resolution targets pending the sale? If the Central Bank has no role in this matter, how can penalties be applied according to the code of conduct?</p>

          <p eId="para_54">We are very pleased with the progress that has been made while we have been in the IBRC during special liquidation.  As my colleague Mr. Eamonn Richardson alluded to, by the end of next week we will have effected restructuring deals with 44% of the borrowers in arrears who are co-operating with us.  A further 42% are work in progress.  We are actively encouraging those in this category to continue to co-operate with us so we can have restructuring deals done for them over the coming weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">That is not the question I am asking. Mr. Wallace referred to the current state of play and said that following the sale of the loan book, a voluntary code of practice will apply, but I am saying the current resolution process for people in Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Permanent TSB involves very specific targets which, if not met, result in the application of penalties by the Central Bank. Capital reserves must be adjusted, for example. Will any penalties apply to the new institutions? It is critical that people in difficulty be put into a resolution process. What gatekeeping exists to ensure the targets will be met by the new financial institution?</p>

          <p eId="para_61">Let me move on to the Department of Finance.  The statement issued last evening by the liquidator claims all the parties now in phase 2 agree on abiding by the voluntary code of conduct.  In earlier comments by the Minister and the Department, there seems to have been concern about the rating in terms of the creditors' best interests and distortion with regard to the value of the book on the basis of having some people in a box and others outside it.  Given that everyone in phase 2 has accepted the voluntary code of conduct, it creates equalisation with regard to the purchasing of the loan book.  Does this present a legislative impediment that would be damaging to the creditors?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_22">
          <from> Ms Ann Nolan<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_62">First of all, I would like to welcome the fact that all the bidders have said they will voluntarily abide by the code. As regards possible future legislation, last week in the Dáil the Minister said he hoped they would voluntarily abide by the code. However, we are in discussions with the Central Bank and the Attorney General on whether we can extend the legislation. It is quite complex because a lot of different legal contracts were entered into between different people at different times.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> The Minister is absolutely determined that the code of conduct will apply. We will certainly be watching the space. If the bidders who eventually purchase them do not abide by what they have committed to do, the Minister has said he will legislate as necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I need to thrash this out with Ms Nolan again, if she does not mind.  The earlier argument was that creditors would be at a disadvantage if we were to legislate for a code that would have devalued the book.  Because everybody has now signed up to the voluntary code, there is no negative impact on the loan book.  Putting aside the fact that the State is the major creditor, what is the impediment from a creditor's perspective?  Is there a creditor impediment that would stop a legislative framework being put around this?</p>

          <p eId="para_65">We only got this information last night and I have not spoken to the Attorney General's office on whether there would still be an impediment in legal terms. I cannot give legal advice on that issue but it is unlikely, given that this process is now half-way or three quarters way through, that we would have legislation to go through in that period, even if we had it ready. The fact is there are legal complexities and this is not necessarily the only book that would be sold. We are looking at legislation, as the Minister said. The creditor position is obviously changed by the commitment.</p>

There are a number where we have given moratoria whereby they do not have to pay for a period when they find themselves in temporary difficulty.  We have also done some trade-down solutions for people wanting to move from a certain size of house to another house to alleviate some of the problems with their mortgage.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">For those on the mortgage book who may have been able to discuss their financial situation with another financial institution in the country - let us say, one of those that comes under the regulation of the Central Bank - and have received loan approval to purchase their mortgage out of the new structure, is it envisaged that the purchasing out will draw penalties upon the buy-out?</p>

I will take up those issues with Ms Nolan as she is representing the Minister who, unfortunately, cannot attend this meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The bottom line is that thousands of IBRC mortgage holders now feel they will be at the mercy of an unregulated, unsympathetic, potentially foreign-owned fund which is out to maximise the profit it can make from the mortgages those people took out in good faith from an Irish financial institution, regulated by the Irish Central Bank. They will find themselves completely exposed, isolated and vulnerable to whatever that particular fund decides to do with their mortgages. That is where those people find themselves as a result of the way this process has been handled. Does Mr. Wallace have any comment on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_109">I understand those concerns entirely from individual mortgage holders. Indeed, Mr. Richardson and I have spoken to many of them directly. As liquidators, we have a job to do, which is to sell the assets for the best price we can for the benefit of the creditors, which I alluded to already. The only other thing I would say is that this is not the first mortgage book that has been sold in Ireland. Our experience on the ground is that we have seen no material difference in the way the buyers of those books have dealt with and handled customers post-acquisition than with any existing Irish bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">Unfortunately, we have not got the bids in from the bidders at this point in time.  There is still a reality to the possibility that the loans will transfer to NAMA.  As everyone understands, NAMA has a backstop position in respect of the IBRC liquidation.  It is not a foregone conclusion that these loans will go to outside buyers.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">We now have two different standards of protection for Irish mortgage holders who took out a mortgage from an entity in Ireland regulated by the Central Bank in respect of their family home.  We are not discussing investment properties but family homes.  We now have a vista in which we have two different standards of protection.  If one is a customer of AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB or Ulster Bank, one has the full protection of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  However, if one had taken out one's mortgage with the former Irish Nationwide, one will now have a completely different standard of protection which is entirely discretionary and can be removed at any time by the new holder of one's mortgage, if that ends up being an unregulated entity.  The issue is that even if the funds say they are compliant, a dispute may arise.  If one is in difficulty with one's mortgage and the fund says it is complying with the code of conduct and offering various restructuring options, to whom does one turn to if one disagrees?  One cannot go to the Central Bank, which has nothing to do with it and one cannot go to the Department of Finance, which also has nothing to do with it.  One cannot go to the special liquidator, which will have got its fees and be gone.  Who do people turn to?  They have nowhere to turn.  That is morally bankrupt and completely unacceptable.  It is as much a political issue as it is one for the special liquidator.  Even with the voluntary compliance that these funds say they will adopt, what will happen if they sell on the mortgage book?  That is what they do.  They will not necessarily work out each of these mortgages for the next 15 to 20 years.  They may well sell this on.  That commitment will be sold on with it and will be gone.  Has that issue been discussed?</p>

          <p eId="para_117">I understand it will not apply if the buyer is a non-regulated entity. They will not have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman. It is another matter we are considering in the Department at the moment. I understand the two purchasers of the existing portfolios of mortgages that have previously been sold on the Irish market have established an internal, independent appeals procedure which they are using for people who wish to appeal where they have a problem with their mortgage. We will ask whoever purchases these mortgages to do the same. We are reviewing this issue in the legislative review that we are carrying out.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">It is a major issue, as the Financial Services Ombudsman is the statutory watchdog for Irish consumers who have complaints about financial products sold to them. That avenue will be completely closed off for IBRC mortgage holders who will have their mortgages sold by the special liquidator. There is a serious vacuum in the law which must be addressed urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> I revert to how this issue arose in the first place. We know from parliamentary questions that the Department of Finance was in contact with KPMG as prospective special liquidator for IBRC as far back as autumn 2012, which was several months before the Minister came to the Dáil in February 2013 with emergency legislation to appoint the special liquidators. Did anyone think of this issue and the mortgage holders and of ensuring that these basic but vital statutory protections would be retained in the circumstance of the bank being liquidated? Why was that not factored into the sale process following the appointment of the liquidator?</p>

          <from> Ms Ann Nolan<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_120">It was very important for legal reasons that the sales process was independent and that the other creditors of IBRC would not have recourse to the State.  We did not do anything that would impinge on the value of the assets as they were being sold as the taxpayer would otherwise be left liable for quite a considerable sum of money.  The question of public policy on the protection of mortgage holders is a separate one in respect of which we are looking at legislation.  It is not as part of the sales process of IBRC loans.  Any legislation we bring forward is likely to apply to any sales process of any loans and unlikely to apply exclusively to the IBRC loans.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_121">What Ms Nolan is saying is in fact worse.  She is saying the issue was considered but a decision was taken not to insist that these mortgage holders would be left in no better or worse position.  The Department felt that insisting these protections be retained might diminish the value of the loan book and so decided to exclude them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_79">
          <from> Ms Ann Nolan<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_122">No. What I am saying is that as part of the IBRC liquidation, we dealt only with the value of the assets being sold. In terms of protection for the individual mortgage holders, at the time we introduced the legislation, it seemed most likely these mortgages would go to NAMA. I understand that now there are other bidders. That is not exactly what we expected at the time. We would require NAMA to apply the consumer protection code to any consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> The question of sales of mortgages is a broader one that encompasses more than just the IBRC. It has to do with the mortgage contract. It is obviously preferable that all of the protections of the State apply to these customers, but it is also important not to put ourselves in a position in which we are implying they will have no protection at all. They are governed by the mortgage agreements they have signed and they will be governed by any restructuring agreement they sign with KPMG or have already signed with IBRC before the liquidation. It is not the case that these customers are left with no protections at all. The legal position is that the courts have asked anyone who has gone to court over a mortgage case whether the consumer protection codes applied or not. The courts will retain the right to ask that question. It is specifically provided for in the insolvency legislation that people have rights under the consumer protection code.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">Ms Nolan knows as well as I do the conditions of a contract of sale of a mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">If anyone looks at their mortgage document and if that is the limit of their protection, it is apparent that it is skewed heavily in favour of the lender. Essentially, if one gets into any level of difficulty with a mortgage, it can be called in at any time. That is why a statutory code of conduct was put in place. It was to allow breathing space for a borrower, as well as putting an obligation on the bank to work with a customer to come up with solutions to be worked out over a period. To claim the new mortgage owner will step into the shoes of the bank and that the same conditions will apply is no comfort to that person with a mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> If these funds do come into possession of these mortgages, have there been any discussions with them about interest rate policy? Another concern people have is that these funds are not subject to oversight in Ireland or do not come under any competitive pressures. Accordingly, the organisations involved could just jack up the interest rates.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">It is quite interesting.  Not all of these individual loan sales have completed, and of the ones that have completed, there have been quite a number in which the borrower was not the successful party.

We took independent advice following our appointment as to whether there was any rationale in including KPMG in that litigation and the advice from the independent legal firm was "No". One of the directors has now joined KPMG in the litigation. In the coming days, Mr. Richardson and I will be announcing a very different approach in terms of how that litigation will be managed.

          <p eId="para_186">Can I clear up one thing because everybody in the room wants to know the answer to it?  In respect of the timing of last night's announcement, it could be construed that this was a statement that was going to be put together before the special liquidators came before the committee today.  How long have they been in negotiations with the preferred bidders with regard to a voluntary code of conduct?  We discovered this afternoon that it has no legal standing and that no targets are in place for the people in resolution processes that carry penalties as they do in all the other institutions.  This committee would certainly like to know about the timing of last night's announcement.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">That is an entirely legitimate question. As Mr. Richardson said, each process for the sale of loans goes through a number of different stages. We have phase one in which we try to determine whether there are any parties interested in acquiring the loans. After that stage 1, we then look to see what kind of values the potential bidders have put on those loans. Where there is an appropriate reason to bring bidders through to phase two, we do that. This is probably one of the more complex books in terms of getting it to market and getting it sold. It was our professional judgement that it was only in the last two weeks that it made sense to engage with the bidders in respect of this issue. We had heard it debated. In our professional judgement, there was no point in doing it prior to that because it was only at that stage that we had some insight as to which bidders were seriously interested in making a bid for the various loan portfolios within this section.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">Does Mr. Wallace think that there is not only one conflict of interest but a number of conflicts of interest?  I will summarise it because I want to move on to the mortgage issue.  The special liquidators of IBRC are employees of KPMG who ask whether IBRC should sue KPMG as a result of the auditing of Irish Nationwide accounts carried out by KPMG.  The special liquidators seek independent advice from a legal firm that gave advice to Irish Nationwide on the issues of corporate governance.</p>

As Mr. Wallace pointed out, the decision not to sue KPMG was made before that firm was appointed as special liquidator.  The decision was made by the independent board not the Department of Finance.  We did not play a day-to-day management role in the running of IBRC before it was liquidated nor do we do so during its liquidation.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">Earlier I met with a number of individuals who had mortgages with IBRC.  They are deeply concerned and quite angry about what is currently happening.  One individual, who is a father of three children, has asked me to outline his situation to the committee.  He has a split mortgage under a restructuring arrangement with IBRC that is reviewed on an annual basis.  According to Mr. Wallace, that restructuring agreement will be enforced with the buyer but the agreement is reviewed annually.  If IBRC rips the agreement up next year and demands the repayment of the full amount, this individual would have recourse to the Financial Ombudsman.  However, the new owner of the mortgage will be able to legally review his contract and decide whatever action it considers appropriate.  What would Mr. Wallace say to this individual about what will happen when the agreement is reviewed next year?</p>

          <p eId="para_208">I do not know the specifics of that case but I understand the individual's concerns.  The restructuring agreements with IBRC that I have seen certainly extend beyond one year.  Many of them extend to three years, five years or longer.  It is certainly not the norm in the restructuring agreements I have seen.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">This was a one year case but the same issue arises for three year agreements. The most Mr. Wallace can say to those concerned is that the bidder will comply with the restructuring until the time of the review, at which point all bets are off and there is no recourse to the Financial Ombudsman.</p>

In so far as legislation prospectively governed the actions of people who had acquired such assets, it is not a foregone conclusion that it could not be applied to people who purchased those assets prior to the legislation coming in. So because the legislation would be prospective, it would not interfere with the conditions of the sale. It is legitimate for the Government to legislate for the actions of people who are in that sort of space. That is why we have a suite of regulation of financial service providers. It would be for the Attorney General to make the final decision but we are not discounting the possibility that it would be possible to so legislate. That is why it is under active exploration.</p>

My last question is for the Department of Finance regarding Tanager. There are concerns about a conflict of interest. It is well publicised that directors of Tanager, which bought the loan book from Bank of Scotland, are partners of A&amp;L Goodbody, which provided advice to Certus and which was involved in the outsourcing of the loan books. Is there any concern or are any red flags going off within Departments about directors of one company buying loans from Royal Bank of Scotland being partners in another company which provided advice to the bank to sell the loans?

We have an interest in whether the ultimate purchaser abides by the code of conduct because we have an interest in the individuals who own those mortgages as part of the public interest in how mortgage holders are treated across the board. We have no interest in the price Bank of Scotland got for a mortgage book it sold because there was no commercial interest to the Irish State involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">My job is to protect the mortgage holders and employees of IBRC, Irish Nationwide, etc. The witnesses are special liquidators, not just ordinary liquidators. The fact that they have been appointed by the State means they also have to look after the citizens of the State. They are trying to get the best price, but there is more at play than that. Ms Nolan has alluded to the fact that in the event that the Minister believes the purchasers are not complying with the code of conduct, the Department will try to put a legal framework in place to protect the mortgage holders. If I were a purchaser of this loan book, that would be built into the value now to begin with, so we are back down to the lower price again. Why not legislate for it now and make them comply with it?</p>

The issue from our point of view is that we have to protect the position of the taxpayer who has given a guarantee to the Central Bank for nearly €13 billion worth of NAMA bonds on the back of these assets.  We cannot allow that the other creditors could sue us for a potential loss of value, even if that potential loss of value were zero.  If they could make out that it existed and sue us, we could be putting ourselves in the position of having to pay out to other creditors and even the sub-debt holders.</p>

          <p eId="para_270"> Ms Nolan said that it was not envisaged in the IBRC liquidation that mortgages would be sold on. Could she elaborate on that? I acknowledge that the special liquidators are trying to do the best thing by the taxpayer and get the best price for loan book but they must have been told at the time of the liquidation what the strategy was for the work out of the mortgages. Were they told that the mortgages would not be sold into the market?</p>

          <p eId="para_271">No. Let me make it absolutely clear what I said was "it was not expected"; that is different from being envisaged. We knew the loan book was going to the market for sale; we thought it was more likely that it would end up with NAMA. It would be fair to say that the Irish economy has recovered in the past 12 months and the amount of interest in buying Irish assets has improved significantly in the past 12 months. We knew that some of the assets would sell but at the time we liquidated, it was not clear to us that there would be as much interest or that as big a proportion of the assets would sell to the private sector. One of the reasons we put in the NAMA arrangement was to make sure there was not a firesale because that would have left the Irish taxpayer very exposed, but all I said was it would have been our expectation that it was more likely that a bigger proportion of the assets would end up with NAMA than now appears likely.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">It would have been appreciated if we, as legislators, on the night had a strategy presented to us.  I understand that it had to be in place before 9 a.m. the following morning.  This is a little reactionary.  Almost 40% of the mortgages the special liquidators are dealing with are distressed.  I am uncomfortable with the notion that somebody can come in and manipulate their mortgages to get the most money they can out of them and we need to put legislation in place to protect them to the best of our ability.  I urge the Department and the liquidators to reconsider the need for legislation.  Given what has been divulged, any valuer would understand that the Minister would legislate if they did not live up to the code of conduct.  To safeguard the mortgages, the legislation should be introduced now rather than waiting for the loans to be sold on and on.  A total of 970 borrowers are not engaging.  Are they all PDH people or are they buy-to-let investors?</p>

          <p eId="para_275">We have had great co-operation from the IBRC employees. Their commitment and co-operation over the course of the liquidation has been exemplary. Mr. Richardson and I would like to publicly thank everybody in IBRC, particularly for the hard work they put into getting many of the loan books ready for sale. It has been an outstanding contribution by them. We worked pretty well with most employees over the period of time and we sought on many occasions to extend the contracts of employment with them as long we could. We recently announced an extension until late 2014. The other good news is we have not had occasion yet to make compulsory redundancies in respect of IBRC employees.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">However, many of them have been re-employed without being subject to the terms of the normal statutory redundancy process. In addition, they are considered to have started new jobs and do not have entitlements they had built up previously. They have been disadvantaged following the liquidation and that must be acknowledged. I thank Mr. Wallace for acknowledging their hard work because the vast majority of people working for Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society were hard working and decent and that is not said half often enough. Is there not an injustice that people in the higher echelons who were moved for the purposes of cleaning up the bank were given a lucrative handshake while those who are still there cleaning up the messy loans and doing the hard slog are not being remunerated or looked after properly post-liquidation?</p>

          <p eId="para_282">First, that decision follows independent advice from PwC.  It is not a decision that Mr. Richardson and I made independently.  It was following the receipt of professional advice having appointed independent advisers to provide that information to us.  The other thing is that nowhere in the liquidation of IBRC have we allowed an individual borrower to singularly bid on his or her own loan without competition from another party.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">That is important to note because I think it is forgotten in the detail. As I said earlier, many of the individual borrowers who have been allowed to bid for their own loans have not been successful in acquiring those loans. Hypothetically if we had decided, after receiving independent advice, that we would allow the borrowers to bid for their own loans, it would have been a quite difficult exercise because we would have had situations-----</p>

          <p eId="para_284">I am sorry to cut across Mr. Wallace. My question is about his suitability rather than the process. KPMG was the auditor of the Irish Nationwide Building Society and gave it a clean bill of health. Mr. Wallace has said he has no experience in selling loan books and he clearly has no elected mandate to look after the public interest. In the context of those three facts, does he believe it is appropriate for him to make decisions that so seriously affect tens of thousands of Irish men, women or children?</p>

          <p eId="para_285">Yes, I do.  In many cases liquidators go into a business where they have no prior experience.  I am not saying that is an analogy here, but I am saying I think it is wholly and absolutely appropriate that we would make decisions based on advice from experts in a given field.  The sale of the loan book that we are discussing is one aspect of the overall liquidation; it is not the entire liquidation itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">  I come to the voluntary adherence to the CCMA.  Mr. Wallace will be very familiar with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, a copy of which I have here.  I am sure he will be familiar with the sentence in Chapter 1 as follows: "Lenders are reminded that they are required to comply with this Code as a matter of law."  At today's committee meeting we have learned that the IBRC or Irish Nationwide Building Society mortgage holders, rather than being protected by law as is the case under the CCMA, will be protected by a voluntary agreement that has no supervision, no Central Bank involvement, no sanctions, nothing in writing, no guarantee that mortgage holders can buy out their own loans and no access to the Financial Services Ombudsman.

I have just read back over part of the special liquidators' opening statement which stated: "We are satisfied that the voluntary nature of this arrangement strikes a fair balance between the interests of the mortgage holders as well as the interests of the creditors of IBRC." The creditor essentially is the State, the majority shareholder. Given the protections under law guaranteed by this code compared with a non-existent gentleman's agreement that no one is willing to write down, that has no oversight, no sanction and no enforceability, does Mr. Wallace believe that the Irish Nationwide Building Society mortgage holders would be satisfied with that agreement?</p>

          <p eId="para_297">I wish to follow up on some of the questions Deputies have asked about it not being a binding agreement. Earlier, Mr. Wallace stated that it was his professional view that if it was a binding agreement it would lower the sale price. If bidders would lower their sales price if it was a binding agreement then they are <i>de facto</i> not serious about the voluntary agreement because they are lowering their sales price only because they will be forced to comply with this so-called non-existent voluntary agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">There may be a slight subtlety in that. We have independent advice that if we made it a compulsory term of the sales contract it would impact value. From that perspective it opens up a potential issue for Mr. Richardson and me, as liquidators.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">It does. However, in the past hour Mr. Wallace told this committee that it is his professional view that if these bidders were asked to sign a binding agreement rather than a gentleman's spoken agreement, it would lower the sales price. Does he believe it is reasonable therefore to infer that they are not serious about the voluntary agreement if they are saying they will pay less if they are forced to comply with the voluntary agreement?</p>

          <p eId="para_306">I put it to Mr. Wallace that in many cases that is rubbish. Let me give him an example. Let us consider a mortgage in arrears where there is equity in the house. Many of the domestic banks are offering split mortgages, which comes at a cost to the lender. If, as I agree, these hedge funds and whoever else is bidding are looking to make a financial return, then they are likely to evict the family, take possession of the house and secure their equity. Is that a reasonable assertion?</p>

          <p eId="para_311">The Deputy cut me off a while ago when I was trying to start to explain that issue.  In the opening statement we alluded to a number of issues which we have taken into account following independent advice on whether we would be in a position to allow mortgage holders to bid on their loans.  Even if we decided to go down that road, there are two practical issues, parking all the other issues that have come into our decision-making process, as to whether we could contemplate individual mortgage holders bidding for their own loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">  First, across the entire portfolio of IBRC loans we have, less than 0.2% of the total of borrowers have had the opportunity to bid for their own loans.  They have bid for their own loans in a very competitive environment, allowing other qualified bidders in to bid for those loans at the same time.  We have had no examples right across any book - nor will we have any examples - where individual borrowers will be the only party bidding for their loan because that does not allow Mr. Richardson and me to fulfil our duty of getting - and standing over getting - best price.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">  Second, even if we got down to the point of allowing individual borrowers to bid for their own loans, parking everything else to one side, we would have a range of practical issues to deal with.  Let us consider the hypothetical case of Mr. and Mrs. Murphy with their home on a particular road in a particular suburb of Dublin.  All the information would then be available to anybody who actually qualifies as a qualified bidder - it is not that difficult to qualify as such.  They would be able to go in and look at all of the information regarding Mr. and Mrs. Murphy's home, their payment records, the amount of the mortgage, the level of their arrears, when they stopped paying and all of the details around their mortgage.  We believe an incredible range of practical difficulties would arise even if we got to the point of getting the advice indicating it is practical to allow individual mortgage holders to bid for their own loans.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">It would be possible to create an auction process whereby individual mortgage holders had the option to bid for their own loans at whatever discount might be offered to other people who ultimately will buy their loans. That is an eminently achievable auction process. Was any effort made to model that auction process?</p>

          <p eId="para_315">Consideration was given, as we had in any of the portfolios we had put for sale, as to whether there was room for individual borrowers to be placed on their own in a separate tranche. That consideration was given here, as we did in respect of any portfolio. As we indicated in our opening statement, we corresponded with every mortgage holder prior to commencing the sales process. We received 1,224 responses, and Mr. Richardson and I, along with PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, personnel, read them and took them into account in forming final views on how this portfolio should be sold.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">There were not as many as the Deputy might think who sought to put in bids for their mortgages. We took a number of issues into account, including the cost of running a process, timing and independent advice from PwC. Nowhere else in the process had we a position where only the borrower would bid for the loans. We had to account for confidentiality of personal information and execution risk in following through the process. I do not want to harp on about it but we also had an obligation to get best price for assets from a company loan perspective.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">I thank the witness.  I will give an example of a gentleman who has been outside the gates of Leinster House and was keen to see the witnesses this afternoon.  He owes €220,000 on his family home and is in arrears of €20,000.  I assert that the non-performing loans - the example I give is one - could be sold for a discount of 50%.  We do not know if that is the case and the witnesses cannot say, but they could easily be sold at a 50% discount based on international prices for these types of loan books.  This person's home is in positive equity but he cannot pay the €220,000 mortgage.  It is likely that his mortgage will be sold to a hedge fund for approximately €110,000 and the fund, as it is completely unregulated, is likely to knock on his door or write to him informing him of an intention to initiate repossession proceedings.  It is likely that he, his wife and his children will be evicted from that home.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">  The special liquidators could have designed a process that sold him and his wife their mortgage for €110,000 or even more than the price that will be agreed with the random hedge fund that buys such things.  He would stay in his house along with his wife and children.  What can the witnesses say to him and the thousands of other mortgage holders looking at that type of scenario?</p>

They are not helping themselves as they have made the wrong decision, which will cause much unnecessary pain and suffering in this country.

          <p eId="para_407">It is a big contradiction in the witnesses' approach. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot tell us that if they forced them to comply with the consumer code and MARP, it would affect the purchase price they might be willing to pay and on the other hand say they will voluntarily do it anyway, so we need not worry and that nobody has anything about which to be concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The two things do not add up. Does Mr. Wallace not accept that there is a major contradiction in these two things?</p>

          <p eId="para_411">The Deputy must park the two things separately for a moment.  We have taken independent advice on setting up the sales process and how to manage that sales process for the mortgage side of IBRC.  We took the advice from PwC's loan portfolio team.  There were a number of different parties within the first phase of this particular sales process but the issue becomes even more pertinent in the second phase because it did not apply to some of the parties in the first phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">  The advice that we have taken says that if we include it as a definitive term then it will impact on value.  That is a very live issue for us.  Two weeks ago there was a case in the US where the judge refused to confirm a particular sale regarding IBRC because he thought there was better value available in respect of that sale.  It is a pertinent issue for us, as liquidators, that we get best value.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">The delegation cannot quantify what the difference in value is, yet they are telling us there is no difference at all from the point of view of the mortgage holders. That is what Mr. Wallace has implied because last night, in the late hours of the night, they had not signed up to some voluntary commitment. That is a big contradiction. It cannot be both things. Either the assurances Mr. Wallace has tried to give are worth nothing or it would have made no difference whatsoever if it had been made a condition of the sale that the purchaser had to sign up to the code.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">It does not add up but I have made my point. I seek clarification on the issue of the mortgage holders being allowed to buy back their own mortgages in or around the same sort of discount the vulture capitalists will get when they purchase the mortgage books. Mr. Wallace has said it would have been too costly, taken too much time and so on to do it that way. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_418">No, I do not think that is a fair reflection of what I said. I said that cost and timing came into the decision-making process, but I do not want to go over old ground. I am speaking from the perspective of ensuring Mr. Richardson and I can stand behind our obligations as liquidators. Therefore, we have not allowed any individual borrower to be the only party bidding for their own loans. There is competitive tension in the less than 0.2% of all the loans of IBRC that we have allowed to be put out on their own as individual loan sales. We have not, in any particular party of IBRC, allowed an individual borrower to be the only party bidding for their loan.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">I have not said that. I am saying that cost is a factor. There are a combination of factors, including the independent advice we received from PwC, the team that is in this business every week; the timing of trying to achieve a situation where individual mortgage holders are bidding for their own loans; the practicalities around the disclosure of information and confidentiality; the execution risk; getting best price; and the cost involved in trying to run such a process. Quite a number of factors went into the overall decision as to whether we could entertain individual mortgage holders and allow them to bid for their own loans.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">Whatever the timeframe is, they are subject to review. My next question is for the Department. Does it accept that mortgage holders have significant reason for anxiety, particularly when one looks at the attitude of banks that are based outside this country? They are not the banks we bailed out. Those banks have taken a different approach to the loans they own. They have displayed an attitude of getting whatever money they can regardless of the consequences for the person who had the loan and in a way that is not true because of the political and public pressure that might be on banks based here.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">I would not have the information that would allow me to draw the conclusion that there is an enormous difference between banks that are based outside of Ireland and those within Ireland. The same Central Bank rules apply across the board for all mortgage protection and to all banks whether they operate inside or outside of Ireland. I understand that where the loans are sold, there is an issue and we talked about it earlier. For banks themselves, the same legal protections apply regardless of whether those banks have been bailed out by the Irish Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">On the contrary, I think those companies are at the core of the collapse of Irish banking. At this stage, their advice is useless given the source. If they had been awake in 2008, along with other firms mentioned, we would not be in this situation. There are a lot of books to be written on the inner circle of closed accountancy firms in this city. I am appalled by what I hear.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">Mr. Wallace described his satisfaction at the discussions with non-Irish regulated bidders over the past two weeks that culminated in last night's announcement that they would voluntarily subscribe to the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears. These bidders have been asked for this commitment because they are based outside the country. Mr. Wallace was satisfied as to their bona fides but we know what is happening in this country with venture capitalists. Ireland has become a magnet for international hedge funds. They see pickings here and come in like vultures and sell on. They have no interest in hanging on to loans and being challenged on the commitments they gave to Mr. Wallace. We are also dealing with an unknown quantity, possibly based outside the country, that will not come under the code of conduct to which financial institutions in this country must subscribe. Mr. Wallace indicated to one of the members that he will disclose the bidders at the end but it is meaningless because we will never know the bidders if the loans are sold on at the rate hedge funds can sell them on.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">We know there are people with families who are concerned they will be thrown to the wolves in the hedge funds and their vulture-like activities. Even if Mr. Wallace can give a legally binding commitment from current bidders, nothing will save them from something else further down the line. This is empty, notwithstanding the two weeks work. It means nothing to these people. We must be straight with people because we are talking about their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Mr. Wallace stated that if there was an enforceable stipulation in respect of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, it could put the loan sale at a disadvantage in respect of the sale price. Have any bidders pulled out? I assume the answer is that they have not.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">In letters to the mortgagors of IBRC, the liquidators stated the special liquidators' objective of maximising sales realisations in the public interest under section 3(h) of the IBRC Act 2013.  The liquidators refused to allow the mortgagors to bid for their loans.  As far as I can see, the liquidators are acting illegally by excluding potential bidders.  The normal answer we get is that it is impractical to deal with individual mortgage holders but I cannot understand it because this is untrue.  How is it practical to set up these mortgages in the first place?  It takes a lot more paperwork to set up a mortgage than to pay it off in one go.  The liquidators have shown they can communicate with the mortgage holders because they wrote to them individually in August 2013 and looked for submissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">As far as I can see, all that has to be done is to ask each mortgagee what he or she wishes to bid, to put the lot on a spread sheet and to tot it up to get the mortgagee bids. Will the liquidator act in the best interests of taxpayers and allow all interested bidders to bid or will it continue, as far as I can see, to act illegally by excluding interested bidders?</p>

          <p eId="para_522">I welcome our guests. I have been given a couple of questions to ask and have a couple of my own. </p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Mr. Wallace has acknowledged that PwC was appointed by the liquidator to value the entire loan book. How many of the partners, executives or staff members of PwC appointed by KPMG to conduct the valuations were also partners and senior executives responsible for conducting PwC's Project Atlas - Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc? This report in the middle of September 2008 found that significant security was in place to minimise the bank's loss through default. Anglo Irish Bank management, subsequently relying on this report, told the Government that just €300 million in additional capital was required for the bank. The figure turned out to be €30 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> When assessing due diligence of who should be appointed for the valuation and loan sale preparation process, did the liquidator take account of past experience in the assessment? Does the liquidator agree that, objectively, it is hugely astonishing that the same people who undertook such an appallingly bad original valuation of Anglo Irish Bank in 2008 were hired again and, presumably, paid millions of euro for the privilege?</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> For how many years was KPMG auditor for Irish Nationwide Building Society, an entity which was subsumed by IBRC and for which KPMG is now the Government appointed liquidator? There is the question which arose in the American courts recently that there was embedded fraudulently charged interest on some of the commercial loans in the Anglo Irish Bank loan book for a long number of years. This has been shown as fact. It was not a once-off case but an experience that was systemic. It implies that any rolled up interest, the subject of such fraudulent charges, contaminates the cumulative loans that are the subject of a sale and that the buyers of such loans are buying loans with toxic or embedded fraudulent charges. How has the liquidator dealt with this issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> People who took out mortgages, whether in the Irish Nationwide Building Society or, to a smaller degree, in what was Anglo Irish Bank, entered into a series of covenants under headings which included the term of the mortgage loan, the amount of the loan, the repayments, the interest charges and their basis. Even though there may have been some small print licence to sell on or securitise these loans, their essence is a relationship extending over 25 years. I agree with Senator Fidelma Healy Eames that when a loan is sold, even if it is performing-----</p>

I said at that time that we would review the work done by the board regarding the cost of funds and the interest which was inappropriately charged.

I understand that as an official it is not Ms Nolan's duty to give opinions on policy direction and so forth but perhaps she would explain, in legislative terms, what mechanism exempts buyers of mortgages from Central Bank regulation.  What is the mechanism that puts such people outside regulation by the Central Bank?</p>

          <p eId="para_553">It is not a question of what puts them outside regulation but rather what puts them under regulation. The Central Bank Acts puts them under regulation but if they are not a regulated entity under those Acts, then they are not in regulation as such. If one buys a loan and one is not a regulated entity, then one falls outside the scope of regulation, as I understand it.</p>

          <p eId="para_570">Ms Nolan referred earlier to retrospective legislation.  At other side of the sale, there is the contractual nature of the sale of the actual loan.  It was implied that the purchasers of loans could adopt a belligerent attitude which could affect people adversely because they are on variable rate mortgages.  Most variable interest rate loans are tied, somewhat, to the ECB rate.  The rates tend to move around that space.  If we saw a departure from that general approach to the variable interest rates being applied on the current loan book that is being sold and there was an increase of 1% or 2% with no material change in the ECB rate, that could be deemed to be very belligerent behaviour by the purchaser.  Ms Nolan indicated that such behaviour might give rise to legislative action, not on the sale itself but on how the contract is operating.  Is my understanding correct here?</p>

Obviously, it would be a matter of concern if a very aggressive line was taken but I could not speak to whether or what we could or should do about that or whether ---</p>

In other words, the operational rather than the sale aspects of the loans could be examined</p>

          <p eId="para_575">As a general principle, there are no legal rules about what interest rates people can charge on loans.  Banks can charge different interest rates for different loans, depending on the risk appetite, the length of the loan, the financial position of the borrower and so forth.  Indeed, there are non-banks which also charge different interest rates for different types of loans.  There is usually something governing the interest rates in the loan agreements themselves but there is no legislation governing interest rates on loans.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">That brings me back to the question I asked Mr. Richardson and Mr. Wallace earlier. I will put it to Ms Nolan. Yesterday evening's announcement that everybody in the phase 2 bidding process is in verbal agreement to adhere to a voluntary code of conduct means there is a flat-line position between all of the phase 2 bidders, even if we might not call it a level playing field. Does this change the Department's thinking about the legal advice it received previously regarding imposing conditions on the sale that would have an adverse effect on the value of the loan book? Now that everybody is actually in that space, has it been considered that it could be possible to put a legislative framework around this that would not have an adverse effect on creditors?</p>

          <p eId="para_577">As I said earlier, if we put a legislative framework into this space, it is likely that it will not be specific to the IBRC.

Its mortgagees, or the individuals who own those mortgages, are entitled to the same protection as IBRC mortgagees will be entitled to.  It would be quite unusual to have bespoke legislation for this sale and not for other sales.  I cannot see any particular reason to change the legislation on the sale of loan books in such a way.</p>

          <p eId="para_658">I thank Ms Nolan for the clarification.  If the bids are allowed to proceed without a legal commitment in respect of the code of conduct and the Minister subsequently introduces legislation to require adherence to the code of conduct, could the bidders sue the liquidator of IBRC?  The bidders have opted into the voluntary code of conduct and are aware that the Minister will introduce legislation on the code of conduct.  On the grounds of certainty and the potential cost to taxpayers, should the liquidator not consider requiring bidders to comply with the code of conduct for mortgage holders?</p>

          <p eId="para_660">This is not a normal liquidation because taxpayers effectively own IBRC.  The price is clearly factored into the voluntary commitments.  If the liquidators allow bids to be made on the basis that they will be required to comply with the code of conduct, they will flush out individuals who are seeking to flip the loans on rather than comply with the code of conduct.  Would it not be best practice and good governance for the liquidator, acting on behalf of taxpayers, to implement such a requirement now to bring certainty to the bidding process?</p>

          <p eId="para_679">That is categorically not the case from the information we have seen in respect of the valuations that have been placed on the assets and the bids that have come in. In particular, one gains a great deal of insight when one sees bids coming in from multiple parties on the same asset. This gives one a very good indication as to whether the value range for the assets in question was appropriate. This is something we are very conscious of in respect of each of the loan sales we do. As I stated, and this is as true of the loans we sell to third parties as it is of the mortgage book, it is of vital importance that we secure the best value for taxpayers and the creditors of IBRC.

          <p eId="para_690">IBRC was liquidated overnight, albeit with a little work.  We all remember the shenanigans associated with the relevant legislation in the Dáil Chamber.  The consequence of that is the sale of the loans of 13,000 mortgage holders.  My focus is not solely on those mortgages, because mortgage holders with the Royal Bank of Scotland are in exactly the same boat and do not have any protection.  That issue was not the subject of much attention.  Ms Nolan stated that her only interest was to ensure Royal Bank of Scotland was not bailed out by the State.  I am interested in the citizens who hold mortgages provided by that bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">I am also interested in corporate governance. For example, if a partner in a company that is providing advice ends up buying the book of an entity that is regulated by the Central Bank, Ms Nolan, as a senior official, should be interested. That is not my focus, however, so I will cut to the chase.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Please correct me if I am wrong. The Government's stated position is that it wants to ensure that unregulated entities who purchase loan books from regulated entities in the future will come under the code of conduct of mortgage arrears on a statutory basis. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_702">The Minister has made it very clear last week, when answering the Deputy's parliamentary questions, that the reason he did not do this - and it was a decision not to issue any such direction - is because it could impact on the value of the book.  That was his primary concern.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_624">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2014-02-26T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_703">The Minister is not here to answer the questions I am asking Ms Nolan as an official. If the Minister wants to come in and defend himself he is more than welcome. He was invited but he refused to appear before the committee. The Minister can do that. I am asking about the powers vested in him. Obviously the answer is right. Now we will go to the point Ms Nolan has raised. The issue that the Minister has raised in terms of the potential legal threat is, as Ms Nolan has stated on several occasions before this committee, that if one was to take an action in isolation - at no time have I suggested during this thread of conversation that we take an action in isolation.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> To reiterate, what Ms Nolan has confirmed is that the Government's stated intention is to provide protection on a statutory basis to all mortgage holders, including the 13,000 in IBRC, that the Minister has the power to issue a directional order to the liquidators of IRBC to cease with the sale at this point in time. The Minister has the power to bring forward the legislation that he has already stated he intends to bring forward and if it is brought forward on a unilateral basis that does not specifically deal with this sale, then the issue of legal action is diminished or does not exist. If this is what we all want, why do we not do it? Instead of the Minister saying he will introduce legislation if they will not agree with this voluntary code, why not just issue a directional order to IBRC liquidators to stop the sale at this point in time? The sale was supposed to be complete by the end of last year but it is not. Stop the sale at this point in time. Let us bring forward the legislation. As one of the main parties in Opposition, I have offered to work with the Government and the Minister to bring forward legislation. Deputy Michael McGrath has put his suggestions forward in the form of legislation. If we are genuinely serious about not shafting the 13,000 mortgage holders why can we not take that course of action?</p>

          <p eId="para_705">I certainly do not think that selling the mortgage book is shafting the 13,000 mortgage holders.  I understand there is concern that the bidders - we will have to see who they are - may not do what they have promised to do.  We will take action if they do not keep to the promises they have given to KPMG.  I do not think I could count the sale of the mortgage book as shafting the 13,000 mortgage holders.</p>

          <p eId="para_706">Okay, why do we not issue a directional order to stop the sale and bring forward the legislation which the Government has agreed to bring forward and then proceed with the sale again?  Why cannot we just do that?</p>

          <p eId="para_707">I have just been given this note. The Minister can only give directional orders if it is necessary for meeting the purposes of the IBRC Act, not if it is necessary for the general public interest. So it would be quite difficult to justify stopping the sale half way through on the basis of legislation which he can pass after the sale is over in any case.</p>

          <p eId="para_708">I take with a pinch of salt the commitments that the officials and the Government have given in this issue. Despite the fact that the Minister issued a statement last night saying he will legislate, and Ms Nolan has reiterated those points, she has not been able to confirm to the committee that the legislation the Minister is thinking about introducing could affect the new owner of those 13,000 mortgages, whether the owner decides voluntarily to sign up to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears or if that is sold on. There is no clarification as to whether such legislation could actually impact on the person who buys these mortgages on 14 March. That is where I take serious issue with the commitments the Government is giving at this point in time.</p>

          <p eId="para_709">My understanding is that we can issue such legislation but I have not got a stamped copy of legislation from the Attorney General. Until I get it, I cannot say it definitively. I do not work for the Attorney General's office. I would like to have a stamped copy before I could assure the House that this is perfectly okay. I have no reason to think we cannot, and I believe we can.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">I want to ask the special liquidators two questions.  I presume the liquidators are on course to meet the targets for loan disposals.  How many people - if the liquidators do not have the number they can supply it to the committee or to me at a later stage - bought their loans directly from IBRC in the competitive tender and so would have got a writedown, and what was the overall reduction in those loans?  They may not be able to give out the individual overall reduction but across the board.</p>

          <p eId="para_712">I will finish on this.  The other issue is on the former CEO of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Mike Aynsley, IBRC.  He is a joint defendant in regard to the racketeering cases going on in New York.  I understand the liquidators have provided a statement saying Mr. Mike Aynsley may well look to the bank for his costs.  He is still a company director at the Companies Registration Office in Ireland and may look to the bank to cover his costs.  Why is he not being taken off as a former director if there is an exposure to IRBC and liquidation of the legal costs of the former CEO?  Will the liquidators reassure the committee that no deal was done with the former CEO where he withdrew legal action against IBRC and liquidation for the fact that the notice period of one year was not paid out to him when his appointment was quashed when IBRC went into liquidation?</p>

          <p eId="para_713">Let me take those questions in reverse.  I can give the Deputies and the Chairman a categoric assurance that no payment has been made to Mr. Mike Aynsley or any sweetheart deal done with him, nor do we intend to make any payment.  Mr. Aynsley voluntarily withdrew that litigation.  On the costs being covered in the potential US court case, there is a slight confusion.  The meaning of what was said was that we may have to cover his legal representation costs at the hearing, whether he is director or not.  There are quite a number of people named in that litigation who are not directors of the bank who may still have to cover the costs of that.  We intend filing an objection to that litigation for the very reason that there was a stay on all IBRC litigation in the US and that it would join us by the backdoor in that litigation if we had to cover all those costs.  On his resigning as a director in the companies office, that is a matter for him.  We have corresponded with him but that is an issue for him, not an issue for us.  We cannot unilaterally do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">  The first question was on the details of the loans bought by individuals.  I am happy to confirm the general details to the committee but not on the quantum at this juncture for commercial sensitivities because we are still in sales processes going down the track.</p>

They would have spoken to buyers in the market throughout the world who buy loan books and would have taken market soundings in respect of the interest in the various loan portfolios in IBRC.  KPMG would then have made calls to interested parties who would have bought loan books previously in other jurisdictions.  We would also have had a significant number of inbound inquiries, over 300, on our appointment or shortly thereafter, expressing interest in various parts of the loan book or in specific loans.

The trade magazines are saying it is down to Oaktree Capital and Lone Star Funds.  Oaktree Capital's own description of itself states it emphasises an opportunistic value-oriented and risk controlled approach to investment in distressed debt.  Lone Star Funds states that it invests globally in distressed debt.  If these two bidders, or ones like them, are the successful bidders, they are debt collectors.  They may be reputable and extremely respectable and professional firms - in no way do I suggest they are not - but they are not banks.  They are professional investors in distressed debt.  On the basis there is no written voluntary agreement, if when the successful bidder emerges it says it never agreed to adhere voluntarily to the CCMA, will we have any proof it did?</p>

          <p eId="para_795">I alluded to an issue in the United States recently whereby the difference in net terms of the liquidation was less than €500,000 but the judge saw an issue in what we were doing. At issue is a €1.8 billion par value book. I have no wish to make it seem unimportant but, from our perspective, whether it is €100 or €1 billion it remains the same principle in that we have not got best value.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">That may be the case for the liquidators.  However, from our perspective, as legislators, it is a completely different issue.  Let us consider the example provided by Mr. Wallace in which the difference was €1 million.  I realise that is not the case.  Let us suppose PwC did the analysis - I do not believe the firm has done it - and it came out that the difference was €1 million.  Let us suppose PwC made a stab at total sales value under the recommended process and the firm also did an estimate of the sales value under alternative scenarios, particularly one in which the mortgage holders are allowed to bid.  I hope the firm did this.  Anyway, let us suppose that total difference was €10 million.  We, as legislators, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, as the guardian of the public purse, could then decide to let the bidders do what they are going to do while we, the State, would make up the difference, therefore protecting any question of a challenge from the creditors because the total amount of money available to the creditors does not go down.  Under that scenario we could potentially avoid thousands of families being unnecessarily evicted.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">The number is only a factor of the valuation and what we get in as bids at the end of the day. I believe asking PwC to put an exact number on it is probably unfair to PwC, to be honest. However, what PwC has is experience in selling loans books and the knowledge from the representations and all the other information around the sales processes in IBRC. PwC has clearly given us a recommendation that we are following.</p>

          <p eId="para_851">I just want to make this clear for everybody.  An individual home owner dealing with the mortgage for his or her home cannot buy it back but a corporate or commercial interest might be able to buy their own loan back at a discount.  That is the decision Mr. Wallace made.</p>

          <p eId="para_855">That is the problem. We have established the Government is disposed towards bringing in legislation that will make these loans subject to the consumer code, the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, and so on. We do not know when but it has indicated it will do so at some stage. At the same time we have been told that it cannot be a condition of the sale because it will impact on the price. I do not understand how we can commit ourselves to do something down the road, which presumably will have the same impact on the price, when we cannot do it now because it will have an impact on the price. Why will it not impact on the price further down the road if it impacts on it now? I do not get it. If we can do it down the road, why can we not do it now?</p>

          <p eId="para_857">I have already explained this. We do not want to tie any action of ours to the sales process because if we get involved in the sales process at all, we run the risk of leaving the Department of Finance and the State vulnerable to being sued by the other creditors, if they are in a position to make out that anything we did interfered with the value that went to their loans.</p>

          <p eId="para_868">There is a connection if we interfere with the sales process before it is finished in such a way as to provide a legislative change that could possibly change the value. How much it changes is moot but that is not the issue. If we bring in the legislation now, the other creditors can say we took some of their value and can sue us. It would be better to bring in the legislation in a more general way that is not related to IBRC. That applies to all the other mortgage holders and would also be fairer to other mortgage holders whose mortgages have been sold.</p>

          <p eId="para_872">  I want to clear up one matter and ask one question before bringing the meeting to an end.  In his presentation Mr. Wallace said that in total there were 15,734 borrower groups comprising 24,632 loans for sale across the six portfolios as described, 33 of these borrower groups, representing 0.2% of total borrower groups, having been or being offered for sale on a stand-alone basis.  We know for a fact, as every Deputy has repeated today, no borrower has been provided with an exclusive opportunity to buy back his or her loan at a discount.  Did the 33 loans have a certain value?  For example, were they above €1 million, €5 million or whatever?  What were the criteria that put those people into that space?</p>

          <p eId="para_873">It was a combination of three main points: the advice from our independent sales adviser, which could have been PwC or UBS, the letter of representation from the borrower, and the evidence they could execute a deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_876">There is one final question that people who have stuck with these proceedings this afternoon will ask themselves. There is a crossroads ahead for the residential mortgage book. It will either be sold or go into NAMA, regardless of codes of conduct, mandatory, voluntary or whatever. When can we expect that determination or decision to be made?</p>

          <p eId="para_879">No, we will make a decision as to who are the preferred bidders. Thereafter, there will be a period in which they still will be corresponding with IBRC prior to completion. It depends on those who become preferred bidders but completion is likely some time towards the end of April to perhaps mid-May.</p>
