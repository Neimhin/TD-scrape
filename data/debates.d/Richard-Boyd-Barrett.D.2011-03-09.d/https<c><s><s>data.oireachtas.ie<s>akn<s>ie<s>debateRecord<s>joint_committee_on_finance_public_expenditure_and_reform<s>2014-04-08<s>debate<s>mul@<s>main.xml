          <p eId="para_15">We will proceed with No. 7 on today's schedule, matters relating to mortgage arrears and the resolution process.  Before commencing business, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off to avoid interference with the broadcasting of the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">  I will move on to the formal part of the meeting and welcome the representatives of Ulster Bank.  We are joined by Mr. Jim Brown, chief executive officer of Ulster Bank, Mr. Stephen Bell, chief risk officer, and Mr. Jim Ryan, head of branch banking in the Republic.  The witnesses are present to assist the committee in the examination of mortgage arrears and the progress in putting in place solutions aimed at resolving difficulties in that sector.  I thank Mr. Brown and his staff for the written material they provided to the committee in preparation for today's meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">  The discussion will begin with opening remarks from Mr. Brown, following which questions may be put by members to the witnesses as appropriate.  It is important that we manage our time well this afternoon.  To derive maximum benefit from the meeting, each member will have a strictly limited time slot within which questions may be put and replies given.  Questions from members and the witnesses' replies to same should be clear and concise.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">  I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  The witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">  I invite Mr. Brown to make his opening comments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Jim Brown<recordedTime time="2014-04-08T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_20">As the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Bell, chief risk officer, and Mr. Ryan, head of branch banking for the Republic.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to provide an update on Ulster Bank's progress in the areas outlined in its invitation to us.  I will go through that invitation quickly, then respond to any specific topic that the committee wants to discuss.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> I would like to say a few words about Ulster Bank at the outset. We are the No. 3 bank in the Republic of Ireland and the No. 1 bank in Northern Ireland. We are building a substantial market share in a number of key areas, including mortgages. Our clearly defined strategy is based on building a really good bank for our customers and addressing our legacy issues. Our strategy is working. We expect to return to profitability this year. Our customer focus is evident in our approach to the resolution of mortgage arrears. We provide transparent and equitable solutions that are tailored to the individual customer's circumstances. Our focus is equally evident in our approach to existing or new customers who are looking to buy or move.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> During our last appearance at this committee, we set out our approach to assisting mortgage customers who are in arrears. We recognised the need to comply with regulatory targets. We explained that we were focusing on getting appropriate solutions in place for our customers, based on what is affordable after reasonable living expenses are taken into account. We have invested in people and systems. The range of supportive, fair and affordable solutions that we have developed enable the vast majority of customers who engage with us to remain in their homes. I am happy to report that our customer-based approach is working. Over 2,500 customers have moved out of arrears since we last met. Our innovative "economic concession" product continues to be the most popular structural solution for our customers. It features a discounted interest rate of as low as 0.5% over varying durations of up to seven years. The particular rate and duration are based on what the customer can afford. We also offer other options, including split mortgages, capitalisations and term extensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> As we have told the committee previously, our starting point on this matter remains that there is a cost to living in a home and that customers need to engage with us. We recognise our responsibility to work with them to find the most effective solution that allows them to remain in their home where possible. Recent research on the Ulster Bank mortgage book shows that paying the mortgage is more affordable than paying the equivalent rent in the same community, particularly when more progressive restructuring methods are considered. This requires engagement, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Ulster Bank does not offer debt write-off. Writing down arbitrary amounts of debt for a small number of people while they remain in their home is not something we will do. We do not believe that it is an appropriate solution as it raises as many questions as it purports to resolve. We believe the write-down or write-off of debt is an unhelpful distraction that is likely to create issues around moral hazard, transparency and fair outcomes for customers. In our view, the focus should be on affordability and offering transparent solutions that can be made available to all mortgage arrears customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The figures we have provided to the committee indicate that we have exceeded our regulatory targets and that the number of our customers in mortgage arrears of 90 days or more has fallen every month since March 2013. This trend is not seen elsewhere in the market. We have provided the committee with additional information that shows our approach over the full mortgage arrears book, including early intervention which we believe is essential in addressing the mortgage arrears issue. This information establishes beyond doubt the success of our approach and the value of early engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Since last summer, the number of customers in arrears who have not engaged with us and are not making any contribution to their mortgage has reduced significantly from 35% to 14%. This number is still unacceptably high. It is not fair to all other people who pay their mortgage that someone makes no contribution to the cost of their accommodation. We have no choice other than to pursue these customers through the legal route. Having said that, the primary intent of legal action is to encourage meaningful re-engagement so we can help. Any customer can take themselves out of the legal process at any stage by meaningfully re-engaging. We are pleased to advise the committee that almost half of our customers entering the legal process have re-engaged with us. Unfortunately, that means the same number are not engaging despite the seriousness of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> We expect to see a continued substantial decrease in Ulster Bank arrears. We also expect to see a continued increase in the overall number of mortgages where a borrower is more than two years in arrears. This is not because the banks are slow to offer solutions to these customers, but because these customers are refusing to engage and legal action appears to be the only option. The longer it takes to move a case through the legal process, the longer these cases will sit in the reported serious arrears numbers. I acknowledge that progress has been facilitated by addressing the legal and administrative obstacles to resolving the mortgage arrears problem, for example by revisiting the Dunne judgment and revising the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. It would be remiss of me not to point out that real problems continue to impede the process. It can take more than two years to process a repossession case through the courts. This timescale seems to be increasing as the cases previously blocked by the Dunne ruling enter the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> I would like to make a few comments on the personal insolvency arrangements. We have argued from the outset that we are dealing with a consumer debt issue, rather than a mortgage arrears issue alone. In these circumstances, the debt relief and debt settlement elements of the insolvency arrangement are a useful addition to the process, as they enable borrowers to put their debt burden on a more sustainable footing. The banks, which hold two thirds on the unsecured debt in the market, will deprioritise these unsecured loans so that customers can focus on paying their mortgages. We welcome the recent comments from Goodbody Stockbrokers, which confirmed the view unsecured debt is just that - unsecured. I note that, to date, Ulster Bank has not vetoed any protective certificate proposal put forward by a personal insolvency practitioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I will conclude on a positive note. The mortgage market is showing signs of improvement. We are well positioned to support the recovery. We are growing and actively gaining overall market share in key segments, particularly in the residential mortgage market. Our mortgage lending for 2013 has increased by 32%. We now support 14% of the market. We have close to €500 million to lend into the mortgage market in the Republic this year. We are approving eight out of every ten applications made to us. We also recently introduced a number of tracker porting products to enable customers to move house. I reiterate that Ulster Bank is committed to supporting the economy and building a really good bank for our customers. While there is more to do, I believe we are on the right path.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">I thank Mr. Brown.  I propose to take the first round of questions in 15-minute slots, the second round of questions in ten-minute slots and subsequent rounds of questions in five-minute slots.  I remind members to be concise in their questioning and witnesses to be concise in their responses.  I will begin by asking Mr. Brown about Ulster Bank's commitment to the Irish market as a retail bank on the high street.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">Ulster Bank was part of the review that was instigated by Her Majesty's Treasury in the middle of last year, which looked at whether RBS as a whole should consider splitting itself into a good bank and a bad bank to deal with the remaining legacy issues.  The conclusion of that review was that an internal bad bank would be set up.  At the end of last year, Ulster Bank took some specific provisions to deal with that.  At the same time, the commitment of RBS to Ulster Bank and the market here was very clear.  That commitment was announced late last year and reiterated in February.  We are now looking to work through how we can build on our challenger position in the market here in the Republic.  We are looking at a number of options to that end.  Our ultimate goal is to build a better bank for our customers.  That is what we are doing.  The commitment of RBS has been confirmed.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">The last time the Ulster Bank officials appeared before us, they referred to an earlier comment that I had made about how sustainable solutions are defined.  There was a level of ambiguity at that time.  There was a need for some clarity about the direction the Central Bank was giving to Ulster Bank, particularly in cases of people who are in arrears but might have positive equity on their property or might have the potential within their pensions to evolve a resolution process into retirement.  It seemed that the criteria were very restrictive in providing that the mortgage had to be resolved within the timeframe of that mortgage or the person's working life.  Has Ulster Bank been able to develop solutions in that area?  Has it sought clarity from the Central Bank in this regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_35">I might ask my colleague, Mr. Bell to provide some of that detail.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the targets are the targets and we need to comply with them.  Our focus is on doing the right thing by our customers.  We believe there are specific issues with the way the targets are set.  I refer, for example, to the question of whether people who still have mortgages when they retire should be determined sustainable.  Mr. Bell might add to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">To answer the Chairman's question directly, there is still some ambiguity regarding what constitutes sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">There is a very clear focus in the mortgage arrears resolution target regime on resolution being achieved by retirement age. We share the Chairman's view that this is not necessarily the right answer. We have been working on a variation of our split mortgage product which would allow customers to defer a portion of the debt to post-retirement, even if that involved deferring it to the point where their estate was brought to liquidation. Our focus is very much that it is completely inappropriate that somebody who can otherwise live in their home in a sensible and affordable way should be forced into the legal process.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">In the course of our previous hearings on this issue, the position of the Governor of the Central Bank in his written correspondence to me seemed to be at variance with the views he expressed when he appeared before the committee.  Has Ulster Bank sought a definitive position in this regard from the Central Bank?</p>

          <p eId="para_39">The way we tend to approach these things is that as we develop formal structures, we present them to the Central Bank and seek its agreement.  We have advised the Central Bank in correspondence that we are developing solutions which will involve a structure that goes beyond retirement age.  We have not as yet had any push-back or resistance to that, but we are not at the stage of formally proposing that structure for the Central Bank's confirmation.  After we last appeared before the committee, we went through the same process with our economic concession product.  It took us six to eight weeks after the committee's last hearing before we finally got confirmation from the Central Bank.  It is not a short process but I am pleased to note that, as yet, no resistance has been expressed to the idea of pushing part of the resolution beyond retirement.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">The only criterion we would use is affordability.  We work with the customer through his or her living expenses, part of which would involve examining any other debt he or she may be carrying.  We primarily focus, however, on how we can structure the mortgage so that it can be repaid in a sensible and appropriate fashion.  We would always key off affordability as defined by the customer's income and expenditure.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">However, affordability can work on a cascading or waterfall scale.  Is the assessment done on the basis of immediate affordability or is attention given to how that might cascade down over time?</p>

          <p eId="para_43">Our experience has been that where customers have started off with a lower payment, they have, over time, been able to resume more normal payments.  We are reluctant to push people immediately from a situation where they might have missed a series of payments to paying the full amount in one go.  We try to take a medium-term view and work with the customer.  A good example would be where one or both of the borrowers have returned to training in order to re-equip themselves to enter the employment market in a difference place.  It seems to us appropriate to support customers through that period, which might mean the payment would be lower while they go through that process of training or further education, before resuming at a more normal level at some point in the future.  We try to take a medium-term rather than an immediate view of what is reasonable.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">Coming back to an earlier question, affordability takes on an entirely different meaning if it is possible to move the resolution into post-retirement, particularly for people who are in positive equity.  There is some confusion in regard to the phrase "sustainable solution" in terms of a lack of appreciation that a solution will not be specific for the next 30 years but will, rather, have a variance to it.  For people in their mid to late 50s, for example, who have affordability issues with regard clearing the total sum of their mortgage repayment, is there potential with the type of new scoping out the bank is doing that somebody post-retirement who can afford a portion of the loan could, similar to what AIB is offering, take out some equity or avail of some type of payment programme that would be elongated during retirement?</p>

          <p eId="para_45">What we would do in that situation is defer the part of the principal that was not affordable for resolution at some later date.  We tend to revisit the situation with the customer periodically in case anything has changed.  There certainly has been no instigation on our part to go down a legal route where the customer clearly has positive equity and is able to sustain a portion of the mortgage, with the remainder to be resolved later.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">  To reaffirm what we said on the last occasion we appeared before the committee, we do not charge interest on the deferred element of any split mortgage.  In other words, it is not a case of deferring the problem for the customer.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">It is a welcome development that we are seeing resolution processes being developed by banks beyond the prescribed list set out in the Keane report.  Ulster Bank's concession approach is a very innovative one which allows the distressed borrower to deal with both interest and capital in an affordable and manageable way.  I note, however, that in the case of some of the options recommended in the Keane report such as mortgage-to-rent arrangements and split mortgages, the bank is very much in a flat-line position.  Is this because its customers are not choosing those options or because the bank is not offering them?</p>

          <p eId="para_48">Every time we talk to a customer about an economic concession, we explain the split mortgage option.  In the vast majority of cases, there is a positive election by the customer for the economic concession product.  We have been working on the mortgage-to-rent scheme and have managed, after 15 months, to conclude our first agreement.  It is a very long and complicated process involving a great deal of negotiation with different parties.  We absolutely are not resistant to that option but, as Mr. Brown said in his opening remarks, the ability to restructure loans to the point where the mortgage repayment is considerably less than the rent payable for an equivalent property means we tend to find solutions that do not require something like a mortgage-to-rent arrangement.  As I said, however, we are open to that if it is the right solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">I have some understanding as to why a person would opt for the concession approach rather than a split mortgage, but a mortgage-to-rent arrangement is in an entirely different category.  Do the delegates have some expectation as to when they will begin reaching the figures that are being placed on the grid in this regard?  There is nothing there at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">The solutions we have in place today are designed around keeping people in their home and thus give a better outcome for the customer.  As Mr. Bell mentioned, the cost of doing that within the range of options we offer is generally cheaper than the rent option.  In our view, the options we are providing are ultimately better for the customer and they are working.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">In response to a parliamentary question I tabled recently, I was told that the amount in mortgage interest supplement that has been paid out by the State since 2008 is just under €313 million.  This means that every bank, whether or not the State bailed it out, has been assisting its customers in one fashion or another.  This brings me to the point that some 30% of distressed borrowers with Ulster Bank are now engaged in legal proceedings where it seems a repossession is taking place.  That is quite a large portion.  The committee was not happy, during the course of the last set of hearings, that legal letters which had been sent out by the banks to customers were being counted as resolution processes.  These were the initial letters that went out; it would seem those cases have since progressed to a more formal position, with solicitors appointed, affidavits issued and so forth.  How is it that 30% of Ulster Bank's customers are finding themselves before the courts?</p>

          <p eId="para_52">When we appeared before the committee on the last occasion we said there was a significant increase in legal activity and we expected that activity to stabilise, which is what has, in fact, happened.  The key here is that it is not our intention to repossess anybody's house.  The problem we have at the moment is that there is a segment of customers who are not engaging with us at all, despite our mailing them, calling them and visiting their homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">If customers are not engaging, there has to be a process to encourage them to engage.  However, although the percentage of non-engagers has reduced from 30% plus to 14%, the bank's legal positioning is still at more than 30%.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_27">

          <p eId="para_56">The figure we referred to previously related to those customers who were not paying and not engaging and in respect of whom we had not yet commenced the legal process.  That figure has reduced to 14% or 15%.  When we came before the committee on the last occasion, we said that the nature of the target regime meant it was likely banks would prioritise legal action in order to hit their targets.  We made it clear that we were not including anything in our targets that related simply to sending a threatening letter.  The figures we gave related to cases where lawyers had actually been appointed.  We were talking about a formal commencement of the legal process.  We gave a figure of some 4,300 cases where the legal process had commenced, and I recall indicating to the committee that I did not expect that number to rise significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">That has not been the case. The number has remained broadly flat. By comparison, in our first mortgage arrears target regime submission on long term payments we outlined that we had approximately 2,061 long term arrangements in place. This has risen to more than 5,200 since then. Again, as I stated on the last occasion I appeared before the committee, we expect to see a dramatic shift towards long term solutions rather than further legal action.</p>

We hold the view that once they re-engage we can put in place solutions that will enable the vast majority of them to remain in their homes.  This is evidenced by the results of our process.  Ultimately, there will be a small minority of property repossessions, in respect of which there may be elements of debt outstanding.  We will look at how we propose to treat that debt at that stage.

I would like to take up where the Chairman left off.  In terms of the statistics provided, the fact that 30% of the bank's mortgage customers who are in arrears of 90 days or more are in the formal legal repossession zone strikes me as an incredibly tough approach on the part of the bank.  It will send shivers down the spine of many people to hear that despite the improvement in the number of people who are co-operating with the bank three in every ten, or 30%, of people in arrears of 90 days or more are now in the formal legal repossession zone.  This is evidence of a get tough approach by the banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">We do have a process in place to deal with customers who are in arrears.  That process is working.  In terms of those 90 days in arrears, 2,500 people previously in arrears are no longer in arrears.  There are 5,000 people who were in arrears of some sort who are now also no longer in arrears.  It is clear that where customers do engage with us we can put in place a solution to work through their issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">  There is an element of customers, approximately 4,000, who have not engaged with us at all despite our trying to contact them.  Following failed repeated attempts to engage with them, we instigated the legal process.  As I mentioned earlier, it is not our intent to repossess 4,000 houses.  Our intent is to get people to engage with us in putting in place solutions.</p>

When the point is reached whereby over an extended period no repayment has been made and there has been no response to any letters or phone calls and, on occasions when we have sent an experienced adviser to the property, no response in that regard, we then have few options open to us.  I would point out that we made a clear commitment that we will have an Ulster Bank representative at every court hearing so that if the customer does present there is an opportunity to engage with him or her and discuss the options in terms of recommencement of meaningful payments.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">Very few have at this stage reached formal hearing.  In terms of how the court process operates, we first get a listing date and then a first hearing.  It is almost inevitable that the first hearing will be adjourned.  It has been our experience to date that the second hearing is also adjourned.  We are now awaiting a third hearing in most of the cases concerned.  We are not as yet very far down the legal path at this stage.  We are waiting for third hearings, which we expect will happen in quarters 2 and 3.</p>

However, this is mainly a reminder of the process and the fact that we have no option but to move down that track.

          <p eId="para_88">It is incredible that approximately 6,500 of the bank's 14,000 customers in mortgage arrears are essentially in the legal realm.  In launching the mortgage arrears targets programme the Central Bank and the Government hoped to generate some action.  I am not sure this is the type of action they envisaged.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">The magnitude of the issue is reflective of the problem that exists with mortgage arrears generally.  The size of the mortgage arrears problem is considerable.  A number of issues arose around the process in terms of banks getting up to speed in handling the issue.  We are now on top of that.  Other issues that arose around the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, and the Dunne ruling, which impacted the process, have also been addressed.  Through all of that there was a significant increase in arrears.  From our perspective we expect that the arrears will decline over time.  As mentioned, there is a significant group of customers who have not made any repayments at all for up to two years or longer and refuse to engage with us.  The only route available to us in this regard is the court process.  As mentioned, it is not our intention to repossess.  We would rather have the customer in financial distress engage with us so that we can put in place a solution, as we have done for other customers previously in arrears but now up to date.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">When one looks at the figures, it is frightening that somewhere approaching 50% of the bank's mortgage arrears cases are heading down, or are already well advanced down, the legal route.  It begs the question as to what efforts have been made to prevent them from getting that far.  Mr. Bell is putting forward the justification that many of these people have not engaged at all, and they have stopped making any repayments on their mortgages, but it is an incredibly high figure.  Would many of these people have had other offers of sustainable solutions from the bank thus far?  Or would this be the first offer as such?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_64">
          <from> Mr. Stephen Bell<recordedTime time="2014-04-08T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_95">No.  We tried not to consider legal action as an offer, as such.  It is more a consequence of a failure to take advantage of an offer.  It is absolutely not in our interest or our preference to go down the repossession route.  When we appeared before this committee previously we said that the mortgage arrears target regime had some extraordinarily swingeing penalties for banks that did not meet them.  As a consequence of that, it was always going to be inevitable that banks would do those things that allowed them to hit the targets.  The only incontrovertible way of hitting the targets in that early stage was by taking legal action because everything was subject to subsequent review by the Central Bank and its auditors.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">  We commenced legal action in about 4,300 cases beyond the threatening letter.  That number has not changed since we last appeared before this committee.  We have increased by over 60% the number of long-term arrangements we have put in place with our customers.  We have now narrowed down to around 2,300 those customers that still are not in some kind of arrangement or meaningfully engaging with us.  We think that is making reasonable progress.  Alongside that we have taken 2,500 families out of serious arrears.  </p>
          <p eId="para_97">  This is going to be a longer process because we effectively had a two-year hiatus where we could not do anything very much.  That was because under the CCMA, contact was restricted and under the Dunne ruling the threat of consequences had disappeared.  In a multi-debt environment, which is what Mr. Brown referred to as part of his opening remarks, this is not purely a mortgage issue - this is a personal indebtedness issue.  When credit card lenders, credit unions and unsecured lenders can continue to pressure customers to pay, but mortgage lenders cannot, it does create an uneven playing field.  I am afraid this is an element of catch-up as we try to get back to a normal position. </p>

          <p eId="para_98">In light of what Mr. Bell has said, does the bank have individual cases on its books where it has ended up issuing a threatening legal letter or ended up taking them to court because of the pressure to meet certain targets as issued by the Central Bank?  In a sense, Mr. Bell is blaming the Central Bank targets for these outcomes because Ulster Bank has been under pressure to meet targets and avoid stringent financial penalties.  That seems to be what Mr. Bell is saying.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">There is an element of that.  I would also say that there has been a two-year period where one could not take the normal action one would take in any other market - I have worked in a number of other jurisdictions.  There has also been the inability to contact one's own customers to talk to them openly about alternative solutions, with a recognition that while it is in nobody's interest to take repossession action, it is a legitimate threat.  All this has let this bubble move further down the pipe than we all might have liked.  Therefore, I am not saying that it is entirely down to the Central Bank, not at all.  It was a factor but the main factor was a two-year period in which we were able to do very little to approach our customers and help to resolve the situation with them.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">I would like to add to that.  In my opening statement I mentioned that we need to meet the targets.  However, our focus through this whole issue has been on doing the right thing for our customers.  At the committee's request, we have reported the numbers we sent to the Central Bank showing the various initiatives that we have got in place.  One of the other key things we have focused on is ensuring that we address the early arrears issues to stop people getting into arrears in the first place.  In the numbers we have given to the committee, members will also see on the right-hand side the total forbearance arrangements that we have made.  Many of those are in early arrears and relatively short-term arrangements, maybe for short-term unemployment or something like that.  The focus, however, has been on trying to stop arrears becoming a more serious issue for us to deal with as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">It is important to point out that we were the first to introduce tracker porting back in March 2011.  Over and above all other banks we saw the requirement.  There was a stalemate in the market because people had a very affordable tracker and consequently felt they could not trade up and move home.  Many such people were in apartments with children and needed to move to a three or four-bedroom home.  That situation has now moved on so that those in negative equity can also trade up whether or not they are on a tracker.  That facilitates people to move on up to a level of an LTV of about 200%.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">  The product has its own key features and I can go into as much detail as the committee wishes.  It is early days in terms of the enhancement of negative equity.  The number of applications is still light but it is gaining traction.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">I wish to welcome Mr. Brown and his colleagues here today.  Paragraph 7 of Mr. Brown's opening statement concerns the issue of writing off or writing down mortgage debt.  Some of Ulster Bank's competitors are now writing down and writing off debt.  I am interested in some of the language used and have three quick questions about it.  Mr. Brown said he does not write off debt.  Is that just mortgage debt?  In the second page he stated that the mortgage has to be seen as a priority over other unsecured loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">  When Mr. Brown says that write-offs and write-downs are an unhelpful distraction, he is talking about AIB.  Is AIB's policy an unhelpful distraction because it is writing down and writing off debt?</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The representatives of the bank maintain that write-off is likely to create issues around moral hazard and fair outcomes for customers. Are they really suggesting that it would be a problem for some of the bank's customers if the bank wrote off some of their debts? How can the bank possibly justify that?</p>
        </speech>

          <p eId="para_126">I will take those three questions.  We will postpone or write down non-mortgage debt to allow the customer to remain in his property to maximise what he can afford to allocate towards his mortgage.  Along with all the other the banks in Ireland we have agreed with the general principle that unsecured debt should be de-prioritised to enable the customer to focus on mortgage payments.  That has been agreed between all the principal banks due to appear before the committee as part of this session.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">  Reference was made to our view on write-offs not being helpful.  We are not commenting on any particular institution but we believe that solutions must be effective.  This remains a major issue and involves many thousands of customers.  Spending too much time talking about solutions that can only really be applied to a small number of customers, numbering in the hundreds, does not really solve the problem.  It is something of a distraction from the real issue, which is how we help the tens of thousands of customers who are still struggling to get back onto a level playing field.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">  There is a question for us around moral hazard.  I have no wish to personalise this in any way, shape or form.  Let us consider one example that received a reasonable amount of coverage in the press.  Let us suppose the mortgage is written down to what happens to be the indexed value of the property today.  We know that property prices will increase over time.  We know property prices have increased in Dublin by 12% or 13% in the past 12 months.  It is likely, therefore, that over the remaining term of the customer's mortgage the customer will receive a windfall gain at the gift of the State or the State and banks because the customer will have positive equity building up on a debt that was written down for no obvious reason.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">That is reasonable and gets us back to negative equity and those other arguments.  Mr. Bell has put a good deal of focus on sustainability.  Can we not accept it is necessary for some people who are engaging with the bank?  Mr. Bell referenced people who are not engaging and clearly there are people who are not engaging.  As a politician, I know the people who engage do far better than those who do not engage.  However, there must be some people with whom the bank is engaging and who engage very well for whom a sustainable solution - Mr. Bell referred to sustainable solutions - must include the reality that they cannot afford all of their mortgage and never will.  Therefore, the only sustainable element must include some form of write-off or write-down.  Some of the other banks have accepted this.  Does Mr. Bell not accept it?</p>

          <p eId="para_132">Mr. Brown may wish to come back on this point, but we do not accept this.  We have developed a split mortgage product to allow an interest rate of zero for the amount that is not affordable to be warehoused in future.  It seems wholly inappropriate to me to write down a debt to what happens to be an indexed valuation today and then see the value of the property grow over time.  In that case, the only person to gain is the person who was given the gift of largesse from the bank concerned.</p>

They have got a solution in place that keeps them viable without any write-down of the debt.  For us, it is all about affordability and ensuring that we can keep customers in their home.  We do it in such a way that is affordable as well.</p>

That is capital and it is in the bank.

Based on the conversations we have had up to now the bank representatives have suggested that it will only move legally on a person who has not engaged or made any payments towards the mortgage for a period in excess of two years.  Does that apply to each of those 136 people?  On that basis, can I assume all of those people did not receive an offer of some form from Ulster Bank?</p>

          <p eId="para_151">There were no evictions as such.  They were all either voluntary surrenders or vacant properties when the sheriff or bailiff approached to secure possession.  No one was forcibly removed from his property among the 130.  They are the longest of arrears cases in which we have tried absolutely everything to engage with the customers.  It is a matter of considerable regret to us that in some of the cases that are going through the legal system at the moment, the last payment we received was in 2007.  These are extraordinarily long cases whereby the court process has run for such a long period that the eventual losses to both the customer and the bank have escalated beyond all recognition.  These customers would have been provided with every possible opportunity to engage with us and reach an alternative solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I wish to tease that out.  I was not trying to be smart when I was referring to evictions because repossessions are disturbing regardless of whether they are voluntary.  We can be sure that voluntary means something different from the defined term or what it means in the real world than for the people concerned.  These people took the view when they voluntarily gave back their keys to the bank that they had no other choice.  This is what I want to get to the root of.  There is always another choice.  What were the alternative options that the bank would have given these people?  Although some of these people may not have paid the bank since 2007 the position is that someone needs to be offered a sustainable solution.  In the absence of being able to afford that sustainable solution, then and perhaps only then a legal route is something that can be embarked upon.  The representatives of the bank seem to be indicating that there was nothing really on offer to these people other than the fact that they had not paid the bank or engaged.  That is what I am asking.  What did the bank offer these people other than volunteering or giving their keys back?</p>

We would never go to that stage of the process without having tried every possible means, whether by telephone, by text, home visit or letters, that is, every means possible.  We are unable to offer a solution to a customer who will not speak to us.  Therefore, if we get to that end of the process, the court order will not have been granted unless not only we were satisfied that every option had been exhausted but the court was satisfied that every option had been exhausted as well.</p>

One assumes a person who reaches that point will have exhausted all available options.  In how many of the 136 cases - or 123 cases if one wishes to split hairs - were split mortgages or mortgage-to-rent arrangements offered?

          <p eId="para_180">I will add one thing.  Under the mortgage arrears resolution process, all customers have the right to appeal if they believe the decision made is incorrect.  That process will also have been exhausted before the 123 cases concluded.  To put that figure in context, it is less than 0.5% of the total number of people in arrears of more than 90 days.  It is not a significant number of people given that it accounts for less than 0.5% of customers.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">I welcome representatives of Ulster Bank to the meeting.  I also welcome the news that the bank will continue to operate as a financial institution on the island of Ireland.  That is as far as my welcome extends.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">  The focus of the meeting is mortgage arrears target, although other issues arise regarding Ulster Bank.  I corresponded with Mr. Brown who asked his public relations staff to respond to my correspondence.  The response I received did not answer any of my questions on the global restructuring group which is forcing viable businesses to sell assets.  This group is the bank's internal bad bank, as it were.  The issue of bank closures, which is also coming down the line, was not addressed either.  I ask Mr. Brown to respond to these questions if possible.  </p>
          <p eId="para_188">  To focus on mortgage arrears, Ulster Bank has proudly stated that it does not write off mortgage debt and has not vetoed any protective certificates.  I presume the bank will write off mortgage debt in a personal insolvency arrangement.  </p>

          <p eId="para_189">With regard to personal insolvency arrangements or, for that matter, any mortgage debt or unsecured debt, our view is that there is an affordable solution in the vast majority of cases where the customer adjusts his or her costs of living.  We come to an arrangement on the unsecured debt and then put in place a solution with regard to how the mortgage is treated.  Invariably, this does not involve writing down a mortgage.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I will put the question again.  Mr. Brown should note that a report issued in recent days by the Insolvency Service of Ireland states that, on average, personal insolvency arrangements propose a write-off of 19% of secured debt, with the figure ranging from 0% to 39%.  The service, therefore, informs us that, under the proposals Ulster Bank boldly claims it is not vetoing, an average of 19% of secured debt will be written off.  I ask Mr. Brown for clarification on this matter.  In cases in which Ulster Bank is one of the creditors, will it stick to its position that it does not write off mortgage debt, given that, on average, the personal insolvency arrangements propose to write off 19% of secured debt?</p>

          <p eId="para_193">Sorry, as there is a time limit, I will ask a simple question for the third time.  Ulster Bank has made the bold statement that it does not write off mortgage debt, in other words, secured debt.  The bank has a veto over personal insolvency arrangements.  Given that these arrangements will, on average, propose the writing off of 19% of secured debt, will Ulster Bank stick to its position, as restated by the chief executive, Mr. Brown, that it will not write off mortgage debt?  If that is the case, Ulster Bank will veto personal insolvency arrangement proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">We have not yet seen any situation where that would even be relevant.  In the case of the typical customer in arrears, for every €1 of mortgage repayment, there is €60 of unsecured debt repayments.  On the basis that unsecured debt is unsecured and must be the first casualty of any personal restructuring, we have not see any situation yet, given that the average balance with which we are dealing is relatively small, where any kind of write-off would be in any way appropriate.</p>

Last September, the bank reported that in respect of the second quarter of last year, there were 143 sets of legal proceedings in respect of mortgage arrears resolution targets.

          <p eId="para_239">The Minister for Finance echoed those comments earlier when he said, "I have informed the Deputy previously that letters threatening repossession or legal action could not in my opinion be considered a sustainable solution under the mortgage arrears targets".  The Minister is saying that letters threatening repossession or legal action should not be included because it was never the spirit of the targets that they be included.  While the text of the targets says that it is allowed for them to be included, it is to be noted that 52% of the sustainable offers that have been presented by Ulster Bank, as a financial institution, have amounted to threats of legal proceedings or indeed legal proceedings.  In that context, is it not the case that Ulster Bank has basically stuck it to the Minister for Finance?</p>

          <p eId="para_240">If the Deputy wants a clarification of the interpretation of the Central Bank's own guidance, perhaps he should address that to the Central Bank.

          <p eId="para_241">I would like to add to that.  The key thing is that our focus has been on coming up with solutions that address arrears issues and keep people in their homes.  As I said in my opening statement, there has been a decrease of 2,500 in the number of people who are in arrears of 90 days or more.  Over the last 12 months, there has been a decrease of 5,000 in the number of customers who are in any sort of arrears.  We have solutions that we have put in place and are working.  The number of people in arrears is evidence of that.  We have put in place a number of pre-emptive solutions to stop the situation from getting worse and prevent people from getting into arrears of 90 days or more.  A number of customers have not engaged with us at all over an extended period of time.  There are just two ways to resolve that - through the court process or by getting the customer to engage.  If they do not engage, the court process is the only avenue open to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">As I have already said, there have been legal proceedings or the threat of legal proceedings in 5,810 cases.  The bank wants to present it in one way.  I am presenting it in another way.  I am just asking for confirmation that the bank has initiated legal proceedings against people and their families who have engaged with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">There is a combination of answers to that question.  I am trying to answer it directly.  Engagement can mean many things.  If somebody offers to pay €50 a month towards a monthly mortgage payment of €500, they are technically engaging but it is not meaningful engagement.  It is not a meaningful offer of any kind of payment.  We are trying to work with customers over a medium-term period.  As I said to the Chair in response to an earlier question, we are not looking to repossess anybody's house.  It appears that we have a group of customers who will not take this matter seriously until that threat is put in front of them.  This time last year less than 10% of customers responded when we threatened legal action, but now almost half of all customers are responding.  We think that is a very positive move.  It is a shame it has taken legal action to make it happen.  We think it is very positive that we are finally getting-----</p>

          <p eId="para_250">I suggest that the bank is issuing legal proceedings against people who have engaged with it.  To put it simply, there is a certain cohort of people who are not in a position to repay to Ulster Bank huge amounts of money that the bank lent to them but they should probably never have got.  The bank has looked at sustainable solutions.  We can deal with the sustainable solutions.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">I will go through the numbers with regard to sustainable solutions.  There are four columns, the first of which relates to term extension.  The majority of these cases - almost 4,000 of them - involve arrears capitalisation, to which the second column relates.  The other two columns relate to a number of other smaller items which seem to involve normal repayments.  Most of these people would have come out of arrears without the help of Ulster Bank.  It should be offering the range of solutions that are stipulated by the Central Bank.  Ulster Bank does not offer the majority of those solutions, including debt write-down, debt for equity and mortgage to rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">These solutions are not being dealt with by Ulster Bank. Ulster Bank is very clearly trying to squeeze the last cent out of customers who, through their own fault in some cases, borrowed excessively. However, there was a culture in which Ulster Bank was engaged which encouraged people and touted the idea of 100% mortgages. Ulster Bank led people up that merry path and when they are there, in 52% of cases, the option the bank chooses is to take them to court.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">One of the reasons that we showed the total forbearance arrangements on the template here is to highlight the fact that we are offering a wide range of options to customers in arrears before they get into 90 days which are not captured by the Central Bank statistics.  Members can also see that in terms of solutions we have put in place such as the economic concessions and so on, we have put in place a considerable number of options other than those we report to the Central Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">I will be brief.  The witnesses have furnished us with a number of figures.  They indicated that 980 are interest-only mortgages.  How many of those interest-only mortgages are in positive equity?</p>

We would provide interest-only mortgages for buy-to-let situations where the rent being collected on the property is sufficient to cover the interest but not the principal and interest and it seems inappropriate to take further action in those instances.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">The other thing is that the mortgage arrears issue is not an issue of positive or negative equity.  The issue is around affordability.  In general, people who have got into arrears have had issues with employment or lost their jobs.  In such situations, putting in place an arrangement such as a temporary interest-only facility may be the right approach.  Alternatively, they may have had a reduction in income as well.  It is not positive or negative equity that determines whether someone has the affordability to live in a home.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">The key here is that some people do have other debt with us.  We offer personal loans, credit cards and so on.  The larger issue is that on average, as Mr. Bell mentioned earlier, for every euro that someone is paying us in mortgage payments every month, they are also paying 60 cent towards the unsecured debt.  Generally speaking, the amount of unsecured debt is relatively small and the loan is being paid off over a relatively short period and generally at a higher interest rate.  Our view is that if one manages an arrangement as to how to treat the unsecured debt, generally the mortgage situation is affordable.  If the mortgage situation is not affordable even then, we can put one of the arrangements about which we spoke earlier in place that will deem the mortgage affordable in the long run.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">We found that we had a significant issue in terms of the right of increase in mortgage arrears and that as a consequence we needed to have a significantly high number of collectors in place who could reach out and call our customers.  We found that because a crisis like this one had not existed in the Republic, it was very difficult if not impossible to get experienced collectors in the market.  We looked at areas where we might be able to get collectors.  As it happened there was a pool of available collectors in Edinburgh, generally people who had four or five years of experience and who know how to deal with customers in arrears.  The management had generally five to ten years experience so we made a decision that we would set a system for early arrears in Edinburgh.  This was primarily driven by getting people who had experience in handling mortgage arrears so that they knew how to handle our customers correctly.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">  Generally speaking mortgages that are 90 days or more in arrears are handled in the Republic.  We have 50 people on the ground in our network who deal with the more significant mortgage arrears.</p>

          <p eId="para_327">So it is not the case of creating a situation where there is much less empathy for the householder who is in difficulty with arrears by putting it at such a distance from the country?  These people are much more removed from the daily circumstances of life in Ireland.  Is that not putting people who want to talk to the bank about problems at a significant disadvantage?</p>

          <p eId="para_328">I would argue that it is the complete opposite.  We have people who have vast experience in handling customers who have mortgage arrears problems.  I think the results show it is working, the fact that 2,500 customers who were in arrears of 90 days or more, and 5,500 who had arrears at all are no longer in arrears.  I think a considerable part of that is as a result of having those experienced people but also as a result of the bank having the solutions in place that we have discussed earlier.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">Very few at this stage.  The approach we decided to take last year was to work with the customer if he or she was able to maintain the repayments, and if he or she was not able to do so, we would appoint a rent receiver who made a commitment that we would not terminate tenancies in buy-to-let properties but we would wait until the tenancy had expired.

          <p eId="para_331">When this situation arises for tenants, it puts them in a very vulnerable position.  There is increasing stress among tenants of landlords who are dealing with Ulster Bank and other banks.  How does Ulster Bank treat the tenants and does it given them a guarantee or solace in regard to the stressful position?  In a situation, in which receivers are being appointed to properties, the tenants are in a dreadful situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">One of the reasons that we commissioned the research on the cost of rental properties versus mortgages is because clearly having a home that one owns through a mortgage gives one more security of tenure than one could ever have living in a private rented property.  Where a customer is a tenant of a buy-to-let customer, we only have part of the relationship; it is not our primary relationship with the customer but we would not seek to terminate the tenancy early when the underlying buy-to-let borrower was in distress with us.  That is not our position.</p>

          <p eId="para_334">In the case of an owner-occupier, when there is what the bank calls a voluntary agreement to sell, then the property is sold at the current market rate.  Why then does the bank adopt the arrogant stance of not looking at a general write-down to today's value when in fact that is what happens in individual cases?  Can the bank not be part of a general national solution with other banks to try to sort out the mess once and for all?</p>

We have solutions in place and customers are engaging with us and as a consequence we have fewer customers in arrears than we did before.  We also have viable arrangements in place for many of those customers who are in arrears.  From my perspective what we are doing is working.  We still have a long way to go.  While it may have come down by 2,500 for those more than 90 days in arrears, we still have another 14,000 cases to work through, but we have the solution, the people and the processes in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">Why does the bank adopt this position with regard to the unfortunate victims of the blackmail, profiteering and speculation that was occurring in the property market given that it was, according to the <i>Financial Times</i>, subject to the biggest bailout in history at one stage?

          <p eId="para_345">The issue is not one of negative equity.  The mortgage arrears issue is an affordability issue.  Either people's incomes have been affected through employment or they have had a reduction in income, and that is the problem we are trying to address.  The solutions that have been put in place, and the way we are handling them, deal with this.  Hence, we have been seeing the number in arrears fall, quarter on quarter, for the past 12 months.  It has nothing to do with negative equity; it is about affordability.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">I do not believe that is correct.  We provided facilities for customers so they could own their own homes in their entirety at the end of the mortgage terms.  That is still our intention.  At the end of the term, the house will be worth what it is worth; it has nothing to do with the affordability of the loan in the interim, during which we will help the mortgage holder to the fullest of our ability.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I want to ask about buy-to-let arrangements and tenants in cases of receivership.  While the set of problems concerning those who took out mortgages to buy their own homes has been highlighted, the plight of tenants who pay rent and have a reasonable expectation of security of tenure has not been highlighted to any great extent over the past year or two.  They find that because their landlord has gone bust, receivers move in and tell them they must leave, in many cases at very short notice.  This presents a big problem, particularly for families with children.  In the current market, it is very difficult in many cases to obtain alternative accommodation.  What is the attitude of the delegation to this?  The delegates said they will let the leases run.  Leases will have expired in many cases.  Typically in the private rental sector, one gets a one-year lease in the first year and no lease at all after that.  When the delegates say they let leases expire, does this mean, in reality, that people get a month’s or two months' notice in many cases when the banks' receivers move in?</p>

          <p eId="para_349">We can talk about this in a little more detail.  We proceed on a case-by-case basis.  First, we have started appointing rent receivers only over the past 12 months.  The reason is twofold.  One aspect concerns where the mortgages were not being paid.  Cash may have been received on the properties but was not being paid to the bank.  Second, in many cases the properties were falling into disrepair.  Therefore, putting a rent receiver in place allowed us to deal with that.  We are very conscious of the impact it could have on tenants.  Hence, we proceed on a case-by-case, lease-by-lease basis, as Mr. Bell mentioned.  I do not know whether Mr. Bell wants to elaborate on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">Basically, as far as the bank is concerned, the criterion is the lease.  Could the delegates tell me a little more?  If I am reading the figures correctly, 2,675 buy-to-let properties are in arrears.  I calculate that in the case of 1,600 of these, letters have been issued relating to rent-receiver or legal proceedings of some kind.  This amounts to two thirds of the buy-to-let properties.  The tenants could face the possibility of eviction relatively soon.</p>

          <p eId="para_352">We work through it with the tenants.  It is not in our interest to have a vacant property that must be sold at auction prices in the current market.  Therefore, we always seek to work with the rent receiver to find the best outcome for the tenant and the property.  We have an obligation to the underlying borrower to minimise the loss that might be faced in case we need to pursue them for any residue.  We would be seeking to be as flexible as we could.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">That is what I want to clarify.  I am dealing with cases on this issue.  I cannot recall whether any of them deal with Ulster Bank.  It is a pity I did not check before coming here today.  The people I am dealing with receive a letter telling them rent receivers are taking over and that they are out.  Under the residential tenancies legislation, there is supposed to be a four-year cycle once one is a tenant for six months, I believe.  The bank should have to honour that.  The banks can get around it by saying they are going to sell the property.  What is the attitude of Ulster Bank in such circumstances?  I want to hear that the bank's attitude is such that tenants will not be turfed out if they have nowhere else to go.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">I do not recall seeing any cases concerning Ulster Bank.  If the Deputy has some, I will be happy to examine them.  We are acutely aware of the issue.  As Mr. Bell has stated, it is in our interest to keep the tenant in a property when it makes sense to do so.  However, we still have an obligation towards the individual who borrowed the money in the first instance.  There is a fine balance in getting the two approaches right.  It it not our intent to evict either owner occupiers or tenants.</p>

Are these the individuals who are facing voluntary surrender or legal proceedings, or is the bank doing deals for the unemployed?</p>

          <p eId="para_360">There is a mix.  Mr. Bell might want to comment on the specifics.  The reality is that, even for someone who is unemployed, there is a cost associated with living in the home, be it assistance from the State or some other arrangement.  Generally, the arrangements we have in place, be they long-term or short-term, are such that we have a solution whereby an unemployed person can remain in his or her accommodation.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">I agree. Unemployment can be many things.  We have customers who are contract workers who go through a period of one, two or three months of unemployment between contracts.  Their circumstances are very different from those of the long-term unemployed.  We still try to work with those in long-term unemployment so that whatever income they have can be made appropriate for the mortgage they are servicing.  If they cannot pay, or if it is just not possible, we need to be mindful of that.  Not all mortgage arrears customers, even those in very serious arrears, are eligible for social housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">If they are engaging.  The other key issue is the magnitude of the debt.  If somebody is unemployed and living in a house worth €1 million or €2 million, it would not be unreasonable for us to expect him to sell it.  However, if he is unemployed for a short period, we believe we have a solution available that will keep him in his home.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">Riddle me this case.  The sum of €250,000 is the cost of an average house in my part of Cork, and the same applies to most parts of the country, with Dublin being the exception.  Let us say someone buys a house for €250,000 but he or she has €50,000 in unsecured debt.  Ulster Bank puts the house on the market and sells it for €150,000 - which is what it is probably worth now - but there is €50,000 in unsecured debt left and, lo and behold, now there is also €100,000 of unsecured debt which Ulster Bank will probably write off.  This situation is where I see the bank's veto working very effectively.  Would it not make more sense, given personal insolvency arrangements and the way the bank's veto works, if it wrote off the €100,000 rather than sell the house?  If the bank turned it into unsecured debt, it would be left with 65% of €100,000.  Let me reiterate that there is €150,000 in unsecured debt.  Therefore, the person is in a performing mortgage because the bank is going to sell the house for €150,000 and there is €150,000 of unsecured debt.  In that instance the bank is in the driving seat because it has the veto.  It can wipe out all the unsecured debt and turn the customer into a functioning one who can pay a debt of €150,000.  Why is the bank not doing this?</p>

          <p eId="para_385">The unsecured amount.  Two thirds of unsecured debt is bank debt anyway, but we would say it could be written off.  If the Chairman looks at our economic concession of 0.5%, for example, then the €200,000 mortgage would only be €1,000 a year in payments.  Even if one put a bit of principal on it, the figure might reach €2,000 or €3,000.  We think it is far better to keep the person in his or her home, write off some or all of the unsecured debt and, as we have outlined here, put a solution in place that will resolve the issue.  Therefore, one does not need to write down any of the mortgage debt and the customer does not need to lose his or her home.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">It came from RBS.  Ultimately it came from UK taxpayers to RBS and, as we made losses, £15 billion or around €18 billion was put into Ulster Bank.  The Deputy is correct.</p>

          <p eId="para_397">I do not believe that it is doing write-offs but I will double check that to be sure.  To be clear, the £15 billion or €18 billion was injected into Ulster Bank to cover the losses we had incurred.  It was not to arbitrarily carry out more write-offs, write-downs or anything like that.  It was to cover the losses we had incurred.</p>

I can tell the Deputy that it was 16,247 at the end of March 2013, so it has fallen by about 2,016.

          <p eId="para_405">Broadly speaking, as Mr. Brown said in answer to an earlier question, around 50% to 60% of the portfolio has some form of negative equity at this stage.  That can vary from a relatively modest amount to reasonably large numbers.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">I presume that situation would be classified as a risky loan on the balance sheet of Ulster Bank beforehand.  At the moment this matter has cropped up as an issue across the mortgage loan book.  I would use the term "paradox of positive equity" whereby people in positive equity are at times more vulnerable than people in negative equity.  I do not mean they are vulnerable in terms of their homes.  There is commonality because they are vulnerable at the time of bank repossession and assisted voluntary sales.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">  I will explain the situation.  The banks have issues in terms of their capital ratio requirements, provisions, stress tests, etc.  What happens if a bank has a loan that is in arrears for more than 90 days and climbing?  Obviously it will be classified on a risk weighted basis within the institution.  Let us consider what happens if the asset is realised and the loan has gone off the bank's books.  Am I correct to say that scenario will improve the capital ratio requirement of the individual institution?</p>

          <p eId="para_426">I am not saying anything about that.  I made a straightforward point.  This matter has arisen for all institutions.  We deal with the public like banks do but in a different capacity.  A worrying feature has arisen.  There is a danger that the banks are becoming bloodhounds for positive equity within loans.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">I have major concerns about the paradox of positive equity.  Ultimately, from a financial perspective, the bank gains from moving on properties, homes in particular that are in arrears for more than 90 days.  It benefits the balance sheet far more significantly than moving on property loans that are in negative equity.  I would like to hear the banks elaborate on the procedures that are in place to ensure that there is parity of treatment.  Our objective is to keep people in their homes.  I have no doubt that it is the objective of Ulster Bank as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">In regard to our earlier request for further information, I will follow on from Deputy O'Donnell's request for a breakdown of the legal proceedings in respect of properties in both positive and negative equity.  Ulster Bank is doing debt write-down but it is doing it at the unsecured stage, which is at the post-voluntary surrender or post-repossession stage.  Whether the customer is in positive or negative equity, what I am hearing is that the philosophy is that debt write-down will only be given on the basis that the bank gets the house.  The colourful phrase is that the pound of flesh for the write-down is that the banks gets the bricks and mortar.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">That is not a particularly fair characterisation of our approach.  We have a range of solutions which we can make available to customers, which in almost every case would make the cost of staying in the property less than renting a comparable property.  In that instance we see no logic in writing down an arbitrary amount of money, leaving the customer in the property, who would over time benefit from capital appreciation on a written down debt.  This seems to be a completely unnecessary step when we have all the other tools in our armoury to solve the problem by very different ways.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">It is important to point out that we employed 200 people or thereabouts in Scotland because the pool of experienced collectors available in the Republic was small.  The people we have employed generally have four to five years of experience and know how to handle discussions with people who are in financial arrears.  As a result and alongside the solutions that were put in place, we have seen a significant reduction in arrears in the past 12 months.  Having an operation in Edinburgh has played an important role in that regard.  Those 200 people are only handling early arrears of up to 90 days.  The people on the ground in the Republic handle the longer-term arrears.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">When Ulster Bank makes a restructuring offer, does it offer choices between two or three that might work for the customer or does it offer just one option?  When it offers choices or a single option, does it also offer an explanation in writing as to why it has decided on those?</p>

          <p eId="para_505">There are two aspects to that issue.  We would never offer a single solution, as it is important the customer is able to consider various options.  The offers of an economic concession and split mortgage often go hand in hand in terms of which makes most sense to the customer.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">  For anything that involves a longer-term solution, that is, longer than 36 months, we support the scheme whereby customers can take independent advice at our expense in order that they might be satisfied they are making the right choice.  We are keen not to steer people towards particular outcomes, but instead to let them see the range of options.  In the event a customer believes the option we offer is not right, he or she has a right of appeal through the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP.  This often results in us reconsidering, if appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">We typically have that dialogue by telephone.  A key element of our approach is to try to do as much as we can there and then with the customer over the telephone.  Being in arrears is a stressful experience.  An endless exchange of correspondence over numerous weeks while the customer is asked to gather up proofs, utility bills and bank statements is not the right answer.  We would have an open dialogue with the customer.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">In order to provide protection to the customers we have got full call recording capability in all of our sites so if there is a dispute, we can play back the details and ensure we were as transparent as we hope to be.</p>

          <p eId="para_513">My final question refers back to the example the Chairman raised and the question asked by Deputy Doherty.  The Chairman made the point that the bank will potentially write-down a substantial amount of debt once it has been re-categorised from mortgage debt to unsecured debt as part of a residual.  The example given was that the person owes €250,000, he or she  cannot afford to pay so the house is sold for €150,000, leaving a residual amount of €100,000 which Ulster Bank might then say it will write off as unsecured debt.  If I understand the answer to that correctly, the witness said he could not foresee a situation in which that would have to happen, because there is a range of solutions available to keep them in the house.  Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_514">Yes.  Our average mortgage is €164,000, so we are not talking about €250,000 or €300,000 situations.  The average amount of unsecured credit that our customers who are in arrears are carrying is approximately €11,500, but the cost of that is at a much higher, much more profitable interest rate for the unsecured lenders over a much shorter period.  The unsecured credit is usually what creates the financial pinch point for the customers.  In all the situations we have seen so far, by dealing with the unsecured credit and taking that burden away from the customer our share of restructuring the remaining debt does not require any write-down.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I wish to pick up on something Deputy O'Donnell mentioned, the balance sheet repair that the institutions are undertaking.  The problem that has arisen for everybody across the markets, not just Ulster Bank, is due to the creation of credit by the abandonment of fractional reserving.  Ulster Bank is part of RBS Group and in 2008 RBS Group, if one ignored ABN AMRO, which had a good balance sheet, had loans-to-customer deposits ratios of 135%.  That is 45% above the safety level of 90% for prudential lending and responsible bank board operation.  Forty-five per cent as a proportion of 90% is 50%.  When Ulster Bank is in a sector of banks where the average loans-to-deposits ratio was 173%, with an abandonment over seven years of fractional reserving, absolutely reckless balance sheet construction and creating an asset price bubble with the credit that had been gathered through the banking system, that bank is responsible for 50% of the asset price fall of assets bought with funds provided by the bank.  That is a fact mathematically.  In the case of Bank of Ireland, it is 75% responsible and accountable for the asset price fall of the assets that were bought with funds loaned by Bank of Ireland to its customers.  It is really a breathless, astonishing arrogance on the part of the sector to seek to collect 100% of the loans that created a mirage.  It was a bubble of air to which the customers are now long-term mortgage slaves.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">  In fact, let us consider the etymology of the word "mortgage".  "Mort" means death.  Normally it was death of the asset while the borrower was repaying the money so that the asset became his or hers at the end of the 25 years.  Now, because of those seven years of profligate and absolutely malfeasant lending by the boards of banks, the borrowers of that period find that they have no assets.  The only asset that they might have had after 25 years is likely never to be theirs.  The nonsense that is being peddled at the moment, that the property market is taking off, is absurd.  It is like saying that the stock market has gone up in value because 1% of the equity on the stock market has been traded at a temporarily high price.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">  This is where we must get real.  I do not like the language and terms such as "encourage meaningful re-engagement".  Let us get real about this.  The bank had a breakdown in its computer systems for three or four months but there was no engagement, even with people who had deposits or credit balances in their accounts.  This is unfair.  I am not asking for heads or scalps, just for fairness.  A total of 15,000 customers of the bank are in deep distress, mental depression and even facing death.  It is wrong.  I am asking all the witnesses to put it to their boards that they really wrecked this country.</p>

Basically, I am showing a contradiction between what the witness is saying and what the bank's staff are saying.  I accept the witness's answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_556">The situation is that we have had a split mortgage offer since the middle of last year.  What we found is that when we laid out the economic concession side by side with the split mortgage, as members can see from the numbers, the vast majority of customers preferred the economic concession because it allowed them to pay capital down quicker.  We have tried to look for other groups of customers because typically a split mortgage is more likely to be useful to those who are nearing the end of their term and we have now issued ---</p>

My point is that I do not see any reason why somebody who is in his or her early 70s, for example, which was the basis on which the case was offered, should not be entitled to some sort of mortgage.  We would not call up the mortgage and remove the person from his or her house just to meet the Central Bank criteria.  We will not do that.  If there is a specific issue with a specific case, I am more than happy to examine that.</p>

I accept that everything is dealt with on a case by case basis but I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank about this case.  The Central Bank gave me specific guidelines on age.  In certain conditions, if there was income to support it, a person might be let go to 70 or a little over but never over 80.  The proposal that Ulster Bank made, which it described as sustainable, actually contradicted and went against Central Bank guidelines.</p>

          <p eId="para_572">The issue in terms of guidelines is that if the customer is over 70, the loan is not deemed sustainable anyway.  What we will do is seek to put the right solution in place, regardless of the person's age, so that the loan is viable.  Just because someone has reached 70 years of age, in our view, does not mean that we should call up the loan or take legal action.</p>

For many customers, a short-term arrangement can be the permanent long-term solution if they only have a temporary issue.  If, for example, a customer contacts us to tell us that there has been a death in the family which has put strain on the household finances, we are very happy to put a six month moratorium in place.  That fixes the problem permanently even though it is a short-term solution.  There is a danger of misreading short-term solutions as being short-term fixes.</p>

Prudential guidelines or directions were given to the banks in July 2009 by the Central Bank.  The aim was that banks would move away from 35 to 40-year mortgages, that 100% mortgages would go by the way side and that lending ratios would revert to a more normal level, with LTVs put in place.  What is the new mortgage book at Ulster Bank like?  Is there demand in terms of applications?  What percentage of those applications is the bank approving?</p>

          <p eId="para_609">I have a question that is supplementary to the Chairman's excellent question.  I have more than 20 years of experience in the area of valuations going back to the 1980s and 1990s.  Valuations by so-called auctioneers and valuers in this country have been very wide of the embedded and true benchmark of the inverse yield value of a property.  As Mr. Brown said, people have to pay a rent for living no matter who owns the property.  If we take a four-bedroom semi-detached suburban house - in Stillorgan or Kilmacud, for example - the maximum rental value of which is €2,000 per month or €24,000 per year, a 7% yield will give a maximum value of €360,000.  It is because of the very small volume on the market at this time that prices have been bid up.  As Mr. Ryan said, the volume of lending went down last year.  The public perception is that prices are going up, but it is not a sustainable increase because it is not related to the inverse of rental yields.  A craziness in perceptions is beginning to take hold again.  Do the delegates agree there should be a brake applied at the level of 15 times maintainable rent?</p>

          <p eId="para_610">The way we look at it is that we are in the business of financing people to purchase a home over a period, which is generally 20 to 25 years.  The value the property trades at is the value of the transaction today.</p>

          <p eId="para_611">The value depends on credit, which is the point I want the delegates to take away.</p>

          <p eId="para_612">I understand that, but it is another reason we do not focus so much on positive or negative equity or price movements.  The key for us is affordability and ensuring the borrower who takes out a mortgage with us can sustain the payment over the life of the loan.  It is the reason we build in stress tests, buffers and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_613">However, valuation based on rental yield can be checked against the income of an owner-occupier in a similar house.  For instance, €70,000 per year times three is €210,000, and times three and a half gives €240,000.  These are the brakes that should be applied and they are very simple.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">I must bring the discussion to a conclusion.  I thank the witnesses for assisting the committee today.  This meeting is one of a series of engagements we are having in the coming days with representatives of the banks.  I appreciate the frankness and openness with which the delegates engaged with us and their commitment to provide any information that was not to hand.  I look forward to receiving that information in the coming days.</p>
