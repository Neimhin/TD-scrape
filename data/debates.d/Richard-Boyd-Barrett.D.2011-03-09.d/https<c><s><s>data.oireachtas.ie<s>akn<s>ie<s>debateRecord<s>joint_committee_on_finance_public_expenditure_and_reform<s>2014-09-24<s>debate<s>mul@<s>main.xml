        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from> Mr. Feargal Ó Brolcháin<recordedTime time="2014-09-24T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_20">The purpose of this legislation is to make provision for the inclusion by the European Security Mechanism, ESM, board of governors, in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty, of the ESM's direct recapitalisation instrument as one of the financial instruments envisaged under Articles 14 to 18 of the treaty.  This includes provision for the creation of subsidiary bodies which could be used to implement the direct recapitalisation instrument.  The legislation also incorporates the ESM treaty, as adapted following the accession of Latvia to the ESM on 13 March 2014, into the European Stability Mechanism Act 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">  The euro area member states reached a preliminary agreement on the operational framework of the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument, DRI, on 10 June 2014.  This includes the draft guideline on financial assistance for the direct recapitalisation of institutions, which set out how the DRI will operate.  This has been provided to members.  Establishing the DRI requires a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM board of governors, subject to the completion of national approval processes, to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty.  The aim is to have this process completed by November this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">  The Attorney General has been consulted and has advised that an amendment to the ESM Act 2012 will be required to allow the Minister for Finance, as a member of the ESM board of governors, to pass the necessary resolutions.  In short, the reason we need to amend the ESM Act 2012 is twofold.  First, the ESM was established to provide loans to member states.  The DRI provides for loans to financial institutions on the basis of an application by a member state.  Second, the DRI provides that subsidiary bodies and sub-entities may be used to facilitate such investments, so we must also cover that eventuality.  While the ESM provides for limited self-amendment, for example, in Article 19 of the ESM treaty, to add to the range of financial instruments that can be used, these changes go beyond what the Dáil approved in the ESM Act 2012.  That Act provided for the payment of Ireland's contributions to the ESM, and also made provision for the immunities included in the ESM treaty in Irish law.  The ESM treaty, as it stood in 2012, was annexed to the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">  Article 3 of the treaty states that the purpose of the ESM shall be "to mobilise funding and provide stability support under strict conditionality, appropriate to the financial assistance instrument chosen, to the benefit of ESM members which are experiencing, or are threatened by, severe financing problems, if indispensable to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its member states".  The key feature is that it provides for financial assistance to euro area member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Article 19 of the ESM treaty provides that the board of governors may review the list of financial assistance instruments provided for in Articles 14 to 18 and decide to make changes. The directory capitalisation instrument is being introduced under this article. However, as the direct capitalisation instrument was not in existence when the ESM was adopted and as it provides for direct assistance to a financial institution, it is considered that this expands the scope of the treaty beyond what was approved by the Oireachtas in the ESM Act of 2012, and an amendment to that Act to provide for the new instrument is therefore required. In addition, the draft guideline provides for the use of subsidiary bodies and entities of the ESM, including external investment, to conduct the actual recapitalisation. Although the treaty provides for ESM subsidiaries, the amendment provides for their use with a direct recapitalisation instrument.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The aim of the instrument is to preserve the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of the member states by catering for specific cases in which an ESM member experiences acute difficulties with a financial sector that cannot be remedied without significantly endangering fiscal sustainability due to a severe risk of contagion from the financial sector to the sovereign. The use of the instrument could also be considered if other alternatives would have the effect of endangering the continuous market access of an ESM member.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> The treaty as adapted following Latvia's accession to the ESM in March this year is being annexed to the ESM Act 2012 in both the Irish and English languages through this legislation to ensure the most recent version of the treaty is associated with the Act. Latvia applied to join the ESM on 21 August 2013, arising from its imminent accession to the euro. The arrangements for its accession to the ESM were dealt with in accordance with Article 44 of the ESM treaty. In October 2013, the ESM board of governors - the euro area finance Ministers - approved Latvia's application to join the ESM, along with the technical terms for Latvia's accession. Latvia joined the euro on 1 January 2014 and became the 18th member of the ESM on 13 March 2014, having deposited its instrument of accession 20 days beforehand.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> As a consequence of Latvia joining the ESM, there is a need to adapt the ESM treaty to reflect this fact. The ESM treaty provides for limited self-amendment, as I mentioned. This includes adaptations arising directly from the accession of a new member under Article 44. Such adaptations are subject to the approval of the board of governors by mutual agreement, as indicated by Article 5.6.(l) of the treaty. The adaptations arising from Latvia's accession fall within these provisions. These changes were agreed by the board of governors on 23 October 2013, and as there were adaptations to the text of the ESM treaty to accommodate Latvia's accession in annexes I and II, it is considered appropriate to take the opportunity of this Bill to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Latvia's accession led to a number of necessary technical adaptations to the ESM treaty, including the addition of Latvia to the list of member states; the amendment of Articles 8.1 and 8.2 to increase the total authorised capital stock and value of paid-in shares by the amount of Latvia's contribution to each; the inclusion of Latvian as an official language through the addition of a new paragraph to the final part of the main text of the treaty;<i>
						</i>and the amendment of Annexes I and II to the treaty to include Latvia's contribution key and share of the capital stock. These changes come about because the technical terms of Latvia's accession to the ESM approved by the board of governors include the calculation of Latvia's capital contribution to the ESM, with the capital contribution key set at 0.2757%. This means that Latvia's total capital subscription will be €1.93 billion, including €221.2 million in paid-in capital, which will be paid in five annual instalments of €44.24 million. Latvia has paid its initial instalment of paid-in capital and will make the four remaining payments annually up to 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I will run through the heads of the Bill and I will then be happy to take any questions. The heads were provided to the committee in July and the drafting process has taken place since then. As is usual in such circumstances, the Bill when it appears will have the same content but will look more detailed and fleshed out. Head 1 states the aim of amending the ESM Act to allow for the inclusion of an instrument for direct recapitalisation of financial institutions in beneficiary member states as part of the amendment envisaged under Article 19 of the ESM treaty. Head 2 is to provide for amendment of the ESM to allow for the creation of the ESM subsidiary bodies, sub-entities and funds to implement direct recapitalisation. This can include provision for participation by the private sector in such direct recapitalisation. The purpose of this Bill is to extend the immunities of the ESM to such subsidiary bodies when they are involved with direct recapitalisation. Head 3 indicates that the ESM treaty, as amended following Latvia's accession, is annexed to this amendment Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">I welcome the officials and thank them for the presentation.  I will try to bring this back home and tease out the potential implications for Ireland.  I know there are some transitional arrangements relating to the possibility of direct recapitalisation, but will the witnesses talk us through that?  For example, if the ongoing stress tests by the European Central Bank reveal capital shortfalls in banks, this direct recapitalisation facility will not be available.  Is that the case?</p>

          <p eId="para_31">The board of governors must approve it and the aim is for that to be done in early November, once the single supervisory mechanism, SSM, is operational.  Once that is in place, there is the possibility that any member state can make an application on behalf of a financial institution to seek direct recapitalisation, subject to the conditions I set out and the aims.  If there are acute difficulties which cannot be remedied without significantly endangering a member state's fiscal sustainability due to a severe risk of contagion, or if alternatives would have the effect of endangering the continuous market access of an ESM member, this could be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">  It was agreed in principle in 2012 that this instrument would be developed, and measures for banking union have since been put in place, particularly with regard to the EU bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, which sets up a cascade.  The operational guideline circulated to committee members provides that such a cascade would follow through in advance of the instrument's application.  That is what is envisaged.  The instrument is one part of breaking the link and the banking union measures are another important part of that, especially the BRRD.</p>

          <from> Mr. Feargal Ó Brolcháin<recordedTime time="2014-09-24T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_58">No.  Ireland's financial contribution is set.  The overall capital contribution is set out in the initial ESM treaty at a total capital subscription of €11.145 billion, of which approximately €1.275 billion is paid in capital.  We have paid all of that capital.  This does not require it to change.  The amount approved in the initial European Stability Mechanism Act 2012 would not change.  If it did, the Minister would have to go to the Dáil to seek approval for an increase in the level of contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">In practical terms, if money is drawn down to meet a new capital shortfall, for example, and the Department goes through the relevant procedures and is successful and secures direct recapitalisation from the ESM, does the ESM then become a shareholder of the bank?  What is its status?  Is it an investment, equity or a loan?</p>

          <from> Mr. Feargal Ó Brolcháin<recordedTime time="2014-09-24T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_60">It would be an equity investment in the relevant financial institution.  The extent of ESM ownership would depend on the contribution made by the member state and whether there was any private sector involvement.  In the nature of an equity investment, there are different rules for how one deals with it from the point of view of accounting for it.  In any investment the ESM makes it must make provision above that amount, essentially an additional provision, to allow for the possibility of risk.  One treats equity investments in a different way from how one would treat loans.  They are inherently riskier, which has an impact on the ESM's overall borrowing capacity.  It is related to how the credit rating agencies view these matters.</p>

          <from> Mr. Feargal Ó Brolcháin<recordedTime time="2014-09-24T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_62">It would depend.  In order to remunerate the ESM's investment, there might be a need to take some preference share capital.  The ESM will be borrowing this money and then investing it; therefore, it will have its own costs to cover.  To cover them on an ongoing basis, it might need to take some preference and some ordinary share capital.  It would have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

It borrows the money and lends it for programmes such as the one we had, although we did not have ESM money, or in this case for direct recapitalisation.

The stress tests will have taken place and a great deal of work has been done on the banks in the meantime.  While the possibility to which the Deputy refers is remote, in the event that the available amount was exhausted, the ESM would have to review the matter and consider whether it wanted to provide more.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">I will go through the bank recovery and resolution process.  The fundamental underpinning of the process is to ensure the taxpayer is protected.  I will explain how the system will operate.  The additional tier 1 and tier 2 share capital instruments will be bailed in first.  If that is insufficient, we will move down the waterfall using the bail-in tool within the bank recovery and resolution directive.  Eligible liabilities of capital instruments that do not come within the first layer - senior debt and that type of liability - will absorb the losses.  Obviously, the covered deposits are protected.  The deposit guarantee scheme could make a contribution on their behalf if there were remaining losses to be absorbed.  If there are further losses to be covered, we will reach the resolution fund stage.  The banks are contributing to a resolution fund on an ongoing basis.  From 2016, we will move into the single resolution mechanism, to which all member states will be contributing.  Obviously, in the early years the prospect of there being insufficient money in the fund, if there is a big call on it, will be a big issue.  A bridge financing process is being developed to try to ensure money is available for the fund.  There will be a gradual mutualisation of the single resolution fund over the first eight years.  The first port of call of a member state will be its own national compartment.  As the years go by, there will be contributions from other national compartments.  At the end of the eight years, there will be a mutualised fund whereby, in effect, all compartments will contribute to any resolution.  That is the thinking behind the framework.</p>

It is true, as the Deputy has pointed out, that the ESM will not be permitted to make that contribution other than in circumstances in which some of the difficulties that have been outlined would result if the State were to do it.  The conditionality set out in the treaty would have to be met.  The ESM will be only able to make a direct recapitalisation in limited circumstances where these thresholds are met.  There is nothing at all in the legislation that imposes any obligation on the State to bail out any bank.  The legislation allows the ESM to bail out the bank - not across the board and not without limitations - in certain circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">I thank Mr. Mac Donncha for his answer.  My point is that the State has to bail out the bank first, as long as it has the resources to do so, if the ESM is to be accessed.  It is a far cry from separating sovereign debt and banking debt.  If we are to access this €60 billion, if we have the wherewithal to do so, we will have to use our own resources - our hard-earned taxes, etc. - to make a contribution before the ESM can step in.  I am taking account of the waterfall before that point.</p>

All other senior debt will be bailed in first before deposits of more than €100,000 are reached.  The directive and the single resolution mechanism also make provision for the exclusion of these eligible deposits for contagion or financial stability reasons.  It is obvious that other liabilities would then have to pay on their behalf.  There is scope for these deposits to be excluded, depending on the circumstances of the particular resolution and its implications for the broader economy, domestically and internationally.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">I would like to comment on a big concern at this stage.  My understanding is that if we do not pass this legislation, it cannot take effect in Europe.  They need this member state to agree to it.  We would be agreeing to something without substantive progress having been made on the issue of retroactive recapitalisation.  The wording in the guideline is very similar to the wording in the draft a year previously.  Will the officials provide for clarity for the committee in this regard?  Is it the case that the application for direct retroactive recapitalisation would not require us to follow the cascade-waterfall model, which would mean that bond holders and depositors would have to take a hit, the State would have to inject up to a certain level and only then would the ESM invest?  Is that the proposal?  Is it the officials' understanding direct recapitalisation will follow this avenue?  I ask them not to reply by saying this is to be decided by the board of governors at a later stage.  Surely the Department has some feeling of how this measure will be applied, given that it is potentially one of the most beneficial measures to the State in respect of the quantum of money that would be resecured.  Have we been given any understanding - perhaps from the other governors, the ESM or other member states - of how this will be applied?  Is the committee to be kept in the dark?</p>

          <p eId="para_137">We have addressed this question.  The Minister has addressed it on a number of occasions in the House in response to parliamentary questions.  As we have outlined, Article 14 says what it says.  That is where the matter rests.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">I would like to read something to the officials.  I am sure they are involved in drawing up answers to parliamentary questions on behalf of the Minister.  I tabled a question to ask the Minister for Finance to explain how an application under the direct recapitalisation instrument of the ESM would calculate the amount that would have to be required at a time of recapitalisation by the State to bring Bank of Ireland and AIB up to the level of the common equity tier 1 ratio of 4.5% as established under the Basel III framework.  If these banks were to go bust today, we would need to know this.  That is how the instrument would take effect.  I was told that the Minister had no official responsibility to Dáil Éireann in the matter.  I ask the officials not to tell me that the Minister has answered these questions.  This is a very serious issue.  I have been told it is up to the board of governors.  If we are being asked to accept legislation that will allow this instrument to take effect - we have a veto on this - surely we are entitled as Members of the Parliament to have an understanding direct recapitalisation will be facilitated in a way that will not have to go through the waterfall system.  If it does have to go through that system, it will not be very beneficial to the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">The CEO of AIB, Mr. David Duffy, is able to comment publicly on the fact that direct recapitalisation may be able to be availed of without going through the waterfall system.  He is a banker and head of AIB and speaking to the media.  The delegates are officials in the Department and I am sure they are some of the most knowledgeable on how we would apply for direct recapitalisation.  The Minister has told the committee that he intends to apply some time after November.  Surely, based on their understanding, they can inform other parliamentarians who have a responsibility in this matter whether Mr. Duffy is correct in his public utterances, or at least state there is a chance this is how the application or instrument could be applied.</p>

It has had two years to secure the detail, but there has been no fleshing out whatsoever of the detail of retroactive recapitalisation.  I hope and pray the Minister and the Department have a clear understanding behind closed doors of how this will happen and that they are aware an application can be made for direct recapitalisation without having to go through the waterfall process and that they are keeping us in the dark because they want to keep everything closed off from Opposition politicians.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">I thank the delegates for their explanation which has been very helpful.  To follow on from where Deputy Pearse Doherty finished, the conditionality set out for accessing current recapitalisation suggests the threshold will be very high and that all other possibilities will have to be exhausted before one can access recapitalisation under the ESM and that an arguably even higher threshold will apply for retroactive recapitalisation, judging from the sounds coming from the European Union and the fact that it will be left to the discretion of the board of governors.  A country must exhaust every other possibility before it will be able to apply for direct recapitalisation of its banks.</p>

I am sorry to be repetitive, but Article 14 sets out what it sets out and simply states the details of any particular application will be decided when the board of governors decides on it.  That is as far as it goes.  It allows the board of governors discretion to take the approach the Deputy has suggested or to take a different approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">That is a pretty small amount, which is just over 10% of its lending capacity.  With such a small amount available throughout the whole of Europe for direct recapitalisation and a pretty high threshold being exacted for current recapitalisation in the legislation, our chances of getting retroactive recapitalisation are zero to nil, given the size of the pot available and the thresholds applied to current recapitalisation.  There is nothing to give much hope we will get anything in terms of retroactive recapitalisation.  Is this a reasonable reading of what we have in front of us?  To put it another way and to use colloquial language, it does not state retroactive recapitalisation would be considered sympathetically for countries which have been beggared as a result of their requirement to bail out their banks and have had a really hard time - obviously, it would be phrased differently.  It has very high thresholds for current recapitalisation and very little money available and something about a board of governors considering it on a case-by-case basis.  It does not look very hopeful.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">I have outlined what the Minister has said, that an application will be considered after the instrument is put in place.  With regard to the phrasing, these documents are always phrased like this and it is the standard way they are constructed.  It is important to note a provision for retrospective recapitalisation is included, which leaves the possibility open.  This can be considered an achievement in itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">It is not for Mr. Ó Brolcháin to comment, but it looks like a sop to salvage the credibility of the Government's original triumphalism that it would obtain this, that as it now fades into the distance there is still a possibility we will get it.  I will move on from this point as there is not much more to be said about it.  </p>
          <p eId="para_152">  On a more general basis, the €60 billion for direct recapitalisation would be a pretty pathetic figure if there was to be another serious financial crisis in Europe.  We had to get €64 billion and one bank alone, Anglo Irish Bank, required €30 billion.  If there was to be any serious shock to the European financial system, the €60 billion for the whole of Europe would be exhausted very quickly by two banks the size of Anglo Irish Bank.  We would then be back to our bailing them out again.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">The €60 billion set aside for direct bank recapitalisation is in the context of an ESM fully invested given its share capital, which Mr. Sheridan outlined.  The fully invested amount was envisaged at €500 billion.  The current investment amount is nowhere near that figure.  This, taken in conjunction with the changes in bail in conditions, mean that we are not comparing like with like.  Not only would a bail-in apply up to senior debt and beyond in the future, but banks would also have far higher levels of capital than our banks did.  There would be capital levels of 15% to 20%.  We are in the realm of speculation, but if a bank in Europe had a serious problem next year which was envisaged as being systemic in the European context and the ESM had not invested all of the money it could, there is nothing to say the €60 billion figure might change.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Presumably, though, it would require a decision by the board of governors to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">The legislation simply provides for the inclusion of the direct recapitalisation instrument, DRI, among the instruments that can be included in the ESM treaty.  It provides a legislative basis for the Minister to agree to this instrument.  The figure of €60 billion is the one agreed by the ESM board of governors as the cap on the DRI.  There are a number of reasons for this.  First, all such discussions are the subject of agreement among the now 18 member states.  Second, the €60 billion has a greater than linear impact on the ESM's lending capacity.  As such, greater provision must be made.  If the ESM fully provided €60 billion by way of direct recapitalisation, the rest of its lending capacity would be reduced.</p>

The statement on breaking the link between the sovereign and banks comprised a number of factors, principal among them issues relating to the banking union element and the BRRD and the single resolution mechanism, which are two important building blocks.  The aim is for the single resolution mechanism to be self-financed by the banks.  Another factor was the need to provide for the DRI as a further back-stop.  There are a number of stages, in a forward-looking sense, with these elements in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">Herein lies my struggle.  Other than the DRI, which is too small and will probably never be used, based on the technical note we have received, the ESM would decouple the link by lending directly to banks for recapitalisation so that the sovereign would play no part.  Am I right in believing that, before such a recapitalisation, the ESM's money would come via the sovereign?  By definition, this would maintain the sovereign-banking link through the sovereign lending on to the banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">That is probably not the case.  There is the bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, structure and the single resolution mechanism, SRM, structure into which we are entering.  The purpose of the SRM is to set up a fund to which the banks contribute.  When a bank goes into resolution, one goes through the waterfall - the cascade - and the bail-in mechanism, bailing in all the subordinated debt, junior debt and senior debt, and then one uses the resolution fund at a European level.  In the first couple of years there will be a gradual mutualisation.  In other words, it is compartmentalised for the first eight years.  One goes to the Irish compartment first and if there is still a deficit one goes to the other compartments – the mutualised elements of the compartments.  In the first year it is 40% mutualised and in the second year it is another 20%.  By the end of year two one has 60% mutualisation.  One has access to a great source of funding from the mutualised compartments of other member states, and that will gradually be mutualised fully after eight years.  After eight years there is a proposal to develop a common back-stop for the single resolution fund itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_195">Am I correct in thinking, if we take Anglo Irish Bank as an example - another Anglo - and its losses were €30 billion, that the first level, which is 8%, would be €240 million and that the next level in the cascade, which is the resolution fund, would be 5%, which would be €150 million?  In the case of Anglo Irish Bank, which on a European scale is tiny – it is big by Irish standards – of the €30 billion loss, one still has €29.6 billion left by the time one gets to the ESM.

          <p eId="para_196">Anglo Irish Bank is a particular bank.  When the BRRD was being developed, the authorities would have looked at the level of losses for many of the other banks and the general view would have been that an 8% bail-in of liability and capital plus the 5% of the resolution fund would have covered the vast majority of banks that got into trouble.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">Yes; that would be the accepted view when looking at the extent and level of losses in banks throughout the financial crisis in recent years.  That is why the BRRD was designed in that fashion.  There was considerable debate about the level of the 8% figure and that was what member states agreed as an appropriate amount that would deal with the majority of cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_203">For absolute clarity, let us just stay with the example of Anglo Irish Bank.  Let us say Anglo Irish Bank says it needs €30 billion.  Fifteen percent of €30 billion would be €4.5 billion.  If I understand Mr. Sheridan correctly, it is much more than €4.5 billion.  Anglo’s total liabilities would be taken into account, which might be €300 billion, and therefore 15% of that is €45 billion, which is bigger than the €30 billion hole.  Is that the way it is done?</p>

          <p eId="para_204">Yes; in that particular instance those figures would make sense.  It is the liabilities plus the bank's own funds.  That is the tier one capital, the additional tier one, the tier two, subordinated debt and then all the eligible liabilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">As I outlined in my opening remarks, the purpose of it is for the specific case in which an ESM member experiences acute difficulties with the financial sector that cannot be remedied without endangering fiscal sustainability due to a severe risk of contagion, and if other alternatives would have the effect of endangering their market access.  It is clearly identified as being an emergency if it is the case that the member state could avail of another ESM instrument without endangering its access to the markets.  That would come first.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">Am I correct in saying that would be rare?  One would have to put together quite a specific case, because if I understand the system and what Mr. Ó Brolcháin said correctly, if we have been through the 8% and the 5% but more money is still required as that has not fixed the problem, and we are now onto the ESM, if we lend the sovereign money to lend on to the banks it might cause the country to collapse or lock the country out of the markets for some reason, and only in the case of a possible destabilisation of the sovereign can the DRI mechanism be turned on.</p>

It is a small amount of money.  The IMF has expressed concern, as have various economic commentators.  I understand Ireland is not about to go back to try to renegotiate the amount, but what is the Department’s view?

If not that is fine, I fully accept that.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">What would have to happen is that the ESM would have to provide loans for up to its capacity of €500 million.  All of that would have to be used up.  In other words the borrowers would not repay any of that money, ever.  That €11.145 billion is our contribution to €700 million of total subscribed capital.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">No it is part of the €700 billion.  Annex II sets it all out. What would have to happen is the ESM would have to lend its total lending capacity or between its direct recapitalisation instrument, DRI, and its remaining vending capacity.  It would have to lend the whole lot, none of that would be repaid and then that would be called in.</p>

Is there a legal mechanism within the ESM and the DRI that would actually allow retrospective recapitalisation, critically not as a loan but as a transfer?
