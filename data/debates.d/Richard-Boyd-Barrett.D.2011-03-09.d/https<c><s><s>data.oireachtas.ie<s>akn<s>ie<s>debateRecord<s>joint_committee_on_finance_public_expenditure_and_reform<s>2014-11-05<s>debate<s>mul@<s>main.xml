          <p eId="para_18">I welcome Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive of Bank of Ireland.  He is accompanied by his Bank of Ireland colleagues, Mr. Liam McLoughlin, chief executive retail Ireland, and Mr. Pat Farrell, group head of communications and Government relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">  In terms of the format of this meeting, Mr. Boucher will make comments on the presentation circulated to committee members.  In advance of the meeting questions were gathered from committee members and submitted to the Bank of Ireland.  I thank Mr. Boucher and his staff for responding in writing to these questions and the responses have been distributed to committee members.  These responses, together with the input of the witnesses today, should mean all of the key topics will be covered but, nonetheless, a question and answer session will follow to clarify matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off all mobile telephones.  I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are further directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">  Before I ask Mr. Boucher to begin I want us to agree on some ground rules to ensure everyone has an opportunity to ask questions as this will allow for the best meeting possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I propose that lead speakers for each group will have ten minutes, followed by other committee members who shall have five minutes and anybody else wishing to ask questions, who will also have five minutes. The clerk to the committee and I will be keeping an eye on the clock and I will advise members when a minute is remaining of their time to allow them to wrap up because I will be keeping them within their allotted time. If members have further questions I will be happy, time permitting, to allow them to speak again once I have given everyone a fair opportunity to put their questions. It would not serve the purpose of the meeting if the time is used to make statements because witnesses would not have the opportunity to respond properly. I ask members and witnesses to keep their questions and answers short and to the point to facilitate the best interaction possible. I ask members' co-operation to assist in the smooth running of the meeting. Is that agreed? Agreed. I invite Mr. Boucher to make his presentation and ask him to limit it to approximately ten minutes.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Richie Boucher<recordedTime time="2014-11-05T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_23">The context which frames our meeting is one of change.  As members will be aware, Bank of Ireland received an investment of €4.8 billion from the taxpayer.  The bank has repaid that in full.  We paid in excess of €6 billion in cash to the taxpayer and the taxpayer retains a valuable 14% discretionary shareholding in the bank.  There are ongoing developments in the regulatory landscape at European level which relate to our sector, including the single supervisory mechanism for banks which officially came into being yesterday, 4 November 2014.  As part of these reforms, the European Central Bank recently announced the results of its comprehensive assessment of 130 banks, including Bank of Ireland group.  The overall result for Bank of Ireland confirmed that the group has passed the ECB comprehensive assessment with substantial capital buffers.  With regard to the wider economy, we see a strengthening of the economic recovery.  The latest Bank of Ireland economic outlook, which was published last month, projects growth of 4.2% for 2015, up from our forecast earlier this year of approximately 3.4%.  The economy is, therefore, recovering more quickly than we anticipated.  Our meeting is timely in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">  We provided a comprehensive presentation to members in advance of our meeting, including an overview of the bank; a guide to our strategic objectives, an update on issues relating to the comprehensive assessment; our interim management statement, which issued on Friday and is the latest information we have provided to the market on our performance and prospects; and an overview of our main businesses as they relate to our Irish operations.  We have also returned to the committee the answers to a range of questions.  We have given as much detail as we can in answering these questions and we have also provided guidance on where the relevant information is listed in our annual reports.  We have also supplied additional documentation in the form of various public announcements.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">  As a public company we make extensive disclosures on a wide range of issues through various formats and media.  Given that we are 86% owned by the private sector, certain information is in our judgment commercially sensitive and due to our responsibilities to all shareholders and my duties as director, we have to signal that we strive to ensure members have the necessary and appropriate opportunity to understand our strategy.  As a public company quoted in the London and New York stock exchanges, all information we have provided has been verified.  As this is a public discussion and we have issued a public document on the bank's trading performance, I am obliged to say on record this is not a guide to future performance of the bank and is not a solicitation for people to buy stock in the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">  The State's 14% discretionary shareholding in the bank is a matter for the Minister for the Finance.  Under our approved EU restructuring plan, with all State aid having been repaid, the relationship between the Minister and the bank is governed by our relationship framework agreement, which recognises the bank as a separate economic entity managed on a commercial basis and engaging with the Minister in accordance with best institutional practice.  Our goal for this meeting is to present to and discuss with the committee our performance and strategy based on the best institutional shareholder practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">  Slides 5 and 6 of our presentation summarise an extensive document and refer to a number of issues.  Bank of Ireland has made considerable progress over the past 12 months, and certainly since we appeared before the committee 12 months ago.  This has been assisted by the fact that the economic environment in our core markets of Ireland and the United Kingdom has continued to improve.  We have completed the repayment of the taxpayers' investment and the taxpayers have made a profit.  On today's market capitalisation of €9.7 billion, the 14% shareholding that the taxpayers have in the bank has a notional value of approximately €1.3 billion.  It is a significant milestone on top of our repayment to the taxpayers that we are now profitable and generating capital.  We have passed the ECB's comprehensive assessment with significant buffers.  We have robust funding and capital ratios which provide both security and support for our strategic growth objectives.  Our defaulted loans have decreased by €1.9 billion between June 2013 and September 2014, and our new lending is on target.  Our Irish consumer, business and corporate banking target in our financial plan for 2013-17 is new lending into the economy of €33 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">  In terms of the economy as a whole, our view is that it is going through the classic phases of an economic recovery in a restructured economy.  The main feature that has emerged over the past 12 months has been that internal demand and consumption are complementing the growth in exports.  Bank of Ireland is the largest lender into the Irish economy.  We are the No. 1 bank for SMEs.  Based on our information and verified analysis of Central Bank information, we have provided over 50% of new non-property lending to SMEs in 2014 to date.  We have enjoyed particularly strong performance in our agriculture, motor finance and commercial finance businesses.  We provide more than 50% of new lending to the agriculture sector.  Bank of Ireland's corporate bank has a market share of more than 30% and well over 50% of foreign direct investment companies bank with us.  We have a market share of approximately 25% of savings products.  Our mortgage business in Ireland is providing one in every three new mortgages.  Our life assurance business, New Ireland, is the No. 2 overall provider of life pensions and investments in Ireland.  In Northern Ireland we have a universal bank offering.  We have been through a significant cost restructuring programme to position ourselves in that market.  We are determined to remain in Northern Ireland and to position ourselves to reflect the particular dynamics of that market.  In Great Britain, through our partnership model with the post office we are one of the largest challenger consumer banking franchises.  With 3 million customers, we have more customers in Great Britain than we do in our Irish businesses.  In addition, we have a very profitable acquisition finance business which operates in the US and continental Europe and which has negotiated its way through a number of credit cycles utilising its cash flow lending expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">  Slides 14 and 15 deal with the components of the new banking union.  Members will have noted the results for Bank of Ireland, which confirm we have significant buffers.  Slides 17 to 20 are directly extracted from the market announcement we made last Friday.  I will not go through them other than to highlight that our revenue has continued to go up and our new lending is on target.  The group has remained focused on tight cost control while we continue to invest in our people, businesses and infrastructure.  We confirmed in our announcement that we are in the process of a ballot by IBOA represented staff on a comprehensive new career and reward framework which was recommended by an independent arbitrator.  Our asset quality trends have continued to improve in line with our expectations.  We believe this reflects the work we are doing and the overall improvement in the economy.  The figure for total defaulted loans has decreased by €1.9 billion since June 2013 to €16.4 billion on 30 September 2014.  We continue to generate capital at a significant pace and have seen an increase of 180 basis points in our common equity tier 1 ratio from 12.3% at the end of January to 14.1% at the end of September.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">  Slide 24 provides some information on our new lending in Ireland.  It is not up-to-date to the end of September but in our September update we indicated that lending growth had continued at roughly the same pace.  We can see where our lending growth has gone, particularly in our Irish business, in our SME business, in our corporate banking and our mortgage business.</p>

It is a confirmation of the capital strength of the group, which is very important, obviously to give security to our depositors and other providers of services and also to demonstrate that Bank of Ireland is very strongly capitalised to be able to achieve our strategic objectives in Ireland and in our other businesses.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">  Slides 28 to 43 provide a mix of the position at the end of June, and wherever we have been able to do it, we have brought it up to date to the position at the end of September.

          <p eId="para_37">Yes, certainly.  There is a significant amount of information on mortgage arrears on slides 28 to 43, confirming that our mortgage arrears have come down by 24% from our peak.  Nine out of ten of our private dwelling home, PDH, accounts and eight out of ten of our buy-to-let mortgages are up to date.  For nine out of ten private homes and eight out of ten buy-to-let cases where the customer has identified, through an SFS, a problem in paying, we can provide a sustainable solution.  The solutions are set out on the slides, and in excess of 86% of those solutions and restructures are being adhered to.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">  There was a particular question about SME loans and defaults on the SME loans, in particular, the Irish SME loan book.  The left-hand side of slide 43 shows that the defaulted loans on the Irish SME book or business banking book continued to reduce.  It shows that our provision coverage had increased and it confirms that in nine out of ten of the challenged customers, we have restructures or resolution strategies in place and in 90% of those cases they have been adhered to.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">  We have given significant information in slides 46 to 59, which is a reference point for the business and in particular focuses on our Irish businesses, which I will quickly go through.  In terms of the time factor and reflecting the Chairman's request, I will wrap up by saying that now and for the future the Bank is focused on supporting and benefiting from the Irish economic recovery, developing our relations with our existing and new customers, continuing to provide and develop solutions for customers in financial difficulty, effectively managing the developing regulatory environment, generating capital, managing risk, developing qualified, trained, committed and motivated employees to work as a team to deliver our objectives as a business, increasing our profitability, and through all the above having a sustainable business.  Sustainability is important in terms of the way we look at our businesses, providing sustainable propositions to our customers and sustainable returns to our shareholders.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">Before I bring in the other members, I wish to ask Mr. Boucher a question.  In regard to the net interest margin on standard variable loans, the margin the bank has in respect of those loans at over 3% seems quite high.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_8">
          <from> Mr. Richie Boucher<recordedTime time="2014-11-05T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_41">The margin is not necessarily based on it because we have a liquidity risk with mortgages.  A mortgage is a 20 to 25-year instrument and we take liquidity risk in the provision of mortgages.  We look at those as they operate elsewhere.  Yesterday the Irish Government, which is, in effect, the base risk-free investment, issued a 15-year bond at just under 2.5%.  Our fixed rate offering is 4.99% and that is a 2.5% margin.  For our margin, and, in particular, for our capital allocation models and the capital allocation the Central Bank requires to hold against our different books, we must take into consideration our loss experience.  Our loss experience on our Irish mortgage books has been different from what it has been in Europe.  Another comparator I would note is that we have a business in the UK and our mortgage business in the UK is roughly the same size as our Irish mortgage business.  It is a very similar type of market structure and I will return to why that is the case.  The spreads and margins in the UK in which we operate are the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">  Some reference has been made to a comparison between Irish rates and European rates.  A couple of features I would note in that respect is that the loss experience is different, so the capital allocation is different.  However, a very significant feature of a number of the European markets is tax-based subsidies for bond markets.  An example is the <i>Pfandbriefe </i>market in Germany where banks operate as originators and issuers and they sell their mortgages on to bond markets.  If we take into account that there is tax-based or taxpayers' subsidy for those bond markets, it is not comparable.  The more comparable market in terms of market structure and access to bond markets is the UK market against the Irish market.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">I welcome Mr. Boucher, Mr. Farrell and Mr. McLoughlin.  As my time is limited, I can only cover some of the key issues.  I want to continue with the issue the Chairman raised, in particular about the pricing strategy for standard variable rate mortgages.  The bank is currently charging in the region of 4.5% for a new mortgage if the loan-to-value is over 80%.  How can Mr. Boucher justify that when his stated cost of funds is 1.15%, which have come down by about 30% in the past 12 to 18 months?  The bank's margin has increased very substantially.  Most people would regard a variable rate product as one where if the market conditions are bad, the rate is going to go up, but when the market conditions are good, people expect the variable rate to come down, but that has not happened.  When was the last standard variable rate reduction by Bank of Ireland in respect of mortgage products?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_11">
          <from> Mr. Richie Boucher<recordedTime time="2014-11-05T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_45">The last reduction would have been in 2008 or 2009.  There has been no significant interest rate cycle in that period.  The group's net interest margin has improved in the 12 month period from 1.65% to 2.08%.  That is progress but is certainly not an exorbitant margin.  We have to get 98% of our credit decisions right before we can make any money or cover our costs at that particular margin.  As I was trying to identify in my answer to the Chairman's question, the structure and liquidity risk one takes against mortgages are important.  We are providing a mortgage which has a significant liquidity risk.  We have a repricing opportunity but we are giving a 25-year commitment of money to the customer.  We cannot raise that money so it is not necessarily comparable to look at our overall cost of funds.  For example, if we issue a covered bond or unsecured debt in the markets, we are issuing it at about 2% to 3%.  The Irish Government in raising 15-year money in the market at 250 basis points.  One has to take account of the nature of the product one provides, the liquidity risks, the historic credit losses one has taken and the capital one applies.  There are a range of factors in that.  We have to enhance our margin but we try to ensure our products are competitive on an ongoing basis.  We are a commercial business, we operate in a competitive market and we must ensure our products are sustainably competitive, that we can continue in the market, attract customers and do business.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">The bank's margin has increased very substantially.  Its cost of funds has reduced very substantially by about one third in the past 12 to 18 months and yet Mr. Boucher is telling me it is about six years since Bank of Ireland has reduced the standard variable rate being charged.  One of the bank's main competitors, AIB, has stolen a march on it in the market and has reduced its rate.  I presume Bank of Ireland will have to follow suit.  Mr. Boucher will not confirm that today but, ultimately, the market will dictate the bank's reaction.  I submit to Mr. Boucher that the bank is taking advantage of variable rate customers.  They are being exploited.  It will come as a surprise to nobody that a bank seeks to maximise profits, but this bank is profiteering on the backs of variable rate customers.  Mr. Boucher made the comparison with the UK market which he said is the best comparison with Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">Across the Border, Bank of Ireland offers a 1.98% fixed rate up to January 2017 if I have a low loan-to-value ratio of 60% or a 2.09% fixed rate or a variable rate of just over 2% for at least two years if my LTV ratio is 75%. There is a more competitive environment in the North. If, after two years, Bank of Ireland does not keep the rate low for a customer, he or she can switch to another bank. Customers in the South do not have that option. How can Mr. Boucher justify such a massive difference between the rates Bank of Ireland charges in the Republic and the rates it charges in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, given his statement to the effect that both markets are remarkably similar?</p>

          <p eId="para_49">Bank of Ireland has advertised that it is offering a fixed rate of as low as 2% and a variable rate of just over 2% for defined periods of time where people have relatively low LTV ratios, but those rates are much more competitive than what Bank of Ireland is charging in the Republic.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">I should note that the Deputy also cited our fixed rates.  We can buy fixed rate money and we offer fixed rate mortgages.  We are still surprised at the lack of take-up of fixed rate money in the market.  We note that the Government has made a decision to try to fix rates over a period.  We try to offer attractive fixed rates.  We would encourage customers to consider fixed rates.  A fixed rate gives a customer certainty and control of his or her finances in so far as that is possible.  We provide attractive and competitive fixed rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">  As the Deputy stated, we operate in a competitive market.  We review our rates on an ongoing basis.  We also bear in mind our responsibilities to all of our stakeholders - our depositors, our shareholders and the taxpayers whom we have repaid.  The strategies of other banks are something we keep an eye on, but we have learned not to follow them slavishly.  We consider other banks, the sustainability of their propositions and their ability to attract capital to fund themselves and meet all of their commitments to their stakeholders.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">I do not find Mr. Boucher's argument about pricing policy convincing.  He was the one who drew the comparison with the UK market, calling it remarkably similar to Ireland's.  He stated that the average rate Bank of Ireland charged in the UK was approximately 4%.  However, the offering it makes to new customers in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK is remarkably competitive and strikingly different from the offering it makes in the Republic.  Mr. Boucher has cited a rate of 4.5% at a time when its cost of funding is probably 1% or so.  That is a remarkable margin to charge for variable rate products.  I am not just referring to mortgages but also to personal loans for which Bank of Ireland charges approximately 12%, to credit cards for which it charges 20% or so and to loans to small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, which are paying way over the odds.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">I will point out that the group margin is 2%.  We must take into account liquidity risks, especially as regards mortgages.  It is a 25 to 30 year proposition to customers.  As such, we must take a liquidity risk for that duration.  The Government has taken out a 15-year bond at 2.5%.  It is difficult to compare one product or its features with another.  We must have subordinated capital.  We must have a range of instruments of various maturities to match our different products.  We are also required to take into account the weighted cost of capital against products.  This must also factor in loss experience.  Our loss experience on our UK mortgage book is different.  To assist the Deputy, though, we will provide him with our UK and Irish mortgage rates so that he can have an appropriate comparative.</p>

It relates to Bank of Ireland's approach to insolvency cases under the formal Insolvency Service of Ireland process.  Slide No. 40 that the delegation has provided shows that of the total 296 personal insolvency arrangements, Bank of Ireland is involved in 109, if I am reading it correctly.  The number of arrangements that have lapsed due to "No" creditor votes is nine.  Will Mr. Boucher confirm to the committee how many PIAs the bank signed off on that have involved material changes to the mortgages' balances?

The delegation's comments on the economy are welcome and corroborate what we are being told by the Minister for Finance and others.  I am delighted that the bank's rate of new lending is on target and that it is providing one in three new mortgages.  It has refunded the taxpayer totally.  The taxpayer only has a 14% discretionary holding now.  Bank of Ireland passed the stress tests and everything is set for further progress.  Will the delegation comment on the mortgage table that is outlined on page 35?  Is the bank satisfied with its progress <i>vis-à-vis</i> all others?</p>

We still have a number of customers who are in challenging circumstances whom we have to help restructure. Where we cannot help them, we have to move it on. We are not in any way complacent or self-satisfied on this issue. We have to continue to make progress.</p>

Have these families been offered another option to repossession, including the mortgage-to-rent option, the least worst option?  Is it the bank’s position that there is no other viable option other than repossession?</p>

We may be taking some of these cases through a legal process.  Our experience, however, has been that where customers do not co-operate with the bank, once we engage with them in the legal process, the levels of co-operation tend to increase and improve.

          <p eId="para_96">According to the bank’s submission document, the various stages of arrears are either in a resolution process consensually - either the borrower giving back the keys and the bank pursuing him or her for the debt - or resolution through a legal process, which means that the bank has initiated legal proceedings.  I appreciate that the bank’s delegation has answered the question on the provision against this debt.  However, what options were given to these 4,000 plus families before they reached the repossession stage, options such as a mortgage-to-rent which comes to a miniscule amount?</p>

          <p eId="para_97">In those cases we have been through an extensive resolution process with the customers in line with the CCMA, code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That process starts when the customer is contacted about the arrears on his or her house or property.  We have 790 skilled staff who are familiar with the CCMA process involved.  It starts off with a network account manager in a branch meeting the customer and helping him or her to fill in an SFS, standard financial statement, a standard form from the Central Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">The bank has made significant progress in dealing with the issue of mortgage arrears.  In nine out of ten cases where customers have contacted us, we have been able to put solutions in place.  The only impediment is where a customer is not co-operative.  In that scenario we take the customer through a CCMA-approved route towards a legal process.  In 20% to 30% of these cases the customer then actually engages with us and works towards a solution.  Some cases go all the way through to repossession where a case is unsustainable or the customer will not engage with us.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">In the mortgage-to-rent scenario there are specific criteria which could be enhanced.  One of the obvious necessities is either a local housing authority or a not-for-profit housing authority being willing to take the property.  We have seen growth in that market.  As we are a lender, we lend to not-for-profit housing authorities.  It is a commercial transaction and filling a need and gap in the market.  Ultimately, what it needs is someone on another part of the chain who will take ownership of the property and then lease it back to the tenant.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">It is the equivalent of someone with a Bank of Ireland mortgage of €100,000 and a variable interest rate telling the bank when the interest reaches €100,000 that the interest has been paid back and that he or she and the bank are all square.

          <p eId="para_111">Let me finish.  There is a breakdown of the figures.  Approximately €1.5 billion in guarantee fees was paid up until the end of 2013 that had nothing whatsoever to do with the cash injection; it was because we had to guarantee the bank.  The rest is mostly made up of coupons in terms of securities.  Therefore, it does not have to do with the cash that was injected.  Mr. Boucher should be more up-front about this.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">Please listen for one second.  This is interest on products bought from Mr. Boucher's bank.  It is the exact same scenario as the one I have outlined.  It is interest that was applied to coupons.  I refer to the fee applied by giving the guarantee to Bank of Ireland, not to paying all the cash back.  They are two different things.  Bank of Ireland charges fees on transactions all the time, but when it offers a loan, it still wants the capital back; that is the point.  I do not want to take up the committee's time, but the public will decide this.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">Is Mr. Boucher blaming the Minister of Finance?  He is big enough to say what is required.  He should acknowledge that the capital that was injected into the bank has not been paid back and that what have been paid back are the fees that applied to the products bought in terms of shares in the years in question and the fee that applied to the guarantee issued to the bank.  I refer to other services offered to the bank.  It is important to state this because it cost the State money to provide these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">  I wish to move on to the issue of arrears which is the primary focus of the committee in terms of mortgages.  With regard to the data the bank has, Mr. Boucher talked about redemption and improvement in large numbers.  I take it that with people getting back to work or other factors, the financial position has improved.  The arrears capitalisation figure for private domestic homes is 1,060.  Reference is made to a total of 2,373.  Is it the case that there was a natural improvement in these cases?</p>

          <p eId="para_131">I want to stick with the figure of 1,060.  The only service or solution these debtors received from the bank was arrears capitalisation because they were not offered a split mortgage term extension or an interest write-down.  This means that their personal circumstances had changed such that they could deal with the mortgage, plus the arrears they had built up.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">Regarding the mortgage arrears target, as we said, the number of customers in arrears and default has reduced.  The forbearance we provide and characterise in our accounts is also set out in the accounts, which show exactly the number of customers who have been forborne outside the MART and its specifics, which pertain to Central Bank targets and measures.  The fact of the matter, as our accounts demonstrate, is that the number of customers in arrears has reduced, as has the number defaulting.  The number of forbearances we have in place has increased.  Some of thee are obviously connected to a recovering economy.  Some are obviously connected to people being able to deal with unsecured or other debt, while some have to do with the actions we have taken.  In any situation there is a combination of factors.  I completely agree with the Deputy in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">We have set out clearly what the PIPs are.  In Bank of Ireland’s case, we took a market leadership position over two years ago to say unsecured debt should be written down first.  That has been a policy of the bank and reflects the process in which we have engaged.  We pioneered a pilot initiative with the other banks to state that if a customer had a personal loan with us and a mortgage with AIB, we would take the write down and <i>vice versa</i>.

          <p eId="para_193">Obviously, Bank of Ireland is a public company and we are in the market.  The market looks at our challenged loans on the basis of whether arrears are going up or down, whether new customers are coming into that category, the provision coverage against those defaulted loans and the percentage of sticking where we restructure.  The 86% is a position about which we stand in the market.  The market makes a judgment as to whether our restructuring is sustainable.  I concur with the Deputy that restructuring for the sake of restructuring does not do anything for us or for the customer.  We seek to restructure and the market will continue to review the adequacy of our provisions when reporting on our defaulted loans because there is no point in reporting defaulted loans coming down if one restructures then.  I agree with the Deputy.</p>

We are here on behalf of the State which has a 14% shareholding in the bank at the moment.  I believe Bank of Ireland is taking a different approach to people in arrears from all other institutions.  We had the announcement yesterday from the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation as to how it is dealing with AIB customers and the capacity to deal with it in a robust manner.  How many people who are in arrears have had to sell their houses?  As Deputy Regina Doherty pointed out earlier, there are 4,000 people against whom Bank of Ireland is considering taking legal proceedings in respect of their private homes, potentially losing their homes.  In the event of their losing their homes, does the bank keep them on the line for the money they were not able to repay?</p>

          <p eId="para_209">They obviously cannot make repayments.  They are trying to make a start in life again and Bank of Ireland is putting them on the hook until they pay everything.  If I was a banking analyst, I would recommend buying Bank of Ireland shares at one level because I think it is screwing everybody to the point that it is getting every last penny it is owed out of them.  As the State is a shareholder, we have an obligation to see the bank do well, but I think it has gone over the top on it.  I think it is doing damage to the brand of Bank of Ireland.  People in this country talk.  Bank of Ireland is an outlier in the way it is treating people.  My key point is that it is too harsh.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">  Accountants and financial consultants throughout the country will say that Bank of Ireland is the last institution people want to deal with on mortgages and debt.  The witnesses are potentially damaging the brand.  As a shareholder, I say that is not good enough.  AIB stands in much better stead with the public because it is writing down money and restructuring debts.  It is not coming after people to screw every last penny from them or forcing them to give up their personal homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">  I have a fundamental problem with much of this.  At one level Bank of Ireland has a licence provided by the Central Bank.  The State bailed it out.  I do not want to get personal and I wish the witnesses all the very best in what they are trying to do.  However, their line of tack is wrong.  Bank of Ireland is given a licence by the institutions of the country to do the best thing by the people.  I believe the witnesses need to re-evaluate.  I will be writing to the Minister for Finance, as the custodian of the 14% stakeholding.  I will be writing to the public interest directors.  I think the brand of Bank of Ireland is potentially damaged at the moment, largely due to the policy it pursuing.  It needs to ease off a little.  It has gone too far with it on many fronts.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">  Bank of Ireland has two State-owned competitors.  Whatever definition one uses for repayment, these banks still owe taxpayers €24 billion.  Slide 35, which refers specifically to mortgages, shows that AIB's defaulted loans amount to €5.5 billion, while those of Permanent TSB amount to €4.7 billion.  Bank of Ireland's defaulted loans amount to €1.9 billion and our arrears are half of the industry average.  Our restructures stick for longer and we have more resolutions in place on our book, relatively speaking.  That is the context in which one must look at Bank of Ireland. </p>

          <p eId="para_225">I wonder sometimes about the function of these meetings.  While members are allowed to speak and ask questions, where is the policy response?  I am not sure there has been any policy response at Government level since our most recent meeting in April.  Whatever we say about mortgages and repossessions, in the summer of 2013 the Government had a law voted in that facilitated the banks.  Many of us bitterly opposed the legislation at the time.  I am not surprised the banks have used the law to their best advantage as they have been allowed to do so by the Government.  We must show some realism on this issue.  My party continues to bitterly oppose the law in question and we stand up for those who have been driven into the courts as a result of the actions of the banks and the change in the law made by the Government in the summer of 2013.  Those are the facts.</p>

Since then, Bank of Ireland has been involved in active discussions with the various parties, including the approved housing boards and the Department.  I believe we are close to producing a very good protocol in this area.  A meeting will take place in the final week of November to bring the matter to a conclusion.

          <p eId="para_255">The two year fixed rate for a mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of greater than 75% is 4.35% in the Republic and 2.09% in the North.  Why is the rate charged in the North less than half the rate charged here?  Is it the result of the lack of competition in the market in the Republic?</p>
          <p eId="para_256">  Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks control a large part of the residential mortgage book in Ireland.  The former has been ahead of the curve in that it has returned to profitability ahead of AIB, yet it is the latter bank that has seen fit to reduce its variable rate by 0.25%.  Why has Bank of Ireland not followed suit and reduced its variable rate?  Why is the two year fixed rate for a mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of greater than 75% charged in the North less than half the rate charged in the South?  </p>
          <p eId="para_257">  I do not wish to go over old ground but I wish to get to the nub of the issue.  Bank of Ireland has increased its margin by 43 basis points or approximately 26%. </p>
          <p eId="para_258">This more or less corresponds with the reduction in the general cost of funds to the bank itself and Mr. Boucher might elaborate on that. The question simply is about what the bank is not doing. It strikes me as being reasonably logical, in that Bank of Ireland states it is a bank that is in pretty good nick and condition, yet its main competitor in the past week has given a reduction of 0.25% to hard-pressed mortgage holders and to first-time buyers. Moreover, in the North, Bank of Ireland is giving absolutely identical customers a fixed rate for two years that is half the rate it would give to them in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">Yes, absolutely.  I agree completely.  It has come down.  As we have discussed with all our shareholders and stakeholders, the defaulted loans are still too high.  The question of how the defaulted loans come down is a key criterion on which as a company we are judged by everyone.  The first factor that is a contributor to this is to ensure - in so far as we can and the economy is a function of this - that the number of customers defaulting reduces.  In each of our portfolios, the number of customers defaulted has reduced.  Then, there is the absolute quantum of defaulted loans and what is one's provisional coverage.  What is one's best estimate of one's loss against that?  We hold provisional coverage of just under 50% of coverage against our estimate of potential loss, taking account of the collateral and so on that we hold.  Then, we look at the defaulted loans and whether they themselves are reducing.  Are the arrears coming down, are we holding sufficient coverage ratios and are there defaulted loans?  It is still too high.  It peaked in early 2013 and is reducing.  It is a very significant metric and it is much too high.</p>

In its answer to Question No. 24, the bank referred members to its answer to Question No. 25.  However, the bank's answer to Question No. 25 does not answer the question.  If, for example, the 20% ratio was introduced, what percentage of the bank's mortgages would qualify?</p>

          <p eId="para_289">It is difficult to give a verified answer to that question because it is somewhat hypothetical.  That is the product we offer.  If, for example, we stated we could no longer offer someone a 90% mortgage, a proportion of our customers would say they were a bit disappointed but would take the 85%.  It is hard to be definitive as to who would not have qualified.  We make an offer to the customers, who state they would like this or that.  When we assess customers, the primary assessment we make is on income capacity.  We see the mortgage as security but as my colleague pointed out in response to an earlier question, we are looking at loans to individuals based on their assessment of their income capacity.  If we look at the multiple in particular, there are two features to that.  We look at the income multiples and the income multiple is the primary criterion under which we assess someone.  If the income multiple does not meet our assessment of a person's ability to repay a mortgage, the loan to value is not a deciding factor.  We start with the income capacity and then consider the potential drags on people's income.  We also then assume that interest rates will not stay the same forever.  We will assume in a sensitivity test that we will add approximately 250 to 300 basis points to make sure that if interest rates rise, a customer's repayment capacity, everything else being equal, still remains sufficient for the customer to service the mortgage.  Thereafter, the loan to value comes into play.  I do not know whether my colleagues wish to add anything to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">If I can help in a different way, I will try to give the definitive answer.  A material proportion of our customers would not qualify because of the loan-to-value cap in particular.  We believe that a lot of our customers would qualify under the income potential but the loan-to-value cap would cap that number.  There is then an obvious concern as to whether customers would take on unsecured or other forms of higher interest-bearing debt to try to deal with that.  This is an obvious issue we would face.  We will be looking at this issue and will decide on whether to make a submission to the Central Bank.  However, in answer to the Deputy's question, the income criteria are more likely not to be the issue for the customer.  It is the loan to value and the ability to get the deposit.</p>

          <p eId="para_297">There is a combination of factors involved.  We go right through the CCMA process to the end.  If we consider the way the mortgage book has evolved, there was a spike in the number of defaults and we restructured as many mortgages as possible.  Inevitably, however, in view of what had happened to the economy and a range of other factors, the issue began to manifest between 2009 and 2011.  There is a factor in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">What does Bank of Ireland do to protect people to ensure they are not thrown out of their homes?  There are two elements to this.  First, there are repossessions of owner-occupied properties and, second, there are repossessions of buy-to-let properties, in respect of which the ratio is significantly higher than the former.  I refer to the example of the Coyne family whose landlord, I accept, was not a Bank of Ireland customer.  However, tenants are being thrown out of their homes because they are being repossessed by the banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">I will provide a very specific example in that regard.  We are selling a portfolio of approximately 1,000 homes on the market, of which some 800 are received buy-to-let properties.  We specifically say in the documentation that where there are existing tenants, they will be protected.  It is a case of buyer beware.  We are of the view that if a person is a tenant and meeting the terms of the lease, it may be better for him or her to deal with a different landlord who has the financial capability to meet his or her commitments as a landlord.  There is some potential in this regard.   People who have greater expenses in other markets are coming into ours and stating, "We can provide and meet our commitments."  If we appoint a receiver for a buy-to-let property, the tenant's lease will be taken by the receiver.  A number of potential buyers are looking at these properties for income purposes.  They see the income potential, the consistency of the tenants and the opportunity involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">In the context of owner-occupiers, it would make certain financial sense for Bank of Ireland to adopt a more aggressive stance in terms of restructuring and repossession because of the fact that prices are increasing and properties would be worth more to it.  Has a more aggressive policy been adopted?  I was contacted in the past week by someone in Tallaght who claimed that Bank of Ireland had initiated repossession proceedings against them in court without any real attempt having been made to negotiate an alternative solution.  In other words, the bank has made a quick move to repossess.</p>

Repossession crystallises losses for us.  The customer's income capacity is the key element to which we give consideration.  Our strategy on restructuring operates in observance of the CCMA, etc., and is defined on the basis of income capacity as opposed to the absolute value of the property.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I welcome Mr. Boucher, Mr. Farrell and Mr. McLoughlin.  I wish to pose two questions, the first of which relates to the standard variable rate and the second to the recent announcement made by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, on loan-to-value ratios.  We have been thrashing out these matters all afternoon and, as I understand it, the position is quite simple.  If a customer is paying at a rate of 4.4% and the bank is borrowing money at 1.5%, the margin of profit for the bank is 3.25%.  What is an acceptable margin of profit for Bank of Ireland in this matter?  Where does the bank stand on the net interest margin?  Is there a level of acceptability of profit and are there circumstances where the bank is taking too much profit and pushing customers too far in the context of the margin to which I refer?</p>

          <p eId="para_306">The overall group margin is 208 basis points.  It has improved, but if it had remained below 200 basis points, we would not be in profit.  That is an important factor.  We are obliged to consider different products in terms of their maturity profiles.  It is important for us to bear in mind the fact that in the context of a mortgage, we are taking deposits short in the market and making a commitment to the customer that we will lend to him or her.  Therefore, we have a liquidity risk.  In our asset classes, mortgages drive the single biggest liquidity risk.  In the context of the UK market, one of the biggest strategic mistakes the bank made and our largest single issue was related to the liquidity risk it faced with its mortgage book there.  We had grown the book, depended on securitisation markets and taken money on a three to five year basis.  Liquidity risk is a factor.</p>

          <p eId="para_308">My point is that if one considers the position on a specific product, what the Deputy is saying might be true.  However, we are obliged to look at the liquidity risk right across our profile.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">I understand that.  No one is going to buy a house for €200,000 tomorrow morning.  People buy houses over a 20 or 30 year period, with an APR, a fixed rate or a tracker rate applying.  The net sum of the final payment will be the actual amount a customer pays for his or her house.  A mortgage has a running rate over its lifetime, as does the margin.  At present, the margin is 3.25%.  I understand the bank is obliged to make a profit, but I want to know if a review is required of the current level of profit.  When Mr. Boucher appeared before the committee previously, we dealt with the issue of split mortgages and the manner in which Bank of Ireland was dealing with them.  At the time it was retaining the interest on the warehouse portion of mortgages to the full extent.  Mr. Boucher went away and reviewed the position and the bank then reduced the margin of profit on the split side of mortgages.  In this instance Mr. Boucher needs to take the same approach because the margin of 3.25% is very profitable for the bank.</p>

However, I cannot make an absolute commitment on how we price our products.  I gave a commitment on the previous occasion to consider the position because I figured we could do something.  However, I cannot make a commitment to the committee in respect of how we price products.  It would be disingenuous for me to leave anyone with the impression that I might be in a position to take action in that regard.  We consider our products on an ongoing basis in order to ensure they are competitive and sustainable and that we can obtain good returns on them.  If our products are uncompetitive, the bank, as a business, suffers.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, recently made a significant announcement on loan-to-value ratios.  It now seems that if someone wants to purchase a property, he or she must come up with a deposit of 20% of the overall amount involved.  In the aftermath of the announcement to which I refer, has Bank of Ireland adopted a formal position or indicated what its position is likely to be in this matter?</p>

We have not made a decision on whether we will make a submission or the form such a submission will take if we do decide to make one.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">Those at this table, regardless of whether they are Government or Opposition Members or representatives of the bank, and people who are watching proceedings from outside are of the view that, despite the housing crisis, the citizens of Ireland are going to continue to purchase homes.  In order to be sustainable, the housing market must be open to first-time buyers.  However, such buyers come with high loan-to-value risks attached.  In that context, the 80:20 ratio announced by the Governor of the Central Bank presents a difficulty.  In the past people ignored the regulator and the Central Bank and we know to where that led.  There is a great deal of merit in what the Governor of the Central Bank is saying.  In that context, is there a need to consider putting in place a different type of mortgage product which would reduce the risk involved and permit financial institutions to lend above the loan-to-value ratio for mortgages?</p>
          <p eId="para_314">This would permit lenders to loan above the loan-to-value rate of mortgages. I say this on the basis that some kind of mortgage insurance is in place, as is the position in Canada and the Netherlands. Canada is significant as it did not experience a housing bubble like Ireland. Will Bank of Ireland consider a different type of mortgage that will facilitate first-time buyers and meet the Central Bank's criteria? It would have to contain an insurance caveat.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">We have operated in markets where there is insurance and it is something we will consider.  One must be very careful when it comes to counter parties because one does not expect mortgages to go bad next year.  Effectively, a person is taking a risk that the Central Bank does not want the person to take.  If people are prepared to take the risk what will they be paid and will they answer if they are called?  We have seen such markets operate and are interested in assessing such a proposal.  If it can work we will participate but the counter party risk is an important consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">Our primary focus is income capacity and potential when assessing mortgages.  We recognise that this is a difficult area and we are concerned that if people cannot obtain finance from a mortgage they will seek other sources of expensive, short-term finance.  This has been a feature of the market in the past.  If we make a proposal we like it to be carefully considered and supported.  Income potential is our primary consideration.  By definition, first-time buyers are starting out in life and have less ability to amass cash.</p>

          <p eId="para_318">I welcome the witnesses and share Deputy Lynch's view on concerns relating to the Central Bank's statement on access to home ownership.  I am interested in the comments that were made on an insurance product and it has been noted today that such insurance products were quite common in the 1980s and 1990s.  The loan-to-value ratio was lower in those cases.  I am concerned about the ability of people in contract employment to access funding.  Could the witnesses come back to the committee on how such a product could work in the market?  The Minister for Finance has asked the committee to consider the recommendations of the Central Bank and we should broaden our net as far as possible.  The level of home ownership in Ireland is almost at an all-time low - it has dropped by over 10% in the past five to seven years and that is spectacular.</p>

Are the witnesses aware of a report published recently by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, in association with DKM Economic Consultants, Red C and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI?  It recommended an amendment be made to the forthcoming Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill to clarify legislation on properties in the hands of receivers, be they rent receivers or otherwise.  The amendment would see receivers step into the shoes of landlords and acquire all of his or her obligations for the avoidance of doubt.  Do the witnesses have a view on this PRTB recommendation?

          <p eId="para_327">We think clarity is appropriate when a receiver steps into a contract.  We have a big business in the UK, including a buy-to-let business.  We are aware of the concept of one-year secure tenancies and the attached obligations and arrangements.  A move towards rental properties will become a feature of the market in future no matter what we do as society is moving in that direction.  There will be more professional landlords.  International companies that specialise in this area see opportunities in Ireland and this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Large companies have the capabilities and expertise to meet obligations as landlords because they see the area as a business.  To run a business properly they need tenants to pay rent and they need tenants to be comfortable in making such payments.  For this to happen such large companies must meet their obligations.  I believe the rental system will evolve to include larger entities that want contracts and certainty.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">I am setting a scene.  We are now fast forwarding five and a half years, because that was the court of directors then and this is the court of directors now.  This is key for today's setting and conversation because we can all get lost in the micro-management of the balance sheets, funding and arrears and so on.  On page 62 of Mr. Boucher's submission today, look at the court of directors at the top of that pyramid and see what their key responsibilities are.  I am suggesting that Mr. Boucher should have had the governor and a couple of non-executive directors here with him today.  I am going to go through them with him and ask him to see the point that is being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">  On top of the risk pyramid of a €125 billion or €130 billion balance sheet, the board has the ultimate oversight and accountability for the risk and related control environment in the group. It is responsible for reviewing and approving risk appetites, risk framework and policies.  All the detail in here this afternoon has been about the execution of those policies.  Mr. Boucher has hesitated and ultimately refused to answer Deputy Doherty's question as to whether there are no write-offs in cases where the loan had originally been secured but the security is insufficient.  The loan has had full examination and stretching in order to be repaid by the customer and there are no write-offs.  That is a credit policy.  </p>
          <p eId="para_346">  We will go through the members of the court of directors. Governor Archie Kane has been a year and a half in the Bank of Ireland and he comes from England,  from Lloyd's Bank.  Kent Atkinson, director number two, comes from England again, and has also been at Lloyd's.  Mr. Boucher himself is the longest-serving member of the court at seven and a half years.  Next is Pat Butler, who has previously worked mainly with McKinsey and abroad, and has been on the court of directors for two years.  There is only one lady and she is English.  I would say that there are very few Irish experienced people on that board in terms of understanding the effects on the people of Ireland of all the bank's algebra and accountancy.  </p>
          <p eId="para_347">  I will go back to that day in March 2009, when Bank of Ireland got €3.5 billion of preference share injections to keep the group alive.  That was the right thing to do.  But it is not acceptable to be insensitive to the customers of the bank.  In Ireland we have €20 billion or so in mortgage loans on residences.  How many thousand loans are in that?  Is it ninety-something thousand?</p>

          <p eId="para_350">This is totally unfair, and the Chairman knows very well why.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">  Of those mortgage loans, if there are 160,000 clients - call it 150,000 - there are about three and a half people per loan affected who are living in those houses.  That is half a million people.  There have been a lot of suicides, deaths and illnesses because of the unreasonable stress.  Income, or the capacity to repay, is the primary thing the bank considers when it considers loans.  If Mr. Boucher lost his job tomorrow he would have no income.  He should think about that and about the people who have no incomes because they had to take reductions, lost their jobs or have had to emigrate.  </p>
          <p eId="para_352">  There has to be far more accountability, as the top of that pyramid in Mr. Boucher's presentation says.  I am a bit passionate about this, but it is very justifiable passion.  In this world, we all have to do what is right with our lives, not just what the algebra says can be done.  Mr. Boucher said at one stage that we have to try harder.  Who is "we"?  Why is there only one lady on the court of directors?  Ladies represent at least half the households of the 150,000 customers.  </p>

          <p eId="para_355">The total is €16.4 billion of defaulted loans of which our coverage ratio is about 50%, so it is roughly €8.2 billion.  I do not have the figure in front of me but I will confirm it for the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">That is very important and I will say why.  It is because if the management of the bank messes around with provisions, increasing them or writing them back depending on the policy on whether or not to write off, and depending on the value in the loan-to-value algebra - by the way, what is "value"?  Where do the values for these properties come from?</p>

Picking up where Senator Hayden left off, figures released by the Irish Mortgage Holders Association, IMHO, this week are very impressive. The collaboration between the IMHO and AIB is very successful and I would be interested to hear Mr. Boucher's thoughts on that.  Might Bank of Ireland consider a similar arrangement?  I believe 1,330 mortgage issues have found long-term resolutions in less than 12 months and almost 500 of those involve people who were actually faced with losing their homes.  They have managed to resolve their difficulties through mediation between the IMHO and AIB.  I feel strongly that it would be in the interests of Bank of Ireland as well as its customers to consider a similar approach.</p>

It is not for me to talk about AIB's policies, but certainly €5.4 billion in defaulted loans is a big issue and assistance is required.  We use third parties, although we do not often name them, who assist us.  AIB is using one third party, they have a very significant issue and that is their decision.</p>

I presented the bank's pitch book, which was a publicly disclosed document.  We then had roughly 20 investors, and different investors expressed sufficient interest at that time, in our opinion because the Department of Finance was underwriting it and they could depend on the Department of Finance to have the wherewithal to follow through their investment.  Certain criteria were set out for the investors, including that the Government would not backstop any investment.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">We had to confirm to the Department and to the State as the underwriter, that we would like to let these people move to the next stage, due diligence.  They signed non-disclosure agreements.  As part of signing such an agreement, if they decided not to proceed with their investment they could not trade in the bank stock or any bonds related to the stock for a period of six months.  Entering into due diligence is a very important consideration for a potential investor because they are potentially locking themselves out of a market.  Those investors then met a number of my colleagues.  I was the chief executive, so I was intensely involved in the meetings with all investors.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">It was probably more us, but the Department of Finance was the underwriter, so before we said we would allow someone to look at due diligence, we had to ensure that the Department of Finance did not have a specific issue.  It was not involved in the pitching of the bank's story.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">One of the things to note about the investors is that they were not acting in concert.  They were different investors.  They are different types of companies.  That was made very clear to the shareholders and was confirmed by the Stock Exchange.  The core investors were Capital and Fidelity - each either the second or third biggest fund managers in the world.  They would have made a separate investment.  Because of the nature of the investment at the time, which was in the middle of a rights issue, the investors had to come together for the specific purpose of taking up the stock.  The investors have confirmed, to the Stock Exchange and to their own regulators, that they did not act together.</p>

Under the troika programme, which is now concluded, there was provision for a central credit register, to be established as one of the key reforms in the financial sector.  The legislation was passed in 2013 but the roll-out of the central credit register has been delayed.  Can Mr. Boucher advise what impact, if any, that has on the bank's operations, its capacity to make lending decisions and its assessment of customers' creditworthiness?  Does he have a view on whether it would be helpful if that were introduced?</p>

          <p eId="para_415">We see a credit register as being very important.  It is a hindrance at the moment because unsecured credit is not verified.  In the other countries we operate in, and in most countries in the world, there is a credit register, where the providers of credit are registered so that people know.  It would certainly assist our underwriting process.  In particular, it might assist with challenge credit management.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">I wish to raise the issue of many homeowners who, in a sense, are trapped in the property they are in because they are in negative equity.  They might have a tracker mortgage rate.  Bank of Ireland introduced a product in April 2013 for people on tracker mortgages who wish to move so that if they qualify for a mortgage they can keep the tracker rate plus 1% for five years on that original portion of the mortgage and any additional mortgage is at the variable rate.  The uptake seems to be quite poor.  Bank of Ireland has approved about 400 cases and about one third have been drawn down.  Would Bank of Ireland be willing to review that product to see if it could be made more attractive?  Surely from the bank's point of view, if it is lending additional money to creditworthy customers that money will be at a variable rate, so it will be making a profit on that and clearly it would be transformative for many people in that situation.  Could he comment on that and a related issue of people in negative equity who may be trapped in apartments with two or three children, a completely unsuitable environment for such families?  What help is the bank giving to people in that situation to move if they can qualify for a mortgage?</p>

          <p eId="para_422">We introduced that product in April 2013 in response to extensive customer research on the needs of customers in tracker mortgages.  There have been over 400 applications under the standard terms, which are a five-year product with a 1% uplift in rate.  The reason, we feel from customer feedback, that only one third have drawn down is that they are struggling to find the right house for themselves.  They have approval and that approval stands, but they cannot find the appropriate property to move into, so it is a supply challenge in the first instance.  We are not getting feedback on the product itself.  There are different products in the marketplace from other suppliers that have been launched in the second half of 2014 but they are all about the same.  It is predominantly a supply issue, particularly in the Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">  On negative equity, we also introduced last year negative equity trade up-trade down for customers and those products are of a similar nature and have proved to be quite popular for customers who are in that situation but we will give negative equity loans in those situations where customers are in difficulty up to 175% loan-to-value, LTV.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">I just want to ask a technical question.  If someone is on a variable mortgage and when they got the mortgage they were in a certain LTV bracket of maybe over 80% but some years later the property value has increased, they have more equity in the property and they fall into a lower LTV band, which would attract a lower interest rate, can they revise what band they are in or are they fixed in the band at which they entered when the mortgage was drawn down?</p>

          <p eId="para_431">Could I ask the bank what impact the introduction of non-recourse lending would have in Ireland? Would it have an impact on interest rates and the bank's disposition towards risk? It strikes me that if people are being required to stump up a deposit of 20%, there should also be a commitment on the part of the bank that the borrower's liability would end with the property.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">Many questions I have about the banking sector are directed more to the Government than to individual banks.  However, I have a few questions for Mr. Boucher.  Does he accept the proposition that his bank, along with others but his would be at the top of the league table, is profiteering in terms of the interest rates it is charging on loans compared to its European counterparts?  This was raised earlier but I was not present, and I apologise for that.  The evidence from the briefing we were given is that the bank is engaged in serious profiteering in respect of the interest rates being charged, compared to what banks in the rest of Europe are doing.  How would Mr. Boucher respond to that?  How does he consider it morally justifiable, given that the bank would not exist today without the bailout it was given by ordinary citizens of this country?</p>

          <p eId="para_448">The Deputy would not expect me to concur with his assertions, but I will outline some facts.  Our net interest margin is 2.08% across the group.  If one compares that with banks in Britain, the US and many European banks, it is a low net interest margin.  Relative to that, it is a recovering net interest margin, but it would not be construed as an exceptional net interest margin.  That is a fact.  There are different funding structures, different loss experiences and a range of things that impact on banks' pricing models.  We compete for our business in Ireland and for our business in the UK, continental Europe and in the US in different parts of our businesses.  We compete on the basis that we want our customers for the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">  We must have products that are sustainable.  We have seen entrants into markets, including this market, who have had unsustainable business models.  They come in with pricing structures or business models that just do not work and they leave or collapse.  Some of our competitors have collapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">  As to the Irish taxpayer, one of the key focuses of this bank, perhaps distinguishing it from other banks, is the absolute focus we had on repaying the State aid and to bring the taxpayers a profit.  The taxpayers have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">What we have returned to taxpayers is cash that can be used for other purposes. Banks should never have been supported by or needed support from taxpayers. We must ensure we put structures in place to make sure that will never happen again. Part of the way we have to think about running our business involves the return of taxpayers' cash for them to do what they like with it, which is very important. This has been at the heart and a key component of our strategy in the past six years. To be quite frank, I do not see the same attention in other banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">There are very different features.  In particular, in a lot of European markets there are state-sponsored and taxpayer subsidised bond schemes such as in the internal Pfandbriefe bond market in Germany.  Similar schemes are operated in the United States - the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac schemes.  Our contiguous market with the same structures, in particular in terms of access to bond markets, loss experiences, etc., is the United Kingdom where there are equivalent broad spreads.  It has a different currency, but the base rates are not and do not look a lot different.  Let us look at the pricing of all of our products.  Our net interest margin is 2.08%.</p>

          <p eId="para_458">It probably comes back to what I said earlier - my beef with how banking works here has more to do with the Government and its policies.  Mr. Boucher made an interesting comparison between the Europe-Irish and Europe models.  It bears more discussion, but, unfortunately, we do not have the time to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">  I wish to ask about two related matters.  First, there is the matter of repossessions, voluntary surrenders, not just of principal private dwellings but also of buy-to-lets and so on, and the fact that a lot of people have been forced to give up their homes or are being put out of them by receivers.  Why do banks require tenants who are paying rent to be put out?</p>
          <p eId="para_460">  I have not read all of Mr. Boucher's document, but he has said Bank of Ireland is now one of the biggest or possibly the biggest lender to the construction and property and corporate sectors.  He has trumpeted the fact that it is engaged in a lot of lending in these areas.  I put two and two together and it seems all of this property has been made vacant as receivers move in and that commercial property is being bought up by others who are presumably financed by banks like Mr. Boucher's.  Banks get control of this property and in the meantime tenants are put out.  Rents are then jacked up, which is great for the people to whom he lends and the bank, but the consequence is a housing crisis and another property bubble.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">The Deputy could not expect me to agree with him.  Let me give a specific example.  If we appoint a rent receiver to a property to get the rent which is being diverted to the landlord, to whom we have lent the money, we have a vested interest in keeping the income flowing.  I mentioned the thought process in response to an earlier question.  We are  selling a portfolio of approximately 1,000 properties, of which about 800 are buy-to-lets.  We specifically say in the document that we have said to potential acquirers that it is tenancy protected where there are tenants.  For the buyer, it is <i>caveat emptor</i>, as he or she knows the tenants are protected.</p>

However, there has been a significant tightening of corporate governance procedures by quoted companies.  We are quoted on the Stock Exchange.  Bank directors must now be approved by the board of the Central Bank.  They go through a comprehensive and extensive process.  It was public knowledge that my position as chief executive of the bank had been reviewed by a third party on behalf of the Central Bank.  It had analysed my role before the crisis and whether I was a fit and proper person to be chief executive.  There was an independent third party report compiled for the Central Bank.  It is called the fit and proper regime, a regime which applies in the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>

Its a model where the bank must be self-funded and each of our businesses, including Mr. McLoughlin's, Retail Ireland, our UK business and corporate business, is self-funded.

          <p eId="para_491">In our case, we do our own internal stress testing.  We ensure we have enough capital to protect ourselves and our depositors and to meet our strategic ambitions.  The outcome of the stress tests did not come as a big surprise to Bank of Ireland because it had its own internal capital models; therefore, the availability of capital and funding for at least the past two years had not been an impediment to our lending desires.  We had put out to the market that our strategic plan, our own internal stress testing, would have us lending approximately €33 billion in new money into the economy in the period from 2013 to 2017.  Passing the stress tests was nice and it was an important part of the regulatory process, but it would not have had a material impact.  Obviously, if we had failed, it would have had us in a very different context but passing did not mean that the desire or credit appetite changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">  One of the most important responsibilities I have relates to the fact that we have private sector capital, which was injected into Bank of Ireland.  They were not people who felt sorry for the bank but people who believed in the Irish recovery and that the bank could participate in that recovery.  They expect us to deploy that capital; that capital can only be constructively deployed by us in lending new money safely.  A significant pressure on us as a management team is to safely deploy our shareholders' capital because if we do not deploy it appropriately, they will sell their shares and put the money where better opportunities can be found.  That is how the private sector works.  There is a significant strategic requirement on us to lend into the economy.  What we must do is make sure it is safe and sustainable.</p>

We account for over 50% of new lending into the economy.  A feature has been the fact that a lot of our new to bank lending would have involved a refinancing of people from other banks.  A particular feature we have noticed since March 2014, particularly in the SME business that comes within Mr. McLoughlin's remit, is that over 50% of our new lending involves customers who are doing new things rather than refinancing or rearranging their finances with banks exiting or where they are uncomfortable, etc.  That is an important component of the recovery.  Bank lending tends to track behind economic recovery and then to go a little beyond GDP.  Our ambition is to beat GDP.  We hope we have competitive propositions and that we are extremely focused on the market.  We lend to all sectors and have particular features.  We are lending over 50% of new money to the economy.  We reported in our pre-close statement on Friday that the pace of new lending was picking up also.</p>

          <p eId="para_495">On the construction sector and the supply side problem in the marketplace, some of the builders left standing have come to us with stories to the effect that they could make a significant contribution to dealing with the supply deficit if the bank would carry them for the 12 to 18 months needed to clear a site, deal with planning, get the design work and all of the other things that need to be done completed, but, again, the banks generally have not been forthcoming, whether it is related to the stress tests or another reason, and that work on sites that might have been developed in the past 12 months or in the immediate future are not being facilitated because the banks will not carry them.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">We see it as an important sector.  We think lending to that sector must be balanced and kept as a proportion of our balance sheet and that we must manage the risk.  Nevertheless, it is a sector in which we want to participate.  One of the key ingredients that may be missing in some instances is equity.  We will provide 65% or 70% of the finance, but if we end up with equity in a business, things have gone badly wrong for us and the customer.  We are not equity providers.  I will set out a simple sum.  If we provide €1 in equity capital, that deprives us of €10 worth of lending capacity because it is like for like on capital; there is that multiplier impact.  In addition and to be quite frank, we do not have the skills set.  We hope we have a better skills set in lending, but it is quite a different skills set in the case of equity.  We are seeing funds coming in with mezzanine debt, which is higher coupon and a more risky form of debt; therefore, if we provide a figure of 70%, one will have a mezzanine provider who will have a much higher debt and provide 15% but one still needs equity of 15%.  However, I do see funds coming in.</p>

          <p eId="para_522">One of the key things is the subject about which we have just been talking - the funding structure.  The banks should really fund their loan books from customer deposits.  The capital structures are very different.  At the time, banks throughout the world had capital ratios of approximately 5% or 6%.  We are running at approximately 14%.  That is the level of capital we have available.  We have restructured the way in which our boards function.  We have a very specific risk committee.  We looked at one of our problems or issues - the structure of our balance sheet in percentage terms.  When one's balance sheet is very big, it has the potential to fall and we have shrunk the business.  We have had to get out of businesses in which the asset selection was good but we could not support capital liquidity.</p>

          <p eId="para_542">I would like to begin by making some observations and asking some questions in this big context.  The officials are here to give an overview of the banking sector in Ireland.  That is their calling card and they have kindly given us a great deal of material - financial details and percentages, etc. - running to over 80 pages.  I have tried to bring everyone back to our core responsibility of who devises the policies and strategies of the Bank of Ireland group.  I have made the point that most of the court of directors are unrepresentative of Irish households and short on experience of Ireland, in terms of its finance, economy and demographics and everything that accompanied the collapse of the economy.  It is easy to be remote and distant and not to see the impact of what happens when one is in a boardroom and how it translates in people's homes.  The figures show that for every household or customer mortgage in distress, the lives of at least three people are being ripped apart.  That is the average, but sometimes four or more are affected.  It is a serious matter and up to those who understand the machinery of balance sheets, portfolios and ledgers and how it happened to deal with it.  I applaud them for getting the group's loan-to-deposit ratio down to 111%, which is the right figure for the group.</p>

          <p eId="para_544">I think it was between 158% and 161% between March 2008 and March 2009, which was shocking.  If we take a 160% figure and measure it against the surplus using the 90% figure, the prudential, steady-Eddie bank balance sheet management amount, we will see that the average is 70%.  That figure - 70% - is the keel that should have been obtained if things had not gone out of control over seven years up to 2008 and represents measurable culpability of 75% on the part of the partial creators of the asset price bubble which had developed on the back of the credit pyramid bubble.  That is simple.  Ann and Barry readers could explain it and we do not need a banking inquiry to tell us that.  The banks, particularly the court of directors at the top of the pyramid, were culpable in those seven years.  The auditors were also culpable.  They should have been saying, "Guys, stop expanding your balance sheet at this unsustainable rate."  I will explain why.  </p>
          <p eId="para_545">  I am sure the delegates have read Tim Geithner's book <i>Stress Test</i>, a good name, which has been out for a couple of months.  In it Mr. Geithner writes about the size of the domestic banking sector in the United States, which is just over 100% of GDP, or $12 trillion.  In Ireland the culpability of the boards of banks collectively and AIB specifically is measurable because the weighted average loan to deposit figure was 173% across the Irish-owned banks.  The banking system went from three times to over five times the size of national income.  That is the credit pyramid and that is what the banks did.  We know what they are now saying to the people whose asset prices collapsed.  By the way, the 23% figure is illusory, as I said.  It is not true because the prices of these transactions do not represent the volume of transactions.  In the same way, Bank of Ireland share price today - 30 cent - when multiplied by the shares outstanding does not equal the market value of Bank of Ireland.  Similarly, the 23% figure that is based on a few transactions in Dublin does not apply to the whole property market and the banks have a responsibility to tell the Government that, as they are at the coal-face of the experience, as Mr. Boucher knows.</p>

          <p eId="para_563">My questions are about lending in the property, housing and construction sector.  I want to get my head around what is happening in that sector at the moment.  Will Mr. Boucher explain how he is making decisions about lending to property developers at the moment, what proportion is given to them of the finance they need to carry out a construction development and what criteria are being used?  My concern is that we would repeat all the mistakes of the past.  How is that working?  Is the bank lending to people to buy up property that was left over from the collapse?  How is that working?   In the document, there is reference to working in terms of public private partnerships.  Will Mr. Boucher say something about the types of public private partnerships in which the bank is collaborating and how that works?  What is the balance between its involvement and that of the State sector?  Could he give some examples?</p>

          <p eId="para_564">First of all, on the issue of lessons and things we do not do - which is worse, what you do do and what you do not do?  We do not finance landbank acquisitions in the construction sector.  They should be financed by equity.   The maximum loan-to-value rate would be somewhere between 65% and 70%.  We need to see pre-sales for the commercial market, but we recognise it is not possible to get pre-sales in the residential market.  Those are key criteria.  We also do not do an equity release from the single property nor do we lend against an uplift in value.  Those are some of the lessons we learned.  One of the other big lessons from the past is the need to keep an eye on the peripheral vision of the market.  We thought we could work our way out of certain situations.  We were not as conscious of to what was going on in other banks.  That was a mistake we made.</p>

          <p eId="para_566">On the public private partnerships we have been involved in, there is the N7 project and some schools financing, where we finance the constructor in partnership and then we do a long-term term-out loan for the operation of the thing.  There is an equity participation.  With the constructor or contractor, we take an element of the construction risk - that it can be completed - and we take the trading or take-on risk.</p>
