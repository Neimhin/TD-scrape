          <p eId="para_16">I welcome Mr. Jim Brown, chief executive of Ulster Bank, who is accompanied by Mr. Paul Stanley, chief financial officer, and Mr. Stephen Bell, chief risk officer. The format of the meeting is that Mr. Brown will make an opening statement. In advance of the meeting, we collated questions from members and submitted these to Ulster Bank. I thank Mr. Brown and his staff for their responses in writing to these queries, which we received last Monday. The responses have been distributed to members. Together with the input of our witnesses today, I hope all the key topics will be covered. None the less, a question and answer session will follow to clarify any matter that might arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>

          <from> Mr. Jim Brown<recordedTime time="2015-04-29T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_19">I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Paul Stanley, chief financial officer, and Mr. Stephen Bell, chief risk officer. I thank members of the committee for their invitation to appear before them. I will go through our opening statement relatively quickly and will then respond to any specific issues the committee wishes to address. Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, is committed to Ulster Bank. It is unique in the market as the only internationally owned systemic bank that operates across the island of Ireland. We employ over 5,200 people, have a network of 175 branches and serve almost 2 million customers. We have lent in excess of €31 billion across the island of Ireland and hold €26 billion in customer deposits. </p>
          <p eId="para_20"> In 2014 lending activity increased by 38% with €1.4 billion of new lending facilities to business customers and a further €900 million in personal lending. I am pleased to say this strong performance has continued into 2015. We have submitted our responses to the committee's questionnaire and look forward to discussing this over the course of our appearance here. Before we go into further detail, I would like to make a few comments regarding mortgage arrears and our standard variable mortgage interest rates, areas which are of particular interest to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> Ulster Bank has made significant progress in helping 22,000 customers resolve their mortgage difficulties. Approximately 2,000 customers, however, will neither pay their mortgage nor engage with us. We believe this group of customers can be helped if they can be persuaded to engage with us. As members have seen in our submission, we have published our commitments this week to encourage engagement and emphasise to customers in arrears that we have solutions, will help them and treat them fairly. We can all agree that there is a cost to living in a home and that it is unacceptable for a borrower to make no payment whatsoever towards the cost of his or her accommodation. Therefore, the mortgage payment must be regularised or we must enforce our security.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> It is Ulster Bank's belief that its standard variable rate, SVR, is not overpriced. The current narrative that the SVR minus the European Central Bank, ECB, rate equals margin is simply incorrect. There is a range of other costs that must be factored into the SVR and these costs are substantially higher in Ireland when compared with other markets in which Ulster Bank and RBS operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Ulster Bank recently recorded an operating profit of €752 million for 2014, representing the first annual profit since 2008. This performance was driven by the underlying strength of the core Ulster Bank franchise, increased lending to customers, proactive management of our legacy issues, coupled with an overall improvement in the economy and the property market. Our customers' requirements are also changing with digital transactions now representing 57% of our total transaction volumes.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">We are also investing in our physical distribution, including a recent announcement with our arrangement with An Post providing customers with an additional 1,100 new points of presence. </p>
          <p eId="para_25"> We have made significant progress in addressing and resolving our mortgage arrears issues. From the outset our objective has been and is, to keep customers in their homes. We have achieved month-on-month reductions in mortgage arrears every month for the past 25 months. To date, 10,000 customers who were in arrears are now up to date and paying and a further 12,000 customers are on alternative solutions. Of these 22,000 cases only five personal insolvency proposals were vetoed by Ulster Bank in 2014 and these were due to their specific circumstances. It is disappointing, however, and notwithstanding the progress made to date, that approximately 2,000 customers will neither talk to us nor pay their mortgage, despite our efforts and the efforts of the Government, the Central Bank, the insolvency service and the courts, to encourage engagement. In a further effort to engage with these customers, we have recently launched our commitments to customers in arrears which give specific assurance that these customers will be treated fairly. With engagement we believe that satisfactory arrangements can be found for the vast majority of these customers. There are no circumstances where we or society in general can sustain or justify a situation where a mortgage holder continues to make no contribution towards the cost of his or her accommodation. As I said earlier, there is a cost to living in a home and this must be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> In the absence of engagement and where no repayment is being made, we are left with no alternative but to continue with legal proceedings. This is not a good outcome for anyone as the legal process does not generally provide any realistic alternative other than repossession. Any further initiatives in this area must ensure that secured lending remains prioritised over unsecured lending in all repayment situations. If secured mortgage debt is treated with similar or lesser status to unsecured lending, then inevitably the cost of mortgage lending will increase as it becomes quasi-secured debt. In making this argument we recognise and accept that unsecured lending by banks should be treated in the same way as all other unsecured lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Within the wider RBS, mortgage lending is an important part of our offering in all our main markets, including England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland. Broadly speaking the interest margins in all of these markets is similar. However, unlike the other markets, our mortgage book in Ireland has been loss-making. Notwithstanding this fact and reflecting our commitment to the market, we have been progressively reducing our variable interest rates to both our existing and new customers. Separately, the cost of providing mortgage finance reflects the cost of our capital funding, operations, compliance, management of arrears, credit losses and levies. Virtually every one of these inputs in Ireland is substantially higher when compared to other markets in which Ulster Bank and RBS operate. In this context, we do not believe that our SVR is overpriced.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> I reiterate that we continue to make significant progress in helping customers in financial difficulties and we are confident that we can help any remaining customers who are in difficulty if they are prepared to engage. However, in the absence of engagement and where there is no regular payment, we are left with very little alternative but to go through the court process.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Second, our standard variable rate is not overpriced. The cost of providing mortgage finance in Ireland is substantially higher than in other jurisdictions in which Ulster Bank and RBS operate. Third, RBS is committed to Ulster Bank and it is unique in the market as an internationally owned systemic bank that operates across the island of Ireland. Ulster Bank looks forward to continuing to support personal and business customers and the broader economy, both now and into the future. I am happy to take any questions from members.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">Before we begin the question and answer session I propose that we adhere to some of the usual ground rules. Heretofore the arrangement has been that the lead spokesperson for each party will be allocated a total of ten minutes interaction with those giving evidence while other members may avail of five minutes each. This session will conclude at 4 p.m. to allow for witnesses from Bank of Ireland. We will keep an eye on the clock and indicate when one minute speaking time remains. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I welcome Mr. Brown and his colleagues to the meeting. I wish to deal with the point made by Mr. Brown that the cost of providing mortgage finance in Ireland is substantially higher than in other jurisdictions in which Ulster Bank and RBS operate. It is my understanding that the lowest three-year rate for a borrower in the Republic is 3.65%. However, a person in the same loan-to-value can borrow at 1.49% fixed rate in Northern Ireland. Is that correct and can there be that level of a difference, which is more than 100%, going from 1.5% to 3.5%?</p>

The comments I made were with regard to standard variable rates and there is a consistency in rates between the two markets for fixed rates depending on the term of the loan. It is correct that depending on the loan-to-value ratio and other credit criteria there can be differences in rates.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">As I said it depends on the term for which the customer is taking out the loan. It also depends on the loan-to-value ratio, the value of the lending against the home, the underlying security. The risk can be higher or lower so that impacts pricing as well. It also depends on the customer's individual credit criteria. There are a number of criteria that could impact on the difference in rate. This also applies to our standard variable rates here in the Republic of Ireland. Our standard rate is 4.3% but customers can get lower interest rates depending on the loan-to-value they borrow against.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I use the standard variable rate as a good example across both markets, looking at the rates that Ulster Bank charges in Northern Ireland as well as the rates that are charged by RBS NatWest in the rest of Great Britain. There is very little difference between the rates that we charge and there is very little difference between the cost of funds across those lines. The margin is more or less similar. However, there is a distinct difference in terms of providing the cost of the mortgage to customers here. As I mentioned in my opening statement, capital operational costs, the cost of servicing arrears, the cost of funds, etc., are all significantly higher in this market.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">I would be happy to try to develop that point. When banks are looking at the capital they have to put behind particular assets, they have to look at the historical performance of the business. It is a regulation and accounting requirement matter. It is not something we choose to do, it is a matter that is required of us as a prudential institution. Looking at the loss history and the loss performance of the portfolio in the Republic of Ireland, we end up with a significantly higher risk-weighted asset percentage applying to a mortgage in the Republic of Ireland than we do in Northern Ireland, England, Wales or Scotland. That is effectively something that will change over time as the historical loss performance washes through, but at this point in time, the models we are using and the calculations we are making require us to hold multiple times the capital more for the same risk in the Republic.</p>

We recognise the importance of a physical distribution network, hence the reason we enter into what we think is a very important relationship with An Post so that our customers have access not just to the 175 branches but now have access to another 1,100 outlets as well.

          <p eId="para_82">In regard to the 2,000 customers, this is an approximate number of customers who are already in the legal process. We have stated our policy that where a person who is 90 days in arrears and has not engaged with the bank, we would have to initiate legal action. It is the responsible thing to do. We are using the commitments we made on Monday to encourage people who may have thought it is too late, because the legal process has commenced that it is not too late to deal with the bank. We want to encourage them by saying it is never too late. It is only too late when the judge finally announces an eviction date, which is something we want to avoid at all costs. We have ensured that at every court hearing there is a representative of the bank available so if the customer arrives at the court process wishing to engage we can pick up with them there and then. We have adjourned hearings in the past because the customer has approached us prior to the hearing, saying they would like to talk to us about a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> The overwhelming message about the commitments we made is that engagement is critical and it is never too late to engage. We think it is important to recognise that the kind of payments we are looking for when a restructured home loan repayment is agreed will be substantially less, by some margin, than an equivalent private rental cost. The reason for our comments regarding eligibility for social housing is because of the income level that would be relevant for that consideration. There is absolutely no way we are able to restructure the mortgage so that it becomes affordable for somebody at that level of income. We think it is the responsible thing to do to say that if somebody's financial circumstances have deteriorated so much that they are reliant on the State to provide housing, it would be irresponsible of us to pursue them for a shortfall after the property has been sold. Where somebody in our opinion is perfectly able to service a restructured home loan and simply does not wish to, then if the end of that process is the sale of the property, we would look at recovery of the shortfall. We think that is the right thing to do because if the customer had engaged, we believe we could find a solution which would have kept them in the home, which is absolutely our first priority at all times.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">Senator Coghlan had another question about the components of the margin and the costs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_56">
          <from> Mr. Paul Stanley<recordedTime time="2015-04-29T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_87">I will take that question. One of the specific components would be the capital. During a previous response to questioning, I spoke about capital. The other component is funding. Let me clarify a point on funding. We are a subsidiary bank of a parent and as part of our financial disclosures, we do not have the same levels of disclosures as one would see in AIB or Bank of Ireland. AIB would have given a fair bit of detail on its funding rate. We have indicated in the response that, given we are in the same market, our funding levels are not that dissimilar from those that are disclosed by the other banks. Our parent will obviously have a full disclosure similar to the likes of those banks, and that is available in their accounts. That is a matter for their operations but we have to fund ourselves in the Irish market.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> When we take those funding costs away from the 4.3% standard rate, taking the standard variable rate as an example, the margin we end up with in the market will be about 300 basis points before we take all our other costs, capital and everything else from those. That is a very similar margin to what we are earning in the North of Ireland in Ulster Bank's own operations. It is a similar margin to what RBS earns in its domestic markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> The other component elements would be standard operation costs for running the mortgage areas and running the arrears areas as well. We have to attribute a portfolio element of credit losses. We do not make an assumption, despite the difficulties that may exist from a legal perspective, in terms of recovery in the market. We make a run rate or normalised assumption as to what the portfolio would attract by way of credit losses in a normal market. These are probably the main principal components, and while there is a little bit for levies and other items, these are the principal items.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">In their response to question 46, the witnesses state that unlike other markets, their mortgage book, both tracker and standard variable rate, has been loss marking. That seems a remarkable admission. Is it the case that the mortgage business as it currently stands is unsustainable? Does that mean that in the short to medium term there is no proposition of a cut to the rate for mortgage holders?</p>

          <p eId="para_91">It is a fact that if one adds up the losses we have experienced on our mortgage book in the past five years, they are in excess of €2 billion. The losses have been significant. We have experienced losses across the various types of mortgages, be it trackers, fixed or variable rate mortgages. With regard to the standard variable rate loans, the rate we are charging coupled with the cost we are incurring, assuming a normal regularised market, is such that we can probably make a reasonable return on shareholders' funds. Unless any of these other costs come down, be it the cost of funds, the amount of capital we have to have, the credit losses and so on, the standard variable rate will not come down.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">Royal Bank of Scotland put a significant amount of capital, around £15 billion, into Ulster Bank through the downturn. I think it was the right thing to ask about 18 months ago if there would be a viable business for Ulster Bank in this market. A review was undertaken over a 15-month period and there was a very clear commitment from RBS that they are committed to Ulster Bank. We think there is an opportunity for Ulster Bank to be a competitor in the market and to contribute to the economy. We are looking for the market to rise over time, which is what we would expect. The members should put out of their mind any questions or doubts about our commitment. We are here to stay.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">The problem of mortgage arrears is fundamentally different in the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland. Non-performing loans, which is the measure of cases 90 days or more in arrears, never peaked beyond 4.5% in Northern Ireland whereas here it peaked in the high 20%. The nature of the problem is very different and therefore the nature of the solutions we offer are different in Northern Ireland from the Republic. The legal system that applies in Northern Ireland is based on the system in the United Kingdom and as such there was no impact on Northern Ireland from the Ms Justice Dunne ruling which in effect meant for two years, between the middle of 2011 and the middle of 2013, there was no meaningful threat of repossession. I say that upfront because it is probably not helpful to try to compare the mortgage arrears activities between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In fact, the regulatory view of what are appropriate solutions between the PRA and FCA and the Central Bank are quite different as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">It is not available in the North. It is not really necessary to address the problem in the North based on our experience. Where we believe a person has the capacity to pay for a restructured home loan but chooses not to and works to sell the property, we would look at the residual debt on a case-by-case basis. We recognise that in some instances we may achieve a better outcome through the co-operation of the customer than if we had to go through a lengthy court process. We would typically not look to go beyond seven to ten years in any kind of arrangement because that would be consistent with the personal insolvency Act. We do not want to put people in a position whereby in co-operating with the bank, they put themselves in a worse position than if they had gone through a personal insolvency process. We would typically base our expectations on affordability and their individual circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">There are detailed figures for repossessions and voluntary surrenders and the table shows a significant spike in the last two quarters of 2014. Is this the start of a prolonged period of these numbers?</p>

          <p eId="para_101">The figures we have shared with the committee on previous appearances is that in the UK in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we saw something between 0.5% and 0.7% of the housing stock repossessed each year for about a five-year period. That is the level of repossessions that most economies would see as they correct from a severe economic contraction. The level of 150 repossessions a quarter, which is the most recent figure we quoted, would seem to be a more normal representation of what will be needed to see this problem work through the courts system. The difficulty is that for the period from mid-2011 to the end of 2013, the average number of repossessions was 26 per quarter, not 150. One has seen quite a dramatic difference. In effect what happened was that cases that could not be heard for two years or more are now having to hit the system.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">No, that is not what we are saying. What we are saying is that if any further measures are introduced people need to be mindful of the fact that the rights of secured lenders need to be preserved. The reason interest rates are relatively low on mortgages is because of the right to enforce that security. If that right were over-ridden or if it became quasi-secured then the reality is that the interest rates would reflect the increased risk we would be running on the portfolios.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">That is to say the asset financing rates are probably in the high single-digits or low double-digits, while unsecured lending is typically between 15% and 25% APR. This is to reflect the fact that there is no real security for lenders to rely on in those cases. The reason for standard variable rates being at comparatively low levels is because of that effective security.</p>

Unexpected events can occur which may make a payment difficult to make in a particular month. We still work closely with customers who are on arrangements even though the arrangements are functioning effectively.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">Absolutely. As part of the mortgage arrears process and in the event that a customer took the view that the arrangement he was offered was unfair, he has a statutory right to appeal. He could appeal to an independent body within the bank which then looks at the circumstances of the case. The levels of appeals that we have experienced within Ulster Bank Ireland Ltd. have been extraordinarily low. We take this as a sign that the customer is broadly happy with the proposal that has been made.</p>

In many of the instances there had not been adequate engagement by the customer before a relatively late appeal by the personal insolvency practitioner for a solution. One of the essential aspects of the personal insolvency process when it was launched was that it was for people who had engaged meaningfully with the institution, could not reach an agreement and were insolvent. We have seen some cases, and they are representative in the five cases, in which there had been no engagement until the very last minute.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">On the solution being offered to the 2,000 non-engagers, how severe is the requirement to be eligible for social housing? Is there much room for objective judgment? A person resident in a house such as Gorse Hill might or might not automatically be on the social housing list. If the bank judges a person to be a significant earner, how severe is the assessment? Could the bank use the eligibility for social housing to put a line through many of the 2,000 and prevent them from getting what they thought they would get?</p>

          <p eId="para_155">Given that they have not engaged, it is difficult for us to tell because we do not have the benefit of the full information. The significant majority of our customers have a home loan balance that is considerably less than €200,000. Even at the standard variable rate, the capital and interest repayment would be well within the affordability of somebody who has an income of €35,000, based on tax deductions, etc. In many counties and for the vast majority of people, social housing eligibility is within the €30,000 to €35,000 range, although it is less in certain parts of the country. We thought it was an effective commitment to make because above the levels that would typically qualify a person for social housing, it provides the kind of income that would allow a person to service a restructured loan.</p>

I would like to discuss the variable rate mortgages and the apparent differences in the rates here compared to those in the UK. While profiles of borrowers can vary anywhere, variable interest rates seem to be higher here than in Britain and the North of Ireland. The witnesses referred to greater risk in the South. Could they elaborate on it? Is the greater risk to do with what we have just been through, namely the bubble, the crash and the unprecedented mortgage arrears crisis? Does the bank constantly factor it in and recoup its losses? Is that the reason rates are higher here?</p>

          <p eId="para_161">Over the past five years, we have lost a considerable amount of money on mortgages in the Republic of Ireland. Separately, a dialogue has been going on in the market that somehow the standard variable rate, SVR, is tied to the ECB rate which then determines margins. This is not the case. A number of factors need to be taken into account when determining the profitability or otherwise of a mortgage. Because we operate on both sides of the Border and in the UK, we know the SVR for a similar type of product to a similar type of customer is very similar in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales and the cost to fund it is very similar. Although the rate might vary by 20 basis points, so does the cost of funds. Clearly, we do not have the same information about Europe. The margin on all those loans is very similar, as Mr. Stanley said earlier, approximately 3%. A number of costs are incurred in providing mortgage, including capital, the cost of funds, operating expenses, the cost to service mortgage arrears, credit losses and levies. Despite the fact that the margins are the same, the cost to provide all of those imports in terms of servicing a mortgage is higher in this market than in other markets in which we operate.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">As was said, we have made numerous efforts to try to get customers to engage, everything from calls, letters and visits. There has also been clear communication from Government, the Central Bank, the Insolvency Service of Ireland and even the court process and despite all of that, there is a group of customers that still will not engage, even through to the court process. It has been reported that only one in five turn up in the courts, for example. I cannot explain that but in recent days we have come out with our commitments to customers in arrears in terms of how we will treat them so that they can see that the process we would be putting them through will be fair. We would rather that those 2,000 customers engage with us because if they do we believe we have got a solution that will help them, just as we have helped the other 22,000 customers, but we need to engage. As to why they are not, I cannot answer that.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">Generally speaking, the mortgage-to-rent process does not seem to have happened. I am disappointed that has not materialised to a greater extent because it is potentially the solution to many of the most difficult cases that one would imagine, that is, people who have lost their jobs and those on low income. Mr. Brown might answer that but I will ask him one final question given that my time is running out.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> A big issue that has dominated the agenda in recent weeks is the events around Siteserv, and it has opened a window to the bigger issue of big write-downs for corporate and commercial interests. While Mr. Brown is not involved in the Siteserv issue, has he any opinion on the scale of the write-downs being handed out, and what is Ulster Bank's record in regard to big write-downs? The Minister is now saying, after the event, that he wants to know about any write-down over €10 million and so on. Can Mr. Brown tell us anything about the volume of big commercial loans his bank has written down and the writing down of loans in those type of circumstances to that extent, which is arguably of significant benefit to the companies that get them?</p>

          <p eId="para_184"> In terms of the losses we have incurred, we had a considerable commercial lending portfolio on which we took write-downs. We have virtually disposed of all of that; the majority of it will be done by the end of this year. We have taken some gains back in terms of realising slightly more for the assets than what we had marked but, generally for us, the situation is that the majority of those loans have been disposed.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">Our stance has been that the idea of writing down debts owed by people who continue to trade or exist in the previous form is not something of which we are supportive but where we have to enforce our security and sell the asset, it has to be sold at today's market price, and that creates write-offs. We stick to our distinction between write-downs and write-offs. There will have been large write-offs as a consequence of disposing of assets at today's market prices, which would be substantially less than the price at which we financed the transaction, but we have not done large-scale write-downs for companies that have continued to trade as normal.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">I thank Mr. Brown and his colleagues for their presentation. I have a number of questions primarily on the standard variable rate. First, in response to question No. 4 Mr. Brown said that a permanent interest rate reduction has been invoked in zero cases. That strikes me as strange. In most cases the mortgage holder is endeavouring to do their best but often it is the marginal difference that determines whether they can make a payment in terms of the higher or lower rates Ulster Bank charges on mortgages at various stages, be it on the basis of their loan to value, fixed or variable rate. Mr. Brown might comment on that and also on a comment by the previous speaker with regard to mortgage-to-rent. What is the impediment to that being used more widely?</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> Second, in respect of the fact that Ulster Bank operates in Northern Ireland, what is Mr. Brown's experience there of the bankruptcy regime, which is a one year bankruptcy term, and how that impacts on its mortgage book? Where it is invoked, what has been the outcome for the family home in those situations?</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Third, Mr. Brown made reference to the factors that impact on the bank's variable rate including capital levies, taxes, compliance costs, credit losses, operational costs, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I presume these factors also impact on the bank's credit rating. Does Ulster Bank have two separate credit ratings for its operations in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland? Are the two credit ratings different, and if not, does it suggest that those who operate the ratings see no significant difference in the operating risks of loan books in the two jurisdictions? How active is the switching market in Northern Ireland? How many competitors does Ulster Bank have in Northern Ireland compared with here, and is the relative lack of competition here a factor that enables the bank to charge a higher interest rate here? Does Ulster Bank have a profile of the 2,000 non-engagers in terms of age, employment and loan-to-value ratio? I appreciate that if a person does not open his or her post, the bank has a difficulty. On the basis of other products that exist regarding switching, loan-to-value ratios and appreciating property prices, could the non-engagers become compliant mortgage holders?</p>

          <p eId="para_197">In our experience, the bankruptcy period, be it three years or one year, is not the issue in trying to resolve the 2,000 cases in arrears. Whatever the period, those customers will not engage with us, and changing the bankruptcy period will not cause them to do so. Unless customers respond to the commitments we have just launched, the only tool we have is the court process. The standard variable rates are very similar in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and the margins are virtually identical. We have four or five key competitors in the mortgage market here. Although the competitors in the North are different, competition is equally active, and there are competitors there from the rest of the UK and Europe. The number of competitors is similar in round terms. We are rated by Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Although I do not have the ratings here, we are happy to provide them.</p>

The liquidity regime for UBL is very much wrapped up in Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, and there is a look through to that linkage to the parent, whereas UBIL is increasingly being regarded by the rating agencies on a standalone basis. Given that Moody's is reviewing its methodologies and reinforcing this approach, I expect to see the existing differential widen.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">I am delighted that lending increased by nearly 40% last year. It is very positive and I hope it continues. I recognise the efforts Ulster Bank has made in the mortgage arrears crisis. People who work on behalf of borrowers have said positive things to me about Ulster Bank and told me the bank is making genuine efforts to keep people in their homes, where possible, and come to reasonable agreements. I also welcome the fact that the interest rate fell by a few basis points in March.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> I will pick up on Deputy Boyd Barrett's line of questioning. Although Ulster Bank has nothing to do with Siteserv or the IBRC sales processes, let us say a company with a market capitalisation of approximately €50 million owed Ulster Bank €150 million, but an agreement was reached that the company would be sold and the amount raised returned to Ulster Bank, which would write down approximately 65%. In this case, would the shareholders ever get a multi-million euro pay-off as part of the transaction, thereby reducing the amount Ulster Bank would receive by several million euro?</p>

I very much welcome Monday's statement that, in particular situations, the residual debt after a voluntary sale would be written off. On the last occasion we spoke, Mr. Brown said where Ulster Bank had a controlling vote on a proposed personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, if the arrangement included the write-down of debt on the part of Ulster Bank, the bank's policy was to vote against the PIA. Now that the very welcome precedent has been set in limited circumstances, would Mr. Brown envisage Ulster Bank, where it has a controlling vote, being open to PIAs that may include some write-down of debt as part of a reasonable solution?</p>

          <p eId="para_215">We also said at the meeting in November that in a case where somebody had sold their home and qualified for social housing we would not pursue them for that residual debt. What we have done, in a last ditch effort to get that clear message out to customers, is to come up with a customer commitment that clearly states how we will engage with customers and that we will treat them fairly. It reiterates many of the points that were mentioned previously but it set them out in a way that is very clear and transparent for customers. I will ask Mr. Bell to comment on specific examples.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">We have always tried to be consistent in our answers to the committee in setting out the distinction between write-down and write-off. What we said, with respect to those commitments on Monday, is that in the event of a write-off at the end of a sale process, we will not chase the residual shortfall for those people who are at a sufficiently low income that they would be eligible for social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> In terms of our approach to the personal insolvency process, we are still of the view that the vast majority of cases can be resolved without the need for a principal write-down. Our concerns around that are that it is not a solution that could be offered to everybody. We, as an organisation that has said we wish to be known for trust, service and advocacy are deeply uncomfortable to offer solutions to some people that we cannot offer to very many people. We are in a position where the Irish real estate market is recovering from a very low base but offering somebody a write-down of principal and leaving the contractual interest rate the same simply extracts profit in a different way and creates a capital gain at the end of the process for which there is no real justification. Our preference is to regard arrears as an affordability issue, to work on reducing the monthly payment as far as we can through either extending the term of lowering the rate for a period of time which can be quite lengthy. However, for us, the consequence of writing down debt seems to create something of a moral hazard concern because, in reality, what it is doing is potentially rewarding those who borrowed most aggressively at the peak of the market as opposed to those who were more prudent in the run up to the peak. The difference between policy and practicality-----</p>

          <p eId="para_218">I am sorry to cut across Mr. Bell but I am mindful of the time factor. Various proposals are currently being considered by the Government on accelerating the pace of the mortgage crisis. It has gone on in Ireland far longer than it has gone on anywhere else. I tabled a motion in Dáil last night that raised a few possibilities. Can I get a quick response from the bank as to whether it would support the following four proposals? I will go through them and Mr. Brown can then respond to them. The first proposal is to move the bankruptcy period from three years to one year, at least for a term-limited time until the mortgage crisis is resolved. The second is the provision of financial expertise, be it a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, or a personal financial adviser, to those who cannot afford them. The third is the provision of legal representation. What struck me about the process in the Circuit Court recently was that the borrowers who did turn up did not have a lawyer. Borrowers were not turning up with legal representation in court. The fourth proposal is a recommendation from the committee last year that the restructures offered by any lender would be stress-tested in the same way that new lending would be stress-tested. Can I get Mr. Brown's response to those four proposals?</p>

          <p eId="para_219">First, it would be useful if we could get details of those in order that we could respond in a more thoughtful way. Therefore, the responses I will give may not be exact. On the first issue, as I mentioned, I do not think that moving the three year period to one year is the issue in terms of speeding the resolution. The key here is that there are two or three elements that make the process lengthy. The first is that there is a code of conduct on mortgage arrears process, which we need to go through with customers. That can be quite protracted. Getting into the court process and getting a case through the system, heard and finalised is also very lengthy. In my view the only way to shorten the process is to address both of those. At present the only tool we have available to us, due to lack of engagement, is the court process. Therefore, we have no choice but to go through that protracted process to get those 2,000 people to engage. In terms of financial expertise, we already advise customers of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">What would really help, and I am sorry if this sounds a little harsh, is if we could agree that for those people who will not engage and who do not pay or do anything to help themselves with this process that the courts will allow those cases to move through the system more quickly because what we have now is not helping us or the customer at the end of the day. Repeated adjournments and extension of the situation simply adds to the balance, the cost and the losses that everybody will face. We would be fine with bankruptcy periods of whatever length but what would make a huge difference is the ability for the court process to be speeded up in those cases where we agree this cannot be allowed to continue. The measure of that can be seen in England and Wales where the court system is faster. The most serious arrears have hovered between 0.2% and 0.25% of the total mortgage stock while in Ireland that equivalent number is nearly 10%, which equates to 50 times higher levels of serious arrears. The simple answer for that being the case is that no repossessions are taking place.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">Okay. With regard to restructuring, and I am sure the bank has many customers who would be in the pre-arrears category as opposed to the arrears category that we are considering. I am surprised to note that with respect to the bank's split mortgage product - which is a something that would have been recommended under the Keane report where a borrower would park a percentage of the mortgage, pay what they can and address the balance afterwards - that it has zero in the long term and very small numbers in any event.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">Mr. Bell might like to explain that. We have another product, the economic concession, which operates similarly but we think it is actually better for the customer. The Deputy will note from the numbers that we have provided that a significant number of customers have taken that solution. Approximately 4,500 have taken up that product. Mr. Bell might go through that and explain it.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">The reason we have had so little uptake for the split mortgage product is that when we have offered the customer the choice between a split mortgage and the economic concession product, they tend to prefer the economic concession. The way it works is that we will agree to lower the interest rate and it can go as low as 0.5%, although not all cases are at 0.5%. That concessionary rate can be for a period as long as seven years but they are not necessarily all for that period. We picked seven years because we try to be complementary to the work of the personal insolvency service and we wanted to ensure that at the period end the customer would be able to resume normal service. Because of the way that works, the vast majority of the customer's monthly repayments goes towards paying down capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">They will not service interest unduly because the interest rate has been set at such a low level. What one finds, therefore, over a medium to longer term forbearance period is that the balance the customer owes reduces and when the forbearance period ends the balance he or she must service on the original interest rate has been substantially reduced. </p>

          <p eId="para_241">I will tease out that issue if I may. Given that some of these customers were on tracker rates of 1%, an arrangement under which the rate is reduced by 0.5% will not exactly allow them to see light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">The tracker rate would be closer to 2% because there is a 1% margin over the European Central Bank rate, which has been closer to 1% in the past. The reduction can make a material difference, although I admit it does not work for everybody to the same extent.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">Simply reducing the interest rate will not work for a customer who is in difficulty with arrears. My fear concerns young families in a certain age bracket who are offered a restructured mortgage arrangement. By the time their children start third level education they will be barely hanging on and will be unable to afford to pay the costs of putting their children through college. I am afraid this will result in another dramatic event. I discussed this issue with representatives of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service who expressed considerable concern that many people will encounter serious problems with third level education because they are barely hanging on under the current arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">As we stated, notwithstanding the position in which individuals find themselves, there is a cost to living in a home. If one takes an average mortgage of €170,000, in the case of a customer who is offered an interest-only period at an interest rate of 2%, the monthly cost of his or her mortgage will be €300 per month. It is impossible to rent anything in Dublin for €300 per month, whereas we can put in place a solution that keeps a customer in his or her home, provided there is co-operation and engagement.</p>

          <p eId="para_251">A split mortgage would allow people to stay in their home and, at a later date, either sell the property or pass it on to someone who would then have a small mortgage on it.

          <p eId="para_252">Ulster Bank is perfectly relaxed about split mortgages as a concept. Under our approach, the customer could pay down as much as that part of the debt that would have been warehoused during the forbearance period when the interest rate has been set low. The net economic effect is, therefore, the same. As we indicated to the joint committee in one of our first appearances before it, when we did the total cost of credit for a split mortgage against an economic concession for the same rates and terms, we found it was cheaper for the customer to have the economic concession than the split mortgage. The reason is that typically the market construct for the split mortgage is that the contractual rate applies on the non-warehoused portion and a zero rate applies on the warehoused portion. Net of those two factors, the customer can end up with a higher total cost over the life of the loan.</p>

          <p eId="para_253">Mr. Bell and I will agree to differ on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> If a person moves into a restructured arrangement for a business which has a core or non-core debt or in circumstances in which he or she is moving from being a sole trader to a limited company, the interest rate is likely to increase on the basis that many of them will have borrowed at a very favourable rate. In such cases, Ulster Bank will already hold the title, for example, where the person is a farmer. Does Ulster Bank ask customers in such circumstances to bear the full costs of perfecting the title for a second time? Does the customer have to pay the bank's legal fees? While I accept this is not directly related to mortgages, it also involves restructuring. </p>

          <p eId="para_290">This is part of the problem we are experiencing the housing market. Approximately 80,000 homes were being built annually a decade ago. If Ulster Bank and all the other financial institutions are providing only 10% of the construction finance they were providing at that time, only 8,000 houses will be built annually. This figure is nowhere near what the market needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Ultimately, if one is to look at how this will affect supply and demand for the housing market, it will reduce the amount of supply while demand increases. Accordingly, the price of the houses goes up. The value of Ulster Bank’s loans and balance sheet will improve as a result of the restriction of the marketplace. I have a problem with this and believe the Central Bank has a larger role to play in this.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">Ultimately, the cost of housing is going up which is improving the share price of the banks. However, this is all to the detriment of those who want to get on the housing ladder, particularly for first-time buyers who are down to 80% LTV, loan-to-value, ratios as opposed to the 100% RBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, introduced back in the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> I am pressing upon Mr. Brown the need for Ulster Bank to give more money to site finance.

          <p eId="para_303">We are active supporters of the economy in the Republic. Across the island of Ireland, two thirds of our lending goes to the Republic. Last year, we lent €1.4 billion to business and gave €900 million of new lending to mortgages. We are active in supporting businesses and the mortgage market too. That trend in lending has continued into this year. We are looking to increase our lending by another 30% over and above what we lent last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> However, we will be very prudent about the lending we will be doing. We realised the role we play in the market but we do not want to get ourselves into the situation that we were previously.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">From my perspective, I do not think moving from three years to one year is the issue. Despite all the efforts we have made to engage customers, as well as the efforts made by politicians, the Government more broadly, the Central Bank, the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the courts, we still have 2,000 customers who will not engage with the bank. We came out with our customer commitments earlier this week to make it clear as to how we will work with customers in this situation. The bottom line to resolve this issue is to find a way to engage those 2,000 people. Today, the only option we have if they do not engage is the court process.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">There is a hang-up about bankruptcy in Ireland. There is a stigma attached to it with an unwillingness to declare it publicly and admit what is perceived as a failure when it is a consequence of something greater than the individual or the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> The one-year element will encourage many people to go down the route of bankruptcy. I would like to see an arrangement put in place whereby a line is put in the sand after the term is over, meaning an individual’s creditworthiness is fine and they are not excluded from the mortgage market, small business loans or car finance loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> However, this will cost the banks money. With the price of property going up, the banks are getting back towards equilibrium and hoping to get repaid the money they lent. If people start pressing the eject button with the bankruptcy arrangement of one year, however, it will have a negative effect on the banks. Ulster Bank is one of the better banks for dealing with customers and helping them with mortgage problems. There is still a long way to go, however. The numbers involved in negative equity, in arrears and distressed mortgages is enormous. I am of the generation that is affected. I would encourage the banks to facilitate the one-year term for bankruptcy. The banks should allow for credit ratings to be renewed without the baggage of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> Has Ulster Bank engaged with the Department of Finance, the Central Bank or Financial Services Ireland on the idea of the bankruptcy period being reduced from three years to one?</p>

          <p eId="para_328"> I cannot answer the broader question as to what is the collective position for the other banks. We believe we have a role. We will not be participating to the level, however, that we did previously. In terms of risk appetite, to have the weighting of our balance sheet towards that one specific sector of the economy is not prudent.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">I will not pursue it further. However, I draw from that response that given everything that happened, if other banks are likely to have a similar concern about going down that road again, the current housing crisis will not be resolved - at least alone - by the finance that might be provided by the banking system in this country and that we are going to have to look elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> I understand Mr. Brown was not involved in Siteserv but if I may pursue the question I put to Mr. Brown about Siteserv-type scenarios. If I understand him correctly he said that he cannot imagine a situation where a commercial loan of €150 million would be written down by €110 million where that company would continue in business. I think that is what Mr. Bell said. If I understand him correctly, Mr. Brown followed on from that to say that he cannot envisage circumstances where such a company that was being sold off that the shareholders would be allowed walk away with €5 million. That is fairly damning opinion in terms of what happened in Siteserv, even if Mr. Brown is being moderate in his statement of it. I have one further question for Mr. Brown in the Siteserv case scenario. Can he envisage a situation of that sort where the buyer of the company that is being sold off was somebody who also had a number of other companies that between them had a controlling share in a number of other companies and, between them, owed Mr. Brown's bank hundreds of millions of euro in other arrangements and that he would offer a write-down of that sort in that kind of arrangement?</p>

Over the past two to three years in particular, but before that, our exit strategy on those loans has been to take them to the market and either sell the loan or the underlying asset. With regard to the specifics on Siteserv we were not involved with it so I cannot answer that question.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">I thank the Chairman for introducing my colleagues. I will be brief but on occasion I might ask my colleagues to speak on a couple of the items. I propose to give an update on the group's strategy and financial performance, reflecting among other things that taxpayers have a 14% shareholding in this large pillar bank. I will make a Powerpoint presentation, one component of which will concentrate on matters that were particularly pertinent in the questions, that is mortgage interest rates and the group's management of challenged mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> In slide 5, we give the key highlights of our financial performance for the year ended December 2014. We have achieved a significant turnaround in the group's trading performance, approximately a €1.5 billion turnaround. What is particularly gratifying for us and I hope our customers, is the significant increase in new lending. We did €10 billion of new lending in 2014, which was drawn down last year. We are the largest lender to the Irish economy. Our UK mortgage business also contributes to the growth in new lending. Primarily due to a reduction in the cost of money to the bank, reflecting a strategy the bank has pursued, our net interest margin improved during the course of 2014 to 2.11% for the year as a whole and the exit margin, that is the margin in the last quarter of 2014 was 2.22%. We made further progress on our strategy of reducing defaulted loans and they came down by €2.8 billion, that is 22% below their peak, but nevertheless it is still at a significant level of €14.3 billion. </p>
          <p eId="para_342"> During the past few years, but in particular with the coming of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, there has been a big focus on the bank's capital. The bank's core equity tier 1 capital ratio improved significantly during 2014 to 14.8%. We passed all the ECB stress tests with significant capital buffers and the intrinsic value of the group, that is the tangible net asset value per share increased by 13%.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> On slide 6, we demonstrate that Bank of Ireland is a leading bank in the Irish economy. We hold the No. 1 or No. 2 positions in all of our principal product lines. In the 12 months to the end of December 2014, we provided one in three home mortgages in the Irish market.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">We have 27% of the cash savings market. We are the only bancassurer in the market. We have 24% of the life assurance market. We are Ireland's number one business bank based on Central Bank of Ireland verified statistics, where we did greater than 50% of new business lending and agri-lending, and we are the number one corporate bank. </p>
          <p eId="para_345"> Slightly differentiated from some of our competitor banks, we have retained a significant presence outside of Ireland, which is focused on Great Britain. We have a partnership with the UK Post Office which has substantial market presence. In Northern Ireland, which we view as part of our Irish-type operations but it is obviously in sterling, we have a universal bank offering. We have an acquisition finance business, which operates internationally and primarily out of the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> I touch on the contribution to the economy on slide 7. We lent €5.7 billion into the economy in 2014. I advised the committee at our last meeting that our ambition was to lend and to have drawn down €33 billion in new lending into the Irish economy between 2013 and 2017. The 2014 figures show we are on track to meet this target. I will not continue with the advertorial in respect of the rest of the statistics. </p>
          <p eId="para_347"> Our view is that the economy is picking up. This is depicted on slides 9 to 10. We are trying to demonstrate in slide 9 that there is a classic investment-led recovery path coming from the export sector. We have seen a pick up in consumer confidence and consumer spending money in the economy in 2014, which is particularly relevant to our business. That has fed through into other confidence levels and an increase in the total number of people employed. Slide 11 explains the same thing in a slightly different way.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> Slide 13 is a brief summary of the breakdown of the financial performance. Our income level and our net interest margin grew. Our costs were broadly flat. They were slightly up, which primarily reflects investments we are making in our businesses, in particular in our branch network in Ireland and our IT and digital banking infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> Reflecting the reduced level of defaulted loans, the restructures we put in place for customers, which are sticking, and a general improvement in collateral values, our provisions, that is, the loan loss charges we took, had a significant improvement in the year 2014. That flowed through on the profit and loss to our accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> It might be useful to pause on slide 14, which focuses on the bank's net interest margin. I draw the attention of the members of the committee to both graphs, but in particular the graph which is in the bottom left hand corner. This graph shows the progression in customer pay rates, that is, our customer charge rate and the pay rate. The lightish blue line is the pay rate we pay for funds and the dark blue line is the charge rate. The improvement in our net interest margin has come primarily from a reduction in the cost of money to us rather than a change in charge rates. We anticipate that, as we put on new lending at slightly higher margins and the tracker element of our book reduces as a proportion of the overall book, net interest margin growth will be primarily on the asset side. </p>
          <p eId="para_351"> Slide 15 gives a little more information on the mix of new business and the mix of new lending that we are doing, broken down between Republic of Ireland mortgages, Republic of Ireland business banking, Republic of Ireland corporate banking, our UK mortgage business and our acquisition finance business. That table shows that in each of our main business lines we have seen good growth in customer demand and our ability to satisfy it. </p>
          <p eId="para_352"> Given the time, I will skip slides 16 and 17. Slide 18 is a reminder that the taxpayers have been repaid and are in a substantial profit<i> vis-à-vis</i> their investment in Bank of Ireland. Slide 19 gives a very quick pictorial overview of our market shares and our presences in the Irish economy. Slide 20 is a pictorial representation of our UK businesses. </p>
          <p eId="para_353"> In summary, the group has continued to deliver on the strategy we set when we recapitalised from the private market in 2011. Our strategy has been focused on an Irish business and our ability to lend money in that Irish business. We do not make money until we lend it and the growth in lending has been a particular stand out feature along with the reduction in the impairment charges, which came into the bank's capital. Our overseas businesses are self-funded. The group provides them with capital but they fund themselves. These businesses are performing in line with our expectations and that has been reflected in our share price and the share price available to taxpayers. </p>
          <p eId="para_354"> I will ask my colleagues to address the committee on the mortgage issue. </p>

          <p eId="para_355">I will cover briefly the situation in relation to mortgage pricing and will focus on presentation slides 51, 52 and 53. We keep pricing of all our products under ongoing and active review. Products, including our mortgages, are priced to reflect the cost of funds to the group, operating costs, including regulatory costs, and the estimated potential loan losses from the portfolio as well as capital and liquidity costs. These are all factors the bank as a responsible lender must consider. The structure and liquidity risk the bank takes against mortgages is a significant factor. We must remember that the bank is providing a 25 to 35 year commitment of money to the customer and we cannot fund for that duration. In accordance with commercial realities and Central Bank and Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, macroprudential policy decisions, pricing is risk based using the the loan to value, LTV, band as a proxy.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> As recently as January of this year, we announced a suite of attractive fixed rates ranging, depending on risk or loan to value, from 3.7%. These fixed rates are available to both new customers and, importantly, existing variable rate and standard variable rate, SVR, customers. Our costs of funds, as Mr. Boucher noted when dealing with slide 14, reduced by 23 basis points during the course of 2014. This reduction is more than reflected in our revised fixed rate pricings announced in January. In addition, while not a feature across the Irish market, we also give customers, from February of this year, the option to move to a lower LTV band and thus a lower fixed rate pricing on the provision of an up-to-date home valuation. This feature is available to existing variable rate and SVR customers. </p>
          <p eId="para_357"> The decision to take a fixed rate mortgage, which is always the customer's decision, gives certainty to the customer and the bank for periods of up to ten years, which is the longest term for which we will provide a fixed rate, at a time when fixed rates are at the bottom of an interest rate cycle. At the end of 2014, fixed rate mortgages account for 9% of outstanding mortgage balances. During the first quarter of 2015, circa 50% of new mortgage customers chose a fixed rate draw down. In the month of March 2015 alone, more than 55% of new first time buyers chose a fixed rate. Mortgage markets differ very significantly in structure and features across all EU member states and this prevents an accurate and transparent comparison. </p>
          <p eId="para_358"> Slide 52 shows that the average SVR we charge in both Ireland and the UK are similar. Our analysis shows that both our fixed rates and variable rates would result in mortgage repayments being less than rental costs. Using publicly available data on <i>www.daft.ie,</i> we will look at a typical three bedroom semi-detached property in, say, Lucan in Dublin or Douglas in Cork. We calculate annual savings for customers of more than €2,000 per year against rental costs. </p>
          <p eId="para_359"> I will pass over to Mr. Stephen Mason who will cover briefly the mortgage challenge portfolio. </p>

          <p eId="para_360">A consistent application of our policies has meant we continue to make very significant progress in the management of mortgage arrears. Full details are in the presentation but I will make some brief comments. Starting with slide 25, we note that nine out of ten of our owner-occupier mortgage customers are fully up to date with their mortgage payments. Nine out of ten of our owner-occupier customers who were in financial difficulty were offered a sustainable solution and nine out of ten of those customers are meeting the terms of their new arrangement. All of our activities in our approach to mortgage arrears recognise the fundamental importance of the family home. By the end of February this year, the number of owner-occupier accounts in arrears had dropped by 33% from peak levels seen in May 2013. At the end of December 2014, 5.5% of our owner-occupier accounts were in arrears of greater than 90 days. That is materially better than the industry average, excluding Bank of Ireland, where the figure was 11.6%. Slide 25 of the presentation shows that we provided 32% of new owner-occupier mortgage lending in Ireland in 2014. We hold 19% of the national stock of owner-occupier mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">We have some 10% of the national stock of owner-occupier mortgages in arrears, some 9% of the national stock of these mortgages greater than two years in arrears, and we have issued just 6% of the civil bills issued nationally in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> We have included an analysis of the repayment patterns of owner-occupier customers greater than two years in arrears, which shows, regrettably, that half of these customers paid nothing towards their mortgage in 2014. This analysis also shows that the expected monthly payment for these customers averaged €890 a month, less than the average monthly rental cost in Ireland of €950. Further analysis in the presentation shows that uniquely in the market, our owner-occupier mortgage balances greater than two years in arrears fell in quarter four 2014, whereas they rose at industry level. The difference here is quite significant. Some 3.6% of our book is greater than two years in arrears, whereas at industry level, excluding Bank of Ireland, the figure is 8.8%.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> On slide 49, we show we have concluded significantly more of our owner-occupier solutions under the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART, process than the rest of the industry. We have reached a conclusion with 83% of cases, whereas the industry, excluding Bank of Ireland, achieved a conclusion with 61%. Again, the loss of ownership, as part of these concluded solutions, is significantly lower in Bank of Ireland. We also provide significant detail in our pack in regard to personal insolvency, where we show we have voted in favour of 84% of the arrangements that have been proposed to us, higher than the overall Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, approval rate of 76%. We fully engage with the ISI, as can be seen from the fact we have a participation rate of 36% or 363 protection certificates issued to the end of March 2015. We provide details of the 18 cases where we were a secured creditor and the client proposed arrangement on slides 37 and 38.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">I welcome Mr. Boucher and his colleagues. We are in the process of meeting with the key banks to discuss the current situation, particularly in regard to mortgages. I noted two bits of good news in the presentation from Mr. Mason. First, I noted that 92% of Bank of Ireland owner-occupier mortgages are not in default and second, that of all the civil bills issued last year, Bank of Ireland was involved in only 6% of them. This is quite a low figure for a big bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> However, I have a question in regard to unsustainable mortgages, namely where there is an unsustainable mortgage and the mortgage borrower continues to be liable for the recovery of any shortfall between the sale proceeds and the mortgage loan, the negative equity part. When people lose their house, they are homeless. Does Bank of Ireland chase up homeless people for money? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_284">
          <from> Mr. Stephen Mason<recordedTime time="2015-04-29T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_369">We answered that question in response to the questions submitted to us. What we said is that mortgage lending is full recourse lending and that after a property has been disposed of, we will engage with the customers to come to an arrangement as to what they can pay in regard to the residual balances.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_285">

          <p eId="para_370">I take it that is a "yes" therefore that the Bank does follow after homeless people for the balance. The answer is that it is full recourse lending on the property and the person is liable for the recovery of any shortfall between the sale proceeds and the mortgage loan. I am surprised, but Bank of Ireland seems to suggest it does follow up on homeless people for the negative equity.</p>

          <from> Mr. Stephen Mason<recordedTime time="2015-04-29T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_371">That is the nature of full recourse lending. If there is a residual balance when the asset has been disposed of, on a case by case basis and understanding the new circumstances of the customer we look to see what contribution they can make towards the outstanding balance.</p>

          <p eId="para_372">Bank of Ireland got off to a great start here, with a positive presentation. However, it is now saying it will chase up homeless people. I am amazed it would not leave homeless people alone. Does it not think homeless people have enough trouble, without following them for negative equity? I take it as a "yes" that it will follow up on them, because it cannot say it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> On the bank finances, impairment is a significant issue. In the accounts for 2014, how much of a write-back was there in terms of previous impairments? Obviously, the bank has been taking a prudent view each year and as values have improved and the number in default has decreased, I presume it has been able to write back some of what had previously provided for? What is the figure for that?</p>

          <from> Mr. Richie Boucher<recordedTime time="2015-04-29T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_374">The provision to write back a recovery in the accounts was €280 million. That reflected the changes in our financial models and, in particular, reflected a change in house price assumptions. Up to June 2014, we had been making a conservative assumption that the peak to trough fall in house prices was 55%. Then as we considered our provision, we said there was probably another 10% on top of that for cost of disposal and cost of sale etc. As the market improved, from an accountant point of view an ability to continue to maintain a 55% assumption was no longer correct and that was reflected in €280 million of a provision recovery.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">It is roughly around 42% or 43%, but I would also say that it is slightly simplistic to give a bland answer like that because when we look at it, we look at the mix of our book and the locations. As we know, the market is made up of a number of micro markets. Dublin is different from Kerry, for example, and we try to look at the price in the various markets.</p>

          <p eId="para_384">We must provide prudently and must make reasonable assumptions. I would say we may be slightly more conservative than some of our competitors. If we look at the relative performance of our Irish mortgage book, as outlined by Mr. Mason, our provision in coverage would be higher than that of most of our Irish competitors. We believe it is appropriate to maintain conservative coverage ratios, because while we have a strong view the economy is recovering, we must learn the lessons of the past. Things go the wrong way.</p>

          <p eId="para_385">The slide indicated in the last quarter the cost of funds was 1.03%, yet the standard variable mortgage rate is 4.5%. I know it has been said people can switch to fixed mortgages, but very few have switched. Why have we such a variation between the cost of funds at 1.03% and the standard variable rate of 4.5%? I know Bank of Ireland took a strong view on this at its meeting this morning, but I would say it is making it easier for the Minister for Finance to come down stronger on the banks by its resolute action. Ministers are under significant pressure to exert what influence they can through the Central Bank and Bank of Ireland is making that job easier. AIB was before the committee last week and it suggested there was a possibility of a reduction, but Bank of Ireland has taken a harder line. I suggest that is not helping the bank's case when it comes to time for negotiation with the Minister, but perhaps Mr. Boucher thinks that does not matter anyway.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">Okay. The last topic I want to touch on is one Mr. Boucher may find easier to deal with. Question No. 34 in the document asked about the various issues that go into the costs in determining interest rates and the list included funding costs, operating costs of the bank and credit risk costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">This is the bit I found interesting because we had Ulster Bank in earlier. Its representatives talked about the historical performance of the mortgage loan book in Ireland as having to be taken into account in determining the interest to be charged on new couples. I accept that Mr. Boucher may not have the answer for me today. If not, he might send us a note. What additional costs are there in Ireland which the bank must take into account in charging interest rates on mortgages that do not apply in other jurisdictions? In thinking about that matter, I note the historical cost of previous performance. We were told an hour ago by another bank that must be taken into account. There are also the capital and liquidity costs. I also see in the document mention of regulatory costs. Is it possible to give a note on the bank's cost structure in arriving at the standard variable mortgage rate? To what extent do the extra regulatory costs in Ireland add to the rate versus other countries? I ask Mr. Boucher to set out the additional costs. The bank still has eligible liability guarantees of approximately €1 billion, although I know it paid some off since year-end, as stated in the document. The preference dividend payments are factored into the cost as is the bank levy. Can Bank of Ireland give us a note of the costs it must take into account, including those imposed on it by the Central Bank and regulatory bodies in Ireland that may not be of a similar scale in other countries? Looking at the document, it appears the bank has to take all of these into account, which adds to the costs. It is very easy to blame the bank for the high variable rate but if that is due to the high costs being imposed as a result of bank levies, regulatory costs and the historical performance rules of the Central Bank, it would be nice to know. How much of the extra cost is being imposed by the State with the bank just happening to pass it on to the customer?</p>

          <p eId="para_391">I understand the Deputy's point but there are a couple of things to say. We will come back to him with more detail, particularly about the capital. As we identified in slide 2 - as a public company, any announcements I make must be made publicly and verified - we have a similar sized mortgage book in the UK to Ireland. They are roughly €26 billion to €27 billion. The exchange rate will have an effect but they are roughly of similar size. We have different product offers and fixed rates and a SVR or base rate concept in the UK as well as in Ireland. Trying to look at a comparable product, which is a variable rate product, where the rate can be adjusted at the bank's discretion, in the second half of last year, our charge rate to the customer in our UK business for our variable rate mortgages was, across all of the variable rate offers - because we have different variable rate offers in Ireland - 4.49% whereas for our Irish book it was 4.3%. As such, there is a slight misnomer that our charge rate is different in Ireland to the UK. We compete aggressively in Ireland and the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> To come to a couple of the other points, I could not put my hand on my heart and say we suffer higher direct regulatory costs on our UK or Irish business. Much of the servicing for our UK mortgages is done out of centres we have in Kilkenny and, as such, that provides employment in Ireland. Wage rates are not hugely different between our Irish and UK businesses, broadly speaking. The big difference between our Irish and UK business in mortgages is the historic loss experience, which has been considerable. We have had to have provision charges over the last six years of roughly €1.1 billion on our Irish mortgage book whereas it has been roughly €150 million in the UK. One has to build that into one's capital both for existing and new business. The big difference is the loss experience, which comes into one's capital charge, and also the anticipation of the time to recovery where a customer defaults. The time to recovery is dramatically different in our UK and Irish businesses. I will come back with a more detailed explanation to the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_393">I welcome the witnesses and congratulate them on the turnaround in the bank in recent years. It is fair to say the bank is doing better than its competitors overall. The bank is only responsible for 6% of the whole process of attempted repossessions. When does the bank anticipate a pay off to the taxpayer of the remaining 14% or thereabouts? There is public concern at the gap between ECB interest rates and standard variable rates. Where there is severe hardship in the case of some families, is the bank open to third party review of the applicable standard variable rate in circumstances where the customer can demonstrate that the rate is inflicting hardship? Would the bank accept an external agency to arbitrate on that matter in much the same way as the Credit Review Office assists SMEs with credit challenges?</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> I understand what Mr. Boucher said to Deputy Fleming about full recourse lending. Where a repossession is voluntary with assisted sale or surrender and the bank knows the borrower has nothing else, I presume the bank will not pursue the person with regard to the outstanding debt. There is nothing to pursue. Has the bank analysed those in persistent arrears and established why they are failing to engage with the bank? Engagement is the big thing. What is the total amount of the current level of loans in arrears? Has the bank sold any non-performing loans to debt investors, or vulture funds as they are more commonly known? What steps has the bank taken to ensure that customers are protected where such a transfer takes place? Perhaps it does not arise. I thank the witnesses. That is my lot.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">I will pick up on some of those questions and hopefully my colleague will have a note. I will work backwards. We were required under the restructuring plans with the EU to sell certain assets and loan books, but I cannot recall any Irish mortgage books being part of that sale. We have, in fact, bought performing books. We bought €250 million of performing mortgage books from the IBRC receiver. With regard to a customer with repayment challenges, for nine out of ten of our customers who come to us and fill in the standard form a solution can be provided with a restructuring option. That may take a number of different forms. It can be an extension, split mortgage, etc. In nine out of ten cases, we can do that. If some change in the interest rate is part of the solution, that is part of what we do. Following engagement with and feedback from the committee approximately 18 months ago, we reduced the rate we charge on a split mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> The State's ownership of the Bank of Ireland is a discretionary ownership by the Minister for Finance. That is not something we have control over. Our share register has changed a great deal since 2011 and the type of investor in the bank has changed. At the end of 2013, our top ten investors accounted for 50% of the ownership of the bank, excluding the State, and that is now approximately 34%. Large investors have been able to exit the bank stock as things have evolved at a discount of approximately 4% or 5% for chunks of 5% or 6% of the bank to the prevailing market price. The Minister's decision is the Minister's decision, however. He made a decision in 2011 to follow the taxpayers' money, in effect, and invested in the bank at that time when the stock price was 10 cent. The stock price is now in excess of 35 cent, so the Minister looks to me like he knows what he is doing in terms of that investment.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">In terms of people who are not engaging, it is not a significant proportion of our book. We have a number of strategies in place. We try to engage with customers from the start of the process, including by telephone and in writing. If that does not work we then move to what is called the non-co-operating phase with customers, as provided for under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA. Under provisions 28 and 29 of that code, a series of letters are issued in which we warn customers of the implication of non-co-operation with the bank, following which they move into the non-co-operating phase. If they continue not to engage, they then move into the legal process. What happens, typically, is that as this process evolves we get engagement at each stage from customers. Why some customers have not engaged with us, I cannot say. I cannot explain why the small percentage of customers who have not engaged with us have not done so. They will ultimately end up in the legal process. We are open to them engaging with us at any stage of the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_421">I understand the logic of the bank not wanting to give write-downs lest that becomes a practice within the market and it is not possible to provide write-downs for many people. We hear regularly from banks that they deal with people on a case-by-case basis. There are cases where an individual or family would be able to deal with, say, two thirds of the debt owed but cannot deal with 100% of the debt owed. In some of those cases, the persons involved may go bankrupt or pay no money back to the bank. There would be a net benefit to the bank in writing down the debt in those cases. Why, in those cases, does the bank not allow for write-down? In a similar corporate scenario the decision is made positively for a write-down. There has to be a net cost to the bank in living up to its no debt write-down rule in certain cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">It is hard to answer that. As we entered the crisis Bank of Ireland had a lot of problems, although probably slightly fewer problems than some of its competitors. If we look at other metrics like, for example, the haircuts we took on loans transferred to NAMA, they were significantly below the industry average and provisions we have taken in business and other corporate books have been less than our competitors. Our books may have been better positioned coming in, including our Irish mortgage book. I think that was probably a factor. We probably focused on this earlier than our competitors did. However, in terms of the thrust of the Deputy's question, I think the consistency of our policies and procedures has been a feature of our relative performance. There is confusion as to what some of our competitors do and do not do.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">Mortgage to rent appears to be the big failure in the whole process. Allied Irish Bank appeared before the committee last week, at which time its representatives indicated that zero mortgage to rent cases have been concluded by that bank. I note from Bank of Ireland's results that it has completed five cases. Where does the problem lie and how can it be fixed?</p>

          <p eId="para_432">Perhaps I can take that question. The Deputy is correct that we have completed five cases. Nine are sale agreed and contracted. It is hoped that they will complete shortly as well. There are another seven in respect of which we have accepted the offer made by the approved housing body. It is now with the customer to accept what has been proposed. There are five completed and a number of others close to completion. There are 50 awaiting confirmation of demand from the local authorities and AHB. There are a number of others that for various reasons did not proceed, including a lack of demand for social housing and the customer opting not to participate in the scheme. I agree that the numbers completed at this point are disappointing. We are great supporters of mortgage to rent. It appears to us to be a very good solution to the problem for people whose properties are suitable for social housing, and for the people themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> We wrote to the committee 12 months ago, outlining details of how we thought the process could be improved. There have been some changes made recently. A new protocol, while it has not been signed off on, is in the process of being agreed. It deals with some of the issues around timelines and the amount of hand-offs that are in the process. There are a number of things that we believe need to be done to improve the process, including the establishment of a centralised dedicated agency to deal with mortgage to rent. The eligibility criteria undoubtedly needs to be revisited.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">For example, if customers had any small equity in the property they would not be eligible and if there was no local demand for social housing, they would not be eligible. They would be ineligible if incomes were over a small threshold and the types of family unit in a property sometimes cause the property not to be eligible for social housing. They are among the bigger issues but there is nothing that could not be overcome with the right people in the room. The process could be made to work.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">The following issue may not directly affect the Bank of Ireland but the witnesses may be able to shed some light on the regulation from the Central Bank. Allegations have been made that banks have sold loans to third parties for far less than what the debtor was originally happy to agree in an arrangement with the bank. The logic is that the debtor - the householder or businessperson - would be in the property and the third party would receive a very cheap loan. There have been allegations that there are not enough checks and balances within the system to prevent insider dealing between a bank and third party in such a scenario. Are there enough checks and balances to ensure, from the Central Bank perspective, that if loans are sold for values lower than a potential arrangement with a debtor, it would be done in a manner that would safeguard shareholders' interests?</p>

          <p eId="para_445">We have not done it and as a public company, and particularly because we are quoted on the London Stock Exchange as well as the Dublin exchange, there are rules, which are roughly the same. Up to recently we were on the New York Stock Exchange. There are very strict requirements around connected parties. We must disclose any transaction of anybody who is a material shareholder. The materiality definition is someone who owns probably more than 5% of the company. If we do a transaction and there is any indication that it might not be a commercial transaction, it must be disclosed to all the shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> I have an example, although it is not related to what the Deputy outlined. The Deputy might remember, for example, that our shareholders had to vote to allow us do the promissory note transaction with the State for the IBRC notes in 2013. That was because we must have transparency among all shareholders if we are doing what could potentially be perceived as a non-commercial transaction with a connected party, or somebody who has a shareholding in the banks. The rules are very strict and the board has a very high requirement in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">My final comments go back to the residual debt question that has been asked previously. It is quite shocking that Bank of Ireland is chasing residual debt, potentially, from a homeless person. Is there a cut-off period? For example, if I surrendered my home and there was residual debt of €100,000, would Bank of Ireland after seven years come to an understanding that there is no logic to pursue the residual debt? Will the individual have that hanging over him or her for a lifetime? Representatives from Ulster Bank were here earlier and they indicated that between seven and ten years is as long as they would chase residual debt.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">I will speak in generalities rather than about an individual case, as that is sometimes a rabbit hole in which people can disappear. In general, we recognise that there must be an incentive for the customer to support a proposal. We are pragmatic business people. We are commercial and recognise that in a commercial world if we would like somebody to do something, there is incentivisation. That incentivisation can be either that after a certain period of performance, there could be a period of further enhancement from the customer's perspective. It is a commercial arrangement with a customer but we recognise that there must be an incentivisation for somebody to co-operate. It could be a disincentivisation of going legal or a positive disincentivisation, putting something in it for the customer in order to co-operate. That is the way we try to operate.</p>

          <p eId="para_472">We had Ulster Bank here earlier saying the money it is currently providing for site finance and working capital for new home development is about 10% of what it was providing at the height of the boom. If every bank applied that, we would have about 8,000 houses built a year, less than half of where the market is at. I want to know what Bank of Ireland is currently providing for site finance and working capital for builders as a percentage of what it provided at the height of the boom.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> People are now struggling to get affordable homes. Might there be a rationale in place whereby the banks are seeing their own balance sheets improving due to the fact that the price of property is improving, without providing working capital and site finance? Why would they provide this when the law of supply and demand would mean they would only bring down the value of the property that is ultimately backing their loans? Relative to what it provided at the height of the boom, what site finance and working capital facility is Bank of Ireland now providing for start-up homes?</p>

          <p eId="para_483"> We do see that there is a business opportunity for us in providing money to housing finance. Our biggest single issue is the customer's ability to provide equity.

          <p eId="para_488">I am aware of that. What I am concerned about is people who are trying to get on the ladder. The 80% loan-to-value, LTV, ratio and the decrease on the affordability cash flow means that the price of housing is beyond the reach of many people. Supply is probably the biggest way of correcting that as it would create competition within the market, as Mr. Boucher acknowledged earlier when discussing his own variable methodology. What is Bank of Ireland going to do?</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Looking at the reports the bank has provided to the Central Bank historically, one would have to find exactly how much money it used for site finance, agriculture and so on. The fact that this sum has significantly decreased is, in my opinion, improving and helping the share price of the bank. I want to see more houses being built and I need the banks to provide more site finance and working capital. I am here to explain that we need more engagement from the banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">I have gone through this with Bank of Ireland in this committee on a number of occasions. It does not write off debt but rather keeps everybody and anybody on the line. Why would an individual not head towards bankruptcy and crystallise the loss for the bank? Surely that will have a negative impact on the bank's balance sheet.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">Mr. Boucher and his team are very welcome today. I would like to start with Mr. Boucher's thoughts on an issue that is not related to Bank of Ireland but rather concerns IBRC. Imagine if there was a company that owed Bank of Ireland €150 million and the market value of the company, which was insolvent and could not pay its debts was approximately €50 million. If the bank decided to sell the company and the €50 million was realised, that would leave the bank with a write-off of €100 million. Is there any situation in which the bank would condone a payment to the shareholders of several million euro which the bank would forgo as part of the total sale price?</p>

          <p eId="para_503">In general terms, we do have situations in which we need the co-operation of management or shareholders to keep a company going as a going concern. In particular, this would apply to construction or continuous process-type companies. For companies with dead assets where we do not need the co-operation of the management, we have a different view. In situations where the company must be kept alive to enhance or maintain its value, one might need co-operation. These are different situations which primarily reflect the nature of the company's business. I get criticised for that but our job is maximise recovery and in some situations we would have to do things we would prefer not to do in order to maximise value.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> In answer to Deputy Tóibín's question earlier, in certain situations one does recognise that incentivisation or disincentivisation is an appropriate part of commercial negotiation.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">I thank Mr. Boucher and appreciate that we both have to be careful. In his time as chief executive of Bank of Ireland since 2009, has the bank ever allowed a deal where a substantial amount was written off by the bank - up to €100 million or more - and where part of that deal was a multi-million euro payout to the shareholders of the insolvent company?</p>

          <p eId="para_506">I would guess that in some situations, for example in our leverage finance business, which is an international business, we have had to do that, usually as part of a club with other banks or in deals ourselves. I would guess in some work-out situations we have had to incentivise either management or existing shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Sometimes existing shareholders control certain patents. That might be an example, they have certain controls over the company that they are not going to surrender. The alternative is to put a receiver and liquidator in or the equivalent, Chapter 11 in the US, for example.</p>

          <p eId="para_510">Thank you. I would like to move on to mortgage arrears. As Mr. Boucher knows, I have been consistently very critical of Bank of Ireland’s approach to mortgage arrears. We will go into the numbers in a minute but I want to talk about the tone. When I talk to people involved in helping borrowers, be they commercial, not-for-profit or statutory operators, or at least funded by the public purse, and Bank of Ireland comes up, the words used for the bank’s approach to borrowers are “aggressive”, “unreasonable” and a word used to me this morning was “deplorable”. I know there are several personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, who refuse referrals on Bank of Ireland cases because they say Bank of Ireland is impossible to deal with and they will not spend any time on it. As chief executive and senior manager of a bank with a very long tradition in this country, which has always had very positive relationships with the private sector and the community sector, and which was rescued at a particular point, how do Mr. Boucher and Mr. Mason respond when the bank they run is consistently, and pretty much unanimously, singled out for this sort of criticism, with words such as “aggressive”, “unreasonable” and “deplorable”?</p>

          <p eId="para_511">I would first of all point out that in practice people do not tend to go to their Deputy when something has worked. The statistics show when talking about mortgages that in nine out of ten cases and this is verifiable information, we can provide a solution to the customer that is a higher proportion than our competitors, despite the fact that our book is demonstrably better performing. In nine out ten cases where we have offered a restructure, it has been accepted and they are performing.</p>

          <p eId="para_513">Our performance, when we come down to raw statistics, rather than anecdote, on a verifiable, comparable basis, shows we offer more solutions for customers as a proportion of arrears of our books and our solutions stick more. Those are facts.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">That is fine, but the statistics say nothing for the tone and the cause. They show the outcome. A perfectly reasonable response is that borrowers are signing on the dotted line because they are scared of Bank of Ireland in a way they are not scared of the other banks because they consistently see it operating in a much more aggressive manner. We do not know. That is the realm of speculation. What is not speculation is that any Deputy, or anybody working to help borrowers, will consistently single out Bank of Ireland, which has a proud tradition in this country, from the main banks – I am not talking about the sub-prime lenders who do not always act responsibly - and use words such as “aggressive”, “unreasonable” and “deplorable”.

          <p eId="para_517">I am concerned on an ongoing basis about the image of our bank and that is why I keep reiterating the facts: when we engage with the customer, and we have better engagement with customers, we do not have to employ third parties, we get more restructures offered and more of our restructures stick. The fact that other banks have confused messages and approaches and some kind of a lottery system for what happens, the consistent application of our policies, processes and procedures, has us where we are and the inconsistent lack of policies, processes and procedures has our competitors where they are.</p>

        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_420">
          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2015-04-29T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_518">Let us talk about that. The expert review on repossessions states the following as Government policy:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_519">The Government’s paramount objective in the context of resolving the mortgage arrears problem is to keep borrowers in their homes wherever feasible; repossession of private residences is a last resort when all other options have failed. The statutory and regulatory frameworks have already been strengthened in order to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Two weeks ago I spent the morning in Bray Circuit Court. One of the repossessions granted was sought by Bank of Ireland. The lawyer representing the bank admitted in court that repayment had been made the previous month. My understanding is that the amount was above the level of interest. The payments of the mortgage were occurring and mortgage arrears had built up in 2014. I know Mr. Boucher does not have the specifics of that case in front of him and he cannot comment on it yet it appears blindingly obvious that Bank of Ireland is moving to repossess houses when all other options have not been exhausted and when borrowers are making payments. What does Mr. Boucher say to that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_421">
          <from> Mr. Richie Boucher<recordedTime time="2015-04-29T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_521">I cannot comment on an individual case. I note the example the Deputy gives. We have to go through a very significant route to get a repossession. Repossession is a last resort. In our presentation we show that of the civil bills sought by banks 6% are from Bank of Ireland, the other paragons of virtue are at 94%. As a proportion of our book and as to where we are, we do not use the threat of court proceedings as a negotiating tactic. The other banks the Deputy describes clearly do. They bring people to court as a negotiating tactic.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> I cannot talk about the anecdotes the Deputy hears. All I can talk about is the verifiable available information, which is that Bank of Ireland accounts for 6% of the civil bills despite having 21% of the mortgage market. I can only deal with the facts as I see them. It disappoints me. I do not like the image of our bank being given in the terms the Deputy describes. It is not an appropriate image. I have 500 colleagues who are trained to do their job for the bank but to do it in as empathetic way as possible. We do not use pejorative words around our customers as other people do. They are our customers and they have challenges. We do have practices, policies and procedures. Some people do not like them but they are consistent.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">If I and others were to provide Mr. Boucher with a portfolio of testimony, maybe from individual borrowers but also from people working in this field with all lenders that identify Bank of Ireland as being on its own in the level of unhelpfulness and aggression used in these cases does he believe who might be factored into changes in the bank’s policy? I understand that Mr. Boucher’s job under law is to return value to his shareholders but the bank’s SVR mortgage is higher than that of several of its competitors. The verifiable word in the market is that if a borrower gets into trouble he or she will be treated in a much less reasonable and humane way by Bank of Ireland than by its competitors. If it turns out that the word is the bank is more aggressive, and if it is more expensive, that begs the question why would anybody take out a mortgage with the bank. With that in mind, would Mr. Boucher be open to reviewing testimony with a view to changing the tone and approach Bank of Ireland has taken consistently over the past few years when working out mortgage arrears problems, as I am told every day by people working in the field?</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Creed<recordedTime time="2015-04-29T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_526">I welcome Mr. Boucher and his team. He has given a very robust defence of the bank and the statistics make for interesting reading. I have to say I concur with the latter point made by Deputy Donnelly.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> Mr. Boucher is ahead of the posse. He has made reference to the other banks, in somewhat pejorative terms, and how they might manage their business. Undoubtedly, we have learned the following from our engagement with people like MABS, personal insolvency practitioners, New Beginnings or whatever. The overwhelming body of evidence, and this is from people whom I would deem to be reasonable and impartial observers, is that Bank of Ireland is back to business as usual. Given what we have been through, and given the fact that the taxpayer bailed the bank out, although I appreciate that the money has been paid back, there was a naive expectation that it would never be back to business as usual - that which preceded the crash that we have been through - and that there would be some moderation on the worst excesses of the profit motive in the bank. I am a capitalist and support the bondholder. In that milieu it must be possible to have a more humane approach to clients, particularly mortgage holders, who are in difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> I suspect the following will inevitably be the case and is where the bank should be concerned. People will not forget how they were treated. There is a lot of people who feel they are not being treated very fairly. In response, the CEO will resort to statistics and dismiss anecdotes. From the wide range of people who have expressed such a view, and I would suggest if one canvassed the views of all of the Oireachtas Members, one would get significantly the same point of view that has been made by Deputy Donnelly and I, the view is that Bank of Ireland would be perceived as the most difficult bank to engage with now. I understand the points that have been made by the CEO and he may wish to repeat them. It might be best if he took on board what has been said. The bank is ahead of the posse and has repaid its dues to the State but its obligations to change practice does not end there. I know the bank has a responsibility to its shareholders to maximise returns for them. Somewhere in between the bank's customers must receive due consideration. That is the end of my opening remark.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> I will now ask a few questions. Credit rating agencies have given the bank a particular status or standing and it operates in the Republic and in the UK. Can the delegation give us information on its credit rating by the rating agencies? They take into account all of the risk factors that impact on the bank's cost of funds, etc. Do they say the Republic of Ireland is a more difficult place to do business, relative to Northern Ireland? Do they say it is the same risk rating? Do they say it is a different rating for the UK? What is Bank of Ireland's credit rating where it operates?</p>

          <from> Mr. Richie Boucher<recordedTime time="2015-04-29T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_530">We deal with four different credit rating agencies. Before I get to our own, I will talk in a general attitude because that is much of the thrust of the Deputy's question.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> Different agencies look at things differently. Standard &amp; Poor's, in its rating, places a huge emphasis on what it calls the systemic-related issues. That means a bank is very tied with the sovereign ceiling and then the systemic issue. The organisation is very open and provides a very clear methodology. There is a high emphasis on the system so one cannot consistently outperform the system. I can see the sense in that because no matter how good one is, if the system is problematic and the country has issues, then one's own creditworthiness is impacted by that.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Moody's operates a slightly different position. It places less emphasis on the system but a big emphasis on the macro or the performance of the economy when it looks at banks of our size. Fitch is much more focused on the individual bank. For each of the credit rating agencies, our own rating has improved. We are still below investment grade for long-term debt but for short-term debt we are above investment grade. It does vary depending on short-term or long-term deposits. In general terms, the bank's improvement has contributed to that situation. Probably the biggest factor that influences our credit rating today is the perception of the sovereign.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">The bank's UK operation is in the mortgage business as well. If the agencies give it a similar rating to its operation in Ireland, that suggests they consider the risks to be comparable. It would equally suggest that the rates a customer pays for a standard variable rate should be comparable but they are not.</p>

It is true to say, to an extent, that competition in the Republic stems from banks that are exiting, at one stage or another, very difficult circumstances.

          <p eId="para_556">There are a lot of regulatory restrictions in the UK as well on the level of aggression one can have in one's office and that. They have macro prudential requirements in the UK as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> We now have competitors in the mortgage market and each of them is a meaningful competitor. Between KBC, Permanent TSB, AIB, Ulster Bank and ourselves, each of those competitors are meaningful. In other words, they have more than 10% market share. We have about 1% of the UK market. Our business in the UK is probably a little bit less.</p>

          <p eId="para_560">As can be seen from the figures, we veto a very small number. We have voted against 18 cases. There have been 243 cases voted on and we have voted against 18 cases, which involve secure credit, for a variety of reasons. We have given the full detail on the 18 cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> To summarise, which is what the Deputy asked for, it would largely be because the arrangement would not have returned the customer to solvency. In many cases it was that the proposal was not for what was allowed for under the Act, which was a six-year arrangement, but was for a shorter arrangement for something like a year, when the customer had clear repayment capacity to pay some of his or her debts over a six-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">In a couple of cases, there were assets outside of the jurisdiction, holiday homes and so on, which it was decided not to include in the personal insolvency arrangement. On that basis, we did not vote for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_566">The big difference in the UK regime is that the mortgage always gets absolute primacy. The regime here is quite different, with unsecured debtors given a higher proportion of consideration than they are in the UK. In the case of a lot of PIAs in this jurisdiction, the mortgage is left aside. Moreover, the repossession process is different in the two countries. We have a better-performing book in the UK than in Ireland. While we will repossess approximately 600 properties in the UK next year for a similar-sized book, I expect our figure for Ireland will be approximately 300. It is a different process, approach and attitude in the UK. Different markets will always have different cultural issues, different prices and different capital. I said earlier in response to a question from Deputy Fleming that we have to put more capital against an Irish mortgage than we do against a UK mortgage because of our loss experience here and because the process of recovery is different.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">Mr. Boucher said that part of the reason that Bank of Ireland's performance was better than its competitors was that its books were better positioned going into the crisis. Was that partly because of the personal relationship between bank personnel, particularly bank managers, in branches across the country and their customers? Is there a risk now, as the bank seeks to drive down costs and increase profitability at branches, that those personal relationships will be lost? Is there a danger, in short, of throwing the baby out with the bath water?</p>

          <p eId="para_568">There was a combination of factors which meant Bank of Ireland was different from its competitors. However, let us not take away from the fact that we did not come into the downturn well positioned. The fact that our competitors were in a far worse position is not anything for us to be particularly boasting about. We were relatively better but in a field where others were very badly positioned.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">I presume Bank of Ireland was relatively better positioned because it engaged in more prudent lending than its competitors. Was that in some part because of the personal relationships that were built between personnel and customers? The bank maintained those personal relationships for longer than other lenders before decisions were effectively made to conduct business remotely.</p>

          <p eId="para_570">I have worked at Bank of Ireland for nearly 12 years. In all that time, no member of staff, from the chief executive down, has had an individual discretion. There always has been the requirement for a second sign-off. I ask my colleague, Mr. McLoughlin, who runs our Irish business, to explain the structure and strategy for our branches.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">In 2007, Bank of Ireland had a network of more than 250 branches across the country. That number remains the same today. We see the engagement and outreach between branch and local community as being fundamentally important to our business. We are the only institution that has not reduced its branch footprint. In fact, we continue to invest in it quite significantly in terms of both resources and branch layout. We have arrangements in place across the country to facilitate very significant investment in local enterprise. We have conducted enterprise week events, for instance, where the local branch and staff work very closely with the local community. In the past 18 months we have invested in an initiative called Enterprise Town, which is another way of supporting local businesses. So far this year we have held Enterprise Town events in Ballincollig, Oughterard and Callan, and we intend to invest in 40 other towns across the country in 2015. That engagement, involving branch managers and staff working with the local community, is of vital importance to us.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara<recordedTime time="2015-04-29T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_572">I was aware that Bank of Ireland had not reduced the number of branches in County Clare, but I did not know this was the case nationally. I also am aware, however, that the bank has hugely reduced the services available at all local branches in Clare. There was a time when people going into their bank could expect to talk to a human being rather than having to interact with a machine. Automated services reduce costs, of course, but there are major problems when the machines break down.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> Mr. McLoughlin spoke about Bank of Ireland's commitment to local communities. In a context where the Central Bank is trying to move us all towards a cashless society, ATMs have become more and more important. When they break down there is a serious problem, particularly for businesses which are reliant on cash. In my home town of Scariff, the machine breaks down every Christmas and is not fixed until the new year. It is an issue I have raised with the bank's staff. The problem is especially serious because Scariff is served only by Bank of Ireland, a scenario that applies also to three other Clare towns, namely, Tulla, Milltown Malbay and Kilkee. When the machine breaks down and there is no possibility of fixing it over a holiday period, this impacts negatively on the bank's customers, including business customers who rely on people having cash to spend it in their pubs, shops, restaurants and so on. When no money is available from the ATM, people simply move on to the next large town where the ATM facility of AIB or another of Bank of Ireland's competitors is actually working. That leaves a very poor impression.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> I was contacted by a solicitor in Scariff recently who, although he is not reliant on ATM services as he is not a retailer, recognises how damaging this is for the businesses on which he relies. Furthermore, he pointed out, one cannot drop a letter into the bank's letter-box, because it is screwed shut. If one tries to contact the branch by telephone, one is put through to a central telephone service somewhere in the country. In other words, the branches are no longer bank branches as people would always have understood that concept. We are heading into a bank holiday weekend and there undoubtedly will be issues. Will Mr. McLoughlin come back to me next week with information on how many of the bank's ATMs did not work for the duration of the weekend, including the status of the facilities in Scariff, Tulla, Milltown Malbay and Kilkee? In the case of those four towns, as I said, the Bank of Ireland ATM facility is the only one.</p>

          <p eId="para_578"> Our focus is very much about enhancing our customers' experience and there is a significant investment going into ensuring that is the case. While the branch footprint has been maintained, there has been a significant shift in the types of services offered. Customers do a lot of their transactions now using the self-service machines. When people go into the branch, there is always a welcome adviser to meet them. Customers across all demographics tell us they like using the self-service machines.</p>

Our focus is on increasing customer service and enhancing customer experience. I am disappointed to hear about the issues the Deputy raised, and will follow up on them.</p>

I have been like a broken record on the issue of reputation for several years and I heard Deputies Creed and Donnelly speaking about it. There is one thing I am trying to get my head around, which I would like to tease out with Mr. Boucher. He talks about having 500 people working in the area of dealing with distressed mortgages. Bonuses are part of the culture in banks again. How are people dealing with distressed mortgages incentivised? Are they incentivised on the number-----</p>

          <p eId="para_615">I expect Mr. Boucher will not have the figures to hand, but could he give us an overview of the bank's lending to the agrifood sector? In particular, does he have a breakdown of inside-the-farm-gate lending in the various sectors? Particular areas of interest at the moment are the dairy sector and the dairy processing sector. Can he give us some information on that, and on lending being made to the agricultural sector for land purchase and overdrafts?</p>

          <p eId="para_616">I do not know the quantum, but we financed 10,000 acres of land transfers to the farming sector last year. We did 50% of the new lending to the agricultural sector last year. That excludes the very large co-ops and so on, so it would primarily be farming, but could also be small food manufacturers - craft food and so on. I do not have the figures off the top of my head, but we will come back to the Deputy on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_618">I apologise for missing the earlier session but I had to be at another committee meeting. I am sure many of the issues regarding variable rates and so on have been discussed. Mr. Boucher will be aware that the events around Siteserv have dominated media debate over the last week or two. That has opened up a debate around big write-downs on commercial loans. The figure the Minister is looking at now is loans over €10 million where there were significant write-downs and so on. What has Bank of Ireland's attitude, policy and practice been with regard to big loans and write-downs of the magnitude that we are seeing in the Siteserv case, where somebody owes €150 million and €110 million is written down?</p>

          <p eId="para_619">We get criticised for our policy but it is consistent. We seek to maximise recoveries. There are certain situations where there is limited liability. In a personal situation if someone goes bankrupt, whether court-enforced or through a liquidation process, there is no money and nothing to collect, so the entity itself is gone. In other instances, we will convert a portion of our debt to equity. Indeed, when we were recapitalising the bank, some of the bondholders converted some of their bonds to equity in the bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_620">Is Mr. Boucher saying that - I am not unsympathetic to him in this regard if that is what he is saying- under no circumstances could he envisage a situation where somebody owed Bank of Ireland €150 million and €110 million would be written down to keep them in business?</p>

          <p eId="para_621">There would be situations where one would have to restructure the debt. Deputy Donnelly asked me a slightly different question. I speak in general terms because I cannot talk about an individual situation with which Bank of Ireland had nothing to do. I have seen instances where management or shareholders have to be incentivised in very tricky situations. This is particularly the case in continuous process companies, where ultimately one needs co-operation to keep a company alive because if the management walked out or the shareholders stopped being involved for some reason, the company would collapse and one would be in the middle of a continuous process. That can happen in construction companies, in companies with continuous processes or where companies have certain types of contracts. That is a general comment, but I have to be careful, as do committee members, of identifying a particular company of which I have no knowledge. If the Deputy is asking about my corporate experience, I have seen situations where management teams or other persons have to be incentivised because that is the way to maximise one's recovery.</p>

I do not have the figures but it will be available on the Independent News and Media website as to the debt for equity conversion, which I think was done in 2012. It is publicly disclosed information because it was a public company, in terms of the quantum of bank debt that was converted for equity. I do not think it was broken down on an individual bank basis, and we do not disclose those figures, but as a matter of public record and as disclosed by the company, it has been converted.</p>
