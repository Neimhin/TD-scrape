          <p eId="para_3">We read today that the presidents of the five courts have written to the Taoiseach and the Government, articulating their view that the proposed Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017, the Bill of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has severe implications for the administration of justice in this country. We also hear that the Government nearly collapsed last week and that the rushing through of the legislation is to meet the demands of the Minister, Deputy Ross, who wants to ram the Bill through before the summer recess, without amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_5">He also wants to get this through to support the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">This is a very serious issue which should be above party politics in many respects. This is one arm of the governing edifice imposing a new system upon a coequal arm, namely, the Judiciary. The views of the members of the Judiciary should be known. The people should not be denied the views of the latter on such a central issue that goes to the heart of the separation of powers and the administration of justice in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> The motivation behind the legislation is wrong. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has for some time portrayed the members of the Judiciary as some sort of self-serving, egotistical insiders who wait for Buggins' turn - as he wrote in a letter published in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> - to get their positions. This is very damaging commentary on all members of the Judiciary. The Minister recently stated that it is not good enough to have judges making decisions on the basis of choosing their favourite ones. That is the wrong motivation for legislation as profound as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> Members need to be cautious, irrespective of the numbers in the House and who can leverage the most power and get their way. This is a very serious issue that demands deeper consideration than appears to be the case. There has been no compelling rationale put forward as to how the Bill championed by the Minister, Deputy Ross, is superior to every other alternative. Fianna Fáil has put forward legislation in this area and favours reform, as does everybody, including the Judiciary. We believe the Chief Justice should be the chairperson of any judicial appointments commission. I agree with the retired Supreme Court judge, Ms Catherine McGuinness, who has said that this Bill is a kick in the teeth for the Chief Justice because it undermines her position in such a manner. The under-representation of judges is equally unacceptable. For only three of the 13 proposed members of the commission to be the people who know best in terms of the talents and abilities of those seeking appointment - having assessed and watched them in the courts - is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Will the Taoiseach publish the letter he received from the presidents of the courts? Is the Government open to serious amendment of the legislation it is bringing forward? Is it determined to maintain the under-representation of judges and to undermine the status of the Chief Justice? Will the Bill, as the presidents of the courts are saying, undermine the administration of justice in this country?</p>

          <p eId="para_10">I will have to take advice as to whether I can publish that letter. There is no objection to the proposed legislation in the letter that has not already been flagged or appeared in the newspapers. There was a meeting some months ago involving the Chief Justice, the Taoiseach at the time and the Tánaiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, to discuss the Government proposals. There has been engagement with the Judiciary, both in terms of meetings and this letter, to hear their views on this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The Judiciary has served us very well and I have immense respect for our judges and also for the separation of powers in this State. The time has come to reform the way in which judges are selected. It needs to be more transparent and independent. It is important to explain what will happen if this legislation is enacted. The President will continue to appoint judges as per the Constitution. The President will appoint judges on the nomination of the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">The Taoiseach should not bring the President into this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_8">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_13">Those things will not change. They are in the Constitution. This legislation is about the process by which three names are put to the Government. The judicial appointments will put three names to the Government. From those three names, the Government will choose a judge. The legislation will also prevent canvassing. It will require that merit be the criterion for the appointment of judges. The judicial appointments commission will have a lay majority and a lay chairperson and everyone applying for appointment will have to apply to it, including sitting judges seeking promotion. Having a lay chairperson is not unusual and is the case in England and Scotland, where there is an equal number of legal and lay members. It is also the modern way by which people are appointed to senior positions in public office. If one takes the example of Secretaries General, who are the most senior people in Departments, while it may have been different in the past, in recent years they have been selected through the top level appointments committee, TLAC, which is not chaired by a civil servant and the majority of members of which are not civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">In the old days, civil servants may have selected Secretaries General from among themselves. In the modern world of selecting people to appointments, it does not happen that way. If, for example, in the private sector, a new CEO is being appointed to a company, that appointment is not made by a committee of CEOs. The board of the company will usually set up a sub-committee and non-executive directors, who are often in a majority, will select the new CEO. When hospital consultants, for example, brain surgeons, cardiac surgeons and geriatricians, are selected in HSE hospitals, the chairman of the interview board comes from the Public Appointments Service and is not a doctor. It may be different in voluntary hospitals. These reforms are really bringing us into the modern world by providing transparency, greater independence and having more lay people involved in selecting people for key public office.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">Empty phrases like "the modern way" mean absolutely nothing. There has been no compelling rationale for the changes. Deep down we know that the vast majority of Fine Gael Deputies do not agree with this Bill because it is being forced through because of the leverage of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in the same way the DUP leveraged £1 billion from its talks with the Conservative Party. At least the £1 billion will help the people of Northern Ireland. This Bill that Deputy Ross is leveraging because of the unique position he finds himself in will damage the separation of powers and the Judiciary and will undermine the administration of justice. That is our view. In particular, the relegating of the status of the Chief Justice is inconsistent with the Chief Justice's constitutional position in leading the Judiciary. The under-representation of judges, who are uniquely placed to assess the candidates who are going to come forward for application, makes no sense whatsoever. From any perspective there should be a reasonable space allowed for genuine interrogation of this Bill. There has been no compelling rationale other than the Minister's demonising and undermining of the Judiciary for the past two years. That is what he has done in his relentless commentary. He does not talk about the Bill being modern. He talks about getting rid of insiders and of people choosing their own candidates, which I believe is very damaging to the Judiciary-----</p>

          <p eId="para_19">-----who called for reform of the judicial appointments system years ago, before anyone else. It is no way to present a Bill. It is presented in a controversial and negative way, and it undermines the judicial arm of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> We had more than 30 years of paramilitary violence and our constitutional democracy and the various arms of our State survived and were sustained, including the judicial arm. It weathered all that, and the Taoiseach should not succumb to placating the Minister, Deputy Ross, on such a fundamental issue that goes to the heart of how we organise our affairs in this society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_14">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">I have immense respect for the current Chief Justice, whom I have known since I was a teenager, and also the office of the Chief Justice. It is not the case in either England or Scotland that the chief justice in those jurisdictions chairs their judicial appointments committee, so I do not see that as a denigration of anyone's office. It is very much the precedent in our neighbouring jurisdictions that the chief justice does not chair the similar committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The rationale behind the Bill is threefold. We want these appointments to be less political in the future, we want them to be more transparent, and we do not want any profession to be self-regulating or self-appointing. We have moved away from self-regulating and self-appointing professions a long time ago. When Fianna Fáil was last in Government, the decision was made to remove the medical majority on the Medical Council. I know it is not the same thing because the Medical Council does not hire doctors, but it can strike them off. The Medical Council, through reform brought in when Fianna Fáil was last in office, does not have a medical majority. There is a similar rationale behind that. No profession should be self-regulating or self-appointing. That is why there is a lay majority now on the professional regulator for almost every profession. This is the trend in policy, the trend in modernity and the trend in terms of reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> I want to point out that this legislation is not Independent Alliance legislation or Fine Gael legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">It is Government legislation. It is in the programme for Government, as is the commitment to a lay chairperson and as is the commitment to a lay majority. It was a programme for Government supported by the Independent Alliance and ratified by my party at our special conference in Athlone. It has been our position for at least a year. I have no intention of rushing this Bill through. There should be plenty of time for open debate and for amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">Cuirim fáilte roimh an tUasal Michael O'Brien. I understand he is a Dub, so he is doubly "fáilte".</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Yesterday, we heard the heart-rending story of Michael and Kathleen Devereaux from Wexford. Michael is 90, Kathleen is 85 and they have been inseparable during their 63 years of marriage. In April of this year they applied to the fair deal scheme. Michael was accepted but Kathleen was not. The Health Service Executive, HSE, maintained that Kathleen did not need long-term nursing home care despite the fact she had been in hospital since 28 April and requires constant care and supervision. The rejection of Kathleen's application is made all the more bewildering as it was supported by a letter from her doctor in which he makes clear that she would benefit from long-term care. Instead of allowing Kathleen to be with her husband in full-time care, however, the HSE offered her a home care package which comprised two 30 minute sessions of care twice a week. That is two hours of home care per week for an 85-year old woman suffering health problems, who has spent the past three months in hospital and who would be expected to cope with living alone for the first time in more than six decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> It has been made very clear that the family does not have the skills needed to support their mother living at home. The family appealed the HSE decision and was turned down. In media interviews, Michael, aged 90, described the devastation of the experience, saying there are times he feels as if his head is going to burst. He tries to switch off. He said they were loyal citizens all their lives and it was terrible to think the country has led them to this situation. He cannot sleep, he wakes at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. every morning, he prays and then he cries.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> This couple would have been left in this dreadful situation had they not taken to the national airwaves. That is a damning indictment of the HSE and of the Government. What is going on in the HSE to say that someone can make such an awful decision and then stand over it? It is mind-boggling. Those responsible for this decision have to be held to account. I suggest that anyone who is okay with treating an 85-year old woman with such contempt should not be working in the area of health care. We know this is not an isolated case. How many other couples are like Michael and Kathleen? Has the Taoiseach asked? Does he know?</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> I know that transitional arrangements have now been made for Kathleen and that a review of the case has been initiated but nothing is certain.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">In respect of the case Deputy McDonald raises, I read the media reports on the case this morning. It is something that should not have happened. I am very upset to hear that an elderly couple in their final years could be separated in this way. I think this decision was devoid of common sense and humanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">My heart goes out to them for what they have endured at the hands of our bureaucracy in recent weeks. I am very pleased that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, acted swiftly to resolve the case and have the decision reviewed. He will also look at similar instances. The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, were in contact with Tom Devereaux, the couple's son, in the past couple of hours and I understand that the situation has now been resolved. The couple are going to be reunited.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I cannot comment on the detail of any individual assessment or on which doctor signed off and which did not. I do not have access to that kind of detail. However, there were extenuating circumstances in this case whereby a very elderly couple was separated after over 60 years of marriage. That is not the kind of decision-making we should have in our State. It was devoid of humanity and common sense and everyone in government is very upset about it. It is a shame that the matter was not resolved before it entered the public domain but I am pleased the Minister and Minister of State acted very swiftly to contact the family. The couple will now be reunited. They should never have been separated.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">I have no reason to doubt that the Taoiseach and other members of the Government were distressed to hear of this case. I accept that absolutely. I also accept that a review has been initiated and that the Minister, Deputy Harris, acted speedily. I have no reason to question that. However, in a fundamental way, that is to miss the very important point of who was responsible for this decision. We need an answer in that regard. Who within the HSE thought it was sensible, acceptable or in any way consistent with good policy to make a decision to separate this elderly and vulnerable couple in this way? Somebody has to answer for that. Rather than engage in a damage limitation exercise, the Taoiseach needs to apply himself to tell us the "who" of this story and what action will be taken as a consequence of it. We also need to know of other couples - other Michaels and Kathleens - out there. We need to ascertain how many times this has happened. Has the Taoiseach made those inquiries or when will he make them so that he can revert to the House to assure us that it does not take going on the national airwaves to secure one's most basic and fundamental rights? That is what happened to Michael and Kathleen. I know there are others - I suspect there are a great many involved - who were left in this situation but for whom the airwaves were not, perhaps, an option. The Taoiseach must come back to us with the relevant information without delay.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I cannot tell the Deputy who made the individual decision in this particular case, because I do not know, but I can tell her how the system works or does not. The first step in the application process is a care needs assessment to identify whether an applicant needs long-term nursing home care. This is carried out by a health care professional appointed by the HSE by means of a common summary assessment report, CSAR. That includes consideration of a person's ability to carry out his or her activities, the medical health and personal social services being provided, the family and community support available and the person's wishes and preferences. Once the assessment is made, it is submitted to the local placement forum, which, in all locations, consists of a multidisciplinary team supported, in general and where available, by a consultant geriatrician. That is the process but it did not work in this case. We need to understand why and whether the rules need to be changed so that elderly couples in similar scenarios in other parts of the country are not separated in this way. The Deputy has my undertaking and that of the Minister that we will do exactly that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_47">The Taoiseach outlined a litany of processes which patently did not work in this case. In the past couple of days, there have been alarming reports regarding nursing home care in the State. We read in one Sunday newspaper that older people were billed for activities in which they did not participate. There is no comparable package to fair deal to allow people to remain at home even though it has been promised for a very long time. The ongoing scandal of delays in access to home care packages - delays which are estimated to be costing €18 million according to the Department of Finance - can surely be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> To return to the Devereaux case - those of us in Wexford would know the family as the Devereauxes because that is the way we pronounce the name in Wexford - I have been dealing with this since April. There is the correspondence to the HSE in respect of these matters. On 1 June, I was told by the HSE that the responsible person to come back to me was on leave, would not be returning until 21 June and that I would not get a response until then. This is a couple in their late 80s who have not been separated in 63 years except by decision of this State, a decision that no one with any sense of compassion would accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> For months, their son, Tom, and daughter, Christine, have been fighting the system to enable their mother to be admitted to the same nursing home as their father. They detailed their mother's considerable mobility and memory difficulties as well as all the other medical problems. They were all outlined in correspondence that both they and I have forwarded to the HSE, yet the answer was repeatedly "No" until such time as it was raised on the national airwaves. Bluntly, it is not good enough that the system is so defective that one can only have a compassionate response if it is raised on a programme such as Joe Duffy's, whose intervention I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> What about all the others? What about the other Michaels and Kathleens who do not have the wherewithal to reach the national media? How many more cases are there that we do not know about, especially given the processes that were so well laid out and set out by the Taoiseach simply do not work? One after another, all these groups, bureaucrats and decision-makers deal with the detailed medical reports but cannot come to what is now a self-evident, compassionate decision until someone points it out in the national media.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> How did this come to pass? How many more Michaels and Kathleens are there to be dealt with?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T14:25:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_52">To pick up on some of Deputy Howlin's remarks, I am sure he is aware from his constituency work that the waiting times for home care packages have considerably improved in recent months due to the additional resources that have been provided by Government, with the largest health budget now in the history of the State. When it comes to additional fees for nursing homes, the Minister is working on proposals to ensure greater transparency in that regard in order that people going into a nursing home will know what additional fees they may have to pay for extras and to ensure people only pay extra fees for genuine extras and not as an additional contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> On statutory home care, the consultation will be launched this week. It is important we get that right. That is with a view to moving towards a statutory right to home care similar to that which exists with the fair deal scheme. The review of the fair deal scheme is under way at present and the new Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people is meeting representatives of Age Action and Nursing Homes Ireland today to discuss this and many other issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> I am advised that the decision in this case was not a budgetary one, as the scheme is not running over budget, but a clinical one based on the fact one member of the couple did not need nursing home care. However, it was the wrong decision. It was wrong to separate a very elderly couple in this way. It was inhumane and lacked common sense. The Government does not stand over it. We now need to examine why the decision was made in the first place, whether there are other cases, and one would have to surmise that there are other cases, and what we can do to ensure the needs of very elderly couples are assessed together, as they should be, and that they are not separated in this way.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I welcome the Taoiseach's compassionate response to this matter. If it is self-evident that this is the correct decision within minutes of anyone hearing about it, how is it that it was not self-evident to the people to whom we give statutory authority to make those decisions? There has to be a change to a culture that does not take out the measuring tape and say that a couple who have been together for 63 years can be separated because they do not fit into a particular matrix that has been set out.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">The Taoiseach should indicate how the Government will bring about that cultural shift to ensure that people within the system apply the compassion he himself has now applied to this case without having such cases brought into the attention of the national media. It is self-evident that not every individual case will be afforded the attention given to this case but every single case deserves the same degree of attention and compassion.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">As I said, I have only become aware of this case in the last couple of hours. I would like to be able to give the Deputy more definitive answers than I can at present. It may well be the case that the people who were the decision makers in this case followed the rules to the letter and did not allow for a degree of compassion and humanity. There is an<i> ad misericordiam</i> principle that exists in the Health Acts that allows one to make exceptions in extenuating circumstances. That is the basis on which, for example, we allow lots of discretionary medical cards. There is a responsibility on us as politicians and on senior leadership and management of the HSE to change the rules if needs be. One cannot really blame staff on the ground for applying the rules as they are but if the rules need to be changed, they will be.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">Yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> raised significant new questions regarding the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE and its handling of the controversial Seán FitzPatrick trial, which was the longest-running criminal trial in the history of the State. The public's reaction to the case was one of feeling utterly let down. People read what happened in court - rightly or wrongly - as another example of people with friends in high places. They were left with a sense of punishment being only for the little people. In a week when public debate rages about the operation of the courts and the Judiciary, it must be said that cases such as the FitzPatrick one have a significant impact on public confidence in the system as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> I want to raise with the Taoiseach what appears to be a significant conflict in the information provided to me and the <i>Irish Independent</i> by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation recently compared with information provided to my party colleague, Deputy Shortall, in November 2015. Yesterday's revelations in the <i>Irish Independent </i>seem to suggest that the ODCE effectively misled the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Government regarding its ability to effectively investigate the FitzPatrick case and provide the Director of Public Prosecutions with the evidence required to prosecute. On 31 May this year, I received a reply from the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation which assured me that in 2011, the Secretaries General of two Departments, namely, Justice and Equality and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, had met ODCE officials and offered extra resources, if needed, for the investigation. The reply went on to say that the ODCE had claimed that it had no need for any extra resources. The reply clearly says that it was emphasised at the meeting that any request for resources would be responded to positively. The reply confirms that the ODCE stressed that it was satisfied with the resources available to it. However, in a reply to my colleague, Deputy Shortall, in November 2015, it was claimed that the ODCE had flagged the need for further resources within its office. Subsequent replies relating to that question indicate that there was a significant delay in meeting those resource requests. That is obviously a significant issue in its own right. The <i>Irish Independent</i> claims that the emails sent internally from Mr. O'Connell in 2011 about concerns regarding the lack of resources within the ODCE to pursue the FitzPatrick investigation were only forwarded to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation within the last few weeks. We need to know if that is true. We know that during the course of investigation, Mr. O'Connell shredded key documents and engaged in coaching witnesses. Ultimately, this and other issues led to the controversial collapse of the case. </p>
          <p eId="para_60"> I ask the Taoiseach to explain the conflict between the reply from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to me in May of this year and the same Department's reply to my party colleague, Deputy Shortall, in November 2015. Does the Taoiseach worry that the ODCE may have concealed vital information from the outset regarding its ability to pursue the FitzPatrick investigation? Does the Taoiseach believe that the Government was misled by the ODCE? </p>

          <p eId="para_61">I have not seen the report. It has now gone to Cabinet and has not been published yet. I understand parts of it may have appeared in a newspaper, but I do not know to what extent they are the truth or the full truth. The report has not gone to the Attorney General who has to consider whether it needs to be redacted because individuals are named in the report and they may need to have their good names protected. Once the Attorney General has dealt with the report, we will then publish it, if we are permitted to do so, with a response. At that point, it will be possible for the Tánaiste to answer the Deputy's questions in more detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> What I can say is that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, has received additional resources in the past year, including several additional staff. Too often in this country, a lack of resources is used as an excuse for poor performance, which is why so often additional resources do not make any difference in terms of outcomes and performance. What I read in the newspapers is that documents were shredded that should not have been shredded and witnesses were coached who should not have been coached. I do not know how a lack of resources causes someone to shred a document he or she should not have or to find the time to coach a witness he or she should not have coached. The Government and Opposition must not allow people to hide behind the excuse of resources, which is not always the reason everything goes wrong. Often, it is not the reason at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> As Taoiseach, I have expressed my view very clearly that I do not believe our capacity to respond to white-collar crime and corporate fraud is adequate. For this reason, I have asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to work together, with their Departments, to develop a package of measures to go to Cabinet by the end of September. This will enable us to strengthen and deepen our response to white-collar crime and corporate fraud. It is necessary and people demand it, and if we have any chance of restoring confidence in the State's ability to deal with such issues, we need to do exactly that. </p>

          <p eId="para_64">I know the report has gone to the Attorney General. That was not the question I asked. I asked about a conflict that arose when we posed the same broad question to the same Department on two occasions and received two different responses. In 2013, just before the trial commenced, the Department was made aware that the documents had been shredded. I am sure the same information went to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Would we have had the longest running criminal trial in the history of the State if they had had that information?</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> I asked the Taoiseach for specific information. The reply to the question I posed in 2013 stated that resources would be provided if requested. I compared that reply with the one Deputy Shortall received when she posed the question in 2013. She had to follow up the reply with other questions on how many staff were in place and when staff numbers would be augmented. It took until last year before the office had its full complement of staff. That is two years, which is a long time. I asked the Taoiseach a specific question on how he could resolve this conflict. That is an issue in its own right, irrespective of a report going to the Attorney General. We had a Department telling us two different things. Both answers cannot be right because they are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Will the Taoiseach address that issue, please? Does he believe he was misled by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement?</p>

          <p eId="para_66">I do not have an answer to that question. I have not yet had any dealings with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement so I cannot say it has misled me. I certainly have not had any dealings with it in the past 11 days, as Taoiseach, or in my previous briefs. I do not believe it misled me, but if the Deputy has a question to ask of a line Minister, I imagine she will do that in the normal way.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> On resources, in April 2013, a revised workforce plan was submitted by the ODCE identifying the need for five accountants and an information technology expert. That requirement subsequently grew to seven accountants. Notwithstanding the moratorium on recruitment in place at the time, the Department secured sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for recruitment in October 2014. A campaign was launched in November 2015 under the auspices of the Public Appointments Service. After the normal recruitment processes were undertaken, a panel of eight forensic accountants was established. From April through to July 2016, five forensic accountants were formally recruited for the office and the remaining panellists withdrew. The Department subsequently asked the Public Appointments Service to run a specialist competition to allow it to recruit two more investigators to bring the cadre to seven. That campaign is in process.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">For a number of weeks, I have signalled at the Business Committee that we need to have a debate on the renewal of the FEMPI emergency legislation. The latter is very draconian legislation which was brought in on an emergency basis to cut people's pensions and pay, make them work hours for nothing and so on. It was all justified on the basis of an emergency. That legislation is renewed each year. The emergency is over. It is a hallmark of a tin-pot dictatorship to maintain emergency legislation after emergencies end. Mubarak did it, for example. Many other regimes do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">Indeed. At the very minimum, we should have a vote on the legislation. As part of the debate, we should be allowed put forward motions in order that there be a vote as to whether we renew this extremely draconian legislation which impacts on hundreds of thousands of workers in this country. I would also like to point out that, having raised the matter over a number of weeks at the Business Committee, we finally secured broad agreement last week that this debate would take place on Thursday morning. It was then relegated to the graveyard slot on Thursday. Frankly, I think that is deliberate. It is because the Government does not want this issue discussed and it does not want it voted upon. It wants to have a minimum of discussion. The debate should happen on Thursday morning and there should be provision for Deputies, groups and parties to put forward motions so that we can vote on whether to renew this draconian legislation. Legislation on offences against the State has to be renewed every year. We have to vote on it because we understand how serious an infringement it is on people's rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">These are really matters for the Business Committee rather than matters to be resolved in this forum.

That dialogue involves the social partners, unions, business groups and others.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">Regarding protecting the rights of the child, the Government has been dragging its feet on a series of legislative actions. For example, there is no sign of the child care (amendment) Bill, which is supposed to bring much-needed reform to the guardian <i>ad litem</i> services used in Ireland, essentially giving a voice to the vulnerable child and protecting children at their most vulnerable in the courts. Others are the gambling control Bill, designed to deal with the issue of children and gambling, the affordable child care Bill and the Adoption (Amendment) Bill. These Bills comprise a suite of measures designed to deal with issues relating to child protection and child care. As the end of this Dáil session approaches, these items of legislation are nowhere near to being brought to a conclusion. That is a particular concern. When can we expect these legislative items to be brought forward?</p>

          <p eId="para_133">The Adoption (Amendment) Bill has been through the Seanad and Dáil, and the amendments now need to be taken back to the Upper House. That is listed to be done on 13 July. Last week, I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, about the gambling control Bill, which is now very advanced. We hope to have that in the next session. As the Deputy says, having proper regulation in that area is long overdue. The heads of the child care (amendment) Bill were published in January and we anticipate that to be in for the next session. The affordable child care Bill has run into a number of difficulties, as Deputies will be aware. We had hoped to have that up and running for September. That will now not be the case. The child care subsidies are still being provided but this is being done through the existing schemes. We do not yet have a date as to when the legislation will go through. I anticipate that it would be done by the end of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">We are now at the end of June and we will take Second Stage this week. Is it realistic to imagine that we will have all Stages of this legislation dealt with, allowing for amendment if Members so wish, and allowing the time and space for full consideration? I understand it is the Taoiseach's intention to have these matters dealt with before we rise for the recess. While Sinn Féin will support the spirit of the legislation we will debate the detail of it. We want to be assured that every Member has the opportunity to consider and amend what is essential and important legislative change.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">So, yes it is realistic that we can get the legislation at least through this House and into the Seanad before the recess. I am mindful of the comments of others. I do not want to see the legislation rushed through. If people want to have a third debate on it and to have amendments debated that should be allowed as well, but I believe it is within the capacity of this House to meet those deadlines. I do not think anybody wants the perception created that somehow the Bill is being rushed through. It has been a year in development already so it has not been rushed this far, and lots of time is being provided on Second Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">In 2015 we legislated for the establishment of a tenancy deposit protection scheme to be operated by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. In that year, the RTB had noted that disputes regarding deposit retentions accounted for 22% of all disputes. Yet, when questioned by my colleague, Deputy Penrose, it seems there is no intention of enacting a tenancy deposit protection scheme. Instead, what we understand is the Government proposes to review the scheme, which is difficult since it is not even up and running. The Government proposes to create new legislation, only the heads of which we can expect to see by the end of this year. We have already enacted legislation. What we require is a statutory instrument, ministerial action, to enact the existing legislative provision to protect tenants' deposits. Will the Taoiseach act on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_146">I am afraid the Deputy will have to raise that directly with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. I am in general agreement with the Deputy that we should have such a protection scheme in place. It is very important that the deposits which tenants pay are held by an independent body, not by a landlord. That should be the case for all sorts of obvious reasons. I will have to raise the matter with the Minister myself and ask him to contact Deputy Howlin directly.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">First, I will make the general point that the Department would only consider acquiring land where there is an identified need. We have a very detailed approach to identifying where need occurs. That is what we pursue. We obviously have a restricted budget and we have to cater for 15,000 additional pupils every year so we have to take an approach that manages our resources to provide schools in a timely manner. We apply that uniformly across the country. We are not a local authority planning what is the best development of a local area, which is a distinct and different matter, and that is governed by the development plan of the local authority. We manage where we need school grounds. As Members will have seen recently in Harold's Cross, we acquired such grounds. That is the position. We acquire them as we need them.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">We have not considered compulsory purchase powers in respect of our need to do that because by and large we work with local authorities to identify needs. It has worked well. Generally, a compulsory purchase order, CPO, is a slow process and we have not favoured it to date.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">Housing is now a desperate crisis. The rent cap, put in place by the Government in areas of housing pressure, is not helping the market. It is driving landlords away from the provision of social housing and is driving them into the Airbnb business. I ask the Taoiseach not to proceed any further and not to designate any other areas in the State for rent caps. It is having an adverse effect and is not helping the social housing market. I ask that the Taoiseach desists from imposing rent caps in any other part of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">Based on the recent numbers we have seen, rent caps appear to be working. Rent increases have moderated in the areas of rent pressure zones to which the rent caps apply, and the extension to new areas is based on the criteria as set out in the legislation. It does not apply to new landlords. If a person decides to let out his or her place or to buy somewhere with a view to renting it out, the rent cap does not apply to them. It may be the case that some people are leaving the rental market to get a better price on Airbnb, and perhaps that does happen, but there are a number of measures we shall examine between now and the budget to encourage more landlords to stay in the rental market and more people to enter the market. It is evident that once their rental property recovers in value, many people are selling on. This is part of the problem that causes a lack of supply.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">Last autumn we introduced a Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2016 at the same time that Fianna Fáil Deputy John Lahart introduced the Local Government Reform (Amendment) (Directly Elected Mayor of Dublin) Bill 2016. The Minister of the time said he would revert back to us before 30 June to see how we would get a directly elected mayor for Dublin and perhaps also consider the same for Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. This weekend we see that the new Minister of State with special responsibility for local government and electoral reform, Deputy John Paul Phelan, has said he believes we need four directly elected mayors for Dublin. This city needs that like a hole in the head. It is the lack of co-ordination in local government that is the real problem. Will the Taoiseach clarify the Government's plans for legislating for a directly elected mayor for Dublin? When does he expect the Government to live up to its promise of 30 June and to enter talks, as it said it would, with the Opposition parties on how we might make this work?</p>

The new Minister of State with special responsibility for local government and electoral reform, Deputy John Paul Phelan, will respond to the Deputy before 30 June, as committed to before. During the debate on the matter at the time, we discussed the difficulty in having a Dublin super mayor over the four local authorities. What authority does such a mayor have if he or she is over four local authorities? No legislation is planned at this stage but the Minister of State will respond to the Deputy by 30 June.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">I have a question for the Taoiseach. It is one I asked 12 months ago on a commitment made by the Government and it also relates to a commitment made by the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, when he was the Minister for Health. It is about IVF support for those in need of it. At this point almost one in six couples in Ireland trying to have a child needs to have IVF treatment. At around €6,000 it is incredibly expensive. Ireland is one of only three countries within the EU that does not give any supports. I know that research was commissioned on IVF supports in other countries, and the criteria change from country to country. The research also looked at the percentage of funding given. It is about time we took this issue on board. The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the previous Taoiseach, gave a commitment that possibly by this June we would have something. Perhaps the Taoiseach could report to the House in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">We do provide some financial support, through the tax system, for example, where 20% of the cost of IVF services is tax deductible. Many of the medicines that are required for the process are made available on the drugs payment scheme and on the General Medical Services scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">There is some financial support, but it is much less than what is provided in other countries. My view is that as part of our normal medical services, we should provide IVF and assisted human reproduction to people who need it. The difficulty is that there is no legislation governing assisted human reproduction. It happens outside the law at present. It is neither illegal nor provided for in the law. An assisted human reproduction Bill is being drafted. We had expected the heads of the Bill by June, but unfortunately it now looks like we will not have them until later in the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">We need to reduce rates valuations on businesses because they are leading to job losses in every county. Rates are increasing rather than decreasing and this is killing shops and businesses. The commercial rates Bill would give councillors the power to reduce bills for businesses. This will enable thousands of businesses to benefit from significantly reduced bills. The Bill would also create a level playing field whereby community rates, water rates, small and medium-sized enterprises and large multinational companies can be supported. It would ensure that taxpayers are no longer required to pay their annual bills in two instalments. The Bill would for the first time give local authorities the power to slash fixed rates for businesses. Our town centres are being decimated. Every day, someone comes into my constituency office to complain about rates. When can we expect the Bill to come before the House? I hope this is a priority for the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for raising this important issue. I agree that local authorities require greater flexibility in how they apply commercial rates. Perhaps a rates break could be given to new businesses. Distinctions could be made between different types of businesses on our main streets. Many such provisions are provided for in the commercial rates Bill, the heads of which were approved by the Cabinet in April. The Bill is currently being drafted.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">It appears that the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017, which has been the subject of a great deal of discussion, is the only substantive legislation that the Government is offering before the summer recess. My party leader has outlined to the Taoiseach some legislation that is important to him. We have given a commitment to facilitate the passage of the Technological Universities Bill and the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2016. Little or nothing has been said publicly about the Technological Universities Bill. I wonder whether it continues to have the approval of the Government at this stage. If not, why is that the case? Institutes of technology throughout the country are quite worried about the gap or lacuna that exists. There is uncertainty in this sector as a result. I do not think the Government is doing anything to address that. We are ready and willing to pass legislation if the Government brings it forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_189">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to render it unlawful for any person to rent residential property without provision of, and agreement to publication of, pertinent information to the Residential Tenancies Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Everyone in this Chamber is all too aware of how difficult the housing market is right now, for both buyers and renters. Some things have been achieved in the past year and I pay tribute to the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the current Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for the work done in this field. However, as regards action in the rental market, more can be done. As a renter myself I am very conscious of the problems renters face. These problems are faced not just by my generation but by an ever-growing number of people across an ever-growing number of age cohorts.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> It is quite clear the property price register has given information and transparency and has allowed people in the past to make more informed choices when it comes to the purchase of property. The same power must be given to, and it must be expanded for, those in the rental sector. This is not, nor should it be projected as, adversarial legislation. It is pro-tenant but it is also pro-good landlord and it complements the rent protection zone legislation introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Coveney. It ensures the legislation is more likely to be adhered to, allows renters to make more informed choices and ensures that landlords cannot breach the rental protection zone rules between tenants. I see examples of this regularly. People present to my office having had a lease which has expired and where the landlords are putting up the rent by 20% or 30% between tenants, in a clear breach of rent protection zone rules that is happening every day. The transparency and information allowed by this Bill would fix any potential breaches in this area. The Government should be concerned about making its own rules work in the best way possible by minimising rent increases between tenants, both old and new, and it is incumbent on Deputies of all parties to work to make the market as good as possible for both tenants and good landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> Some would say this adds bureaucracy or unnecessary administration but I do not think so. The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, already collects this information when the tenancy is registered, together with the information on the size and type of property. This Bill effectively liberates that existing information for the public good. As we know, for markets to work well certain things are needed and one of the key ingredients is information. Ronan Lyons, the esteemed economist from Trinity College, has noted that those active in the housing market a decade ago or more know well the feeling of not knowing whether they overpaid for a property and this feeling haunts many renters right now as they do not know what a fair price is. In Dublin in particular, and especially in my constituency of Dublin North-West, people often take whatever property is available for whatever price is available. Information is the root of what this Bill promises and I commend it to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_199">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and the Equal Status Acts 2000 by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of a person’s social and economic background; and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Since I have been spokesperson on justice and equality for the past 14 months we have had a lot of legislation and debates concerning justice but there has been very little debate relating to the equality part of the justice and equality brief. This legislation seeks to perfect that flaw. Politicians talk a lot about equality but if we are serious about achieving equality we need to introduce some statutory schemes in order to ensure it is obeyed. At present, equality in our legal system is reflected in the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts, which were first introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1998 and 2000, respectively. The Employment Equality Acts prohibit discrimination in respect of employment and access to employment, while the Equal Status Acts provide a prohibition on discrimination in the provision of service. Both sets of legislation set out nine grounds upon which discrimination is prohibited. For example, one cannot discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, gender, religion, age or sexual orientation. To a large extent it is difficult to police this but the fact that it is contained within legislation is important as it sends out a message to employers and service providers that discrimination in this area is not permitted. It is effective in reducing discrimination and has been effective in the nine areas in which the legislation prohibits discrimination at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> In recent times Deputy O'Loughlin and I, as well as other members of our party, have become aware from speaking to people at our clinics that there is another form of discrimination, which is probably more widespread but which is not prohibited in our legislation. This is the form of discrimination that arises for people who live in certain estates, mainly local authority estates, who say that when they apply for jobs they do not put down their address because the area in which they live is associated with deprivation, higher anti-social behaviour or some elements of criminality. We know that this is happening and it is shameful. It violates the principles of equality that people can discriminate against individuals because of where they come from in the city or the country. It has an impact on individuals and people tell me they give different addresses when submitting job applications if they are from certain estates which are frowned upon, to avoid the stigma associated with their address by certain employers. This does not just apply to employment contracts but is also relevant to the provision of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> The Bill that Deputy O'Loughlin and I seek leave to introduce seeks to add one further ground of prohibited discrimination to the nine grounds already contained within the legislation. The new ground is referred to as the socio-economic ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">It would define disadvantaged socio-economic status, in both the employment equality and equal status legislation, as meaning a socially identifiable status of social or economic disadvantage resulting from poverty, level or source of income, homelessness, place of residence or family background. A ground stating that one could not discriminate against individuals in respect of employment or the provision of services because of this disadvantaged socio-economic ground would then be added to each individual Act. This legislation will have a wide impact. It will be of benefit to individuals who sometimes feel that the law and the political system has left him or her behind. For that reason, I am commending it.</p>

            <p eId="para_222">Last week, the Taoiseach indicated he would not withdraw his invitation to President Trump because it would cause a diplomatic incident, which is not something President Trump worries about in his daily actions. However, in the face of evil, diplomatic incidents are sometimes necessary. Last Saturday, the Taoiseach took part in the pride parade, as did I. The focus of the pride events in the US this year was completely on Donald Trump. I note the Taoiseach went further than not withdrawing the invitation to President Trump and spoke of his enthusiasm for visiting the White House on St. Patrick's Day, a tradition he is aware was debated in the House in regard to his predecessor. The proposed visit should be debated before the Taoiseach undertakes it and for him to say he would do that was planning too far ahead. This is not business as usual. The Trump regime is homophobic, sexist and racist. It is not business as usual and the Taoiseach should not do all the traditional things that have always been done. People who are in fear of Trump's policies would appreciate a gesture of solidarity from any head of state. LGBTQ people in America are currently in fear of the loss of support from the state for their marriages and employment rights and that schools will not recognise their children or allow their children to change their names. Women are in fear that President Trump will row back laws that were won over many years. The Taoiseach should not commit to visiting the White House. What will he raise with President Trump in his phone call later today?</p>

Although she is not of my political family but rather that of the Taoiseach, I am very taken by the attitude of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who will only deal on the basis of European principles. In the short phone call that the Taoiseach is to receive this afternoon, will he specifically mention the need for proactive action across the globe on climate change and the commitment that the Taoiseach has set out for the Government in that regard? In regard to immigration, will he point out that it is not acceptable or proper for Irish citizens with who have lived law-abidingly long term in the United States to be taken away from their place of work in handcuffs without even the decency of being able to contact their family members and make arrangements before they leave? In regard to the taxation system, has the Taoiseach had any discussions with the US authorities in regard to President Trump's proposals for a border adjustment tax, which would have very profound implications for American businesses sited in this State?</p>

            <p eId="para_252">Donald Trump is pursuing pure, unadulterated racism. There is no other word for it. Does the Taoiseach think that it is acceptable that we would invite to Ireland someone who would impose a purely racist ban against six nations, encompassing tens of millions of people, or is he going to speak to Donald Trump about that, say it is not acceptable, and add that we are not going to allow US immigration officers at Shannon or Dublin to implement that policy on Irish territory? It is racism. Do we stand against racism or do we not? Are we going to speak up against it and take the first opportunity to do so, which the Taoiseach has this afternoon, or not? Is the Taoiseach going to express concern about Donald Trump boasting of a €110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, a vicious, brutal, undemocratic dictatorship which kills and executes its political opponents and which denies the most basic civil rights to women, ethnic minorities and workers? Is the Taoiseach going to express any concern about the dangerous escalation of tensions by that country against Qatar and Iran, all being stirred up by Donald Trump? Is the Taoiseach concerned about these things? Will he say anything to Donald Trump today, and is he seriously suggesting inviting someone pursuing those kinds of dangerous and racist policies to this country and fete him here?</p>

Relations between Ireland and America are very important. They are going to go on long after Presidents, taoisigh and Governments change in both countries. They are relations that go back centuries. There are very important economic, cultural and family ties that exist between Ireland and America, and the relationship that we have with the United States is one that is going to have to withstand any particular Taoiseach or President.</p>

Equally, even when there are governments with whom we do not agree, I generally believe that engagement is better than refusing to engage, and I would apply the same principles to counties like Cuba and Venezuela, where civil and political rights are suppressed and have been for decades, and much more than they are in the United States.

            <p eId="para_256">The concern specifically around the United States is not just the domestic policies pursued by this Administration but the global reach of the United States, which is unrivalled by the Cubans and the Venezuelans. The Taoiseach would accept that.</p>
            <p eId="para_257"> It is very difficult to know where to start with the Trump Administration. On the one hand, people accept the reality that this man was democratically returned to office. That is a fact. However, there is a huge concern around where this country and its Administration positions itself in its interactions with that Administration, and there is no appetite whatsoever simply to go along with what amounts to a fairly warped view of the world with strong elements of evil laced through.</p>
            <p eId="para_258"> Will the Taoiseach comment specifically on the issue of what we in this country call the undocumented, who are in fact the Irish illegals Stateside? The recent arrest of a Donegal man who has been living in the United States for 20 years has caused huge anxiety for all the Irish community. According to the immigration and customs enforcement branch of the Department of Homeland Security, there was a 37% increase in arrests on immigration charges in the first three months of the Trump presidency. Will the Taoiseach tell the Dáil if the Government has recorded any increase in arrests of undocumented Irish citizens in the United States? Is he aware of any other citizens currently being held by the immigration service for deportation, and can he report on the extent of his lobbying of the Administration in a bid to find a resolution to this situation?</p>

            <p eId="para_310">President Trump and his Administration have been distancing themselves from international organisations and principles which have underpinned co-operation between democratic states since the end of the Second World War. That is the fundamental shift that is happening under the Trump presidency which should concern us. It is not about how we oppose Trump but how we continue to express confidence in those international organisations, rule-based institutions and agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_311"> The afternoon's courtesy call will break no new ground. I take the point that it is a courtesy call but I do think the Taoiseach should perhaps stress that Ireland continues to believe in free trade and in access to markets, not protectionism, which is a dangerous trend that is emerging, and also in international co-operation on issues such as human rights and climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_312"> The Taoiseach might also be mindful of the fact that President Trump's knowledge of Ireland is probably still on the level it was when he attended a Sinn Féin fundraising dinner and was welcomed warmly by Deputy Adams on that occasion. It might be useful to point out that his party's approach to taxation and trade is not one that is shared by the majority of the people. </p>
            <p eId="para_313"> The planned visit to the United Kingdom has been cancelled, the Taoiseach probably realises that, because there is a fear of public protest which would be too hot or large to handle. I presume the same would apply here.</p>
            <p eId="para_314"> Does the Taoiseach have any update on a new ambassador to Ireland? The recent passing of the great Dan Rooney, a former ambassador, reminded us of the importance of that post to Ireland and to relationships between the United States and Ireland. Has there been any indication of an imminent appointment? </p>

I am happy to answer those questions but it is my intention initially to speak about the long-standing links that exist between the two countries and mention as many other issues as I possibly can but free trade is certainly one that I would like to mention and to restate Ireland's and the European Union's commitment to free trade and opposition to protectionism which was again a feature of the European Council summit last Thursday and Friday, where the council decided against proposals that would screen purchases of State-owned enterprises of companies in Europe. As much as it is possible to work in many things into a conversation, the ongoing commitment to free trade will be one of those.</p>

            <p eId="para_327">I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_328"> A Programme for a Partnership Government, published in May 2016, sets out the agreement between the parties and Deputies who are participating in, or supporting, the Government. </p>
            <p eId="para_329"> Independent Deputies brought their own vision and ideas to that programme, to how our country should be governed and how we need to deal with the myriad challenges we face. I believe that this partnership Government will continue to give us an opportunity to mobilise the many talents around the table in achieving the best outcomes for our citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_330"> The impact of this input is tangible. Over the past year, the Independent Deputies have led on important policy issues such as medical cards for people in receipt of domiciliary care allowance to child care, judicial reform and broadband. </p>
            <p eId="para_331"> My recent meetings with the Deputies focussed on a range of commitments within the existing programme which the Government remains firmly committed to implementing over its lifetime. As you know I outlined some of my priorities when I presented my Cabinet to the Oireachtas last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_332"> The programme for Government annual report was published on 10 May last and sets out the progress made on more than 300 commitments across all of Government over its first 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_333"> The report provides a comprehensive update on the progress of the commitments and highlights very specific plans which have been put in place to address in the short and longer term key areas of housing, homelessness, education, rural and regional development, job creation, broadband, agriculture and climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_334"> The report also highlights the ambition and steps to improve services for families, children, people with disabilities and mental health problems and older people including key reforms necessary in the health and justice sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_335"> Significant work has also been undertaken in advance of and following the UK's referendum on EU membership to ensure an effective whole-of-government approach to the Brexit negotiations that takes full account of the Government's negotiating priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_336"> The Government will continue to implement its programme, striking a balance between addressing urgent priorities and engaging in long-term planning so that lasting solutions are implemented to secure a strong economy and a fair society. </p>

            <p eId="para_337">During last week’s Question Time the Taoiseach used a series of dodges to avoid directly answering challenging questions. The pattern is similar today.</p>

He angrily informed the Dáil that he is entitled to be able to contact Ministers directly on constituency matters and to have full access. The fact is that this facility is not available to the majority of Deputies. In Tipperary specifically, Ministers have regularly given one Deputy preference in early notice of information which he has claimed shows his influence on the Government, to the exclusion of other Deputies in the constituency. Why is a Deputy who the Taoiseach says has no arrangement with Government able to claim influence on the Government?</p>
            <p eId="para_339"> Central to the Taoiseach’s election was the agreement with Independent Deputies and one part of this related to Stepaside Garda station on which the Taoiseach gave a commitment to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Trade, Deputy Ross. I have no problem with reopening Garda stations which should never have been closed. The issue is the pressure put on the Garda Commissioner – was pressure put on the Garda Commissioner? – to provide an interim report to facilitate the Taoiseach's nomination. It is very curious that an interim report emerged at all because this is not a question of 100 stations but of a small number and, hey presto, one interim report came out at a very opportune time relating to Stepaside. I am somewhat curious to know whether the Commissioner got divine inspiration in producing this interim report on Stepaside at that Cabinet meeting when a lot was going on. The report was due within weeks and would have covered the whole country yet the Garda Commissioner was asked to produce an interim report before the Taoiseach's nomination. Can the Taoiseach confirm whether he had any role in this process, whether the Tánaiste had, and the date on which it was confirmed to the Taoiseach that an entirely unnecessary interim report would be produced? </p>

            <p eId="para_340">In response to the question about Deputy Lowry, there is no agreement between my party and Deputy Lowry. We did speak by telephone on two occasions in the run up to the vote for the Taoiseach and for the new Cabinet. He is free to contact Ministers directly about matters that are in the programme for Government or constituency issues but he has not sought any particular commitments in that regard. That facility is open to other Independent Deputies not just those who support the Government and also to those who abstain and even those who vote against the Government-----</p>

            <p eId="para_357">I have resigned myself to it. Is it true that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, threatened to pull the plug on the Taoiseach's Administration on the basis of the handling of the appointment to the Court of Appeal? Is it true that he threatened to pull the plug unless the Taoiseach guaranteed that the judicial appointments legislation would go through the Houses before the summer recess? It is essential that the Taoiseach answers those questions. They are clear questions which require clear answers because it is not only me but the public who needs to understand the workings of Government. I am not asking the Taoiseach to breach Cabinet confidentiality - perish the thought - or any other long-standing convention. I am simply asking him to answer in plain language whether the Minister, Deputy Ross, threatened that course of action and if it was on the basis of the Taoiseach's handling of the appointment to the Court of Appeal. Did the Minister resile from the position on the basis that he would get what has been described as "his legislation" on judicial appointments over the line prior to the summer recess?</p>

            <p eId="para_358">As with many other Ministers, I speak to Deputy Ross regularly. We spoke just last night, for example, and obviously met at Cabinet this morning. We had two phone calls last Sunday, and on no occasion during either of those phone calls did he threaten resignation to me. I have seen reports that he may have done so in the newspapers, but perhaps that was in conversation with other people or Ministers. Certainly, in neither of the telephone conversations he had with me did he threaten resignation. I am happy to clarify that and I think I have clarified it already.</p>
            <p eId="para_359"> The process for appointing two High Court judges and one Court of Appeal judge, Ms Justice Máire Whelan, by the President was done in the normal way. My office contacted the Áras to see when the President would be available and that was the time when we were both available. The Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality must go and, obviously, the President has to be there also. There was no undue pressure put on the Áras whatsoever to speed this up.</p>

That was the case several weeks ago when we were in discussions with the Independent Alliance on the election of a new Taoiseach and Government. It was delayed a week because Deputy Charles Flanagan, who was newly appointed as Minister for Justice and Equality, did not want to take it on his second or third day in office. It was put back a week rather than rushed forward, which is the impression that some people have created. It was due to be in the Dáil on 20 June. We have no understanding on amendments and any amendments put forward will be considered case by case basis in the normal way by the Minister for Justice and Equality. The Bill is provided for in the programme for Government which stated specifically more than a year ago that we would introduce a judicial appointments Bill providing for a lay chair and a lay majority. We would be going against our own programme for Government as agreed by Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance and Independents if we were to support amendments which changed that aspect of it.</p>

In my discussion with the DUP, we spoke about a range of topics, including Brexit, their negotiations with the Conservative Party and LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. In the meeting with Sinn Féin, our discussions included its concerns around Brexit, an Irish language Act and its views regarding Irish unity. In both meetings, we discussed a wide range of issues, including the urgent need to re-establish the Northern Ireland Executive, noting the deadline of 29 June for completion of negotiations. There was also agreement on the importance of a functioning Executive in the context of the Brexit negotiations which started on Monday, 19 June. I made it clear that my Government and I would work in support of the Northern Ireland parties to re-establish the Executive and in pursuit of strong North-South relations, including through the North-South Ministerial Council. I stressed the objectives of ensuring Brexit does not impact negatively on the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and of protecting North-South trade and economic activity, the common travel area and associated reciprocal rights. I raised the ongoing discussions with the DUP on the formation of a new Government in London, which is a matter for the parties represented at Westminster, noting the need to avoid any outcome which could interfere with devolution and the prospects of re-establishing the Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_387"> As reported in the Programme for a Partnership Government Annual Report 2017, the Government continues to engage with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to support the power-sharing institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, including through the current talks process to address outstanding commitments from previous agreements and support the formation of a new Executive. I made a comprehensive report to the House on my contact with Prime Minister May since 8 June during Question Time in the House on 21 June.</p>

            <p eId="para_388">There is very little information available on the current status of discussions in Belfast. It is clear, however, that the absence of an Executive and assembly in Northern Ireland has left it deeply exposed during the Brexit process in London. It is my firm view that the institutions should never have been collapsed in the North and that we are going through a very cynical exercise prior to the inevitable restoration of both the assembly and the Executive. There is a clear majority in the assembly against a hard Brexit and in favour of doing everything possible to recognise the special status of Northern Ireland and its residents. Equally, the DUP no longer has the numbers to block things with a petition of concern. Anything which delays the re-establishment of the institutions will further undermine Northern Ireland's influence and leave matters totally in the hands of the Tories and the DUP.</p>
            <p eId="para_389"> In her meetings with the Northern parties after the election, the British Prime Minister met the leaders of all five main parties. In contrast, the Taoiseach chose to limit his meetings to the largest two. Will he explain this highly unusual decision and why he has allowed a situation to develop where, implicitly, he is seen to exclude those who represent nearly half the population in the North?</p>
            <p eId="para_390"> In terms of yesterday's deal, I welcome the additional £1 billion. It is welcome and we should have the capacity to welcome it. The people of Northern Ireland need it. However, the language around the deal could have been more reassuring. It should have included an explicit statement that no matter relating to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement or the workings of the institutions can be raised in the context of that DUP-Tory co-ordination. That reassurance was not provided. There is also language which suggests a subordinate role for Dublin. That should not be there. Will the Taoiseach confirm if any of this text was discussed in advanced with him or his officials prior to its being signed off on.</p>

            <p eId="para_391">Has there been a change in strategy in respect of Brexit on the part of the Government? I refer, in particular, to the remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, on special designated status for Northern Ireland. That is the position of Dáil Éireann, as voted upon. Is that a new position of the Government's and are we in fact now seeking a special designated status for Northern Ireland?</p>
            <p eId="para_392"> All of us would welcome the deal between the Conservative Party and the DUP in some respects. An extra £1 billion pounds in investment for Northern Ireland must be welcomed. Northern Ireland has very special circumstances. However, now that, for obvious reasons, it is at the top of the political agenda as far as the UK Government is concerned, will the Irish Government step up to the plate and make Northern Ireland a priority in order that we might seek to implement all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement? Is the Taoiseach concerned about other aspects of the deal between the Conservative Party and the DUP undermining the Good Friday Agreement? Will the UK Government remain impartial as regards the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement? Is there a concern that the DUP may have issues that are not in the interests of the nationalist community brought to the top of the agenda?</p>
            <p eId="para_393"> Is the Taoiseach concerned about the polarisation of politics in Northern Ireland following the recent Westminster elections? Moderate voices were swept aside in may ways. If we implemented the Good Friday Agreement and stepped up to the plate, moderate voices would be allowed to be heard again.</p>

            <p eId="para_394">Time is tight. I have a direct question for the Taoiseach. He has met the DUP and Sinn Féin. As of now, what is his best assessment of a deal being reached by Thursday? What is his view of what should happen in the event that no deal is reached? Is it that there would be a further delay to allow for more talks, direct rule or assembly elections?

            <p eId="para_395">I will try to say this as moderately as I can in order to allay the fears of some. Will the Taoiseach explain to me the basis of his statement at last week's Council meeting to the effect that the British might change their mind on leaving the customs union? Was that just him thinking out loud or was it based on something he had picked up from the British or heard from one of the negotiators?</p>
            <p eId="para_396"> In the short time available, I wish, if I might, to make a point. Quite correctly, concerns around partiality and the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement have been raised in the context of the deal the DUP has cut with the Tories. I bring the attention of the House to the fact that the DUP has now signed on for the Tory Brexit agenda in its confidence-and-supply agreement. We need to be very concerned about that. We welcome the £1 billion, should it materialise. Funnily enough, the figure tallies precisely with that which has been cut from the block grant, as it is called, over the past five to six years. However, lest there be any naïveté or misunderstanding as to the intentions of the Tory Brexiteers, it is to exit the Single Market, to exit the customs union and to end the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union. I was intrigued, therefore, by the Taoiseach's comments in respect of their changing their minds and staying in the customs union. I really hope that the Taoiseach is not engaging in that type of wishful thinking because it will not serve us well.</p>

            <p eId="para_397">In his discussions with the DUP and Sinn Féin, did the Taoiseach discuss community relations? At the moment, community relations are probably at their lowest level in a long time. People are in separate silos in terms of the political administration. I am speaking about people who care about community interests and things such as integrated schooling and what happens to children who live in the North, about the poisonous and toxic atmosphere that now exists between the DUP and Sinn Féin and about whether the Taoiseach, in his new role, tried to detoxify what has become a very hateful and negative political environment. It is really depressing for people in the North when elections are simply reduced to sectarian headcounts.</p>

            <p eId="para_398">I will start from the top. I met the DUP and Sinn Féin, which have been the two largest parties in Northern Ireland for two elections running and which are the main unionist and nationalist parties. I spoke to the leader of the UUP by telephone and we are making arrangements for me to meet delegations from the SDLP and the Alliance Party as soon as that can be done. However, as the House is aware, the focus has been on the talks at Stormont. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has been there for most of this week and last and has been regularly meeting all the parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_399"> The issues in terms of Northern Ireland are unique and are well recognised as being unique. Every country has a trading relationship with the United Kingdom. Some countries such as Denmark, The Netherlands and France have major trading relationships with the United Kingdom and they will be impacted by any new trade rules. Perhaps not to the extent we will be, but they will be majorly impacted. We have a unique issue because of the land Border with Northern Ireland and the peace process, which is very much understood in other European capitals and in the European institutions, and that is why we will need unique arrangements to deal with our situation. Whether it is referred to as special status, special arrangements or special measures does not really matter. It is not what is on the tin but what is in the tin that matters. In any conversations that we have had, we have tried to focus on what that will mean.</p>
            <p eId="para_400"> To answer Deputy Howlin's question, I am optimistic. I am certainly more optimistic than I am pessimistic that it will be possible to have the Executive and the assembly re-established before the deadline.

            <p eId="para_403"> Deputy McDonald asked about the UK changing its mind on the customs union. I suppose I was expressing an aspiration. She may remember that a similar aspiration was expressed by President Tusk when he suggested that he may be a dreamer but he is not the only one. When it comes to these things, it is important to hope for the best and to work towards the best outcome but also to prepare for the worst. We are doing both. Given the tight parliamentary arithmetic that exists at Westminster, anything could happen in the next number of months. We need to be cognisant of that too.</p>

            <p eId="para_411">The Government's national broadband plan will provide high-speed broadband access to all premises in Ireland through commercial networks or by State intervention. The plan has catalysed investment so that to date approximately 1.4 million or 61% of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland can get commercial high-speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Mbps. In April, I signed a commitment agreement with Eir, which will provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. Eir has committed to concluding this work over a 90-week period at an average of 500 premises passed per day. My Department is monitoring this roll-out. </p>
            <p eId="para_412"> There are approximately 2.3 million premises in Ireland, of which approximately 542,000 or 23% are located in the intervention area on the map. These premises will require State intervention and are the focus for the procurement process. The remaining premises are located in the blue areas and will be served by commercial operators. A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies that will roll out a new high-speed broadband network within the State intervention area. The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors, including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and the bidders during the procurement process. </p>
            <p eId="para_413"> Shorter-term measures to enhance broadband availability include the implementation of the mobile and broadband task force recommendations and the ComReg auction of the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band, which resulted in the award of 15-year licences covering urban and rural regions across the country. In addition, I have secured an €8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band, which is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances. These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_414"> My Department's website provides comprehensive information including broadband roll-out information per county, a copy of the Eir commitment agreement and information on the mobile and broadband task force.  </p>

            <p eId="para_415">I thank the Minister for his reply. Those in the 542,000 homes and businesses in rural areas who do not have broadband, who will not have commercial broadband and whose service will not be enhanced by anything the Minister has said with regard to the mobile world want to know when they can expect to see a tender go to the marketplace. What kind of expectation is there in terms of a completion date? I ask the Minister to set out a timetable for when he expects to see the contracts signed, the work beginning and the work being completed. The fact that the Minister has spent most of the time for his initial reply talking about anything other than that is deeply worrying to me and to the occupants of the aforementioned 542,000 premises. They are really concerned because there is no clarity as to when, or if, the work will be completed. I ask the Minister to confirm that the three tenderers for this work are still interested. Have they indicated whether they are still interested in this project, given the way in which it has been handled by the Department?</p>

            <p eId="para_416">Twelve months ago, 52% of premises had access to high-speed broadband. My focus is on delivery and not dates. In 77 weeks' time, 77% of premises will have access to high-speed broadband. During my short period in office, I have ensured that one in every four premises in Ireland, the vast majority of which are in rural Ireland, will have access to high-speed broadband. Many of those premises will have access to speeds of 1,000 Mbps. What we are talking about is a rate of 300 farms every single week getting fibre to their door. That is happening as we speak.</p>
            <p eId="para_417"> I am a bit disappointed with Deputy Dooley's comment to the effect that the 541,000 premises in rural areas will not be getting anything in the short term. Imagine is rolling out its infrastructure as we speak, providing up to 70 Mbps right across rural Ireland. Last week I was in Longford to launch a new initiative by Eurona Ireland which is providing high-speed broadband to rural areas too. Investment is going on in rural areas and through the mobile and broadband task force, we are assisting the companies that are currently spending €1.7 million per day to ramp up that investment right across rural Ireland in terms of mobile data and wireless broadband services.</p>

            <p eId="para_418">I cannot believe what I am hearing. Is the Minister living in the real world? He is starting to believe the press releases from commercial operators who, in an effort to get some publicity for the services they are providing, invited him to cut the tape and he is coming in here, believing he had something to do with it. There was supposed to be a national broadband plan that required State intervention to provide services to 542,000 homes. The initial figure was 700,000. Eir has signed an agreement that effectively says that it will do that on a commercial basis. The Minister and the Department have had no role whatsoever. The Minister has quoted what Imagine and other commercial operators are doing but that is about as relevant as what is going on in Timbuktu with its broadband. The Minister has had no role in it and has done nothing to assist the 542,000 premises, whose occupants expected to have a service provided, supported and funded by the State. The Minister, by his efforts to shift responsibility to somebody else, is calling into question whether the Government is committed to supporting the provision of services to those 542,000 homes. By taking credit for the roll-out on a commercial basis, the Minister is hiding the fact that there are people that the Government has seemingly forgotten about. The Minister is more interested in telling us what other companies are doing in order to hide or mask what the State should be doing.</p>

            <p eId="para_436">As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have responsibility for the postal sector, including the governance of An Post, to ensure that the company is fully compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the governance functions included in the statutory framework underpinning An Post. Operational matters and the role of developing commercial strategies for An Post mails and retail businesses, including the post office network, are a matter for the board and management of An Post and are not matters in respect of which I, as Minister, have a statutory function. Consequently, measures to maintain, enhance and diversify the post office network are fundamentally a matter for An Post.</p>
            <p eId="para_437"> The Post Office Network Business Development Group was established at the end of 2014 by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to explore the potential for commercial and additional Government services which could be transacted through the post office network. I was one of those who made a submission to the group. Following publication of the final report of the group in January 2016, two working groups were established to progress the recommendations of the report, namely, the network renewal implementation group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, and the post office hub working group, chaired by the then Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring.</p>
            <p eId="para_438"> On foot of a reconfiguration of Departments in July last year, responsibility for the post office network transferred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  In March 2017, that Department published the final report of the post office hub working group, in which it was outlined that the Department intended pursuing the possible opportunities for services such as community banking and motor tax renewal for the network. Arrangements are in hand to reassign responsibility for the post office network to my Department in light of my overall responsibility for An Post.</p>
            <p eId="para_439"> The network renewal implementation group report was undertaken by Mr. Bobby Kerr for An Post and I understand the report is under consideration by the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company that is in a position to provide a high-quality, nationwide postal service and that it maintains a nationwide, customer-focused network of post offices in the community. However, the environment in which the post office operates is changing and the network needs to change to thrive, particularly with the move to digital transactions. This involves harnessing existing strengths, such as its trusted brand and the relationship of postmasters with individual communities, in order to build the network of the future.  The post office plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike and this is at the forefront of An Post's mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_441"> Deputies will be aware that a fundamental review of An Post, including the post office network, which will identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing, is ongoing. Naturally, the outcome of the review will impact on the extent to which the recommendations contained in the network renewal and post office hub reports can be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_442"> While decisions on restructuring An Post and the operation of the post office network are operational matters for the board and management of An Post, I am monitoring the position closely and hope that a pragmatic approach that will ensure the long-term sustainability of An Post and the post office network can be agreed. I had a number of meetings with the chief executive officer and chairman of the company and my officials also meet An Post management on a regular basis.  I have encouraged An Post to continue to work closely with all parties to find an agreed solution to the renewal of the network. The Government will be briefed once a definitive strategy has been agreed but until such time, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_443"> The post office network has evolved a social role in the widest meaning of the term, one which is highly valued by local communities. I envisage a strong future for the post office network by using its existing strengths to remain a significant player in the provision of Government, financial and other services. It has been long-standing policy that An Post remains in a position to compete in a liberalised market and continue to provide wide-ranging services to urban and rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_444"> I also want to be clear that there is no threat to the mails delivery or universal service obligation. An Post will continue to deliver post to every address every working day, which is a European Union requirement. The recent amended approach to pricing aims to ensure An Post can fulfil its obligation in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_445">While I thank the Minister for his reply, it did not provide much enlightenment. We now know that responsibility for An Post has reverted to the Minister, which is welcome because it caused problems for all of us when three Ministers had responsibility for the company. While, strictly speaking, the Minister is correct that operational issues are a matter for An Post, he is a shareholder on behalf of Joe and Mary Soap and the general public. He has a responsibility and cannot, therefore, act as a spectator. The reviews of An Post have been ongoing since 2014. The Kerr report appears to have been buried, while the McKinsey report has not yet been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_446"> What is the future of the four mail centres, including the centres in Portlaoise and Athlone? Some 200 people work in the former, which takes on an additional 150 staff every Christmas. Every night, 450 mail deliveries enter and leave the Portlaoise centre, which deals with 28,000 parcels per day. It is a very busy facility that operates at far in excess of the capacity it was built to handle. A separate facility built recently to handle distribution at the centre, including leaflets, has been a great success. </p>
            <p eId="para_447"> The public owns the post office network and An Post is a semi-State company. I am fed up with Ministers telling us the company operates at one remove from the Oireachtas and Ministers cannot act on operational matters. They take the information provided to them by chief executives of semi-State companies at face value. Deputies take an interest in An Post on behalf of the public and the Minister is our representative. I also met the chief executive of An Post to discuss the issues that concern all of us.</p>

            <p eId="para_450">Like Deputy Stanley, I am a local Deputy. Given that the Athlone centre was the only facility McKinsey did not visit, it was appropriate that I visit. The facility has a spare building which could easily cater for additional volume.</p>
            <p eId="para_451"> Unlike some people, I take the view that the universal service obligation is critical infrastructure. In November and December 2016, when the House discussed the serious difficulty in which An Post finds itself, we debated whether to alter the universal service obligation or seek the approval of the European Commission to alter it. I was not prepared to entertain either course of action.</p>
            <p eId="para_452"> One of An Post's strong advantages is that it has a van passing every door five days per week, every week of the year. The company is also trusted by the public, enjoys brand recognition and has a nationwide network. We need to put in place a plan that builds on these four key strengths. I am of the view that a plan which sustains not only the post office network long into the future but also the mails business, which has the potential to grow, especially in parcel deliveries, can be put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_454">I welcome that the Minister referred to the Portlaoise mail centre. The Athlone centre is critical for the west and north east and the Minister's visit to the facility was welcome. My concern is that we have only four major mail centres whose future is critical in terms of distribution. As An Post has emphasised, the company is now moving into the personal network, which is a very good development.</p>
            <p eId="para_455"> I welcome the Minister's restatement of his commitment to the universal service obligation. We are all on the same page on that issue. Sinn Féin, in its discussions with An Post, made some suggestions on how the universal service obligation can be implemented more efficiently. It is essential that postal deliveries are maintained for five days each week.</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> The issue is that the post office network and the future of the mail centres are intertwined. For a long time, various Ministers dealt with different aspects of the postal service and there was a danger that it would move in different directions. The Minister is interested in the post office network, I will give him that. Now that responsibility for it has transferred to his Department, I ask him to take a direct interest in the issue, pull everything together, move the process forward and retain the mail centres in Athlone and Portlaoise. These facilities are now taking overflow business from Dublin that the capital cannot handle. We must also retain as many post offices as possible. The key point, however, is that this process is like watching paint dry in that we have been waiting for years for new services to be devolved to post offices. There is a broad consensus in the House and among communities on the need to implement the suggestions that have been made in this regard. We must move ahead and make the network viable.</p>

            <p eId="para_459">When I was an Opposition Deputy, I questioned the commitment of many previous Ministers to the post office network. </p>
            <p eId="para_460">However, that is neither here nor there. I was equally frustrated that there was no movement in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_461"> I see digital not as a threat to the post office network, but as an enabler with considerable potential. The difficulty to date has been that digital is seen as a threat. It is like trying to hold back the tide. We now have a chief executive in place in An Post who sees the significant potential and resource that it presents. An Post has been slow to get back into the parcels business after getting out when it was beginning to grow and its competitors have since got into the business. An Post's one strong element is the universal service obligation. It needs to exploit that asset as much as possible. In fairness, it is developing a pilot in four towns to determine how best to utilise the fact that it has vans that go from towns into rural areas on a five-day basis. This is a small step in the right direction.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_462">The Minister stated that operational matters at An Post were for its board and management, but he has an overriding responsibility. This is not just a rural issue, but the oft-quoted threat to 256 post offices also makes it an urban one. Last December, the Minister told me that the strategic review would report in May, but we are now approaching the end of June. What is the timeframe for the review?</p>
            <p eId="para_463"> Regarding the Kerr report of the post office network business development group, has the Minister invigilated that each of the targets and new areas of development is being proceeded with and that additional funding is being provided? In recent weeks, there was a major threat to our post office in Howth. It was advertised on a number of occasions, but no business came forward to take it on. By the look of things, there has been a stay of execution for a year. There were previous threats to the post office in Sutton and there are no direct post office services in the north Coolock area, which has a large population.</p>
            <p eId="para_464"> The Minister is presiding over a massive national business with nearly 2 million customers and 9,500 employees. He needs to move on this matter in a strategic way. So far, though, his approach has been disappointing.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_329" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Climate_Action_and_Environment">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_465">I thank Deputy Broughan for his question, although maybe not his comments. As he said, if no one is willing to come forward and take on the business in towns like Howth, a fundamental question needs to be asked: how do we modernise the offering so that people will want to take it on? What hope have we of keeping sub-post offices in rural Ireland open if people are not prepared to take on a post office in towns like Howth? Key to this is using digital as a driver. We all know of the post office's role in social welfare and how older people in particular use it. There is a significant opportunity for the postmaster to be used as the gateway to the digital world and for State and non-State services to be provided. Websites like <i>Switcher.ie</i> and <i>bonkers.ie</i> can offer people up to €300 in savings on their electricity and gas bills, yet many older people are not availing of them because they are not able or willing to go online to do so. This is an opportunity for providing a service through the local post office. Many other similar services could be provided in support of what the Government is doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_466"> On the other side, we also need to get young people to start going to their post offices. It is not good enough that the only time people go to a post office is at Christmas to buy a stamp or in the summer to get a passport.</p>

            <p eId="para_467">The Minister needs to take the initiative. We have read about the new Smart current account, but we have been discussing current accounts and so on for some time. In New Zealand, for example, Kiwibank is run by the post office network. The report to which I referred proposed the idea of close liaisons with the credit union movement. In Germany, the Sparkasse bank is headquartered in Bonn. There is a range of measures, but the Minister needs to take the lead role.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> The Minister mentioned towns like Howth. My constituents, particularly older ones, were deeply concerned at the time about the possible closure, but the chief executive of An Post, Mr. McRedmond, did not seem to make a dynamic approach to our local chamber of commerce or major businesses in the area to encourage them to ensure that this key aspect of the social community framework would remain on their peninsula.</p>
            <p eId="para_469"> The Minister needs to take a more dynamic approach. He must publish the strategic plan, get on with matters and try to centre our post offices. The post office's operations are vital in many areas, for example, the Beara Peninsula, where they are a focal point for towns, villages and communities. The Minister needs to set an example.</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> The Minister referred to IT. While there is scope for a return to the parcels business, there is also considerable scope for An Post to take a leading role in terms of IT, given the question marks that seem to he hanging over some email providers, for example, Google's security.</p>

            <p eId="para_471">I will take up Deputy Broughan's final point. Deputy Dooley was critical of me earlier, but with the roll-out of fibre across rural Ireland, 97% of post offices will have access to high speed broadband within the next 77 weeks. That piece of infrastructure needs to be fully utilised for the benefit of communities, older people and people who do not have access to the Internet at the moment. One in seven people has never used the Internet. In this light, the post office can be used to provide such people in urban and rural Ireland with significant opportunities and we need to exploit those opportunities fully.</p>
            <p eId="para_472"> In fairness, the chief executive of An Post, Mr. David McRedmond, gets it. He sees the opportunity presented by the development of financial services, the parcel system and developments in the digital economy as an enabler to drive the business forward. Work is ongoing in terms of the Kerr report and the feedback from the McKinsey report and NewERA, but the board will have to make the ultimate decision. There is also ongoing and regular engagement with my Department. That will continue until we have a blueprint for the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_475">The number of battery electric vehicles, BEVs, and plugin hybrid electric vehicles, PHEVs, in the national fleet is estimated to be 2,970, with 2,300 new EVs bought and registered in Ireland and 670 EVs imported into the State. Since 2015, there has been a steady growth in EVs, with 2017 to date seeing a 25% increase in EV registrations to 529. Of these, 151 are PHEVs while the remaining 378 are BEVs.</p>
            <p eId="para_476"> The EV grant scheme provides grant aid of up to €5,000 towards the purchase of a new BEV or PHEV and is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI. The scheme is kept under review and will continue throughout 2017 with an allocation of €5 million. Additionally, vehicle registration tax reliefs of up to €5,000 apply to EVs.</p>
            <p eId="para_477">Budget 2017 extended vehicle registration tax reliefs on PHEVs to the end of 2018 and on BEVs to 2021. To date SEAI has paid out 2,159 grants amounting to a total value of €10.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_478"> My Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are co-chairing a low-emission vehicles, LEV, taskforce involving relevant Government Departments and agencies. In respect of electric vehicles, the topics being examined include market growth potential and public leadership, and policy levers to stimulate this growth. A holistic Government approach is essential to establishing the right framework for the long-term development of the market. I also plan to introduce, in conjunction with the SEAI, an electric vehicle driver experience programme which will encompass a pilot electric vehicle car sharing scheme, an electric vehicle roadshow, and commercial fleet trials.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">

            </p>
            <p eId="para_480"> There is a range of factors that are accepted internationally as being barriers to the widespread early transition to EV technology including limited vehicle choice, range anxiety, low consumer acceptance and awareness. The transition being slower than anticipated is not specific to Ireland and does not reflect a national lack of ambition or policy support. Given that the Government supported EV grant scheme is demand-led, I do not believe that it is appropriate to set annual targets for EV uptake.</p>
            <p eId="para_481"> It is clear that a lot of change has occurred in this space. In 2011, when the EV grant programme began, only two types of vehicle were available in Ireland, while today there are 25 unique models for Irish consumers to choose from which are all available on the grant scheme. Technical issues such as range anxiety, which would have greatly dissuaded consumers a number of years ago, are being resolved through technology development in the area of batteries and fast chargers. It should also be noted that we have had considerable achievement in certain respects. For example, unlike other countries, such as the UK or France, we have a single entity operating the nationwide EV charging network which enables Irish consumers to access the EV charging infrastructure easily throughout the country. </p>

            <p eId="para_482">If it gets any worse, the remainder of the reply is not worth listening to. If the Minister was serious about addressing the crisis in the transport sector <i>vis-à-vis</i> emissions and getting electric vehicles on the road, he would be doing a lot more in terms of incentivising than running a road show around the country. People need serious incentives. There was an action plan in 2014 which talked about having 50,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020. In 2015 there were 618 electric vehicles sold or imported into Ireland. That is pathetic. Less than 0.25% of cars sold or imported into Ireland in 2016 were electric vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_483"> The current programme for Government, to which the Minister is a signatory and in the putting together of which we are led to believe he had a very significant part, stated that Ireland wanted to be a global leader in the uptake of electric cars. That is an ambition similar to that of the Norwegian Government, which is all very well and good except that Norway has approximately 71 times more electric cars than Ireland had in 2016. The Minister has a bit of catching up to do. That road show he has in mind would need to get an electric shock pretty fast. </p>

            <p eId="para_484">I thank Deputy Dooley. He is great for the one-liners. The reality is that, to date, 40% of the total number of electric vehicles purchased in Ireland have been purchased in 2017.

There was an interesting report in our national newspapers recently which said that by 2022 it will make financial sense for most drivers to drive an electric vehicle. We need to encourage people to move away from conventional vehicles. I myself drive a hybrid and I am sure Deputy Dooley does the same. We need to lead by example. The AA recently carried out a survey which showed that 10% of people are likely to buy either a hybrid or an electric vehicle the next time out. We want to encourage people to move to electric vehicles. That is why we are rolling out this demonstrator project, which will involve car sharing, which is a bit like the dublinbikes scheme, which has been a huge success. We will be doing it in Dublin and Cork to encourage people to try out these vehicles. We will run this road show right across the country so that people can try them out and we will engage with the commercial companies in respect of commercial fleets.</p>

            <p eId="para_489">It all sounds great but the simple question is what target the Minister will hit by the end of the year. The target set back in 2014 was for 50,000 vehicles to be on the road by 2020. At best, there will be 6,000 or 7,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020. If the Minister thinks it is worthwhile mentioning that he will hit some notional target for electric vehicles by the end of this year then I really do not think he has any concept of where we need to be at. What is needed is a very significant incentive - a plan and a programme that will grab the attention of the hard-pressed motorist who has been hit with a significant increase in car insurance, who has seen hikes in the price of fuel in recent years and who pays huge amounts of tax to the State. The Minister knows what is required to shift the dial on this matter. I understand that Norway had more money to put behind it and I know why Norway is now limiting the incentives. It is because they have reached critical mass. People have gotten over the range anxiety and are no longer concerned about the durability of the cars. The Minister needs to take a big bang approach to get those 40,000 to 50,000 electric vehicles on our roads. Then, and only then, in my humble opinion, will the sector start to mushroom and grow along conventional lines of activity. Trying to get incremental growth from 0.1% of the marker is a long way off.</p>

            <p eId="para_494">That is why these targets have been revised downwards. I am dealing with the situation that is in front of me currently. The advice that is available to myself and the public is that electric vehicles will make financial sense for the vast majority of drivers in this country within the next four years. The reality is that diesel vehicles have very little value at trade-in now because dealerships know that the long-term prognosis for diesel is that it will be gone. Drivers are already shifting from diesel to hybrids. We need to drive the incentive further towards electric vehicles. If I were to ramp up the financial supports available for electric vehicles today, I could guarantee that some other colleagues in the House in the not too distant future would be talking about a debacle of the type seen in Northern Ireland with the renewable heating incentive scheme here in the Republic in respect of electric vehicles.</p>

            <p eId="para_500"> I thank Deputy Barry. As I have indicated in my previous response to these questions, the release of the latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency on 13 April 2017 clearly indicated the enormous challenge facing Ireland to reduce its emissions. The projections indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy not covered by the EU emissions trading system, ETS, could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020 - a deteriorating position in respect of the achievement of Ireland’s targets for 2020 when compared with previous projections. Though not unexpected, given the welcome return to economic growth in Ireland, it nevertheless confirms that Ireland’s greenhouse emissions continue to track broader trends in the economy and serves to underline the difficult decisions ahead of us as we try to reduce emissions in line with our international commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> In relation to the targets for 2020, Ireland has an emissions reduction target for each year between 2013 and 2020 under the 2009 EU effort sharing decision. For 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005. This will be Ireland’s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. Ireland’s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU member states under this decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.</p>
            <p eId="para_502"> The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland’s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU-wide cost-effective basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_503"> In order to maximise Ireland's emissions reductions and address the gap to the 2020 target, it will also be necessary to pursue other available options, in addition to the introduction of further policies and measures planned through the national mitigation plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">The legislative framework governing the EU's 2020 emissions reduction targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable member states to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between member states. Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emission reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018. However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances. While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved in light of the final amount and the price of allowances required.</p>

            <p eId="para_505">I did not hear many solutions there. I did hear many excuses. Are the Minister and the Government <i>au fait</i> with the seriousness of the potential fines they could be bringing down on the country? Joseph Curtin from the Institute of International and European Affairs says the country could face fines of €610 million by 2020. That is money that could otherwise be invested in health, education and a better life for our people. He has not ruled out that by 2030 fines of €5.5 billion could be levied on this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> The Minister has produced an outline national mitigation plan that has been described by An Taisce as too little, too late and an unmitigated failure.

            <p eId="para_507">The big issue with potential penalties is not on our emissions target. Nothing has been set in stone yet, but it relates to not meeting our renewable energy targets. That is naturally enough a further concern for us. Based on the evidence available to me at the moment, I believe we will reach our renewable electricity target, but heat and transport are two challenging areas. Within the next few weeks I intend to bring proposals to Government on a renewable heat incentive scheme, which is very different from the one proposed in Northern Ireland, in order that we can get as close as possible to our 12% target for renewable heat.</p>
            <p eId="para_508"> On transport, we have increased the biofuel blend in our transport fuels, which will get us quite close to our transport target as well. However, we need to make further efforts on our emissions targets and our renewable energy targets. Every effort needs to be made, not just on our 2020 targets but our 2030 targets which will be far more challenging.</p>

            <p eId="para_510">As the Minister mentioned transport targets, let us talk about transport. Transport emissions increased by 4% in 2015. It is estimated that they may increase by as much as 10% by 2020. That is not surprising when the Government spends twice as much on roads as it does on public transport. That is the plan. Public transport should get a major boost if we are serious about reaching the climate targets. Despite this, we are told that Iarnród Éireann is on the verge of bankruptcy, and both Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus receive just a fraction of the subsidy similar companies in other European countries receive. All three of the major public transport companies receive State subsidies that are significantly less than in 2008. There is something that could be done straight away - a major increase in spending on public transport. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_513">We clearly have challenges in meeting our transport targets, partly because we have a very large rural population. That is why the roll-out of the national broadband plan is so critical in this. It will reduce the need for people to travel to work. They can work from home or work closer to their own home. It is one innovative step we can take to reduce our overall emissions. Biofuels represent the main plank in this regard. As of 1 January, we have increased the blend of biofuels in our transport fuels to 8%. We will increase that again to 9%. We are exploring going beyond that again.</p>
            <p eId="para_514"> Public transport plays a role in that, as do the greenways. It is about having a unique set of measures to deal with the specific challenges Ireland has and about all of us working together in this regard. That is why the national dialogue is so important to have real engagement with all the players from every community in the country to come up with practical solutions that will feed into the mitigation plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_528">The objective of Ireland's first statutory national mitigation plan is to set out what Ireland is doing, and is planning to do, to further the national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_529"> The national mitigation plan has been prepared having regard to the provisions set out in the 2015 Act in close collaboration with all relevant Departments and, in particular, with the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport; Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. As well as being supported by a range of technical, economic and environmental inputs, the national mitigation plan has also been informed by the submissions received during a public consultation in March and April 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> In addition, I invited the climate change advisory council, following my publication of the draft national mitigation plan, to engage directly with me and with other relevant Ministers with a view to providing its recommendations to feed into the preparation of the final plan. All input received from the advisory council has been considered in finalising the national mitigation plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> In accordance with the provisions of the 2015 Act, the national mitigation plan was circulated to Government in the required timeframe and I am pleased to confirm that the Government has, at its meeting today, approved the national mitigation plan for publication. I am looking forward to publishing the plan and formally laying it before both Houses of the Oireachtas very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_532"> In addition to setting out the full range of measures the Government has implemented or is considering to reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, the plan will include more than 100 individual actions to be implemented across Government to advance the national transition agenda. These actions are the individual building blocks that will enable the Government and wider society to implement deeper reductions in emissions in the years ahead. This will be an ongoing process aimed at incremental and permanent decarbonisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> In order to debate the national mitigation plan in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the 2015 Act provides that relevant Ministers deliver an annual transition statement to each House. The first such statement was delivered last December and I intend that the 2017 statement will be delivered shortly following the presentation of budget 2018. I also intend that the annual transition statement will incorporate an annual progress report on the implementation of the national mitigation plan. In this way, each Minister with a role in the national mitigation plan will be accountable to the Oireachtas for reporting on progress within his or her respective sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_534"> The first national mitigation plan is a work in progress, reflecting the reality of where we are in our decarbonisation transition having regard to a number of factors, including curtailed public and private investment over the course of recent years. The first plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, but it will begin the process of development of medium to long-term options to ensure we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and following decades.</p>
            <p eId="para_535">The plan will become a living document accessible on my Department's website and will be updated on an ongoing basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate further cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.</p>

            <p eId="para_536">The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 specified that the Government of the day must periodically publish a national mitigation plan outlining Ireland's path to a low-carbon future. It is an important piece of cross-departmental planning, something that is clearly crucial if we are serious about making a transition to a low-carbon economy and society. The national mitigation plan was supposed to be published 18 months ago, after the passage of the legislation, which meant that the plan should have been published by June 2017. In response to a parliamentary question I tabled, the Minister said the draft mitigation plan was circulated to the Government on 10 June. That is more than two weeks ago. Is climate change such a low priority for the Minister and the Government that two weeks later he has still not managed to publish the plan?</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> Thus far Ireland has been struggling to meet its 2020 targets. In March 2016 the EPA published projected emissions for 2020, which indicated that Ireland's emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6% to 11% below those of 2005 when we were supposed to reach 20% reductions. That will result in significant fines for this country from the European Union.</p>

            <p eId="para_538">Climate change is an issue we are taking seriously. In fact, in the first contribution of the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, in the House, he made the point that we will have a full Cabinet meeting to discuss climate. It is a very serious issue and it is one we are taking seriously.</p>
            <p eId="para_539"> The plan was submitted to Government for approval on 9 June. My Department is a co-ordinating Department. I need to get other Ministers on board as well. It was right and proper that I would circulate the plan to them and give them an opportunity to read it, which they did. In fact, I spoke with a colleague afterwards and I probably should not say it but we had a very constructive discussion at the Cabinet today on the issue. I look forward to the further discussion and debate that will take place in the coming weeks. It was the right thing to do to give that time to colleagues to digest the information on the national mitigation plan as we had a very good discussion at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> We are being criticised about not doing enough about agriculture. However, it is important to acknowledge when we do things right. An article in last week's <i>Irish Farmers Journal </i>showed that through the beef data and genomics scheme, we have genotyped 31% of our national beef herd. Nowhere in the world has come anywhere near doing that. We are the global leaders in this area. Many of the colleagues I meet when I travel abroad also have responsibility for agriculture and they ask me about the beef data genomics scheme because it is one of the most innovative measures taken in the agriculture sector anywhere in the world. That, and the smart farming initiative operated in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency are two innovative measures that are driving the change forward as well.</p>

            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_541">It appears there will be an ongoing discussion among Ministers but could the Minister give a timeframe or, if possible, a date on when the plan will be published?</p>
            <p eId="para_542"> It is great news to hear about the things that are going right but the Minister must focus on what is not. While I accept that the agriculture piece is going well, that was before the Minister's time in the Department and he will be measured by the decisions he needed to take and perhaps did not. He does not need me to tell him where the priority is, but it is in the transport sector and the heating sector. I welcome the fact that the Minister is bringing proposals to Government on the heating initiative. We have found a way around the issue in the agriculture sector and I am pleased that is the case but the other areas are of far greater importance so let us focus on them.</p>
            <p eId="para_543"> When can we see the plan? Has the Minister met resistance from his ministerial colleagues? Given that the discussion is so protracted at Cabinet level, could he identify whether there are Ministers that are somewhat hesitant about recognising their responsibilities?</p>

            <p eId="para_544">No, there is absolutely no hesitancy at all. The mitigation plan was approved by the Cabinet today. We had a very good and constructive discussion at Cabinet today on it. Some fine-tuning of the document needs to be done and the plan will be published soon after that. Two of my colleagues came to me after the Cabinet meeting looking for copies of the plan. We will publish it as soon as it is available. The plan has gone for translation into the Irish language and I am anxious to have it published as quickly as possible, but in advance of the Cabinet meeting to discuss the issue so that my colleagues have further time to consider it.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> We intend to come forward with proposals quite soon on the renewable heat incentive scheme. We will also come forward with proposals on a renewable electricity support scheme, which will make progress on the former. Significant progress continues to be made in agriculture, transport and housing and planning. They are issues with which all Ministers are engaged and that will continue to be the case.</p>

          <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_372">
            <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_546">I welcome the fact that the mitigation plan has gone to Cabinet. However, I am worried that the Minister has not given a date for its publication. This week the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill is being pushed through the Dáil and any amount of time is being given to it. We have been advised that this is the last Dáil that will have any chance to do something about climate change, such is the seriousness of the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> It has been repeatedly pointed out that the failure to deal with climate change will cost a lot more. Going back to 2006, the ground-breaking Stern review pointed out that it would be 20 times cheaper to deal with climate change than with its effects. I do not have the time to go through all of the reports but the Minister is aware it is much more expensive to deal with the effects of climate change than to prevent it. The draft plan I saw was described by a non-governmental organisation as defeatist and cautious. The organisation in question has been very active on the ground and I share its concerns about the lack of ambition in the plan. Could the Minister please tell me when exactly the plan will come before us? Will it be before the end of the summer break and has it adopted a more realistic approach in respect of meeting our targets?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_373" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Climate_Action_and_Environment">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_548">The plan will absolutely be before the House before the end of the summer break. I intend to have it published as quickly as possible. I cannot give a definitive date here and now but the Cabinet is meeting the week after the House rises and it is my intention to have the plan published in advance so that Ministers can have a copy of it to discuss at that full-day Cabinet meeting. I will publish the plan as soon as I can. As soon as I have the document available it will be published and laid before the Houses.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> Deputy Stanley is one of the people who was here at the time but the timelines that are used in respect of the mitigation plan are unfortunate purely from a logistical point of view. That is why I want the reporting mechanism to come in after the budget. Many of the decisions we have to take must be taken in the budgetary context. We cannot take them in isolation. Many of the measures we have outlined in the mitigation plan such as the renewable heat incentive scheme and the renewable electricity support scheme will be included in the Estimates process as part of the budget and that is why it is important that in tandem with the budget taking place in October we would have the annual transition statement very soon after that.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> We are establishing a national dialogue. It would be wrong to set everything in stone and then have a discussion about where we should go. Whatever comes up in the course of the dialogue also needs to be input into the plan, which is very much a living document.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_374">
            <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_551">We welcome the dialogue, but we are beyond that stage and we need to take action. We set up a climate advisory council, which gave very clear guidelines on the need for a stable plan and targets. All of the non-governmental organisations have highlighted those issues and we know the poorest and most vulnerable in the world who contribute very little to emissions will suffer because of our inaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_552">I repeat this is the last Dáil that can take any effective action against climate change. If I had any power in this Dáil I would put this item on the agenda this week and not the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. This cannot wait until the end of the year and it cannot wait for a budget. I appreciate what the Minister has said in respect of the budget but at some stage there must be a complete shift in thinking and a realisation that whatever about the October budget, we will end up paying a lot more. Deputy Barry has quoted Joseph Curtin of the Institute of International and European Affairs to the effect that Ireland will miss its targets by €610 million by 2020 and by up to €5.5 billion by 2030. By any stretch of the imagination we need an urgent debate in this Dáil well before October in order that we can all have an input into the targets that are set and monitoring of them.</p>

            <p eId="para_553">I am quite happy to have a debate at any time. That would be helpful. I am not 100% sure about the long-term costs but Deputy Connolly is right that they are very significant and in the scale of billions of euro. I do not believe we are beyond dialogue. A fundamental weakness of environmental groups up to now is that it has been very much about top-down lecturing to people and telling them what they must do, rather than by engaging with communities on the ground. We shall come to this later in respect of another question as I do not want to get into it now. This has been the fundamental weakness up to now. People think that they can deal with this issue at a high level and not engage with people on the ground. We need to engage with people on the ground, to work with communities and to explain to them what needs to be done by every single person doing their own small, little bit. The one thing in which Ireland has been globally successful is in engaging with young people. There is nowhere in the world that has done this better than Ireland has, with its Green-Schools initiative. Yes, we have challenges but the Deputy knows the reality as well as I do. I was not inundated with people talking about climate change during the last general election. I was not inundated with people-----</p>

            <p eId="para_557">I listened to the Minister's earlier reply on broadband provision. Conscious of the consistent promises of 100% coverage, I raise the specific example of Oldtown, a village in north County Dublin less than 30 km from Dublin city centre. When I asked the Minister previously about this issue in November 2016, Oldtown was in the amber category on the broadband implementation map, which indicated an area marked for State intervention to be included in the State's programme. The area is now in the light blue section of the map with no commercial provider servicing that area or parts of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_558">If Deputy Clare Daly has heard the previous reply I will not go through it again but will answer the Deputy's specific question. Yes, the area is in light blue, which means that in the next 77 weeks Oldtown will have high-speed broadband as part of the Eir commitment agreement. This is some good news for north County Dublin. They are no longer in the intervention area and they will be part of the 300,000 premises that will get high-speed broadband. I encourage people in the Oldtown area to make direct contact with Eir to find out the timetable for the roll-out over the next 77 weeks. Off the top of my head I do not know when the fibre will come to Oldtown during the 77 weeks. It does address the problem in that community and it is just one of the examples where the Eir commitment agreement is working; we are actually delivering fibre to the door of 300 farms every single week and we will continue that for the next 77 weeks. Once this is completed, I am determined to drive forward with the programme for the remaining 542,000 premises across rural Ireland to ensure that every single premises has access to high-speed broadband.</p>

            <p eId="para_559">I am delighted that the Minister has replied in that regard because one of my constituents did contact Eir, as the Minister has suggested. The roll-out map stops 5 m from the entrance to his house. He offered to pay for the extra 5 m from the entrance to his house but was told there are no plans to extend the line and this was where it was going to stop. Effectively, he cannot work from home or live in that area. Living in a rural community now means that one must have access to high-speed broadband and he is not going to get it. He even offered to pay for the extra length and was told he would not be able to do that. As far as I know, Oldtown exchange is the only part of the greater Dublin area that does not have broadband. Eir seems to be putting the issue of cost in the way. To upscale the entire exchange would cost some €700,000 and that is not being envisaged in this plan. This means that around 170 houses in the area are excluded from this plan. Given that the area is in our capital city or on the periphery of it, this seems absolute lunacy. What can be done for those residents to be included such as this man who is 5 m out? What would the remedy be for him and others like him?</p>

            <p eId="para_560">If the resident in question is in the light blue area of the map then he will get broadband as part of the commitment agreement. That is the agreement and I expect Eir to comply with that to the letter of the law. If it is outside the light blue area then it will have to wait for the next phase of the national broadband plan. In the interim, however, we are working with mobile operators and wireless broadband operators to facilitate them in rolling out their infrastructure. Currently the commercial companies are spending some €1.7 million every day. Imagine is rolling out a wireless network service. Eurona Ireland last week announced an upgrade in its network. I understand that there are many other wireless operators across the State that over the next period will be enhancing their services. On top of this we have released the 3.6 GHz spectrum, which will improve the data capacity of the mobile operators and allow for the expansion of wireless operators. There are opportunities there. Recently I also spoke with a satellite operator that is looking to come in to the State with very high speeds, well in excess of what would have been traditionally envisaged around satellite services. They are available. If the Deputy's constituent is in the light blue area and he puts in his Eircode postcode, and if the company now tells him it will not provide the service to him, I would appreciate the Deputy coming back to me on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_561">I certainly will. If the commercial provider is not willing to connect all houses in the area then we have a problem. I will check the map and I will ask the resident to check the postcode. If it is on the periphery then what assurances can the Minister give? Does the Minister believe that a 5 m border is sufficient? The resident made an offer to be included at his own cost. Is this so bizarre if a premises is outside the light blue area? What other remedy could be found? If the alternative is that his premises goes into the amber area of the map and he must wait in the never-never land then I do not know what solution I can offer to him. I believe this matter relates to the fact that Oldtown exchange is the most archaic one in the county of Dublin. It probably needs special attention because there are a number of residents who are in the townland of Oldtown who will not be connected and who will not be provided for by Eir. We need to plug that gap and this is what I am trying to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_562">The commitment agreement we have with Eir is that Eir must pass a home every minute of every working day for the next 77 weeks. That is a monumental task for the company and we have pushed it to the wire in that respect. I had looked at including in the contract intervention by individuals outside of this, but Eir was of the view that if this happened it would actually delay the roll-out. This is what we are tied into with Eir.</p>
            <p eId="para_563"> People look at this as an all-or-nothing situation. I am determined to make sure that people will have a long-term solution under the national broadband plan for every single premises in the intervention area. This does not mean that things are not happening at the moment. I urge people to go and look at the alternative options because there are options available. I was with a business last week in Deputy Eugene Murphy's constituency and they had the exact same argument; they are 500 yd. from the light blue area.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">They had a wireless option, a mobile option and three fibre options at that site, but they did not realise it because they were looking at the Eir solution only. I encourage people to look at the other solutions that are available. Other operators and competitors are willing to provide services. I actively encourage people to consider them.</p>

            <p eId="para_568">As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I am responsible for the postal sector, including the governance of An Post, to ensure that the company is fully compliant with the code of practice and governance of State bodies and the governance functions included in the statutory framework underpinning An Post. Operational matters and the role of developing commercial strategies for the post office network are matters for the board and management of An Post. As Minister, I do not have a statutory function in respect of such matters. Consequently, measures to maintain, enhance and diversify the post office network are matters for An Post. The Post Office Network Business Development Group was established at the end of 2014 by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to explore the potential for commercial and additional Government services which could be transacted through the post office network. I was one of the five Members of the House who made a submission to that group at the time. Following the publication of the final report of this group in January 2016, two working groups were established to make progress with the recommendations of the report, namely, the network renewal implementation group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, and the post office hub working group, chaired by the then Minister of State, Deputy Ring.</p>
            <p eId="para_569"> On foot of a reconfiguration of Government Departments in July of last year, responsibility for the post office network transferred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. When the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs published the final report of the post office hub working group in March of this year, it outlined that it is pursuing the possible opportunities for the network to provide services such as community banking and motor tax renewal. Arrangements are in hand to reassign responsibility for the post office network to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in light of its overall responsibility for An Post. The recommendations of the post office hub working group will continue to be finalised between both Departments. I understand that the report of the network renewal implementation group, which was undertaken by Mr. Bobby Kerr on behalf of An Post, is under consideration by An Post. The policy of the Government is that An Post should remain a strong and viable company that is in a position to provide a high-quality nationwide postal service and to maintain a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community.</p>

            <p eId="para_572">As the Minister knows, I represent the very rural constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. The post office is an integral part of the cultural and social fabric of the constituency. I would like to give the Minister a feel for the concerns of people in this regard. Over 150 people attended a recent public meeting in the small town of Shercock, County Cavan, which is near the border with County Monaghan. It is of the utmost importance to see additional services like community banking being provided in our post offices so that they become more viable and sustainable. It was very interesting to see the demographic attending the public meeting I have mentioned. We have to make sure our post offices function for our young people as well as for older people in rural communities and in society in general. I wonder how the Minister intends to address that. The postmasters and postmistresses are very anxious because they feel they are contending with unfair competition from private courier services. They want to be able to deliver the same type of efficient services through post offices, but they are restricted from doing so. Their hands are tied behind their backs. Does the Minister have any proposals? If our post offices are to survive and to be able to deliver these services, they must have broadband, which we discussed earlier.</p>

            <p eId="para_573">If the Deputy is speaking to her colleague, Deputy Dooley, after Question Time, she might tell him that within the next 77 weeks, approximately 97% of all post offices in this country will have direct access to high-speed broadband. We can look at the options for the approximately 30 post offices that will not have such access. I am sure Deputy Dooley will be delighted to hear that. I know there is public concern in this regard. People see digital as a threat to the post office network. I see it as an enabler. It is one way we can bring business into our post office network. Like Deputy Niamh Smyth, I am aware that young people do not go into post offices as often as older people. Younger people go into the post office at Christmas to buy stamps and in the summer to use foreign exchange or passport facilities. What can we do to encourage people to use the post office more frequently? Opportunities in areas like parcel services are available to post offices that have access to broadband. I disagree with the Deputy in so far as I think there is an opportunity to provide a very cost-effective service. It does not cost An Post anything extra to send a parcel from the GPO in Dublin to Caherciveen because it has a fleet of vans that are already providing services across the country under the universal service obligation.</p>

            <p eId="para_574">Both post offices and broadband fall under the Minister's remit. It is very difficult for the post offices we are trying to keep in local areas to survive if they do not have a basic service like broadband. I agree with what the Minister said about bringing in younger people and providing extra services. Something that happened in my constituency today provided another example of why broadband is needed. Flair Showers Limited, which has the potential to employ 40 people in the east Cavan area, has had to move its small factory to Kingscourt because it cannot access broadband in Bailieborough. While that is wonderful for Kingscourt and for the county, the company had an established presence with a building and everything else in place in Bailieborough but it was not able to access broadband. We are going to lose jobs out of the town as a result. I have tabled a separate parliamentary question on this matter today and I look forward to the Minister's response. I want to know whether something can be done to enable small factories, companies and post offices to stay in local areas. It is dreadful to see them having to leave because they cannot get something as basic as broadband. I think not having broadband is like not having electricity.</p>

            <p eId="para_575">That is why I am determined to ensure that we continue to roll out high-speed real-fibre broadband across this country. At present, we are passing one door every minute of every working day. My intention is to continue that momentum until every single premises in Ireland enjoys access to this facility. I encourage Deputy Niamh Smyth to make direct contact with the local broadband officer in her local authority to see whether options exist in the specific case she mentioned. I encourage people to look at the options that are available. I mentioned an example in response to Deputy Clare Daly a couple of minutes ago. We need to build on the strengths of An Post and its post office network. I refer, for example, to its brand recognition and to the trust it enjoys among the public. An Post has a nationwide network of post offices across the country. Its vans pass every door in this country five days a week. It is frustrating that these advantages have not been exploited in the past. In fairness to the chief executive, David McRedmond, I think he understands that opportunities exist. A pilot project that is taking place down the road from the Acting Chairman's locality is looking at using An Post vans to bring other services out into rural areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_577">As the Minister will be aware, the proposed introduction of pay-by-weight waste collection last year gave rise to significant controversy when companies tried to increase prices significantly. As part of a voluntary agreement that was subsequently reached, a price freeze was introduced to give the Minister an opportunity to work with waste collection companies to find a way forward so that rates of recycling, etc., can be increased. Given that the voluntary agreement is now coming to an end, I ask the Minister to provide an update on the new pricing structures and arrangements that will come about as a result of the most recent discussions.</p>

          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_394" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Climate_Action_and_Environment">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_578">I can give the Deputy an update that is literally hot off the press. I intend to introduce an incentivised pricing structure that will provide the flexibility for customers to be offered a suite of pricing options to encourage householders to reduce and segregate their waste.  This approach is in line with the Government's policy as articulated in a 2012 policy document, A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland. A specific measure in the policy provides that the household waste collection sector will "operate pricing structures designed to incentivise environmentally sustainable behaviours by households in terms of waste reduction and segregation".</p>
            <p eId="para_579">Incentivised pricing should encourage us, as a community, to prevent and reduce the amount of waste we produce and to utilise the value of our waste through reuse, recycling and recovery. This will also enable Ireland to meet its legal obligations as well as current and future targets under EU waste legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_580"> The amount of waste being sent to landfill has increased in the past two years. Last year, local authorities had to exercise emergency powers on two occasions to make additional landfill capacity available. Had it not been made available, we could not have allowed the collection of waste in this country. We must act to encourage further waste reduction to avert a return to an over-dependence on landfill. The introduction of an incentivised pricing structure for household waste collection will be an important measure in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_581"> If we do nothing about the amount of material going into landfill, within the next three years there will be an 18% shortfall in landfill capacity, effectively meaning we will have no landfill capacity for two months of the year. There are a couple of solutions. One is that we expand the existing four landfills. We had 24 in 2011 but are down to four at the moment and I do not think any colleague from the vicinity of these landfills would want that to happen. The other option is to open up new landfills, and I am willing to listen to any suggestions from Members if they have a proposed site for a new landfill. Finally, we can reduce the amount of material going into landfill and this is my preference.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Curran<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_582">The Minister knows my views on this. I am very supportive of reducing the waste that goes into landfill and increasing recycling, but I will go back to what happened last year. When the proposals were made to go to a pay-by-weight system to encourage people to change to green bins, and to brown bins for biodegradable material, the people in Dublin who had been used to a multi-bin system saw very significant price increases of 50%, 60% or 70% in the new regime. They were able to compare, year by year and like for like, what the new charging regime would be. I fully accept what the Minister is doing and support pay-by-weight, as well as the diversion from waste to recyclable, but it has to be in tandem with a realistic pricing structure, and this was not the case last summer. We did not have a fair pricing structure and the Minister of the day had to take emergency action. I support the Minister's programme but it has to be underpinned by a guarantee that the increases we were forced to look at last year will not be on the table again this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_583">I am not proceeding with the pay-per-kilogram scheme which was proposed two years ago and again last year. It was unfair, it was too inflexible to meet the different household circumstances in this country, it ignored the issue of incontinence wear and it penalised those who recycled more. We are going to provide flexibility for operators to ensure that if people segregate more or produce less waste, they will pay less. We will introduce an incentivised charging regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_584"> The State does not control or set prices. If anyone wants evidence of that they should look at the parliamentary questions tabled by colleagues which noted that there was a voluntary freeze in prices in the past 12 months but that operators were breaching it. I have no control over prices. I can set the regulatory environment and I have done so to allow us as much flexibility as possible and to allow operators to put in place as many types of charging regimes as possible. We are, however, getting rid of the flat-rate charge because it does not incentivise a reduction in the amount going to landfill.</p>

            <p eId="para_585">I have the Minister's replies to parliamentary questions and he has been consistent in saying the companies set the rate, not the Government. However, it was the action of the previous Minister in trying to introduce pay-by-weight that led to this dramatic shift. It was driven by a Government policy decision and the Minister rowed back on it. The Minister said there would be a range of charging options in different companies and that the flat rate would be gone. I am speaking from the consumer's point of view. As companies roll out their new suite of charging options, I urge the Minister to oblige them to give their existing customers the breakdown and advice as to their most suitable option based on their previous usage. The intent of the legislation is to go increasingly towards recycling. A customer should be able to compare what they paid in the previous 12 months with what it would cost in the new programme. The Minister may not control prices but he does have a degree of control over this and he has some flexibility. I urge him to ensure there is transparency to avoid the chaos in the industry which there was this time last year.</p>

            <p eId="para_586">Deputy Curran has raised a very important point. I do not know what powers I have in this area and I have to be very careful because of competition law. I commit to relaying the point directly to the 67 operators and to asking them to do this because it makes sense. Not all of them have a flat rate system and many have a user charge system, which they have done quite effectively, as Deputy Eugene Murphy and I have seen in our constituency. Over the next 12 to 15 months, as people transition from their current flat-rate charging regime to an incentivised system, it would make sense to advise them as to the most appropriate scheme for them, based on prior usage. I will relay that to the industry.</p>

As Minister, I have an overarching duty to respect a decision lawfully made by the bodies, unless lawfully challenged. However, on foot of discussions, I have decided to proceed with a second measure to look at the levels of compensation provided in a European context to land and property owners in the proximity of high voltage power lines. We circulated the terms of reference earlier today to interested Members and it is our intention to go to tender on that. It will take into account the issues that have been raised about distance from power lines, landscape, tourism, heritage etc. I have listened to the concerns of the communities and Members of the Oireachtas and have come up with a study to look at the levels of compensation. We will get it completed as soon as possible, published and laid before the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_596">I have read the reaction to the terms of reference from one of the locals in the Monaghan anti-pylon group. They state that this type of study is exactly what they do not want as it obviously is intended to assist EirGrid in benchmarking landowners for compensation for overhead lines in an international context.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">The feeling on the ground is that to talk about compensation, for starters, is to use the wrong language. People living in the area are worried about land devaluation, health and landscape. I am sorry to tell the Minister that the publication of a second study and terms of reference discussing compensation gets people's backs up. There is no other way of putting it. They are distraught and worried that it is almost as though the Minister is trying to assist EirGrid in ploughing ahead with its plans and completely ignoring the worries of the local community. Those people are not worried about compensation, they are worried about their health, the devaluation of their land and the area where they have to live for the rest of their lives.</p>

            <p eId="para_598">This project has a very poor history. The cost to date is in excess of €30 million and there has not even been a JCB put on site. Compensation deals with one issue. The main issues that have been raised by those affected with Members and councillors from their constituency and nearby constituencies are health and safety, life quality issues and the effects on agriculture, the environment, landscape and tourism. This matter has been gone into in great detail with EirGrid and Department officials through questions and face-to-face meetings over at least the past year of my involvement. I am not convinced that the overhead option should be chosen. All Members know that the North-South interconnector is needed, particularly in view of Brexit and the need to integrate the two economies. All Members know that makes sense. The North badly needs our electricity. We need to stabilise our grid and the larger we make it, the more stabilised it will become, as well as providing another opportunity to feed renewables into the grid. All Members understand that and it has all been explained. Somebody now needs to deal with this issue and steer the project in the right direction.</p>

            <p eId="para_599">Deputy Stanley is correct in regard to the need for this grid even before Brexit occurred. The first study to which I agreed on foot of a motion put forward in the House specifically considers whether it is technically feasible for an underground connection to meet the requirements about which the Deputy has spoken. I have been consistently told that it is not possible for an underground connection to meet those requirements. That is being reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_600"> I listened intently to what Members said on the previous occasion this issue was discussed. However, the difficulty is that people want me to listen but are not prepared to listen to the points that I have made. I have gone as far as I can in regard to the terms of reference. I also have to be conscious that there are judicial reviews underway, one of which, in which I am a named party, is due to come before the Commercial Court on 18 July. My intention is to proceed with both studies and publish them as soon as they are available. People also criticised the previous studies and then referenced them once they had been published. One cannot have it every way.</p>

            <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_601">I raise the issue of a proposed treatment plant in Warrenpoint harbour which is to be used to store and transfer hazardous waste. The proposal is at planning stage in Northern Ireland. I have been contacted by many residents and businesses in the Omeath, Carlingford and Greenore areas who are greatly concerned at the potential impact of this facility. They have also raised concerns at the manner in which the application is being made and the lack of available information.</p>
            <p eId="para_602"> The plant has applied for a pollution prevention and control, PPC, permit to operate as a hazardous waste transfer station and bulking facility which will be used to bulk and store both hazardous and non-hazardous materials. It is also proposed to include a chemical treatment plant which will be used for the physico-chemical treatment of waste and the storage of treated effluent waste. The treatment plant, which will be over 1,000 sq. m in size, is by no means a small development. It has been indicated that at any one time the treatment plant will store 200 tonnes of carcinogenic waste, one tonne of readily combustible solids and one tonne of spontaneously combustible solids. The treatment plant has also applied to store five tonnes of quarantined waste for periods of five days at a time.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> What worries me most about this proposal is that it appears that no proper assessment has been carried out. There was no impact assessment study in regard to the effects a toxic waste spillage or emission would have on the well being of the residents of the Carlingford Lough area. The company behind the proposal indicated that it is very probable that an accidental spillage may occur as a result of the treatment of hazardous waste at the site. It should also be noted that the proposed location of this plant has been vulnerable to flooding in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> I am amazed that this proposed plant has not received any scrutiny from elected representatives in the North. I represent the people of Louth and they are deeply concerned at this proposal. The proposed plant is within 120 m of residential areas in Omeath yet in the impact statement the proposers of the plant state that the nearest residential area is over 400 m away. This is a very serious issue and one into which we in the South must have an input. It is not good enough simply to ignore the residents and businesses on the southern side of the lough. Millions of euro of taxpayers' money has been invested in the area to boost the tourism sector. In recent weeks it was agreed to extend the Carlingford to Omeath greenway as far as Newry. It should be noted that the proposed treatment plant is within 120 m of the greenway.</p>
            <p eId="para_605"> The Minister should give a commitment to contact the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland to obtain further information on this proposal and voice his concerns. The people of Louth are too familiar with the effects of living so close to hazardous and dangerous plants. One only has to consider the negative effects the Sellafield plant has had on the region over the past 40 years to realise that. This proposed development is only 120 m from one the most naturally beautiful areas in the region and has the potential to destroy the thriving tourism industry that has been built up in the Carlingford and Omeath region.</p>
            <p eId="para_606"> Assurances are needed from the Northern authorities that they will engage with residents and businesses in the South in regard to this proposal rather than ignore them. I appreciate that as the Northern Assembly is still not up and running the Minister's job will be more difficult in this regard but I urge him to take all steps possible to, at the very least, stall this process until a full consultation has taken place with residents and businesses in the south of Carlingford Lough.</p>

            <p eId="para_607">I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick. The port to which he refers is in County Down, Northern Ireland, and any proposed waste transfer station to be situated there would, as a consequence, be subject to the regulatory controls of that jurisdiction's national waste legislation. Decisions on planning applications for this proposed development would fall to Newry, Mourne and Down District Council. This proposal has been developed to allow black bin waste collected by the council to be subsequently diverted from landfill for processing and treatment. That will involve the removal of recyclable material from the waste with the remainder being shipped for recovery at waste-to-energy facilities abroad. A facility of this nature may require a waste management licence from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, NIEA. Such a licence would have specific conditions attached to it and the facility would be subject to periodic inspections by NIEA, which can also request the production of records concerning the quantity, nature, origin and destination of any waste being held at the site. The NIEA can request those records at any time.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">There are well-established structures in existence that provide a forum to deal with a variety of cross-Border issues, including issues of waste management. The North-South Ministerial Council meets in the environmental sector to make decisions on common policies and approaches in a cross-Border context in areas such as environmental protection, pollution, water quality management and waste management and is an effective forum to address waste management issues of mutual concern. However, as the Deputy knows, that council is not currently constituted. It last met in November of 2016. I look forward to its being re-established in the not too distant future, hopefully within the coming weeks, at which stage it can be used to progress this issue. </p>

            <p eId="para_609">I thank the Minister for his response. I strongly believe that action is now needed from this side of the Border to at the very least halt this application. The people and businesses in north County Louth are simply being ignored in this process. As I have already stated, the application totally ignores those along the south of the lough when they stated that the nearest residential area was over 400 m away, when in fact the nearest residence is in fact only 120 m away on the southern side of the lough. The fact that the proposed site is vulnerable to flooding and has flooded in recent years is also a major concern. The impact on local flora and fauna must also be examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_610"> At a meeting with residents last night it was pointed out to me that only 30 years ago there was no life in the lough as a result of raw sewage being pumped directly into it, yet today sea bass, salmon and trout are to be seen regularly. We must also take into account the value of people's homes along the lough, which no doubt will be affected by this proposal. </p>
            <p eId="para_611"> I am deeply concerned with this proposal and share the worries of the residents and businesses in the region. Tourism plays a vital role in the development of the region and this proposal will have a negative effect. I urge the Minister to contact the relevant authorities in the north and on behalf of the residents and businesses of north Louth and voice in the strongest possible terms their concerns in respect of this proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_612"> As the Minister knows, the Northern Ireland Assembly is not functioning at the moment. I met the chamber of commerce and many people in Northern Ireland and helped them to try and sort things out. The people of north Louth are pleading for help. For 40 years we had Sellafield. This is hazardous and toxic. The Minister has spent the last two and a half hours talking about the climate in the Republic. The Good Friday Agreement exists, and I for one would like to see a united Ireland. It is very important that the Minister and his counterpart would have a serious look at this area. There is a serious knock-on of this situation. </p>
            <p eId="para_613"> I am seeking commitment from the Minister that he will contact his counterpart in the North or someone in the North and please help the people of north Louth who have been seriously affected for the last 40 years by Sellafield. </p>

            <p eId="para_614">There is a culture of strong and active co-operation on waste management issues between the relevant authorities on both sides of the Border. As I pointed out earlier, there are well established structures in existence that provide a forum to deal with a variety of cross-Border issues, and I have used these previously to highlight problems being faced by Border counties exposed to the consequences of environmental crime. I believe that the North-South Ministerial Council is the most appropriate forum to address the issues of concern from a waste perspective and I am more than happy to raise the matter at the next meeting of the council, should the Deputy have any further concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_615"> I give Deputy Fitzpatrick a commitment that I will make contact with my counterpart. The difficulty is that I do not have a counterpart at the moment. I had a good working relationship with my counterparts over the six months that the North-South Ministerial Council was in place, and I look forward to working with them once the Government in Northern Ireland is re-established. </p>

            <p eId="para_616">I spoke briefly to the Minister last Thursday about the unauthorised development by EirGrid of an electricity substation and electricity lines at Coolnabacca, County Laois. It is not just a question of a breach of planning laws. This is a situation where the actions of EirGrid have been contemptuous. It has broken the law, disregarded the local community and been dishonest in its public statements. Some of its public statements and published documents are unworthy of a State organisation. I personally believe that some of the documentation it has submitted to An Bord Pleanála is fraudulent. The issue is far more serious than someone commencing work on a project that had planning permission prior to lodging a commencement notice. It says in the public statement that it commenced work on the site prior to discharging some of its conditions, and that the works are approved by An Bord Pleanála. That is simply untrue. I am not permitted to describe it with the appropriate three-letter word.</p>
            <p eId="para_617"> This is an area where planning was granted as a result of An Bord Pleanála carrying out an appropriate assessment. That means that if one breaches the planning laws and conditions one cannot go back for retention. There is no option for An Bord Pleanála to ignore this issue. It has ignored the construction management plan that it should have submitted to Laois County Council. It has ignored the condition dealing with the national parks and wildlife and the conditions applicable to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Above all, it has now submitted a document to An Bord Pleanála seeking minor alterations. That document is a fraudulent document and should be withdrawn because it makes no reference to the fact that this work has already been completed. It is seeking a minor alteration for something that is already history. That is a fraudulent submission to An Bord Pleanála and it must be asked to withdraw it straight away. </p>

            <p eId="para_618">This is the most important issue in the mid-Laois area at the moment. It is a flagrant breach of the planning code by a State company. It has a controversial history. EirGrid started work without having a construction management plan or a commencement notice from the planning authority, which is the local authority, Laois County Council. It started work on it around 17 April. It met the county council on 24 April and was told to cease. It kept working away and bulldozed ahead. It was served with a warning letter from Laois County Council on 30 May, but not the urgent enforcement notice that should have been served on it at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_619"> My information is that the environmental impact statement on this project has not been completed. It is sited on a very sensitive aquifer, but An Bord Pleanála, if our information is correct, gave the go-ahead for this project against the advice of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. That has to be clarified. EirGrid cannot go in and recommence this work. Huge work has been carried out already, riding roughshod over the local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_620"> I met the management of EirGrid last week and put it to them that they had an appalling record on Ratheniska and the valley between Slieve Margy and the Rock of Dunamase and the hills on the other side. It has not been upfront with the local people of Ratheniska and Timahoe. I have requested that it informs us immediately of the full extent of what is planned in that area. It has broken the law and disregarded the planning process. We do not normally raise these things in the Chamber as they are usually left to the planners but the planning process on this project is in tatters. This is a publically owned semi-State company. The Minister is the shareholder. He cannot be a spectator on this and he must hold EirGrid to account. We need accountability from An Bord Pleanála and from EirGrid on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_621">I thank Deputies Fleming and Stanley for providing me with the opportunity to discuss this significant electricity grid enhancement project. I understand that they have been briefed by both EirGrid and ESB Networks on the matter late last week. I welcome a discussion on the topic, and I believe it to be an example of how important it is for the people of Laois and Kilkenny that their electricity supply is kept up to the expected modern standards, as well as how vigorous our planning system is.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">In working towards an ever more efficient, more effective and more economic electricity network, it is necessary to carry out grid refurbishment and enhancement on an ongoing basis. In this, EirGrid and ESB Networks work in close co-operation with the ultimate goal of enhancing the national electricity grid. They work to ensure citizens have ongoing, secure access to electricity via a world class electricity infrastructure that supports Ireland's continued economic development.</p>
            <p eId="para_623"> The Laois-Kilkenny electricity grid reinforcement project is required to improve the security of electricity supply in the region. This €110 million investment in the area will ensure the electricity network can meet the present and future needs of all users, from homes to farms, and small businesses to industrial customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_624"> The Coolnabacca electricity station in County Laois is part of this project which was granted planning permission in 2014 by An Bord Pleanála. In April 2017, works started at the Coolnabacca electricity station site. It came to light that the works were proceeding without the planning conditions being discharged by Laois County Council, including the erection of a temporary pylon.</p>
            <p eId="para_625"> When this issue was brought to my attention by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, I immediately contacted EirGrid pointing out that this was totally unacceptable. Once this oversight was identified I was told that all works ceased on site. No further works will take place until the necessary planning conditions have been agreed in writing with the planning authority, which is Laois County Council. A meeting has been scheduled with the local authority for this Friday, 30 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_626"> The temporary pylon is required during the construction works to ensure the safety of workers on site and to maintain security of electricity supply as an existing overhead line runs close to the perimeter of the new station. Once the station is built, this temporary pylon and line diversion will be removed. I understand the pylon is on ESB land.</p>
            <p eId="para_627"> An application has been lodged with An Bord Pleanála for an alteration to the planning permission for this temporary pylon and both EirGrid and ESB Networks are reviewing their processes internally to ensure this does not occur in the future. Since the issue came to light, EirGrid and ESB Networks have been engaging with elected and public representatives locally to keep them informed and up to date with developments.</p>

            <p eId="para_628">I publicly invite the Minister to visit the site. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, may have already invited him personally. The most upsetting point is that EirGrid has made a massive mistake. It knows this mistake cannot be rectified. A construction management plan cannot be submitted in an area covered by an appropriate assessment after work has commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_629"> It has been dishonest in its dealings with what it submitted to An Bord Pleanála. It has been dishonest with Laois County Council. I am very concerned that EirGrid has shown a lack of candour in briefing the Minister today with what I would call the harmless response it drafted. We all know it is a big project and that is all the more reason for it to get it right. In its dealings with An Bord Pleanála it is calling this "minor alterations" because it knows that if it asks for retention, which is the reality, there is no provision in law to give retention for works covered by an area that required an appropriate assessment as carried out by An Bord Pleanála. It is telling An Bord Pleanála that works have not even commenced. It is looking for permission to do these proposed works. Everything about its submission is dishonest and fraudulent. It must withdraw from site unilaterally, completely and forever.</p>

            <p eId="para_630">The Minister's reply would indicate that EirGrid is telling him that the works being carried out are minor and that there is one temporary pylon. I have photographs that show something completely different. It shows two pylons, a road being constructed and other works being carried out on site. This is a flagrant breach of the planning legislation and shows total disregard for the people of Timahoe and the Ratheniska area.</p>
            <p eId="para_631"> The question about the environmental impact statement, EIS, needs to be answered. Maybe it has been completed but our information is that it has not been and that planning permission was given despite the concerns of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The whole project needs to go back to the start because EirGrid has started work and it cannot now simply continue under the present permission. We need answers. We are not dealing with a rogue developer. These are two semi-State companies, owned by us, which are accountable to the Minister, to this House and to the people. I want the Minister to contact An Bord Pleanála.</p>
            <p eId="para_632"> I welcome the fact the Minister has been in contact with EirGrid but I want him to make close contact with it again on this project to clarify the issue around the aquifer. Like Deputy Fleming, I invite the Minister to meet us on the site. Deputy Fleming, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I met local residents at a packed public meeting a few nights ago in Ratheniska. We may be divided on many things but I do not sense any difference between the three of us, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Sinn Féin, on this issue in the constituency.</p>

            <p eId="para_633">I have contacted EirGrid and have spoken to the chief executive of the ESB about this. I will not contact An Bord Pleanála. I cannot and will not do so. The planning process has to go on and I will not interfere with that in any way whatsoever. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has spoken very frankly to me about this. There is quite a bit of anger here in the House about it, and I can understand that. It is nothing compared with what I received from the Minister, Deputy Flanagan.</p>
            <p eId="para_634"> There was a breach of the planning code by a State company and I would expect State companies to comply with the law of the land. Just over 12 months ago, I had an opportunity to address all the energy companies in this country, including the State companies, at an Energy Ireland conference in Croke Park. I made it a point at that conference to say that community had to be at the core of everything that was done, and that there had to be real and genuine engagement with communities throughout the country, with none of the lip service we have seen in the past. I expect the semi-State companies, particularly those under my authority, to have ensured that happened. I will get an opportunity to have a further discussion with them on foot of this and will relay the issues that have been raised in the House. Deputy Fleming is correct. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has invited me to visit the site in question, and at the first opportunity I get I will take up his offer.</p>

            <p eId="para_638">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for affording me the opportunity to raise this sensitive issue in the House. This matter relates to a constituent who was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and rent support because she is on the housing list. She was also working the maximum hours allowed in part-time employment. This was satisfactory until last February when her health deteriorated and, on receiving a diagnosis which alarmed her, she went to visit her relatives in her homeland.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> On her return she was questioned about her circumstances. Her social welfare payments were ceased. Following numerous questions I raised with the relevant section in the Department of Social Protection and parliamentary questions to the then Minister, I was given to understand that her rent would be restored and that three months' rent, including all arrears, would be paid at the same time. That did not happen. Only two months' arrears were paid. She continued to try to recover the payments that had been discontinued. This lady's health is not good. She paid numerous visits to the doctor. There is a doctor's letter on file setting out her vulnerability.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">This situation has dragged on for five months, which is unacceptable. The usual appeals process was provided for but the appeal has not taken place. There is a long waiting list. Meanwhile, the lady in question has no payment, a fact of which her landlord has grown tired. The relationship between herself and the landlord has now broken down and a notice to quit has been issued. She will become homeless in the next few days and certainly by the end of the week.</p>
            <p eId="para_641"> Given the number of times I have raised the issue, the urgency of the situation, the reasonable explanation provided by the woman and the nature of her family circumstances, this is not acceptable. I am very grateful to the Minister of State for coming to the House and I realise the Minister was unable to attend. I have been a long time in the House and a long time dealing with social welfare queries. I even spent a bit of time in the Department. However, I have never come across a situation in which there was such a determination to punish an individual to the extent of making it virtually impossible for that individual to exist. I await the reply. I hope sincerely to hear that the matter has been resolved. Incidentally, I received responses from one or two people who were helpful, one of whom is making a valiant effort to rectify the matter. In the same way I obviously was, however, that person is also being stonewalled. I await the result.</p>

            <p eId="para_642">I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this very important matter and I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty. The person concerned was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance from August 2015 to January 2017 and of rent supplement from May 2015 to January 2017. In January 2017, a review of the jobseeker's allowance claim was instigated on foot of information received by the Department that the person concerned was not residing at the property declared to it. In line with relevant guidelines, this resulted in the suspension of the rent claim. An inspector from the Department met the person concerned who asserted residence at the address. The person could not explain why another resident at the property would have stated otherwise. At the meeting with the inspector, the person confirmed being in receipt of income from self-employment as well as income from part-time employment. Given the level of income declared from the self-employment, together with the other declared income, the means assessment completed in this instance showed that the person concerned had means in excess of the statutory limit for jobseeker's allowance in the circumstances. This means assessment is also used to inform the calculation of rent supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> Following this initial meeting, the Department engaged extensively with the person concerned, directly and through Deputy Durkan, to progress the case. These engagements included further meetings with the inspectorate team, correspondence with both the person concerned and Deputy Durkan's office and, most recently, a meeting with the relevant divisional manager. At all times, the Department's focus was on clarifying and verifying the information provided by the person concerned to allow a payment to issue. As the Deputy is aware, having himself attended, a further attempt was made at the most recent meeting organised between the person concerned and officials from the Department to clarify inconsistencies in the information the person concerned had previously submitted. The Department is not satisfied that the person's means have been fully disclosed and, on that basis, the payment was stopped. The decision to stop the payment has been appealed to the social welfare appeals office. I have been advised by the office that an appeals officer has examined the appeal submissions and decided an oral hearing is the most appropriate way to deal with the case. The person concerned will be advised of the details of the oral hearing as soon as arrangements for it can been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_644"> It is a legal requirement that all tenancies be registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. While the RTB is precluded from dealing with any dispute relating to a tenancy that might be referred to it by a landlord until such time as a tenancy has been entered onto the RTB's register of tenancies, that does not preclude a tenant from referring matters to the board. Under the current legislation, a landlord seeking to terminate a tenancy in the case of rent arrears must first issue a 14-day warning notice notifying the tenant of the arrears. If the situation is not resolved, he or she may then issue a 28-day notice of termination.</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> The Deputy will understand that the Department cannot commit to making payments to customers where it has been decided that means have not been disclosed. The same consideration in respect of means also applies to supplementary welfare allowance payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_646">I thank the Minister of State for his reply but I must point out that it contains at least three major inaccuracies. I do not for a moment suggest that the Minister of State is the architect of that. However, I attended the relevant meeting and am absolutely convinced as to the entitlements of the applicant. I have no doubt that the manner in which a conclusion was reached in this case was not in accordance with due process and best practice, which is a basic requirement of all social welfare determinations. Due process and natural justice are tests which must apply in all such cases. If they do not, there is a problem and that problem still exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_647"> As I well know, everything is geared towards waiting until the summer break when there will be no response at all. I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of that in situations such as this. Looking for a lease at this stage is an option that is past its sell-by date. The relationship between the landlord and the tenant has broken down as a result of the absence of payments and four or five months of arrears. I have been looking at situations like this for a long time but I have never seen this kind of attitude develop before. It is necessary to have a very serious look at the manner in which these determinations are being made. I have a separate question on tomorrow's Order Paper seeking to ascertain the methodology and pattern developing in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> There is still time to undertake a fair assessment. At least one divisional regional manager made a serious attempt to resolve the problem but I have a funny feeling that person will be stonewalled just as I have been for the past six months.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">I am well aware of Deputy Durkan's great record on social welfare and in looking after constituents. I commend him on his dedication and work on this issue. Of course, I take the point that when a health issue is involved, we have to be sensitive. We must also be aware that an oral hearing is on the agenda. Hopefully, the issues the Deputy raises today can be resolved at that stage. The Deputy said there were three major inaccuracies and raised questions of due process, best practice and natural justice. We all support due process. Another complicating issue is the landlord-tenant relationship. The Deputy also referred to the methodology that applied. I will bring all of the issues he raised back to the Minister for Employment and Social Protection and ensure she hears about the facts of the case and the matters and concerns the Deputy raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_650">I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, the best of luck in his new role, which will not be an easy one. I will try not to be difficult with him just for today.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> A main principle of A Vision for Change is that people seeking mental health care should, where possible, be treated at the earliest opportunity in their own communities on an outpatient basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">This is about providing the best care while avoiding hospitalisation and repeated admissions in the absence of community structures. It is also a much more efficient and cost-effective model of care for the State. Unfortunately, those community services have not materialised to the level recommended in A Vision for Change and hospital services, which remain far too necessary, have been scaled back for those seeking care and they have been forced to travel across the country. This can be seen in places such as Wexford in particular, where the closure of local beds has led to people having to travel to Waterford for inpatient care. In some cases, this may not be a major journey but for those on the northern edge of the county, it is at least a 90-minute drive and possibly 150 minutes by bus. This is very hard on the families of patients and it also discourages those who need care from seeking it. Consider how, in the midst of suicidal thoughts and a severely low mood, many may feel unworthy of the assistance needed to get them there for care. I have heard countless stories from family members who have had to drive their loved ones up and down the country, particularly in the south east, in order to find somewhere they could receive inpatient care.</p>
            <p eId="para_653"> In terms of child and adolescent care, only 63 of the minimum 100 beds needed in the State are in place. Children are being turned away from child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Cork and across the State because waiting lists are far too long. The inability to provide community care inevitably puts more pressure on the hopelessly inadequate inpatient services. According to the HSE, only 53% of CAMHS whole-time positions are filled at present. Eleven beds at Cherry Orchard Hospital are currently at threat.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> While I am on the subject, I also wish to raise the serious concerns for funding for Youth Work Ireland's counselling services in Galway. This is an essential service for young people beginning to experience mental health issues. The service could provide 31 hours of counselling, which is almost double the current hours, to 12 to 21 year olds in local communities such as those in Galway, Ballinasloe, Tuam and Loughrea at an annual cost of just €62,000. However, funding is not stable - not even now. These are the kind of local early intervention services we need investment in.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">I thank the Acting Chairman for his good wishes, which are very much appreciated, and I thank Deputy Buckley for his good wishes also. I sincerely look forward to doing the role justice. I hope I will; I certainly will try my very best.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> First and foremost, health care is about the individual and individual well-being. In January 2006, the Government adopted the report, as referred to by the Deputy, of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, as the basis for the future development of mental health services in Ireland. It advocated a move away from traditional institutionalised care to a patient-centred, flexible and community-based mental health service. It also recommended the organisation of mental health services nationally in catchment areas for populations of between 250,000 and 400,000, with specialist expertise provided by community mental health teams, that is, expanded multidisciplinary teams of clinicians who work together to service the needs of service users across the lifespan.</p>
            <p eId="para_660"> More than 90% of mental health needs can be successfully treated within a primary care setting, with less than 10% of patients being referred to specialist community-based mental health services. Of this number, approximately 10% are offered inpatient care, with 92% of all admissions being of a voluntary nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> The spectrum of services provided by the HSE extends from promoting positive mental health through to supporting those experiencing severe and disabling mental illness. These services include specialised secondary care services for children, adolescents and adults. Services are provided in a number of different settings, including the service users' own homes. The service is integrated with primary care, acute hospitals, services for older people and services for people with disabilities and with a wide range of non-health sector partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> Specialist mental health services provided include acute inpatient units, community-based mental health teams, day hospitals, outpatient clinics, community residential settings, continuing care settings and the national forensic mental health service. Primary care services are usually the first point of contact for individuals presenting with mental health problems directly through their GPs or other health service professionals.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> Community mental health teams are the first line of acute secondary mental health care provision. They support individuals in their recovery in their own communities. The community mental health team co-ordinates a range of interventions for individuals in a variety of locations, including home care treatment, day hospital outpatient facilities and inpatient units, and interacts and liaises with specialist catchment or regional services to co-ordinate the care of individuals who require special consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> There are 51 HSE approved centres for adults spread across the nine community health care organisations, CHOs. In addition, there are six private approved centres for adults. There are also five CAMHS approved inpatient centres, four in the HSE and one private, that is, Willow Grove at St Patrick’s Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> As well as a primary care GP network, which is often the first point of contact for someone who is experiencing mental health problems, there is a community team network of 119 HSE adult community mental health teams, 64 community CAMHS teams and 29 community teams responsible for older age psychiatry who deliver specialist community-based mental health treatments.</p>
            <p eId="para_666"> Since 2012, we have provided an additional €140 million for mental health services. This has helped to ensure that patients have access to community services and, in most cases, are not required to travel distances to access these services.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Buckley<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_667">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. He referred to 64 community CAMHS teams. I wonder how many of them are fully staffed. That is one issue I would have. The Sláintecare report was recently debated in the Dáil and while the work involved in producing it was difficult, it was a very good learning experience. We had cross-party agreement on a lot of it. There is a strong emphasis in the report on funding for mental health services as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_668"> We had raised the €37.5 million extra to be put into mental health services early last year but we did not get the full support. Could we even get a commitment? I know the Minister of State is new to the job. However, we need 24-7 crisis services across the country. The Minister of State has seen it. One of the Wexford county mayors said that it is disgraceful that people have to travel so far when they need immediate help. I do not wish to put the Minister of State in a position but we have to ask the question. Could he make a commitment to go so far as to put in place a pilot system of 24-7 services? We know that it is not a Monday to Friday job; it is the weekends and the out-of-hours. Families are suffering as well as the patients. As I said, if they have to travel from one county to another to access help, we will lose a lot more people in this country. Will the Minister of State please make a commitment to invest in mental health services? I ask him not to let families suffer.</p>

            <p eId="para_669">I again thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. The more times this issue is raised in this House and on any other platform where he gets the opportunity to raise it, the more it assists me, the Department and all of us in driving the focus that is necessary in this area. If we went out and asked anyone in our community what is the single most important issue, I think there would be unanimous agreement across the board that mental health is the challenge of our generation. We happen to be the politicians who are populating this space at this point and this is our greatest responsibility. As Minister of State, I have been given the task to see what I can do. However, we all have a role to play.</p>
            <p eId="para_670"> Deputy Buckley has a lot of experience, passion and commitment in this area. He has already asked me for an early meeting and I hope that we can have one in order that we might discuss some of these matters in more detail and that he can share his wisdom with me and try to guide and direct my efforts within the Department. As we are both Corkmen, I look forward to working collaboratively to ensure that we can try to bring about some achievements, not just for Cork but for the country. We have an understanding which, perhaps, some other fellow county men might not have.</p>
            <p eId="para_671"> I also agree with the Deputy, and share the view strongly, that people have the right to be treated in their own communities. That is the least we should do. We are trying to retain and build communities and ensure that they prosper. People should be treated there and we should be making effort in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> I am not fully<i> au fait</i> with the issue in the south east. However, there was a request to meet all the elected Members from the south east, particularly those from the Wexford area. We are trying to make that happen this week. I am not sure that it will but it will certainly happen next week. I will get my head around the issues involved in order that we might move forward with the meeting. I know that some of the Members here now are from Wexford.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> On the waiting list for CAMHS, the Deputy is right that there is a staffing issue, but I do not accept that it is just about staffing. Nor is it just about resources; it is about a combination of effort and focus and we have to address both.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">I do not have a solution for that right now. I will certainly take on board what the Deputy said with regard to Youth Work Ireland. We will mention all of these issues at our upcoming meeting. I will come back to the Deputy with the figures for CAMHS staffing levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_675"> I cannot give the Deputy a commitment today, as I am sure he will understand, other than to do my very best. I have to get my head around too many issues but I will certainly give the Deputy a commitment to do everything I can. I look forward to working further with the Deputy and I hope he will continue to raise this important issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_677">Before I call on the Minister to begin the debate proper, in the context of the House's consideration of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill I want to remind all Members that when debating matters relating to the Judiciary, it is important to be mindful of the principle of the separation of powers. Members of the Judiciary are independent in the performance of their duties by virtue of the Constitution and it is not in order to comment on or criticise them in any way. This is a long-standing rule of the House and I therefore request all Members who are contributing to the debate to be measured in their contributions and to uphold the principle of mutual respect between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary. I urge them to address their remarks to the important policy proposals contained in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_680"> I very much welcome the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's message and I am sure it is one that he and any other Members who take the Chair during the course of the debate will be mindful of. I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will not have to remind Members of this House of the issues to which he adverted and I thank him for same.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> As the House we be aware, it has been a long journey to this point. My predecessor, the Tánaiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, undertook an enormous amount of painstaking work on the complex matters involved in this legislation, while a process of public consultation was conducted in 2014 by another of my predecessors as Minister for Justice and Equality, former Deputy Alan Shatter. The impartial administration of justice according to law is vital in ensuring that we have a strong and stable modern democracy in this State. The critical and often difficult task that the Judiciary performs at every level of the courts system is central to maintaining this and a key concern is to have a system of judicial appointments that supports public confidence in the administration of justice in our courts. The Bill provides for a number of very substantial changes which I believe represent a defining reform, providing for a modern, comprehensive and fit for purpose system dealing with judicial appointments in this State. For the first time we will have a comprehensive statute providing exclusively for the process of judicial appointments in a transparent way. The Bill represents a unique and modernising approach which has been devised to deal with this complex area of administration so that it is best suited to our needs in the 21st century. In this Bill, I am bringing forward immediate and innovative changes to the judicial appointments structure that has been operating for the past 20 years or so. The Bill also sets up a dynamic mechanism to develop further and embed needed improvements and reforms as the justice and social and economic environments evolve into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> Over three years ago, the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, set about bringing our system of judicial appointments in line with international best practice. A decision was taken to engage in public consultations and to get the views of stakeholders as to what the best approach might be to devising an improved system. Certain themes were flagged going into that process including the need to continue to protect the independence of the Judiciary; the role of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB; and eligibility issues and the diversity of our Judiciary. Much of the content of the Bill reflects the outcome of that process and the research and policy analysis which followed it in the Department of Justice and Equality. While there are deficiencies in some aspects of the current system, it could not be said to have affected the quality, integrity or diligence of the Judiciary, which has contributed greatly to the success of our modern democracy or, most of all, its true independence. Ireland regularly features very highly on international measures of judicial independence. Judges themselves, through their professionalism and service, have ensured that our Judiciary is held in very high esteem. I want the debate in these Houses over the next few weeks to be appropriately respectful to the judicial branch of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> In a moment I will come to the key immediate reforms that I believe will bring real change and a better and more open and transparent process under the terms of this Bill, but first I want to underline the significance of having a commission. Working through a procedures committee established under section 19 of the Bill, the commission will be tasked with a remit to determine quickly in a consultative process new procedures for judicial selection and the skills and attributes required for the job. These procedures will reflect best practice professional selection methods and processes. This will not be a one-off task, however. Under Part 8, the committee will have the ongoing role of reviewing the effectiveness of the selection system as well as the effectiveness of the functions assigned to the commission under this Bill. Real attention to system review and process improvement is at the heart of this Bill, having regard to the best practice judicial appointment model that can be devised and improved over time. That will be an ongoing process and the Bill requires the commission to report to the Minister on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> The current arrangements for judicial appointments embodied in the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, as amended, represented an important advance by introducing a new independent element to the judicial appointments process. Up to that time, of course, there was effectively nothing in place to guide the function of appointment other than the relevant terms of the Constitution. Article 35.1 of the Constitution provides that judges are appointed by the President and under Article 13.9 such power is exercisable and performable only on the advice of the Government. That is not changing, obviously, but it is a matter for the Oireachtas to legislate for the systems and procedures that are needed to support decision making under this constitutional prerogative.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> It was an important step in 1995 to bring lay persons into the role of identifying persons suitable for appointment to judicial office and to bring in a more consultative and transparent approach to the process of appointing judges. While I am conscious that I am speaking with the benefit of over 20 years' hindsight, reflection on the experience can only lead one to conclude that the arrangements were limited in a number of respects. The Bill before the House brings the system to a new level of openness and effectiveness. The limitation of the scope of the JAAB to first-time judicial appointments only, for example, meant in effect that the new procedures were concerned with just one dimension of the judicial appointment process. They did not address the elevation of serving judges from one court to another which is an option that is exercised quite regularly when it comes to appointing persons to our superior courts. When a serving judge is the subject of judicial appointment, the JAAB has no role, although it may have recommended practising lawyers for the same position. Where it has a role, that is in recommending persons other than serving judges for appointment, it must recommend at least seven persons, if it can, to the Minister. If the vacancy in question is as president of any court or as Chief Justice, it has no role whatsoever. It is also the case that no dedicated resource was assigned in the legislation to support the JAAB. Over the years, the Courts Service has provided the necessary financial, technical and administrative support to the board and, in passing, I want to acknowledge this invaluable contribution to the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> It is not surprising that these limitations were the overall focus of what was effectively a critique of the current system in submissions made by stakeholders to the public consultation process. Addressing these identified limitations and broadening the vision of what the commission can be is really what this Bill is all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">However, it is perhaps not overly instructive to emphasise limitations in the current statutory arrangements. After all, it is well over 20 years since that legislation was conceived. It was the first time the Government function in the matter was supplemented by an independent element in the process, and it was the first opening of the process to any scrutiny. At the time, it was also an important move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> The justice system now operates in a modern administrative environment. More transparent and participative approaches are apparent in public policy decision-making models both here and on the international stage, and so we will move to a radically more open, transparent and independent system under the Bill. Instead of the Government dealing with multiple recommendations for a particular judicial post, as can happen now, combined with having before it the names of potentially any number of serving judges, it will now, under section 42, have only three names before it, all coming through the process of the new commission. This is a significant change, which is consistent with best international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> The Government, under the Constitution, will continue to retain the discretion to appoint a person to judicial office but will, as section 48 provides and as the 1995 Act provided, have to first consider the recommendations made to it. The names coming from the new commission will, in turn, have come through professional and carefully designed selection processes which will be transparent at all times. It is worth noting that under this Bill, it is the qualifications, experience and character, not only of legal professionals and, in a new provision, legal academics, but also of judges themselves who wish to serve in a higher judicial office that will be the subject of assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> The three most senior judicial posts, namely, those of Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal and President of the High Court, will, under section 46, be subject to a variation of the general process. In respect of these three judicial positions only, the commission will forward the names of persons who have expressed an interest to a new senior judicial appointments advisory committee comprising the Chief Justice, the lay chairperson of the new commission and the Attorney General, and this committee will recommend three names to the Government. The scheme had provided that the Minister would also be a member of the committee. However, following consultation and reflection on this point, membership of the committee will now be as provided under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> The Bill provides the new commission with a very substantial and definitive function in respect of the selection of our Judiciary into the future. Reflecting today's governance and participation models of public policy decision-making, the new commission will have strong lay representation. This legislation is largely about getting the balance right between different contributions and interests. There has been much discourse, and I have no doubt there will be much more in the course of this debate, about the numbers of judges involved in the selection process and whether judges should form a majority in any body set up for this purpose. It is worth repeating a point made by the Tánaiste when the scheme preceding this Bill was undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny in January. She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_692">Judicial selection is not part of the judicial function. The judicial function is to apply the law, interpret the Constitution and defend it.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> Section 12 provides for a new commission of 13 members. This is an increase of two on the current advisory board numbers and an increase of two in the membership, as provided for in the general scheme of the Bill, that is, the model discussed at pre-legislative scrutiny stage in committee in January last. I want to be clear about the status of the Government programme commitment to reduce commission numbers. It has not proven possible to do this while at the same time legislating for the most substantive related commitments. It would not be operationally feasible to reduce numbers while providing for a lay majority and lay chairperson and, at the same time, retaining the Attorney General and legal professionals who are indispensable, as well as having the most appropriate level of senior judicial involvement in the structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> On the issue of judicial input to selection and recommendation, this is perhaps the more substantive variation in the Bill from the terms of the general scheme. Section 12 provides that the commission will have 13 members, consisting of a lay chair, the three most senior judicial officeholders, the Attorney General, one representative each of the solicitor and barrister professions and six ordinary lay members. I am persuaded that the Chief Justice and presidents of the Court of Appeal and High Court should be full commission members, directly involved in all appointments to the courts over which they preside and, in the case of the Chief Justice, to all courts. These most senior judicial officeholders will also be full members of the commission for the purposes of discharging other critical functions under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> I would be the very first to acknowledge that the Judiciary has very critical and indeed determinative expertise in terms of understanding and advising on the legal, courtroom and analytical aspects of what it takes to be a successful judge and that this will, in turn, be complemented by the specific additional legal sector qualities which the Attorney General and representatives of the legal profession will bring to the table. Clearly, one cannot be appointed as a judge unless one has the necessary foundation, legal and related knowledge and skills to do the job with excellence. However, the non-legal people, carefully and professionally selected by the Public Appointments Service, who will now be part of these selection processes as a very substantial cohort, will also bring a range of necessary additional life, user and citizen perspective, governance and selection expertise into the mix. I am sure that, in the new arrangements, the participating judges, those with non-judicial legal experience and those with other areas of expertise and experience will work closely and respectfully together.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> Staying on the subject of judicial representation in the appointments process, Deputies will be aware that there is some concern among senior members of the Judiciary about the implementation of the programme for Government commitments to appointing a lay chairperson to the commission and having a majority of lay members. The Government has consulted in depth the representatives of the Judicial Appointments Review Committee, the senior Judiciary group tasked with contributing to the change process. Substantial and significant elements of the legislation are consistent with the informed views of the Judiciary. For example, the move to only three recommendations, the inclusion of all appointments in the new process, including serving judges, the dedicated resources provided, the provision for selection and recommendation to be based on merit, new accountability arrangements, a prohibition on canvassing and other important elements of the Bill reflect key tenets of the Judiciary's position on these reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Deputies will no doubt be aware that judges are opposed to having a majority of lay persons on the commission and a lay chairperson presiding over a commission of which the Chief Justice is a member. A particular concern expressed in that regard is that all five court presidents, including the Chief Justice, should be directly involved in the selection and recommendation of persons for appointment, as is the case in the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, process. On careful consideration, having listened to the views of the Judiciary on the matter and reflecting on the point in the context of the pre-legislative scrutiny debate, it appears to be desirable to meet this particular point. Rather than a consultation-type arrangement with, for example, the President of the District Court, as the <i>ex officio </i>arrangement under the general scheme would have provided, a direct decision-making role for each president should be retained as in the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process. Sections 11 and 13 provide that the commission shall act in the form of a relevant 11-person committee, one for each of the five courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> In the modern environment of administration, in a new body and, moreover, one that will exercise much more decisive and definitive functions than its JAAB predecessor, an adequate and cost-effective professional management structure is essential. The new office to support the commission and the new position of director are central parts of this, but there is also a need to lead the commission in the professional administrative and recruitment space. The carefully constructed qualifying criteria under section 15 that underpin the appointment of the chairperson to be recruited by the Public Appointments Service will require the person to have board management and corporate governance expertise, among other things.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> In framing the various provisions of the Bill, the Tánaiste was particularly aware of the need to ensure our new system of appointments was as open and transparent as it can be and underpinned by a meaningful set of accountability arrangements. Some examples from the Bill illustrate this. The new commission chairperson will be accountable to an Oireachtas committee. Under section 24, the director will be required to forward reports to the Committee of Public Accounts. The commission will be required to report annually to the Minister. The House will have a role in respect of other openness and accountability matters. Section 64 prohibits canvassing by an applicant or anyone on an applicant's behalf and provides for an offence in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> I have covered the key immediate steps to be introduced under the Bill. I also want consideration to be given to Part 8. This Part is about a progressive approach to reform, allowing for further development of the selection procedures, informed with reference to best international practice and other considerations set out in the Bill. These functions focus on the work of the procedures committee which, under section 19, will be composed of seven members of the commission with a lay majority and lay chairperson.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Section 55 provides for certain essential requirements in the area of judicial competency that must be reflected in the statement. These include an ability to conduct proceedings in a manner that ensures confidence by the public in the administration of justice and the practical considerations that affect the experience of lay persons of the courts system. Another key task of the procedures committee is to review the operation of the published statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> I have pointed to a number of aspects of the Bill that represent some development of the measures outlined in the general scheme. I have retained as objectives in the Bill that the membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women and, to the extent feasible and practicable, reflect the diversity within the population as a whole. These matters will, subject to the overriding merit principle, be considered at selection and appointment stage. Deputies will see from section 55 that these matters will also be addressed by the procedures committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> The last substantive matter I want to mention is the opening up of the eligibility arrangements for appointment to the High Court to District Court judges and legal academics. These matters are addressed in section 35.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> I will finish on two points. First, there is a far-reaching and in-depth reform of the judicial appointments system before us in the form of this Bill. I am confident that the measures are required. However, I want to see precisely after five years of its application how effective these developments are in practice. Section 5 requires the Minister to review the working of the legislation and report on the matter to the Houses. Deputies will want to see a full account of its operation. That review will take account of the work of the commission's procedures committee in reviewing matters after two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Second, the Government will not wish to leave judicial positions vacant once the commission is established and in the period before the procedures committee develops the statements setting out the procedures and the skills required of candidates. This issue is dealt with in section 63.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> I am proposing this Bill as the best approach to ensuring to the greatest extent possible that the quality of our judicial system is maintained to the benefit of everyone in society. It is difficult to overstate how significant these reforms are. Lest there be any doubt about the matter, I wish to make it clear that, in moving from scheme to Bill, we have taken account of a great deal of what the Judiciary has had to say, including on merit, canvassing, the selection of lay candidates, the provisions relating to academics and other matters. What we have not done is move away from the fundamental undertakings as to the composition of the majority and chairperson, which are covered in A Programme for a Partnership Government. I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_709">I have read this Bill on a number of occasions. It is ill-considered legislation. It is badly constructed. It will not even achieve the objectives that its few promoters within the Cabinet say will be achieved. More importantly, it will have long-term negative consequences for the public. In the opinion of Fianna Fáil, this legislation will have significant detrimental consequences. First, it will damage the quality of the justice administered by our courts. Second, it will politicise the appointment of judges to an even greater extent than currently. Third, it will establish an unnecessary and costly quango that will overcomplicate what should be a simple process of recommending the 20 or 30 people suitable for judicial appointment each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> I wish to deal with each of these points in turn, starting with why Fianna Fáil believes that this legislation will damage the administration of justice. The Minister and I will agree that the administration of justice is an important role played by the courts under our Constitution. Under Article 34, justice is to be "administered in courts established by law by Judges appointed" under the Constitution and "administered in public". Every day of the week throughout the country, people can go to the Circuit Court, District Court or High Court and see judges, and sometimes juries, adjudicating on disputes between private citizens or prosecutions by the State against individuals. The variety of work that appears before our courts is considerable. It involves disputes between private individuals, criminal prosecutions where we sometimes have the benefit of juries adjudicating on cases, public law issues and, most importantly, claims brought by citizens of this country and others who claim that their rights under the Constitution have been infringed, sometimes by the Government, sometimes by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> Hearings on these disputes are conducted by judges who have been appointed under our Constitution. For them to adjudicate on them, judges must have a knowledge not just of the statute law that we make in these Houses but also of the Constitution, which is the bedrock of our legal system. They must have a knowledge of the common law. Due to our history, we reside in a common law country where judge-made law forms part of our legal system. It is for this reason in particular that the job of being a judge is one that requires significant expertise. It is not a job that can just be conducted by any person who thinks that he or she can do it based on a belief of what is right and wrong. The law in this country is made by these Houses. It is also present from our Constitution. It is the function of judges and our courts to apply that law. To do so, they must have a knowledge of and expertise in the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> Like many Deputies, the Minister would not question the importance and significance of the role our Judiciary plays. It has been one of the country's successes since Independence. Since that time, we have been able to establish an independent judicial system, one that stands up against tyranny, whether it be by our elected individuals or Government, and protects the rights of the citizen under the Constitution. Courts are respected because they are independent of the Government and are seen to be fair and impartial. That is a notable achievement, given that most disputes that reach court and a judge are adversarial in nature. In court disputes, there is generally a winner and a loser, so it is a notable success that the public at large has confidence in our judicial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> Our courts are respected for their impartiality because of the role played by judges once they are appointed. Irrespective of their backgrounds, once they take the oath of office, they recognise that their responsibility is to adjudicate on cases fairly and impartially.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware that it is unusual for there to be political controversy in respect of a judicial appointment. It does not happen, and it is good that it does not happen. In recent history, it has only happened on two occasions, the first of which was 23 years ago. As a result of that controversy, the Oireachtas decided that the law in respect of judicial appointments should be changed and the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 was introduced. It was recognised by everyone in the House, and I assume it still is, that it was the role of the Government to nominate individuals for appointment as judges by the President. There is a great advantage in having Government responsibility for those nominations and subsequent appointments, in that, if people are found to have been inappropriately appointed, the Government is democratically accountable, not just to this House, but to the public, and can be held accountable at a future election.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> In many of the functions it carries out, the Government requires assistance and recommendations from people of expertise. The Government cannot be expected to make decisions without being given advice on them. As a result, the law was changed 22 years ago to establish the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, the function of which was to give advice to the Government and recommend to it individuals who were suitable and qualified for appointment to judicial office. The power to appoint and nominate still remained with the Government, but it was an important signal that a statutory body was being put in place that would be able to assess which candidates were suitable for appointment to judicial office.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> In 1995, the Oireachtas decided that the JAAB should comprise a number of judges, a number of lay people, an Attorney General and representatives of the legal profession. Currently, the JAAB has 11 members. Of those, five are members of the Judiciary, namely, the presidents of the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court and Court of Appeal and the Chief Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">There are also three lay members, an Attorney General representing Government, and two representatives of the legal profession. That balance was agreed to by this House in 1995 because it was recognised that there was a significant benefit in having the advice of judges when it came to recommending individuals for appointment to judicial office. It was also recognised that no one constituency wanted to be given a majority. It was required that there would not be a majority of judges on that board. There were five. It was four at the time they were appointed, but at present there are five out of 11 members. There are two members of the legal profession. There is one member of Government, the Attorney General, and there are three lay members who have an invaluable part in such processes and procedures due to their experience outside of the field of law. There was a benefit to that, which was why this House agreed to it back in 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> One of the most negative consequences of this debate to date has been the association of judges with members of the legal profession. It is completely unfair to present judges as being part of the legal profession. I know the Minister, Deputy Ross, has sought to present this to be the case on an ongoing basis. It would equally be very unfair of me to turn around and start referring to the Minister as a member of the stockbroking profession. He is not any longer. He was in the past but being so in the past does not mean he is at present. </p>

          <p eId="para_720">Similarly, it is wrong and inappropriate to refer to judges as members of the legal profession. They are not. They are people appointed to office under our Constitution, similar to the offices of the Ministers opposite, except that they take an oath of office to abide by the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> The proposal contained within the legislation being considered this evening is to change the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. We are going to set up a new commission. I wish to look at the grounds on which I state this will damage the administration of justice. Under the new proposals, there will no longer be an advisory board of 11 members. Instead there will be an advisory body of 13. Those 13 members will be made up of three members of the Judiciary, down from five; seven lay people, up from three; and we will still retain the Attorney General and the two representatives of the legal profession. </p>
          <p eId="para_722"> The question I have asked repeatedly, and which has repeatedly failed to receive an answer, is what is the public benefit in reducing the involvement of members of the Judiciary on this board? What is the public benefit of increasing the number of lay members involved in this board to seven? I have asked this repeatedly and I have never received an answer. The Taoiseach referred today to the Medical Council and a number of regulatory bodies having lay majorities. He is absolutely correct. Of course if there is going to be a regulatory or supervisory body which will supervise or regulate a profession it should have a majority of lay members. Most professions apply that at present. This is not a regulatory or supervisory body, however. This is an advisory body. It is put there to assist the Government in identifying the most suitable persons for judicial office. It is there to assist in what I assume is the agreed objective of everyone, that is, to try to get the most suitable and best qualified candidates to apply for judicial office. </p>
          <p eId="para_723"> The Minister, Deputy Ross, has stated that the objective of this change - the reduction in the number of judges and the increase in the number of lay members - is to depoliticise the appointments of judges in order that they are not misused by parties in government to favour political friends. At the outset, I fully agree with that objective. It has been the case in the past that individuals have been appointed to judicial office because of their political connections. It has been the case in the past that individuals have been overlooked because they have not had political associations. That problem, however, has been exaggerated. When one looks at the performance of the Irish Judiciary it is simply dishonest to say that it is a body which has been infiltrated and infected by an excess of party politics. </p>
          <p eId="para_724"> As I said, I agree with the objective, but let us look at the method of achieving this objective. In order to get rid of party politics from the appointment process, the Government suggests that we reduce judicial involvement and that we increase lay participation on this advisory board. The real problem in respect of overly political appointments arises at the Cabinet table. We know that from recent events. It is not a problem with the JAAB. It is a problem with what happens at the Cabinet table when individuals try to turn a blind eye, to promote their friends or to be asleep when important events take place. </p>
          <p eId="para_725"> It is simply wrong for the Government to suggest that to resolve the problem of too much politicisation in the appointment of judges, we need to remove the influence of judges on the advisory board. Does anyone in this House actually think that the Chief Justice or the President of the Court of Appeal, the High Court or the Circuit and District courts have as their objective the recruitment of their party political friends? It is an insult to the Judiciary to say that this legislation is required to depoliticise the appointment of judges. I often think that the role of the president of a court is similar to the role of a school principal. When it comes to the recruitment of a new teacher, all a school principal will want is to make sure that the person hired is hard-working, fair and will do a day's work. I believe that is also the objective of Presidents of the High Court. They have no interest in having party hacks or friends appointed. They want people who are hard-working and who are appointed fairly. One point that has been overlooked is that, if one looks at the proposal being put forward by the Government, by establishing an advisory board which maintains the presence of the Attorney General the Government is ensuring the continued involvement of its interests in the advisory process.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> Unfortunately, the argument being used to a large extent in this debate is why would there be opposition to lay people being on a board? It sounds as though it is very transparent, modern and something that this new Government would want to advance. I need to explain there are consequences and a downside to this. This process will result in many unsuitable people being recommended for appointment to judicial office. The advantage of having a judge on advisory boards is that judges are aware, first of all, of the nature of the work which judges carry out in their courts. Second, judges are aware which of the lawyers who appear in front of them would make good judges. Not every good lawyer makes a good judge, but to be a good judge one has to be a good lawyer. The difference in being appointed a judge is that every person who will or has been appointed has a career as either a barrister or a solicitor behind them. Their role in those jobs gives a fairly good insight into what type of judge they will be. If we now have a situation where the advisory board is dominated by individuals who will look at candidates based on paper-based assessment, I do not think they will bring the same insight, knowledge and experience to the board that judges have. We want to ensure that people are appointed who are open-minded, fair, even, balanced and who do not believe a garda just because he is a garda but who decide cases on the basis of the evidence. My fear is that we are now moving to a situation in which we will have a process that is very much paper and interview based. I know many people who would look like they would make excellent judges on paper but would be a disaster if appointed. </p>
          <p eId="para_727"> Another ground upon which I believe this will not only damage the administration of justice but the authority of the Judiciary is the fact that this legislation requires the Chief Justice to sit on a committee while not chairing it. Could a situation be imagined in which a Member of this House suggested that the Taoiseach be on a Government committee but not chair it? There would be outrage expressed, not just by the Taoiseach's own party in government, but by all Members of this House. That is in effect what the Government is not asking but telling the Chief Justice to do. It is telling her to sit on that committee but that she will not chair it and that she must listen to and be instructed by the chairman of that committee. That is really insulting to the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> I could go on for a long time but I wish to get to my second and third points.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> My second point is that it will politicise the appointment of judges. The individuals who wish to apply for lay membership of the judicial appointments commission board will, in my opinion, be individuals with their own political agenda. We know that many people in this country have agendas and believe that the Judiciary is not strong enough on crime or is too harsh on crime. We know of people in this country who have agendas in respect of whether they are members of the pro-life lobby or the pro-choice lobby. We know some people believe we should have individuals on the board who are representative of victims of miscarriage of justice. All these arguments will have the effect that individuals with political agendas will apply and in my opinion will be able to get onto this judicial appointments commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> There will be seven lay members. Former judges are excluded from applying to be members. So we are telling people such as Catherine McGuinness or other distinguished former judges, who would make excellent persons when it comes to advising as to who would be good judges that they should not and cannot apply as they are not wanted. The answer to the question as to why they cannot apply is they were judges and are contaminated. It is deeply offensive to retired judges who have served this country well over the years. I would have liked to have spent more time on that second point.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> My final point is that the previous Government came to power in 2011 telling us that it was going to abolish quangos. One of the most straightforward jobs that exists in a statutory scheme is membership of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. About 20 people a year are nominated to judicial office. The board meets informally. It has a secretary. The members of the board meet in an office, they look at the applications and they apply names.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Under this legislation we will have not just a judicial appointments commission, but we will have the judicial appointments commission office and the judicial appointments commission director. There will be a mini-empire staffed by individuals who will spend lots of public money on trying to identify the best way for them to spend the public money on trying to identify people suitable for appointment. It is an astonishing waste of money and is wholly unnecessary. We are talking about recommending individuals based on curricula vitae that are submitted for about 20 jobs a year. It can be done very cheaply. It is at present being done very cheaply. Instead we are creating an enormous and unnecessary quango.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> This is really bad legislation. Fianna Fáil will be opposing the legislation because we believe it is bad for the administration of justice and bad for the Irish public. It has not been carefully thought out. It is being promoted by one or two members of Government who really do not know what they are talking about.</p>

        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_439">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_734">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. As has been previously outlined, we will support its passage to Committee Stage. However, we are conscious of the criticisms of this Bill, and I wish to address them in this contribution and outline the rationale for supporting the Bill at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> While we are in favour of this Bill, it is not unqualified support. We agree with Members of the House who have criticised the way in which the Bill has been handled. Confidence in the justice system is contingent on a judiciary which is free from political control or political or other bias. Not only must society have a judiciary that is free from bias, but it must also be free from the appearance of bias. It is essential that we have an independent and impartial judiciary that is representative of the community it serves. A truly representative judiciary would enhance confidence in the judicial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> It is our view that future judicial appointments should be drawn from a wider pool of qualified candidates that is fully representative of the community in order to eradicate the corrosive and unaccountable system of patronage previously in operation. We are not here this evening to criticise members of the Judiciary - far from it. Our courts are populated by many people with great legal minds who do an excellent job on a daily basis. However, it would be naive to believe some of the commentary that has taken place surrounding the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> We are expected to believe that there is not now, nor has there ever been, any system of political patronage within this jurisdiction. We know that is absolutely not the case. We are not saying that those who are in place cannot do their jobs, but the Bill is concerned with the process of how they get there in the first place. I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan in saying that judges who take that oath are impartial and independent. However, the Bill does not deal with people who are currently judges. We are dealing with the process of appointing judges in the first place. For anyone who thinks that this is a left-wing or left-leaning view, I ask them to consider why we are discussing this in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> There must be a fair and accountable appointment process for the Judiciary which is representative of the public interest. However, there must also be fairness in respect of who gets to nominate members for appointment in the first place. As I have pointed out previously, in the appointment of judicial officeholders there should be no discrimination on any of the prohibited grounds. Indeed, there should be a policy of affirmative action to increase judicial diversity. However, it is beyond the scope of the Bill. The principle of diversity should extend to the scope of those who are lay members of the new commission. Much has been said about how lay members could not possibly be qualified to appoint members to the Judiciary. Aside from this being best international practice, I draw Members' attention to section 15 of the Bill. I will come back to that later in my contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> The Council of Europe's Venice Commission has previously recommended the election of a chairperson from among lay members of an appointments body to "bring about a balance between the necessary independence of the chair and the need to avoid possible corporatist tendencies within the council". I reiterate a European body made that recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> There are lay members of judicial appointments bodies in England and Wales, and in Scotland. This is not an abnormal proposal being put forward by the Government. Indeed the Bar Council's submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality in 2016 actually welcomed the participation of lay members in a new appointments process. Its main concern was whether the chair of the body should be a judge.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> In April of this year, Nicola Gordon was appointed as lay chairing member to the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland and the sky has not fallen in on Edinburgh to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> From listening to some of the commentary one could be forgiven for thinking any random person will have the potential to apply and be considered for lay membership of the commission, which is not the case. Section 15 clearly outlines that the Public Appointments Service will have control of the process of appointing lay members and outlines an extensive range of criteria that need to be met for this to happen. A person must not only be fit and proper but also the Public Appointments Service must have regard to their corporate governance experience, their qualifications, training and expertise, and their knowledge and experience of a range of matters set out in section 15(7), including the operation of the courts; the provision of supports to victims; human rights; equality; processes and procedures for making appointments to public office or senior positions in the public or private sectors; administration qualifications; previous board membership; and governance and professional qualities.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> Despite the protests of some Members of this House, this is not particularly radical legislation. The criteria required under section 15 ensure that a smaller group of people than originally expected will actually qualify to sit on the commission as a lay member. I share some concerns with Deputy O'Callaghan on this next point. The people who will qualify under the current criteria will in all likelihood be people who have already served on State boards, commissions and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Many of them will be political appointees and will have gained the expertise needed to apply for a position on the commission. The Public Appointments Service is impartial but it can only proceed with candidates according to the legislation that is implemented in this House. It is for that reason we in Sinn Féin have talked about broadening it out and ensuring that persons who may not be from the traditional background of having progressed through their career aided or assisted by political friends would be considered to sit on the commission on the basis of their ability.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> While this Bill is a good start in reforming the systemic problems of cronyism and nepotism that are rife in the senior echelons of Irish society, it is not the radical shake-up that Fianna Fáil make it out to be. The only reason Fianna Fáil think the Bill is radical is because it is so rare for anyone to attempt to amend even slightly the systemic privileging of a particular group of people in Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> Part 8 sets out quite comprehensively the way in which members of the board - lay and judicial - can assess merit, but merit is still the criterion for selection. That is one of the changes outlined by the Minister in his speech from the general scheme of the Bill to the published version of it. Merit is recognised as a stand-alone criterion. That is only subject to an objective that has been included on gender equality. As we all know too well from last week's discussions, the Government is not, and will continue to be not obliged to select from the list given to it. That is the constitutional position. While Fianna Fáil might want to paint the picture that the change will up-end the courts and that we will find ourselves awash with incompetents on the judicial benches, that analysis does not really tally with the reality. No concerns were expressed by Fianna Fáil or indeed Fine Gael for that matter, when it came to the quality of the associates of those parties being rewarded for their loyalty with judicial positions in the past. At least one third of the country's judges have personal or political links to political parties before they were appointed to the Bench. In his contribution Deputy O'Callaghan admitted that there are people who were appointed to the Bench because of their political connections and others were not appointed to the Bench because they did not have those political connections. I do not think it is fair of Fianna Fáil or anyone else to paint us or anyone else who supports the Bill as disrespectful to the Bench when one of the most senior judges in the State - Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, went on the record quite vocally to proclaim how appointments to the Supreme Court were "purely political"-----</p>

          <p eId="para_754">I am just quoting something that is in the public domain. He said that some people who would make excellent judges were "passed over" in favour of others who were not so well qualified. That is a real problem for the courts but, ultimately, the sign-off on appointments will still be a matter for the Government of the day. This Bill will change the procedure so that instead of receiving a list of seven candidates, a list of three will be now brought to the Government. In fact, as far back as 2013, we in Sinn Féin published a Bill with similar objectives on judicial appointments but, unfortunately, it was blocked.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> We will seek some amendments to the Bill, especially in regard to the make-up of the lay aspects of the commission itself in order to attempt to address the potential for it to be occupied by former political appointees. We also want to see commitments to ongoing training to be included in the Bill. Our continued support for the Bill will be contingent on how those amendments are received.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> It must be remembered that dealing with issues concerning appointments is only one sphere that has to be addressed. We would like to see the removal of members of the Judiciary, as well as regulation of the conduct of members of the Judiciary, addressed as a matter of urgency. We know it cannot be included in this Bill but, nevertheless, we do not want to wait for a crisis-type situation where a member of the Judiciary needs to be removed before dealing with the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> There are no ethical guidelines for judges, who are not subject to the terms of the ethics Acts or codes of conduct for officeholders. There is no requirement for judges to file a register of declarable interests. In fact, they must comply with very little other than provide a tax clearance certificate before being appointed. There is no formal complaint mechanism for the public against a judge for alleged improper conduct. Even Mrs. Justice Susan Denham has said, in public discourse, that the failure to establish a judicial council is affecting Ireland's reputation internationally and is a matter of real concern. A judicial council was first proposed 20 years ago but successive Governments failed to progress it with the urgency it deserves. Following the report of the committee on judicial conduct and ethics in 2001, the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, recommended that there should be an independent statutory based judicial council to regulate judicial conduct, ethics and remuneration. Interestingly, the panel that was suggested in that report to regulate conduct and ethics was proposed to have lay representation on it. The report was welcomed but of course it never went anywhere. It is the lack of monitoring of judicial conduct, along with how judges are appointed and removed - or not as the case may be - that feeds into the idea that the Judiciary and legal profession are somewhat untouchable.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> We believe that any legislation of this nature should be completely in line with the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, which dates from 1985, and the Bangalore draft code of judicial conduct, which was published in 2001, and we will table amendments to reflect that. We are lucky in this jurisdiction that the State is largely compliant with the UN principles, in particular in respect of the protection of judicial independence enshrined in the Constitution. Unfortunately, we are lacking when it comes to section 17 of the basic principles that stipulate:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_759">A charge or complaint made against a judge in his/her judicial and professional capacity shall be processed expeditiously and fairly under an appropriate procedure. The judge shall have the right to a fair hearing. The examination of the matter at its initial stage shall be kept confidential, unless otherwise requested by the judge.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">In reality, there are no complaints procedures in place, which adds further stress to the need for a judicial council Bill. The Judiciary is largely compliant with nearly all aspects of the Bangalore principles. However, value 1.2 of those principles states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_761">A judge shall not only be free from inappropriate connections with, and influence by, the executive and legislative branches of government, but must also appear to a reasonable observer to be free therefrom.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Unfortunately, people are aware of the political affiliations of many judges who have been appointed, which contravenes the value outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> Given the historic context of judicial appointments in the State, we support the call for a lay majority and a lay chair as that is now the norm in international contexts. While Fianna Fáil may complain about the lay chairperson, it is the Government that will have the final say on the appointments process, as per the terms of the Constitution. I am open to correction on this point, but currently only two of 15 members of the Cabinet have any legal training and neither have practised as barristers. People complain about a commission which will have a lay majority, whose power is only to nominate individuals to be decided upon by the Cabinet, and the reason for the objection is that they may not necessarily have the expertise to decide who will make a good judge, yet we have a Cabinet with virtually no legal experience that will appoint those individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">When the Cabinet has responsibility for making the decisions, the latter is a bit hypocritical as an argument for opposing lay membership. The Cabinet does not even have to decide on the recommendations of the commission. It can go with its own individual. Considering that there is very little legal experience there, it highlights the inadequacies of the current situation. It is unlikely that Fianna Fáil went through the qualifications of the current Cabinet members before discussing this, but I did.

          <p eId="para_769"> We also welcome the move to prohibit in law the lobbying of public representatives by potential candidates for the Judiciary. This is a very welcome move.

We are not convinced that a requirement for independence is suitably sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> I shall now turn to the undertaking of training. It should be within the scope of the commission to recommend training. This should not only be the responsibility of the president of the court in which a judge sits. A formal judicial training procedure should be developed for all levels of the Judiciary, including introductory courses and mandatory continuing professional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> Critics of the Bill say that the Judiciary is a particular type of profession and that no one from any other walk of life could possibly be qualified to make recommendations for appointment to it. I do not subscribe to this analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> I shall conclude. We welcome the Bill, even though it is not the radical reform and attempt at modernisation that we have been led to believe. It is a very minor item of legislation in the context of radically overhauling how people are nominated for appointment. It will not have the implications for the administration of justice that Fianna Fáil tries to tell us. I was interested to hear Deputy O'Callaghan say that people who sit on the commission will need to nominate individuals who are going to be open-minded and fair and who will respect the independence of judges. This was one of the reasons put forward for not having a lay membership. I do not believe that is fair.</p>

I shall begin by saying, truthfully and honestly, that I have huge regard and respect for the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.

I do not believe this Bill would be advocated by Fine Gael in any other circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> It does not go unnoticed that the party of Collins and Cosgrave is being assisted in this endeavour by another party for which - if I put it at its kindest - the concept of the courts would not always have passed constitutional muster in the past.</p>

          <p eId="para_782">It is recognised by everybody in this House, and everybody outside, that the chief architect of the Bill is the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. The Minister does not come to too many debates here and his presence tonight underscores his proprietorial role in respect of this legislation. In fairness, he has openly set this out as his prime, if not only, objective in office from the outset of this Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> The Minister, Deputy Ross, has spoken and written on these issues before. He co-wrote a book called <i>The Untouchables. </i>I understand that the title is borrowed from the autobiography of Eliot Ness, the US federal agent who took on Al Capone in Prohibition-era Chicago. I know there has been public disquiet about politicians using their positions in the House to make disparaging comparisons between named individuals but I do not believe it would be controversial - not even with the Minister - to say that Shane Ross is no Eliot Ness. In the Brian De Palma film "The Untouchables", the protagonists carried sawn-off shotguns. The Minister, Deputy Ross, still favours the old-fashioned blunderbuss. In his blunderbuss assault on official Ireland, insiders and cronyism, he devoted a chapter of his book to judges. In truth, that is the only reason we are here today debating this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> The Minister wrote another chapter about senior civil servants. He wrote about how mandarins remained in their posts, or were even promoted, post-crash, how they always looked after each other and so on. What does the Minister now propose? Effectively, he proposes that in order to reform the Judiciary, judges should in future be appointed on the advice of a majority of individuals selected, not short-listed, by the Public Appointments Service, PAS.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> There has been much comment on how the Bill will reduce both political and judicial input into appointments but there has been very little attention at all given to what will substitute for that political and judicial input. I yield to no one in the House in my admiration for the Civil Service. I worked constructively with the PAS in my years as the Minister with responsibility for the public service and its reform. The PAS has undoubtedly contributed to the modernisation and development of the Civil Service in recent years. That is not to say, however, that the Civil Service has no faults. It has a unique hierarchical structure and management style. It has, still, an ingrained silo mentality. The senior Civil Service is at its best when promoting and defending the State, its agencies and their interests. Equally, it is at its most intransigent when resisting any proposals for change that might impact on its own sphere of influence. The Civil Service still shelters Departments and organisations that work in their own best interests, which they identify - often inappropriately - as the interests of the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> In our rush to depoliticise the judicial appointments process, we are being asked to put a very significant part of that process - the decision makers - into the hands of a body consisting of five senior career civil or public servants, including two departmental assistant secretaries general, plus the former chair of the Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland and three personnel consultants.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I do not see why the senior Civil Service should have any role in appointing judges, even at the remove of appointing those who will, in effect, make the appointments. Everyone in management knows that if one cannot make the appointment oneself, the next best thing is to be able to appoint those who will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> We need to be realistic about two things. First, the State in its various guises is by far the biggest consumer of judicial services. While politicians come and go, the senior civil servants who comprise the permanent administration are at the receiving end of adverse judgments and rebukes in our courts on a daily basis. Appointments are overturned, schemes are upset and spending plans are thrown into disarray by specific court decisions. Those who think politicians are sometimes inappropriate in their comments should hear what civil servants sometimes have to say about judges. Second, the major differences on the Bench are not between judges appointed by different Governments. I have been around for a long time. We all know there is no pattern of Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil judges defending their respective teams. I defy anyone to tell me there is such a pattern. There is no major difference on the Bench between those of a liberal or conservative disposition. Some differences might be noticed, but it is not a pattern. Our system is not like the American one, in which a Supreme Court with a conservative or liberal disposition can be created. That has never been the pattern here, regardless of the former political associations of judges. The major difference are between judges who are disposed to toeing the line and those who are not and between judges who know their place from the perspective of the executive branch of government and those who do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> Judges have two basic tasks. First, they must do justice in disputes between individuals. This point was very well made by Deputy O'Callaghan. Second, and perhaps more important, they must curtail the power of the State and its agencies by confining public bodies to the rule of law. In short, they are required to bell the cat. Judges retain such a high degree of public confidence among our national institutions because they take on other institutions in the interests of the man and woman in the street. The interests of the permanent administration are not always the same as the public interest. The Civil Service is the cat that judges are sometimes required to bell. We should not be surprised if the cat objects. There is a northside-southside divide on this issue. On this side of the river, many people in the administration do not like judges who rock the boat. I suggest that in the interests of justice, the boat needs to be rocked every so often. That is one part of the reason I do not believe senior civil servants who have been hand-picked to shape our future Civil Service should have the same sort of say - in fact, an even greater say - in shaping our Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The real concept of institutional bias is much more relevant than the notion of cronyism which has been suggested by the Minister, Deputy Ross, and which I discount. I do not believe people whose professional careers are devoted to the agencies of the State should have a major say in determining who gets to choose who sits on the judges' benches in the future. While the Government might have a right to go outside the recommendations in appointing a judge under this proposal, it will have no discretion in appointing the PAS nominees for this advisory role. The legislation provides quite specifically that PAS will determine who will be on the selecting panel for judges. The senior officials at the top of the Civil Service already have a major say in appointing their own successors through the top level appointments committee. I note that one of the objectives of this Bill is to secure diversity among members of the Judiciary. I do not believe the structures being proposed will achieve that objective. If there is to be diversity within the Judiciary, there must be diversity within the Bar. My experience in recent times is that there is not a great deal of such diversity. Many people will say that it has diminished, rather than increased, in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> I do not think the Minister, Deputy Ross, has thought through or explained why one of his chief bugbears should be reformed by being reshaped in the image of another of his bugbears. This was not his initial proposal on this matter. When in opposition in 2013, he wanted to establish a judicial appointments council to recommend judicial candidates. He proposed that an Oireachtas committee should consider such recommendations before nominating judges. Bizarrely, he wanted the Constitution to be amended to stipulate that no judge or practising lawyer could have a role in assessing the qualifications of candidates or in recommending their suitability. He also wanted the Constitution to be amended to require the Oireachtas committee making these nominations to have a permanent Opposition majority. At that time, Deputy Ross wanted those who were to have a role in selecting judges to know nothing at all about the law or lawyers, or to have lost a general election. My colleague, Deputy Penrose, said last October that this was "daftness on stilts". He continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_792">The Minister's gadfly pesterings clearly entertained a readership in the leafy suburbs, but he has contributed nothing serious to this debate. In Opposition he was a noisy distraction. In Government he has become an empty space.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Subsequent events have reinforced the accuracy of that judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> The solution is obvious enough. In fairness, most of it was embodied in the Bill published by Deputy O'Callaghan, which we welcomed last October. A judicial appointments commission is needed to recommend and rank three individuals for each judicial vacancy based on merit. Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill also proposed that if the Government does not nominate someone from the recommended list, it must publish a reasoned written decision for not doing so. This is stronger than the current provision and I agree with it. Deputy O’Callaghan’s Bill, which the Government has not yet voted down, provides for a commission with a well-thought-out mixture of competencies. As well as the Chief Justice and the presidents of the other courts, nominees of the Citizens Information Board, the Higher Education Authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Free Legal Advice Centres, the Law Society and the Bar Council would be represented on the commission. Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill also provides for gender balance on the commission. My party and I would be more than happy to see a reform enacted along these lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> We need to consider other issues, one of which arises from the fact that a judicial career is embarked on after a career in legal practice. I fully support this feature of our system because it enhances judicial independence. Our judges are not pre-schooled before appointment. The State cannot, for financial reasons, and should not compete against the market in the pay it offers to judges. As I did when I was in government, I support the notion that we should have arrangements to allow people who are well into their legal practice to apply for and become judges. It has been suggested that an informal practice allows interested serving judges to write to the Attorney General, who in turn communicates this information to the Minister for Justice and Equality. I have not heard any commentary on is why this procedure is informal rather than formal in nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The reason is that our 1995 judicial appointments legislation does not even contemplate the possibility of serving judges canvassing the Government for promotion to vacancies in higher courts. There are very good policy reasons for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> Judicial independence is an obligation as well as a privilege. Our compact with the judges is that they must expect to serve until retirement in the posts to which they were appointed. They apply for a post and are expected to serve until retirement, rather than see it as a career path. We do not have a career-based Judiciary and we do not have a promotions-based system of advancement through the hierarchy of the courts. These are important safeguards of judicial independence. There could be nothing more destructive of independence than to create a promotion-based career path for judges, depending on how the powers-that-be think they are performing on the Bench.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> I would certainly enable an appointments commission to make recommendations and approaches. There would be nothing wrong with a commission saying directly to a serving judge, or indeed to a practitioner who had yet to apply, "We believe you should be appointed to this vacancy". I would not, however, create any avenue to enable serving judges to apply for promotion based on them selling their own record in office to the Executive and I would stipulate that even informal canvassing for promotion by a judge should automatically disqualify. The Government's current Bill proposes a rush to the opposite extreme. It proposes to make a career-minded, promotion-seeking Judiciary the norm. Specifically, it proposes that two years' service on the lowest court, the District Court, would qualify one to apply for promotion to any court up to and including the Supreme Court. I do not believe that having a Bench of District Court judges living in the hope and expectation of promotion to higher courts would do anything for judicial independence or for the quality of justice in that court.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> We do not want or need career-obsessed judges delivering their verdicts with one cautious eye on a leader board maintained by any agency of State. The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport, Deputy Ross, is engaged in the same sort of anti-elitist rhetoric as the Brexit campaigner Michael Gove, who urged voters to ignore the economists and said, "People in this country have had enough of experts". It is an attempt at a gut-appeal, conspiracy-theory argument, without any evidence to support it. It is populist bombast, pure and simple. I and my party will oppose it and we will seek instead real and sustainable reforms. I hope the Government will be open to this in the interests of the Judiciary and, more importantly, in the interests of the people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_800">I will share 20 minutes with Deputy Mick Barry. Deputy Howlin offered me a good lead-in to my opening comments by, once again, raising the spectre of populism, the evil it represents and the need to resist it at all costs. Populism is the danger we are facing, whatever it might be. "Populism" is an amorphous term if ever there was one.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> We are dealing with a problem of a judicial system dominated by a very small, self-perpetuating elite. The judicial system and the barristers are drawn from a very small pool, largely controlled by the Honorable Society of King's Inns, about which I learned a bit while chatting to somebody on the phone today. It was set up by King Henry VIII to ensure we controlled access to the Bar but also, initially, to keep Catholics out. This is the only place one can become a barrister. Judges are not exclusively barristers but they are overwhelmingly so. The honourable society is the only place that trains barristers but there is no statutory basis for it in any law made democratically by us. It literally owes its origins to Henry VIII and was set up on an exclusivist basis to ensure that a small, well-vetted elite controlled who got to be a barrister and who was kept out. They still do it and inside the Honorable Society of King's Inns there is another secret society whose members are known as "benchers". There is an inner bench and an outer bench and anyone who is made a judge automatically becomes a member of the benchers. They have secret dinners but nobody ever finds out about them, even though they are held regularly. Cherie and Tony Blair are members, incredibly, and there are other interesting people involved. In order for a person to be called to the Bar, a bencher has to sign off on it and in both the old and new systems, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and the appointments commission, I have counted five who are members of the benchers. These include the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General, who automatically becomes a member. One can be mandatorily made a member of this group, even if one does not want to be, which is quite extraordinary. It begs a serious question about the independence of the Judiciary because some judges may be junior to barristers in the benchers. They might socialise together and chat before cases but when a barrister is not a member of the benchers, there is serious potential in this secret society to corrupt the balance in the hearing of cases. The group can disbar barristers and there is no statutory basis for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> This is how the upper echelons of the legal system in this country work. I welcome the thrust of the Bill and the Minister has identified a completely unacceptable situation, namely, that one third of judges are directly connected to, and are cronies of, the political parties. Even in the past few weeks, close connections of Fine Gael have been appointed as judges. The Constitution requires that the Government appoints judges but there is a big problem with this. I find it hard to understand how people can talk about the separation of powers and the independence of the Judiciary with a straight face. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan asked how we could possibly impugn the Judiciary and the way it behaves but I think we can impugn it. We can hold its members to account and criticise decisions they make and we bloody well should.</p>

          <p eId="para_804">The Deputy implied that there is nothing wrong with political connections and that it is nonsense to suggest judges are recruited on the basis of political connections.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">I put it to him that it is complete nonsense to suggest that people who were appointed because of their connections to political parties or who, for that matter, were appointed by Governments are not in some way influenced by those who appointed or selected them. That has to have some impact and it is a worrying one.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> The whole thing needs to be shaken up. For that reason, I will support the Bill moving to Committee Stage. In principle, I like the idea of having a majority of lay representatives on the commission but a hell of a lot more than that needs to be done. We need to broaden and democratise the base of the entire legal and judicial system and stop it being an elitist club dominated by secret societies such as the benchers. We also need to bring an end to the monopoly of the King's Inns over who can become a barrister because that leads to its members having a consequently disproportionate influence. Even the new commission proposed in the Bill will have five members who are also benchers. A secret society will have influence on the new commission with regard to who will be recommended and considered to be acceptable and the right kind of person to be a judge. That is completely unacceptable and it brings to mind the expression which says there is one law for the rich and one for the poor, not just in the dispensation of the law but in how it is structured. That is how it works at every level all the way up the line. The experience of court for working class people, who make up the vast majority of our population, is in the District Court, where one goes in and industrial, production-line justice is dispensed. There are no juries. The judges of the District Court, who are all mandatory members of the society of the benchers - with its secret lunches and so on - dispense justice on the poor. However, if one is rich, one can afford to go to the higher courts. I do not know why the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is laughing. Poor people cannot access the same level of justice as rich people. That is a fact. The higher echelons of the Judiciary and barristers overwhelmingly come from private schools and better-off backgrounds and inner circle groups vet and select who gets into the higher echelons. That is the reality of what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> In terms of the simple things that need to be done, the monopoly of King's Inns should be ended. UCD, NUI Galway, Trinity College Dublin and other universities should be allowed to train judges and barristers rather than it being the remit of King's Inns and controlled by the benchers or whatever the hell they are called. That needs to end. There needs to be an end to the idea that Members cannot criticise judges or their decisions. Members should have the right to criticise judges, who should likewise have the right to criticise Members. I have no problem with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> The PAS also poses a problem, as has been mentioned by Members opposing the Bill. Who selects the civil servants in the PAS? Who are the members of the PAS or the top level appointments committee and who selects them? They are also a self-perpetuating elite. That is not a good enough way to select judges or Secretaries General.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickBarry" eId="spk_463">
          <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_809">I mentioned in last week's debate on this issue that in 2011 the <i>Irish Independent</i> surveyed 168 members of the Bench in Ireland and found that 56, or exactly one third, had what were described as personal or political connections to political parties in this State. In 2012, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly said that appointments to the Supreme Court were "purely political". In the same year, Judge Michael Pattwell said his own appointment was political.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> The Bill might make judicial appointments somewhat less nakedly partisan in party-political terms. That is progress of sorts. However, it will not tackle the issue of the very strong class bias which exists in the Judiciary and which is a major feature thereof. Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned King's Inns and went back to the days of Henry VIII in that regard. I do not intend to go back several centuries but will deal with the present. To study for one year at the King's Inns, one would have to fork out €12,560, which is a very significant sum for a year's tuition. Very few ordinary people could come within an ass's roar of affording those fees. A couple of weeks ago, it was reported that there are now 79 unemployment black spots in the State. How many children who live in those areas have the possibility of going on to become judges in this State? Will the profession continue to be stuffed full of people from more privileged areas and elitist schools? The average salary of an Irish judge is three times the average for judges in other European countries. How could they not have the outlook of a ruling elite in this society when that is their vantage point? There is an interesting detail in the Bill in terms of class, which is that judicial appointments will now be permitted, if the legislation is passed, to come from the ranks of legal academics but only those from universities, not institutes of technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> The class bias in the Judiciary is starkly shown in cases involving social struggle and social protest. All Members know the case of the Rossport five, who were jailed, and of the 20 men and women from working class communities who were imprisoned in 2003 in the course of the struggle against bin charges, as well as the multiplicity of injunctions that have been issued against trade unions and trade unionists such as in the Greyhound and Aer Lingus disputes in 2014. The class bias of the Judiciary when dealing with social protest and its tendency to overstep the mark in such cases has historically been the case, although every cloud has a silver lining. That tendency has served to raise the consciousness of working class people of the need for their independent political action and in the past has spurred on the development of new left-wing political forces. A famous example is that of the Taff Vale case in 1901 in which it was ruled that unions were liable for the loss of profits of employers in a strike situation and a penalty of £42,000, comprising a fine and court costs, was levied on the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, which had a huge politicising effect in working class communities in Britain. It showed the need to have workers' representation in parliament and was a key moment in the rise and development of what was later known as the British Labour Party. In Ireland, a very important trade dispute took place in Wexford in 1912. That was the lockout of Irish Transport and General Workers Union, ITGWU, members from the foundries in Wexford town. The forces of the State were used in a crude way against workers who were asserting their rights. There were baton charges against workers, the murder of a man named Michael O'Leary and the jailing of the leader of the strike, an ITGWU organiser named P.T. Daly. In terms of the effect that had on the consciousness of working people throughout the country, it was a key moment in the move towards the development of the Irish Labour Party, which, once upon a time, was a party for working people. The party was founded later in 1912 by James Connolly and James Larkin as the political wing of the Irish Trade Union Congress.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Those are important points to bear in mind when we are looking at a Judiciary with a class bias which will deal with social protest overstepping the mark and the effect that it has on the consciousness of large numbers of ordinary people. </p>
          <p eId="para_813"> If this Bill is passed, the party political bias in the Judiciary may be somewhat lessened, which is a minor step forward, but the class bias will remain. The song will remain the same on that front, and it is an issue that the labour movement, the working class movement and the left movement as it develops will have to deal with in a concrete fashion in the years ahead.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_814">There is no doubt that this is a very complex, intricate area, and listening to the variety of opinion in this House endorses that fact. This variety of opinion suggests that there should be more of an opportunity to debate this issue. I do not agree with how it is being rushed at the moment. The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has been ridden roughshod over and it leaves much to be desired. The manner in which Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill was dealt with by not giving it the money message, and the way Deputy Daly's Coroners Bill has been sidelined in order to rush this through, is not acceptable. There is a better way of doing things, and it is disappointing that the Government is not approaching this in a different way.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> Judicial reform is required, but we could have approached the issue in a better way. In terms of what we could do, we should take a glance across the water at Scotland, England and Wales. The judicial appointments board in Scotland has a very comprehensive list of criteria to cover the notion of merit. A judge must have a good knowledge of the law and show skills and competence in the interpretation and application of the law; a thorough understanding of the theory and principles on which the law is based and an ability to analyse and explore legal problems creatively and imaginatively; excellent skills in an interpretative analysis of case law and statute law; excellent skills in identifying issues of fact and law; excellent skills in applying the relevant law to relevant fact; the personal characteristics of integrity, independence of mind and moral courage, fairness and impartiality; common sense; an understanding of people and society; a responsible attitude and sound temperament; courtesy and consideration; an ability to command respect and resilience; and be able to demonstrate a range of case management skills and communication skills. There are 17 criteria used to assess merit. It is a daunting challenge to meet all the criteria, but I wonder what sort of guidelines are to be used if this process comes into play here. </p>
          <p eId="para_816"> The Minister said that three nominees instead of seven is in line with best international practice. I point out that in Scotland, England and Wales they recommend one nominee. Reducing the number of nominees would make the selection process more independent and would have potential in terms of combating the influence of the Government party of the day. Previously, we had a situation where the Government received seven names from the board and even if the highest standards of selection on the basis of merit were adhered to, the Government could still select one of its own supporters from those names. Where are the terms of reference for the Minister for making the selection of the three names? Are we assuming that the Minister will have the wherewithal to make that selection? Even if the Minister has the wherewithal at this moment, how are we to know that in years to come he or she will have the capacity to make the proper decision?</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> The recent controversy over the appointment of Ms Justice Máire Whelan shows that the real problem of patronage lies in Cabinet rather than with the Judiciary, as Deputy O'Callaghan pointed out earlier. How can the Government pretend to remove political patronage from judicial appointments if it will not empower this new reforming body to make the real decisions on these appointments? By putting one nominee forward instead of three, it would reduce the powers of politicians over it, and the Government would have the option of refusing to accept the single nominee and asking the body to provide another. </p>
          <p eId="para_818"> There is much discussion about removing the influence of politicians in certain areas. The Police Authority is a very good example. It was said that this would de-politicise policing, but in fact the end result was that the Policing Authority, as has been proven in the past six months, is a creature of Government still and lacks the real independence that we hoped it would be given. </p>
          <p eId="para_819"> The terms for conducting the selection process for lay persons could be made more prescriptive. At present, the guidance is that the Public Appointments Service shall have regard to the desirability that the lay members of the commission will, among them, possess knowledge of and professional experience in as many as possible of the matter specified in subsection 7, this subsection being a well worded and comprehensive list of areas of knowledge of the law. At present, the position open for the lay members of the committee reads like a Jack-of-all-trades job description. Potentially someone may do this as they have been doing nothing else. If this is to be done properly, the structures and resources need to be put in place to ensure that the right people with the right expertise get the job, and that they will be vetted in such a manner that stands up to scrutiny down the line and that ensures that they can be removed. It is very important that a process is put in place where people can be removed from the board. We have a long history of the proliferation of State boards and bodies and a notable shortage of good people interested in these positions. We do not seem to have a sufficient pool of suitably qualified people, and we need to ensure that the proper resources are available to the Public Appointments Service for this very important task. </p>
          <p eId="para_820"> The England and Wales commissions were established in 2005. Both commissions put forward only one name to the justice Minister, who invariably approves the recommendation or provides a reasoned request that a new process of appointment be engaged in. To protect further against any abuse of the process, parliament legislated for a judicial appointments and conduct ombudsman, responsible for auditing any complaints about the appointments process. There is no such appeals process in this current legislation, and this is complicated by the fact that the Minister ultimately makes the final selection of the three nominees put forward, which arguably means there is still too much political influence. The appointment of a lay person as chair of the commission is a positive development and has been welcomed by many in the legal profession, in particular, solicitors. They see this as an opportunity to break the monopoly of the Bar Council of Ireland. There are approximately 10,000 solicitors in the country and 1,500 barristers, but barristers make up 80% of the judges in the superior courts. Solicitors will see the lay chair as an opportunity to break that mould to some extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> The fact that the only courts present on the commission are superior courts - the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court - means that it is not fully representative of the judicial profession given that it is the District and Circuit Courts which deal with the vast bulk of cases and where most judicial vacancies arise. As such, I propose that the Presidents of the District and Circuit Courts be added to the membership of the commission. If this ends up giving a slight majority to the legal professionals, it could be seen as a compromise for introducing the lay chair. It should be open for discussion. </p>
          <p eId="para_822"> The Bill is a step in the right direction, but if the aim of the Bill is to remove political patronage, or the perception of political patronage, from the judicial appointments process then it fails miserably.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The fact that the Attorney General will sit on the judicial appointments commission and at the Cabinet table means that he or she has a role in every stage of the judicial selection process in the recommendation and appointment of judges. This completely undermines the independence of the commission. Furthermore, as the Incorporated Law Society points out, the Attorney General's role as a major purchaser of legal services in the State raises serious questions about conflict of interest. </p>
          <p eId="para_824"> There has been a breakdown of trust in the State in recent years and this and the previous Governments have presided over the big sell off of Irish land and property to vulture funds. The impact of this on how we supply housing in this country, on affordability and the rental market is very dramatic. It is very unfortunate that it was not better managed. Likewise, the Government is propping up a Garda Commissioner who has long proved unfit for purpose. The perception of political party patronage is damaging to the legitimacy of a democracy. The Government should be doing its best to remove this and the first step would be to make this body independent by removing the Attorney General, empowering it to make its own decisions and further reduce the influence of the government of the day on the decision making process.</p>

          <p eId="para_825">I read with interest yesterday the Minister's commentary on populist politicians, and his tut-tutting that the State could not withstand the modern penchant for jettisoning rules of due process for short-term political gain. I have to hand it to him - he has some neck to say something like that and to come in here with something that is probably the worst example of a political soap opera played out at the expense of the common good, whose consequences will go way beyond the Minister's scheming at Cabinet table. The issues are far too important to be used in this way. It is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> We do not need this Bill. We already have a judicial appointments Bill that has just gone through Second Stage in this House with cross-party support. I am sick of talking about judicial appointments. We have dealt with Second Stage and pre-legislative scrutiny, and my office did mountains of work to prepare amendments to Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill, which was pulled at the eleventh hour because there was no money message. Now, on the eve of the Dáil's summer recess, any amount of time is being given to dealing with this Bill although the courts will be going on holiday in a few weeks' time, and after the Government makes appointments to the High Court and Circuit Court, in some instances for vacancies that will not arise until later this year. It is an absolute joke. The only conclusion to be drawn is that it is being done to offset the damage caused by the botched handling of the appointment of former Attorney General to the Court of Appeal. We have a responsibility to ask at what price. Undoubtedly, if this process continues to be rushed in this manner, it will undermine confidence among the Judiciary and the public. More than that, Deputy Wallace is correct. I saw the Minister making gestures but he knows that the Tánaiste approved the prioritisation of the movement of the Coroners' Bill through Cabinet. The Minister sent me a letter saying that he supported it. The Department of Justice and Equality was told to work with us to have that Bill published two weeks ago. It needed to be so as to pass through all Stages prior to the summer recess. I hope to God no woman loses her life in our maternity services in July, August or September, leaving her family to fight the Health Service Executive, HSE, for an inquest. That was a priority of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and it is being sacrificed because the officials were used to draft this Bill. That is not good enough. It is debasing a worthy objective and judicial reform. The manner in which it is being handled has undermined the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> We have already tabled amendments to Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill to the effect that there should be a lay chairperson and membership of the judicial appointments commission so we support that position. Like Deputy Wallace, however, I raise my eyebrows at the presence of the Attorney General on this body. I do not see any particular expertise the Attorney General could have. At least in the initial stages the judges on this body will come through a political patronage system. There are political differences emerging in the debate which are worth teasing out. Having a lay majority on the judicial appointments commission is not a question of one in the eye for the Judiciary or the legal profession. It is about a particular view one has of what the Judiciary is. People with a legal background see the appointment of judges as a career move within the system so understandably they believe it should be controlled by their expert peers. That makes sense. Ordinary citizens, however, view things quite differently. They see the role as a social one, acting in the interests of society and the administration of justice, adherence to the legal profession being a secondary consideration. On that basis, it makes sense for judges to be appointed from the society they represent and being alive to its needs. That is critical. Having equal representation on the appointment commission is the best way forward to give both sides their due.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> Section 15 of this Bill deals with the experience that the people to be appointed as lay members of the commission will need to demonstrate. Under the initial heads of the Bill, that experience was to be in voluntary, community or social affairs but that has been axed and replaced with expertise and experience in commerce, finance or administration. I am shocked. What in God's name does experience in commerce or finance have to do with the appointment of judges? It is far more important to have people on the appointments commission with experience on the ground, people who deal with communities, members of which are likely to appear before the courts and which are ravaged by criminal activity, who understand the issues that lead people to have a conflict or end up before the courts. That is a really retrograde step. Another retrograde step is the removal of the provision in the original heads that the membership of the commission should be gender balanced and reflect social diversity. That has disappeared. Given the experience of women in some of our courts that should be reinstated.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> The proposed senior judicial appointments advisory committee is a joke. It is made up of the Chief Justice, the Attorney General, the chairperson and perhaps also - the language is not clear - the Minister. Section 23 of Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill, dealing with senior appointments, was far more sensible than the suggestion presented here because it empowered the commission to make a recommendation to the Government for such senior appointments to be based on merit, in other words on the same principle of all of the judicial appointments. The make-up of this senior judicial appointments advisory committee is too political. It is unnecessary. It sidelines the commission from the important appointments and there is no clear reason that the commission cannot perform this function and that the Minister has to get involved at all. They are fatal flaws.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> I am, however, sympathetically inclined toward those who contributed to the debate saying that in many ways this is a false debate, that it has been hyped up and is much ado about nothing. The key problem for citizens is not judicial appointments, but their ability to access and achieve justice in this State. That task is far bigger than judicial appointments. I am broadly sympathetic to those who say there are some outstanding individuals who serve the Judiciary remarkably well. I go to court quite often and on many occasions I am absolutely gobsmacked by the calibre, which is very impressive. When it goes wrong, and those judges are not up to scratch, it goes very very wrong and there is absolutely nothing in place to deal with those individuals. There is a far more urgent need to legislate for a judicial council than for this commission. It is not good enough that we are rushing this through. It has been on the cards for a long time. It is an open secret that there is a judge in the District Court who, realising the shortage of judges who could speak Irish, put himself forward on that basis although he did not have a word of Irish.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">He got the job on that basis and once he was in it, having lied to get it, there was nothing they could do. He was still there. Terrible things are going on in the family law courts behind the scenes, with lives being destroyed without any proper scrutiny or legislation. We need an urgent intervention and oversight of our courts system. I am desperate to see judicial reform, but it must be proper and comprehensive. In its current form, this Bill is definitely not that. We are doing a disservice to those good members of the Judiciary, the public and those citizens who will come before our courts if we use this issue to make political capital and a political gain. The issues are far more important than that. I do not want to be part of something that debases a very important objective in this way. It leaves a great deal to be desired.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_833">I thank the Ceann Comhairle. I was in my office and had to endure listening to a certain individual across the House using his time to castigate and try to put down the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross. I did not like it but the Minister is well able to rise above that type of activity. I do not agree with it and I do not like to see it being done to any Member. I must also say a word to my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett. I was not impressed either to hear him castigate the King's Inns as some sort of elitist model, which it most certainly is not. If he knew his facts, he would know that it is a very open and transparent place with various ways for people to get in. One does not have to be an elitist to get in. It is very unfair on people from rural Ireland and around the country who educated themselves and worked hard to get into the King's Inns and came out to earn a living successfully. They are not elitists. There is nothing special about them. I will tell the Deputy what they are; they are ordinary hard workers. They are people who studied and were good at their books, a thing I was not good at, and they bettered themselves. To condemn those people as elitist is unfair, but it is the Deputy's own opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> Before I address the Bill itself, I note that I have nothing but respect for and confidence in the abilities of all the judges in this country, be they on the District, Circuit, High, Court of Appeal or Supreme Courts. They are all extremely hard working and highly intelligent individuals with a difficult and challenging job to do. They often give up lucrative private practices at the Bar or as solicitors to serve the State and administer justice in a fair and proper manner. Let me put it like this - rather them than me. The question of how judicial appointments are made is very important and directly relevant to every citizen. The independence of the Judiciary is vital and every person, or poor misfortunate as I see them, who has to appear before the courts must be satisfied and safe in the knowledge that the law of the land will be applied in a competent and impartial manner without fear or favour. It is clear that concerns have been raised in the past about the way in which judicial appointments have been made. That should definitely not be seen as casting any aspersion or doubt over the integrity and capabilities of the people who have been appointed and have served or are currently serving as judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> The time may have come to review the way in which appointments are made. I have no difficulty with changes being brought forward. In particular, it is vitally important to ensure that the whole process of judicial appointments is carried out in an open and transparent manner so that the public at large can have confidence in the system and be sure that the best man or woman is chosen for the job. While the Bill itself has many positive aspects, the biggest difficulty I have with it is the composition of the proposed commission. What is proposed here is that there will be a lay majority and a lay chairperson. While, of course, there should be some lay persons on the commission, when it comes to picking the best person for a job, who can be better placed to do that than the people who are already doing the job? What we need are people who know exactly what the job entails and who can properly test each potential candidate’s ability to do the job. I do not know of any other job application process where the majority of the persons involved in the appointment process are not directly involved in the area to which the appointment is to be made. The phrase "horses for courses", with all that entails, comes to mind. Not to be smart about it, but the question must be asked as to how the lay persons are to be selected and vetted. While the Bill envisages some form of selection process by the Public Appointments Service, how can the public be sure that these lay people will have the expertise necessary to choose the best person for the job and to choose the person who may be sitting in judgment on them the following week?</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> I am particularly concerned to hear that it is proposed that no member of the District Court or Circuit Court will be appointed as a member of the commission itself. Those courts deal with a large majority of the cases coming before the courts on a day-to-day basis and they have the real knowledge of what it means and, more importantly, what it takes to be a judge. I see it in my own constituency in Kerry where the District and Circuit Court judges are at the real coalface of the administration of justice and deal with very large volumes of cases on a daily basis. I have huge respect for the work they do in very difficult circumstances to adjudicate in all types of family situations and misfortune. On the positive side, I welcome those parts of the Bill which set out the requisite skills, attributes and capabilities necessary for appointment and which will form part of the selection process. I also welcome the fact that all appointments will be based on merit. I have no difficulty with those parts of the Bill which prohibit the canvassing of support for an application or any form of interference by any person involved in the process. The Bill proposes that only three names will go forward to the Government as prospective candidates for a vacancy, which also makes great sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> There is nothing as important as the fair administration of justice in this country. I want to ensure that the existing public confidence in our Judiciary is maintained. While there are some positive aspects of the legislation, I have come to the conclusion that this Bill falls short in a number of important areas. Unfortunately, I cannot support it as it currently stands although I welcome the fact that it has been brought forward and appreciate the work the Minister, Deputy Ross, has done on it. It is the usual case of something being rushed through in a panic to deal with a recent crisis and it is another clear case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. In the past few days, the Chief Justice and some of the most senior judges in the country have made public their concerns about certain sections of the Bill. We have to listen to them. In general, judges are very reluctant to make any public comment or become involved in any controversy. It is my humble opinion that the very fact that they have felt the need to voice their concerns publicly in this way means they should be listened to and their concerns should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> As I understand it, there are approximately ten to 12 judicial appointments each year. There are far more pressing matters that we need to address as a matter of urgency in our country. For example, we need to assist the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to reduce the number of people, particularly children, who are without a home and the waves of people who are on our social housing lists, including over 5,000 in County Kerry. The health system was never in such a state, notwithstanding the amount of money being pumped into it on a weekly basis. People continue to go blind while they wait to have cataracts removed. The effects Brexit is going to have on this country are still not fully understood. We are having meeting after meeting on Brexit, but no one can clarify the impact it will have on our farming communities, tourism, trade and the movement of people to and from the State. Our infrastructure is light years behind the European average.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Perhaps we could use some of the proceeds from the sale of AIB to pay back our taxpayers for the years of suffering they have endured. </p>
          <p eId="para_840"> I am grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution on this Bill. While I do not agree with all aspects of it, at the same time that is what Dáil Éireann and Ministers are for, that is, to come forward with ideas. We do not have to agree fully with what a person might be proposing but, at the same time, we can have respect for his or her views and opinions and the work that is being diligently carried out. I do not believe it is fair or right for Members to be personally critical and to use their time here to carry out some sort of personal vendetta that they might have against an individual. I do not like that type of carry on.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_468">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_841">Like the Minister, Deputy Ross, I campaigned vigorously in the formation of the programme for Government for the introduction of some form of judicial appointments commission or reform of the Judiciary. I have to declare an interest because I have been before the courts and did not find the experience very good. I have vigorously defended the proposals for reform of how members of the Judiciary are appointed, as outlined in the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017. Notwithstanding the fact that Deputy Jim O'Callaghan brought forward his Bill, and he has more expertise on the legal profession than me, I was speaking ahead of this Bill all week because we had looked for it. Given the seriousness and the necessity of the measures being proposed in the Bill, it is vital that the Government urgently addresses its own clear divisions on this matter. It should not have taken a year and it is a pity that it is being rushed during the last two weeks. However, only for the ham-fisted way that the Government appointed the Attorney General to her new position on the Court of Appeal, this Bill would not be here at all this week. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, can smile all he likes, but that is a fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> The Minister, Deputy Ross, was clear in the programme for Government he negotiated. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, was not there, although many of his colleagues were, but when I brought it up, I was nearly thrown out of the room. It was a taboo subject and I could not go there. I was rounded on and treated like an alien who did not know what he was talking about, but I do know what I am talking about. I have visited many of the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has displayed a kind of lukewarm enthusiasm and seems reluctantly to have come round to supporting the provisions of the Bill, but what the Minister, Deputy Ross, who is the driving force behind this Bill, is attempting to do is both politically courageous and long overdue. On talk about the books he wrote, we are entitled to do whatever we like when we are outside this House. The reaction of the Judiciary, while cloaked in concerns about the separation of powers and the appropriateness of the new process, is ultimately the last gasp of an elite group who, for far too long, have been self-selecting and self-regulating. That has to change like so many other areas in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> I will not go down the road of criticising everyone that is at the Bar or in the Law Library. I never will become a lawyer but I have known for too long, while involved in politics and before it, how appointments are made. I can quote experiences here if Members want. The Judiciary is not and cannot be immune to revision and reform such as those outlined in the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. We have had too many experiences.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> We have many good and eminent judges who, up and down the country, diligently and in difficult circumstances do their jobs daily, as Deputy Healy-Rae and others have said. However, this concerns the system of appointment and regulation, and the fact that there is no assessment of their behaviour or reactions to how they are getting on. There is no critique. We are not allowed to criticise them.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> As I said when I spoke on the appointment of the former Attorney General to the Judiciary, we saw how the referendum was run for the new Court of Appeal. I opposed that, and I am glad I opposed it. There was no criteria as to how many judges would be on it, how many cases they would have to hear or how they would deal with the backlog. There is an outrageous backlog in the High Court, the Circuit Court and other places. My court case would be going on yet, ten years later, only that we got a special sitting. It was through a special sitting that I fell into the lion's nest or whatever one wants to call it. There is no accountability. We did not even set out in the referendum or the legislation that underpinned it how much the Court of Appeal would do. Can the Minister tell me how many cases have been heard? We have eminent people and legal professors challenging it every day. There is a kind of a go-slow there. I was not a fan of the former Minister, Mr. Alan Shatter, but a go-slow commenced when he seemed to be on his political crusade. Let that be where it is because we have to move on to where we are today.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> There is such a furore about having lay people on the appointments board, but there will be a lay majority. There will be three judges, seven lay persons, one Attorney General, whoever that may be, and two representatives of the legal profession. I am pleased with that. What I am not pleased with, however, is how the lay people are to be appointed. Some people suggest that they should have expertise in finance and commerce or other issues. If ordinary members of the public up and down the country are fit to be on a jury every day of the week, 300 or 350 days a year or how ever many days it is, they are well fit to be on an appointments board. Why are they not? Will we have a two-tier system? Is it that they are fit to be on a jury but not fit to have any say or role in how we appoint people who will direct a jury, throw out cases, work around cases to dismiss a jury if it does not suit - that is happening - or ill-treat a jury, as happens at times too?</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> We cannot have it every way. We have lay people. I am talking about ordinary lay people and others who are not lay people, such as professors, retired county managers or senior public servants appointed by the Public Appointments Service. I was in that bastion for two or three days appointing lay members that the Minister at the time wanted for the fisheries board. When I arrived there on the Monday morning to do the interviews - I happened to be the chairperson - I was met by a secretariat that told me they had obliged us at the weekend by reading through all the 120 applications and had picked out the top 20 for us. They gave them to us and we looked through them, but I said that we were not having it. I turned it upside down and said that we were going the other way. The 20 that were picked out were all elite, retired personnel who should have been out playing golf. They were probably playing golf when they were supposed to be working or whatever else. That is what is going on in this country. The handlebars of power are clasped by an elite and they want to keep it that way. If they end up in court, they want to ensure that they have their friends inside before them.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> There is also the picking of judges for certain cases. The Ministers can close their eyes and smile that it does not happen. My dear Minister is new to the Department of Justice and Equality and he has a lot to learn, although I know he has experience as a solicitor. Again, there is an imbalance in the number of legal people. There is only a small number - 1,500 - of eminent barristers. I have engaged some of them - there are many good ones as well - and I must thank them for making it possible for me to be here. The attempt of the exercise was to get me out of here, but it did not happen thanks to a good defence and a fair jury.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> Now the juries are not fit to be involved in the appointments process, even though they are only selecting those who are to go forward to the Cabinet in a process where the Chief Justice and the Attorney General will have a say. On the morning, the Minister will be slipped a note going in - that has been happening and it will happen the Minister too. It will be passed to him. He will be told to bring it in, that the Taoiseach wants this one and that it is Fine Gael's turn this time. The Minister, Deputy Ross, might never get one. He will never get one because he will not want to take it from them. I know that. We had an appointment made before by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, who was so scared of the Minister, Deputy Ross. He got a fair few of them appointed himself. One appointment I forgot on the last night was by my good friend up here, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and one of his former Cabinet Ministers. I think she was the only justice that he got appointed but she did not have a very good track record and she is no longer there. I will say no more. However, this is what has gone on and it has been going on under our noses. The sooner we lift up our glasses and see what is going on, the better. </p>
          <p eId="para_851"> I salute the Minister, Deputy Ross, on championing this issue. I know he has got it now by default because of the furore that happened last week. Fine Gael did not want an election. However, it is rushed legislation and there are parts of it that I am not happy with, especially how the lay people are picked. I have informed the Minister, Deputy Ross, that I will be tabling an amendment to the Bill to try to have lay people on it and not lay people when it suits them to be lay. They might have been lazy and lethargic in their jobs, but they are not lay because they are retired on pensions. They should stay retired on pensions and not be self-serving and keep the system in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> I agreed with a lot of what Deputy Howlin said about the senior Civil Service - no disrespect to the people here - and how they mind the house, mind each other, and mind the system. I sat at a press conference in Buswell's Hotel today - I did not see too many there - on the right to homes Bill. Who is protecting those people from the vulture funds? The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, said they were a great invention in Ireland. They are worse than Oliver Cromwell in Ireland and the Government is giving them the imprimatur. No one will bring in legislation to stop them. We have the right to homes Bill now, and I do not believe it is a money Bill. It may be a money Bill but we can borrow the money at a reasonable cost and bail out the ordinary people who went and tried to home themselves, but now they are going before district justices of all kinds as lay litigants.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> I have been down there. One of them was shoved in there by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, not so long ago. He would not allow representation. A women was unable to stand up after a traumatic journey and is being imprisoned. She is a mother and a grandmother. He insisted that she stand up first.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Then he insisted that she represent herself, even though she was not able to speak, not to mention stand up to make a speech. That is the kind of injustice that gives a bad impression.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> I got it into the Cabinet rooms last year. They did not want to go to this issue at all and they told me to leave it: "This is our territory; keep away from it." I may have been elected by the people of Tipperary but I was not going to change this system. I was told, "This is our system, it has served us well and it will keep serving us". On occasion, however, when it suited and when there were too many candidates for election, one or two were shoved onto the Bench and out of the way. The Minister cannot tell me that did not happen because I have evidence that it did. I have evidence and the Minister knows it. He can smile but it happened in his party too. That is what has gone on. It stinks to high heaven. The work of the good people is tarnished and diminished, the work of those who want to be in there, administering justice, which is a very important job.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> Why is a person fit to be a juror in all kinds of complicated cases except those in the Special Criminal Court? Jurors are expected to be able to understand the law and to be fair and impartial. The majority of them are and I commend and salute them, but six or seven of them could not be brought into a room apparently. I heard a retired Chief Justice this morning and was shocked by her. She said that the chairperson of the appointments board has a very important role because he or she may be able to influence the other members of the board. Therefore, the chairperson cannot be a lay person because he or she might have daft ideas about spreading the wealth, spreading the preserve and taking down this bastion that has not served the people who fought to free this country. It was meant to, but it did not. It is time this Bill was passed. There are warts and failures in it because it is rushed. Rushed legislation is bad legislation but we need the change.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> Why did the Government throw out Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill if it does not want to have anything to do with this? The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, was not in the Department of Justice and Equality then. He was in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and he helped me out with a number of issues, fair dues to him. Now he is in the hot seat. He has inherited a lot of issues and I know there were not many queuing up for his job. He is reluctantly sitting beside the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport tonight and, much as he does not like this Bill, he is putting it through the House. I salute the Independent Alliance for being in government and for being the watchdog and the guardian of the commitments that the Minister, Deputy Ross, made. Those commitments were included in the programme for Government, like many issues that we brought forward but we cannot find in the programme any more. We are trying to find them. Any time we leave a programme in the Chamber it disappears in case we read something else out of it. I support the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_858">I am sharing time with Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">This Bill has been hugely controversial primarily because the impression has been given that one element of reform, namely, a lay majority on the JAAB, will be some kind of silver bullet which will magically transform our judicial system. There is no doubt that the Judiciary has been drawn from one cohort of Irish society and that it lacks diversity. The Bill addresses just one of a number of factors that require to be addressed if we are to overhaul the antiquated ways in which our judicial system works.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> It is worth noting that the Judiciary itself has sought changes, as outlined in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in 2014.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_861">In a rare intervention, the judges - through a committee chaired by Chief Justice Susan Denham and including representatives of all court jurisdictions - are sharply critical of the "demonstrably deficient" system and say wide-ranging changes are needed to attract high calibre applicants..."It is increasingly clear that the relative success of the administration of justice in Ireland has been achieved in spite of, rather than because of the appointment system," the judges argue.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">However, I probably would disagree with Ms Justice Denham on the solution. One thing that can be guaranteed when it comes to any system reform is that there will always be resistance and that such resistance will usually come from insiders. We are not very good at creating new institutions. Our justice system is an inherited system and any reforms of many of our inherited systems have been piecemeal. We do not do radical reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> While we in the Social Democrats do not believe the Bill is perfect, it is a move towards the kind of reform that is required to bring the judicial system out into the light and make it more accessible, more diverse and ultimately more fit for purpose in a modern Ireland. That said, the Bill requires significant amendment. The emphasis on the so-called lay majority has been a misrepresentation. The Bill sets out a mechanism for a committee of 13, the majority of whom shall be lay members with a lay chair. The way things are portrayed, however, gives the impression that the lay members are just randomers who will be picked off the street. I have a problem with the way section 15 is constructed. It is definitely one of the areas that needs amending. There are people working in the Legal Aid Board, legal academics, victims' advocates and many others from all walks of life who would have expertise in dealing with, for example, the outcomes of sentencing policy and who could offer some extremely useful input. </p>
          <p eId="para_864"> With the best will in the world, simply changing the system for how judges are appointed will not change how judges administer the law or affect sentencing outcomes, for example. A few years ago I attended the Irish Penal Reform Trust's annual lecture. The focus on that particular occasion was sentencing guidelines and the work of the sentencing council. I was shocked to note how well the UK system works and how well it is resourced when compared to ours. In the UK, ongoing training is the norm in order to ensure consistency in sentencing. There are ongoing efforts in that regard which are properly resourced. The speakers went through the methodology involved which was very impressive. It is recognised in the UK that one will not get consistency unless one puts a system in place. Consistency does not happen by accident. Once a rigorous system is in place, it matters less who is sitting in the judge's chair. Judges work within a proven system, thus removing the likelihood of random, inexplicable sentences or other decisions which are open to human error. The other interesting point I took from the UK example is the make-up of its sentencing council. This is a body with a number of non-judicial members, although not a majority of lay members. All members have senior roles in the field of justice. It was the opinion of the keynote speaker, Lord Justice Colman Treacy, that the breadth of viewpoints had enhanced the work of the sentencing council and it was quite interesting to hear that. We believe that some of the same will be true of the JAAB and so we will support this Bill on Second Stage. However, we do so with a serious caveat. We do not see the Bill as a panacea for fixing a system which urgently requires greater diversity and modernisation. There are several sections that require amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> It is important to note that the Judiciary has served us well. There is no doubt that there are many examples of good decisions but there are also many examples of poor decisions. We cannot have a blanket acceptance that every decision is good. Were that the case, we would not have miscarriages of justice or appeals lodged to decisions and so forth. That said, the Judiciary has largely been good. </p>
          <p eId="para_866"> We constantly argue that Second Stage should be based on the principle of the legislation and we resent the fact that very often the Government stops legislation from progressing beyond Second Stage to Committee and Report Stages. However, the shoe is on the other foot on this occasion, with the way things are panning out. This Bill is an example of legislation that can be improved on Committee and Report Stages. This morning, the Taoiseach said that the Government would be accepting amendments but then he qualified that remark quite quickly. There needs to be an openness to improving this legislation. The Government must be open to accepting what may be challenging amendments. The Bill went through the pre-legislative scrutiny process over quite a period of time. That process is one of the better examples of Oireachtas reform. Issues were highlighted during that process and quite a lot of expertise was built up during scrutiny which will be brought to bear in terms of tabling amendments. The Social Democrats will support the Bill on Second Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_867">The Green Party was in two minds about this Bill when we spoke among ourselves in considering the issue. I decided earlier to inform myself by listening to the Minister's contribution and the various positions taken on the legislation. While we had a rough idea about what our position would be, we decided to wait and see what the debate was like. Having listened to the contributions and parsed the arguments made by the Minister, I concluded that the former Supreme Court judge, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, a highly reputable, honourable former member of the Judiciary and independent woman of great renown and repute, is absolutely right that the essence of the Bill is a deliberate kick in the teeth to the Judiciary. I say this with regret because if it is accurate, as I believe it is, it is a deeply worrying development in terms of how the Government works.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> I read the Minister's speech many times to try to parse from it the key arguments in favour of making the proposed changes. He noted that the current system had drawbacks, describing the arrangements in place at present as limited in a number of respects. He indicated that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is not able to promote judges to a higher court. We should be able to rectify this limitation by broadening the provisions on the current arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> The Minister argued that proper resources were required to oversee this process and a case can be made in this regard. Deputy O'Callaghan had a point, however, when he argued that we were in danger of creating a quango by appointing a director, establishing an office, providing for statutory functions of reporting and introducing the paraphernalia associated with a new body. Notwithstanding this, one could argue that resources are needed for this purpose. As far as I can discern, this is the only substantive argument being made in respect of the limitations of the current system. </p>
          <p eId="para_870"> The attack on the Judiciary in the proposals lies in the recognition that the Government has deliberately increased the number of members of the new judicial appointments commission beyond what it had originally intended simply to ensure a lay majority on the commission. I note the Minister's point that this is not a constitutional issue because the Constitution does not provide that the Judiciary must be involved in judicial appointments. As such, we are free to approach this issue as we wish. However, the Minister openly admitted that the Government decided to accept the arguments made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, that we must have a lay majority on the commission and that it would be wrong to allow the Judiciary to have a majority on the commission. While we may hear a justification in subsequent speeches, no argument was made to support the view that a lay majority is better than a judicial majority. Similarly, and this is the key issue for Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and members of the Judiciary, the Minister did not present a single argument to support the view that a lay person as opposed to the Chief Justice should chair the commission. This can only be viewed as an insult to the Chief Justice and the legal system. I regret that this provision has been proposed. While no one disagrees with the need to modernise the judicial appointments system, is it necessary to kick the Judiciary? Is that a clever development?</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> I listened with respect to the Taoiseach's arguments on this issue. His main argument appeared to be that the United Kingdom takes this approach to judicial appointments. I am slightly concerned that an Irish Parliament is looking to Britain for a model for our judicial arrangements. We have a different tradition, one of which I am very proud. The British legal system could learn a thing or two from the constitutional democratic and republican system we have. To have a Taoiseach citing British legal and constitutional arrangements is a weak argument in defence of the Bill before us. </p>
          <p eId="para_872"> When one hears the word "elite" being bandied about endlessly and one sees Fine Gael siding with Deputy Boyd Barrett on the issue of this elite, it has shades of <i>The</i>
						<i>Daily Telegraph</i> headline "Enemies of the People" in reference to the British judiciary. The Minister for Justice and Equality can shake his head but that is what I heard in the contributions and it is not where I want to go. </p>

          <p eId="para_878">That instinct is not where we should go but unfortunately it is where the Bill is coming from. There is nothing wrong with being popular but when it moves into enemies of the people territory, which is what I fear we are doing with the calculated attack on the Judiciary to which I referred, I start to have concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> I am proud of our courts system and Judiciary. I am proud that our constitutional system has, at its core, the republican courts established at the foundation of the State which were from and of the people. The reason we must be careful to protect the independence of the Judiciary is that its role is to protect the people from us. That is the strength of our constitutional system. Since the foundation of the State, the Judiciary has been independent and has proved itself adept at protecting the power of the people that derives from the Constitution, as opposed to a monarch or this House. The Judiciary protects our constitutional republic. These are the reasons I am concerned about this vicarious kick, a Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness described it, that has been aimed at the Judiciary. </p>
          <p eId="para_880"> While the legal system is archaic and has its failings, including in the King's Inns and benching systems, it also has strength. I do not deny that we derive some benefits from the traditions of the English system. It is not all bad when one considers other international systems that we could adopt. The universal view among Deputies who spoke in this debate, including those who support the Bill, is that, by and large and with some exceptions, the Judiciary has served people well. For this reason, the attack on it presented in this Bill is a cause of serious concern. </p>
          <p eId="para_881"> There has been undue political influence on judicial appointments over the years. The current and previous Governments have a case to answer in this regard because, from what I have heard, the level of political influence on judicial appointments in recent times has been slightly higher than average. The controversial issue is not only who secures judicial appointments but also who can get work. While I am not directly connected to the legal profession, this is what one hears. There is truth in the argument that the system is not sufficiently inclusive of people from different backgrounds. While the system is by no means perfect, it is not all bad either.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> It is right that the political system has responsibility for appointing judges. There are, naturally, connections between the judicial and political systems. The legal and political professions, if politics can be described as a profession, are similar. In any event, legal professionals and politicians engage in similar tasks to the extent that we speak, are interested in public affairs, seek to win arguments and are constitutional office holders. This is all the more reason that it behoves politicians to be careful in how we manage this issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_883"> One of the other failings of the judicial system is that it is, like this House, too adversarial. We should seek ways to find mediated and other solutions. We should use this opportunity to rethink, reconsider and give some steer to how the Judiciary or courts system could achieve a more mediated approach. I will suggest one form of mediation that may be warranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">We should accept the suggestion of former Supreme Court Justice Mrs. Catherine McGuinness and consider an amendment on Committee Stage to restore the role of the Chief Justice as chair of the proposed commission, accepting that the broad parameters of the technical issues in terms of appointments need to be modernised, but that we do not need in that process to give a vicarious kick to the judicial system. Such an amendment might have to be accepted in the Seanad if we cannot get it through this House; we will have to wait to see what the numbers are. Perhaps some Fine Gael Members might agree with me that we do not necessarily need to give a kick to our constitutionally independent Judiciary at this moment in time. Who knows what the numbers will be?</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> A mediated solution would achieve agreement and defuse this unnecessary row that has evolved. It is not the key issue, given that there is not a crushing need for us to address this among the range of issues that we have to face. It is an unnecessary fight that has been brought on for unnecessary purposes. As a mediated solution, I suggest that we consider such an amendment or an amendment to the effect that the numbers do not have to be stacked up one way versus the other to show that this is a lay or political triumph for some over the Judiciary. We will be suggesting such amendments on Committee Stage and looking for support for their acceptance across the House. If we did that, this Bill would sail through and be a good service to our democratic, constitutional Republic.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Cassells<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_887">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> I thank the Ceann Comhairle. It is a privilege to speak on Second Stage of our town council Bill. On the plinth today, I spoke about the fact that our Constitution had been given quite an airing in the Chamber over the past week, from the misquoting of Article 13 last week to Article 35, pertaining to the Judiciary, and Article 33 on the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of his role in the investigation into Templemore and our work at the Committee of Public Accounts. However, another article is rarely quoted, namely, Article 28A on local government. It shows the importance of local government in terms of the delivery of services and the essence of what makes our communities, towns and estates the vibrant places to live and rear our families in and where we enjoy the fabric of our unique society. However, this article gets overlooked any time that a Government meddles in the structures of local government under the much abused word "reform".</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> I am unashamedly an advocate of local government, having first been elected as a 21-year old to Navan Town Council in 1999 and, subsequently, to Meath County Council and having served 17 years in the local government structure before entering Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> What happened in 2013 through the previous local government Act in the name of "reform" under the now European Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, was butchery, plain and simple. It was butchery of democracy and the worst attack on our systems in 100 years. At a European level, the lack of resources allocated and attention paid to local government that manifested most acutely in Fine Gael's "Putting People First" policy document, which later came into the legislative realm, was heavily criticised in a 2013 report of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> The abolition of town councils has masked the fact that there is a much deeper funding crisis in local government, given that no increase in the general purpose grant was subsequently allocated to counties. That was a good sleight of hand. The money was kept back and Members across the way thought that no one would notice if the traditional block grants allocated to county towns were not added to counties' overall figures the following year. The counties were impoverished even further. On top of that, there was the same sleight of hand with the allocation of roads funding. Since the money that traditionally had gone to town councils was not added to the county totals the year after abolition, many counties found themselves down hundreds of thousands of euro. As the Minister of State, Deputy English, knows, our county of Meath was down €1 million in 2015. Some thought that people would not notice, but they did notice because the councils were broke to begin with, and this only reduced their ability to offer services to people further.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> Apart from anything else, the wiping away of those 80 town councils, which had served their communities well over the course of 115 years, with the stroke of a pen showed how the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, and the Government of the time did not understand how local communities worked and interacted with local councils. There is no need for slagging people off in the Chamber because there is a broad acceptance. In particular, Deputy Howlin noted in 2015 that abolition was the worst mistake of his time in the previous Government and that what had been done was wrong. Through this Bill, we in Fianna Fáil seek to reverse that wrong and re-establish the town council structure as a form of government in Ireland, with the purpose of growing urban centres and giving our large towns, where tens of thousands of people live, a proper mechanism for the delivery of services that they deserve. That is the motivation.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> Why should something that was abolished be brought back is a question that is being rightly asked of us. The answer is that there is now a gaping void in how the needs of people in large towns are met. Neither public representatives nor dedicated sets of officials are in place to give vision and purpose to the towns in the years ahead. Engineers are spread over multiple municipal districts the size of Dáil constituencies. People who are calling out for proper services, be those in terms of roads, water or sewerage, cannot get answers because engineers are dealing with a number of electoral areas. There are no dedicated and ring-fenced town council budgets, which would have been in the realm of tens of millions of euro in the case of many large towns and boroughs, and no dedicated statutory town development plans, which can provide people with a vision of how their towns will grow. When it comes to money, there is no ability to retain the local property tax, which is raised in the main from the pockets of people living in large towns and spread over wide areas instead of being retained within the areas from which it is raised. If statutory councils were in place, they would be able to retain such funds on behalf of those who paid the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> Businesses know only too well the fallout from the abolition of town councils. Walk down any main street and talk to a shopkeeper. The commercial rates of small and large businesses in every town suddenly rose because almost every town commercial rate had been lower than the county rate. We are now in a period of equalisation. Due to the abolition of town councils, town businesses - they are the main employers in counties and keep vibrant town centres alive against tall odds - have suddenly had an additional charge put on them. That will continue over the next decade as part of the equalisation of rates. The business people who are keeping Ireland outside of Dublin city alive know only too well what abolishing town councils meant for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> I am committed to seeing good local governance in place because I believe that councils deliver on the ground the services that people require. At today's press conference on the plinth, I was asked whether town councils had been anything more than talking shops. In the case of my town council, which I spent many years proudly serving on, if the delivery of a €13 million theatre, new swimming pool, gymnasium, 68-acre park, enterprise zone and enhanced town centre was the result of a talking shop, it was a bloody good one. That multimillion euro investment was achieved in the space of a decade during which I was privileged to serve as mayor of Navan on two occasions-----</p>

          <p eId="para_897">-----and at a time when the town council was recording annual surplus returns when, in stark contrast, our county council was mired in debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I take immense pride in walking down the streets of my hometown with my three young children, knowing that the town in which they are growing up, and indeed in which the Minister of State, Deputy English's children are growing up, is a much better town in terms of facilities for them than the one in which I grew up. That is, and must be, the litmus test as to whether a form of government is successful - have we improved the lives of the people we serve? If we can say that we have made tangible differences, then it has been a success. </p>
          <p eId="para_899"> Considering the example which I have given, and which can be replicated in so many towns across Ireland - I have colleagues here from Sligo, Naas, Cavan and Kilkenny - one wonders about the motivation to abolish them in the first instance. Over the next 20 years, our towns will grow larger and the need to have dedicated budgets, development plans and representation for them will be all the more critical so that the facilities which are lacking in so many areas, and which get covered as commuter stories in the newspaper and on television, actually get delivered. </p>
          <p eId="para_900"> We want to see the town council system back in a strengthened fashion. There is no reason that we cannot have the strong local government seen in places like France, Italy and Scandinavia. People have said to me that we are over represented in this country. They should look at the statistics. We are not. In France, the ratio of public representatives to people is 1:118. In Denmark, which is a similar size to this country, it is 1:1,100. In Ireland, it is 1:2,800. It is the highest ratio in the EU. The UK is just behind us at 1:2,600. </p>
          <p eId="para_901"> Any public representative worth his or her salt will know from speaking to the people living in the large housing estates of more than 300 houses - both those currently there and those that will be built in the future - that we need to have the proper support and infrastructure for them, from the very basic items to bigger things such as swimming pools and playing pitches. If a large town is part of a much wider and larger municipal district, its ability to acquire that funding is considerably diminished. In some cases there are municipal districts which are the size of Dáil constituencies. The Kells electoral area in Meath is a fine example. It is not feasible for our local public representatives to offer proper representation. We do not want to see the large towns, in which people are living, starved of funding in a system that is already starved of funding and which was under-resourced in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> This Bill is the first step in putting a town council system back in place which will be fit for purpose, so that the people living in the urban centres of this country, whether it be Kilkenny, Drogheda, Athlone or Navan, will get the special focus that can only be delivered through the reintroduction of our town councils. I hope that the Government, and indeed all parties in the House, will support the Bill and seek not to obstruct, but to actually help people in the urban Ireland which the Government is creating through the national planning framework. Let us make sure that these towns we are building have resources and supports that are fit for the purpose of helping our people.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesLawless" eId="spk_481">
          <from>Deputy James Lawless<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_903">I commend my colleague, Deputy Cassells, on introducing this Bill to the House. He has been leading the charge on this for the past 12 months. As a proud Navan man, former member of Navan Town Council and former mayor of Navan, I know that this gap at the heart of local democracy is very dear to his heart, and indeed to the heart of all of us, on this side of the House at least.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> The abolition of 744 councillors and 84 town councils in essence cast aside, at the stroke of a pen, millenia of democracy. It happened without a referendum because of course there is no reference to local government in the Constitution. Perhaps there should be. There was no public consultation of any kind. It was a system which went back to the first city and town charters and, indeed, to Irish Brehon law which had the concept of a taoiseach to represent local districts. It is a precept that has been recognised for millenia. </p>
          <p eId="para_905"> In European treaties, we hear about subsidiarity, where decisions are made by those closest to those who will be affected. As the great Irish-American politician Tip O'Neill put it, "all politics is local". Unfortunately, the move by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, was more Tammany Hall than House of Representatives. It was a populist move by the last Administration that somehow suggested that fewer politicians would mean better government. It fed into a "plague on all your houses" mentality - a form of anti-establishment mood fuelled by the establishment itself. It was a cynical exercise from the same stable that attempted a power grab in the Seanad and is now involved in an assault upon the Judiciary, to which we will return tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> As a former mayor of Naas, and as a representative of an area that once had a town council, I have seen the effect at first hand. Few will advocate, in the media or elsewhere, for the retention or advancement of politicians. I will cite one notable example, the late Councillor Willie Callaghan, who was also a former mayor of Naas and the president of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland at the time, who bravely led the charge but he was ignored. His concerns fell on deaf ears, as did those of everyone else at the time. Politicians made for an easy target. Some were delighted with their abolition, but when the services also disappear, who laments that loss? Residents associations began to notice when the grant is no longer paid out, when the grass is no longer cut and when the Christmas lights fund is no longer in existence. These small local services, which were provided by a small dedicated body, draw focus to the gap that now exists. It was provided at very little cost. The councillors took a very modest stipend and any staff who were redirected were merely moved into the parent bodies. </p>
          <p eId="para_907"> As towns like Naas, Navan, Sligo and elsewhere now grapple with the multiple challenges of reducing footfall, lack of amenities and challenging retail environments and with the problems of congestion, urban sprawl, dereliction and unco-ordinated planning, who can argue that a town-specific body, with only that mandate, could be anything but positive? Rather than better democracy we have seen a further centralisation. Agencies such as the National Transport Authority now direct county councils on road projects. Ministerial directives have become commonplace in local area plans. In fact, the correction in that regard has been to the extreme on the other side. </p>
          <p eId="para_908"> In north Kildare, towns like Naas, Leixlip and Newbridge all had town councils, however the towns of Celbridge and Maynooth did not, despite having a population of almost 30,000 between them. There were certainly anomalies in the system, but the large municipal districts which replaced them are certainly also imperfect. Very large administrative areas, which are more than an hour's drive from one end to the other and lack cohesion or internal leaders are illogical units which poorly serve the towns that are represented. </p>
          <p eId="para_909"> At a time when politicians are rightly often decried for being aloof, cutting them off from the people they represent, and taking an axe to the lowest fundamental layer of local government seems to be nothing less than democratic sabotage. I ask the Government to consider this Bill seriously and earnestly. The Labour Party, which was a substantial part of the last Government, has seen the error of its ways. Indeed, Deputy Howlin has put on the record that it was one of that Administration's regrets. There is an opportunity to restore it and to right that wrong. I ask the Government to take that on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_910">I wish to support the Bill and reflect on the decision made by the then Minister, Phil Hogan, which stunned everyone in Kilkenny because he had come from local government. He had been a member of the county council and was aware of the importance of Kilkenny Corporation. That was not just a decision for the Minister at that time, rather it was a path that had been well laid out by others before him and by the bureaucrats within the Department who were attempting to reduce the number of public representatives and the number of councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> It was also a strike against history. Kilkenny city is steeped in its history. It has a city statute. The legislation was later changed to describe Kilkenny as a city for ceremonial purposes only. That took from people the pride that they had in their history and in their local corporation. It took away a voice on their behalf which dealt directly with their problems. Alongside that, the corporation's replacement halved the city and put extensive parts of rural Kilkenny in with each of those halves. It is now an area which is impossible to administer, which has very little in terms of budget. </p>
          <p eId="para_912"> It is now time to restore Kilkenny Corporation or Kilkenny Borough Council in whatever guise is necessary, provided that the power goes with it. County councils and their powers have been diluted considerably and the county manager or the CEO is now all-powerful. I suggest that what is needed is a tilt in the balance in favour of the public representatives, who represent the people who elected them, and to take power away from unelected officials. The time has come for this and I believe the public have an appetite for this type of change. </p>
          <p eId="para_913"> It is no good to change it without giving power with the change - the power to raise money, to strike a rate and to change the direction of a city or a municipal area. Above all they must have the power to elect their mayor. There must be a proper place within that democratic structure for the mayor of a city or council. That is hugely important. What was done in the past simply muddied the waters around who had the power and who spoke to the power. It was just taken away without any consideration. France was mentioned as an example. In France, the power goes with the position.</p>

          <from>Deputy Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_914">I commend my colleague, Deputy Cassells, on introducing this legislation. In 2013, difficult as things were throughout the country, the move of the then Minister, Phil Hogan, came as a surprise to me. We can understand why sometimes in politics we might play the ball. We can even understand at times that we might play the man, but why the then Minister had to dig up the pitch as well is beyond me and certainly undermined democracy in our country. We often complain about the ivory tower where up to this Administration these Houses were subservient to the Cabinet of the day. This was only exacerbated by the actions of Phil Hogan in removing the democratic mandate of communities throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> We did indeed save money - a whole €15 million - but how much did that cost in terms of the value to communities throughout the country? While I know proposals from our party and others have suggested we might have a threshold of urban centres with populations of 7,000 or even 10,000, I would ask that if this commission is set up, it should consider going even lower than that. We can see the value to communities like those in south County Donegal where there were town councils in Ballyshannon and Bundoran. In other counties and other towns throughout the country, there was value for relatively low costs to those communities in ensuring their community had a sense of ownership of the policy platform being pursued by the town council, the county council and passing on to us here as Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. It is imperative that the Government embraces this and sets up the commission. Within a year we will have tangible proposals to enhance democracy throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> This evening, once again, we have allowed an independent commission to decimate counties throughout the country in redrawing constituencies. I was from the almost multinational constituency of Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Donegal. While I am pleased we have reunited Cavan, we have decimated Roscommon by putting part of north County Roscommon in with Sligo, Leitrim and south Donegal. While I know it is a matter for another day, we need a constitutional referendum to rebalance our approach to having a representative democracy in this country. It is not just town councils, which this Bill addresses, but if we continue as we are, long after we are all gone there will be 120 Deputies on the eastern seaboard and nobody anywhere else in Ireland. We must come up with a formula that respects county boundaries. I challenge the Minister and the Minister of State to begin that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> I commend the Bill to the House and hope the Government sees the merit of repairing the pitch that Phil Hogan dug up unnecessarily in 2013.</p>

          <p eId="para_920">I hope I did not put him off his stride. It is not a small thing to produce legislation, on which I congratulate the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> I welcome the opportunity to discuss important issues relating to the local government system, to hear the views of Deputies, and to share with the House some initial thoughts on the future of local government in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> The Government's Action Programme for Effective Local Government - Putting People First, which was the platform for the wide-ranging reform programme implemented in 2014, set out an ambitious vision for local government to be "the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level - leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services, and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably".</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> I intend to further that objective, building on the significant improvements that have been made in recent years. The next stage in that process will be a report to Government and the Oireachtas under the Programme for a Partnership Government on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability, and to ensure that local government structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy. The programme signals this process as the next wave of local government reform and also indicates specific issues to be considered, including reducing the size of local electoral areas and the question of town and borough councils. I will receive this report in July and I will be able to consider it in detail and bring it to the Oireachtas in September.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> To achieve the vision set out in the 2012 policy document, the structural framework must be fit for purpose. Accordingly, a core element of the reform programme was structural reorganisation, involving the unification of certain city and county councils, and replacing 80 former town councils with municipal districts integrated with the county councils in a new, innovative system of governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> Outdated boundaries and other anomalies have been removed. I believe the new system provides more effective and community-focused decision-making and implementation. There is full integration of local authority resources across each county, and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> The new municipal district system is also closer to the European norm, which Deputy Cassells referenced, covering the entire territory of each county, in contrast with the previous unbalanced arrangement of isolated town councils, while rural areas, many town environs and some larger centres lacked municipal status and local governance. A 2013 Council of Europe report, which was referenced by Deputy Cassells in his Second Stage speech, specifically welcomed the decision to replace the town council system by the new municipal district arrangement, particularly because it ended the dual franchise in towns which the Council of Europe report described as unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> An important benefit of the new system is a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions. Local matters are dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application are decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions. In effect, there is now a dual system of governance but an integrated administrative structure in each county which maximises operational efficiency while ensuring devolved decision-making throughout the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> The Bill has technical flaws, particularly the fact that it is linked to repealed provisions of the Local Government Act 2001. Substantial redrafting would be required if it were to progress. However, there are more fundamental issues in principle with the Bill, as follows. The Bill would pre-empt consideration by Government and the Oireachtas of the report on local government matters to be submitted under the programme for Government. As I mentioned, that report will come to me next month and to the Government and the Oireachtas in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> In so far as there are shortcomings and scope for improvement in current local government arrangements, these matters can, and will, be addressed without resorting to the re-establishment of a multiplicity of town councils. Unfortunately and ironically, the commission proposed in the Bill would probably impede improvements such as the review of local electoral areas which needs to proceed this year to be ready for the 2019 local elections. I do not want anything to delay this important work.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> The most fundamental problem, however, is that the ultimate purpose of re-establishing town councils is basically lacking in justification and, notwithstanding the good intentions of its sponsor, is ill-advised on a number of grounds. First, the arguments that have been made for restoring town councils, such as lack of investment by local authorities in towns, are not generally supported by facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> Moreover, there is little evidence of general support for reverting to the town council system among councillors. The Association of Irish Local Government, which represents councillors, has expressed the view that a legislative measure would be premature in advance of any review of the efficacy of the 2014 reforms. While proposing that the funding requirements of municipal districts containing towns experiencing growth pressures be examined in the interim, the AILG view is that it would seem sensible that any structural review should await the completion of the current electoral cycle so that the 2014 reforms could be assessed fairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> Reversion to a town council model would not be compatible with the new system of local governance introduced in 2014. As a result, the significant benefits which the new municipal district system has brought about would be reversed and the opportunity for the new system to develop and improve would be lost. An operational review of the new structures was completed in 2016, informed by surveys of both elected members and the local authority executive. This provides a strong evidence base for policy development.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> The survey responses indicated a strong consensus that the new municipal district system has resulted in significant improvement on the previous system, with capacity to deliver further benefits as it matures and fully settles over a complete council cycle, and that radical change should not be pursued before the new arrangements have been allowed time to bed down fully.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> I do not suggest that the current arrangements are perfect. Some shortcomings, particularly related to the excessive size of many electoral areas, were identified in the recent surveys, and potential improvements suggested. These matters will be addressed in the forthcoming report. Work on the report is well advanced and it is expected to be submitted to me by the end of July, with a view to submission to Government and a full debate in the Oireachtas in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> The question of town councils and the related issue of local electoral areas have been given particular priority because they are central to the reforms introduced in 2014. The implications of various approaches have been rigorously considered along with potential measures to reinforce the effectiveness of the 2014 reforms in light of the operational review.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> The most fundamental question to be considered is what shortcomings exist in the current arrangements and to what extent they are likely to be addressed by re-establishing town councils or by some alternative approach. On the basis of detailed consideration to date, but without pre-empting decisions on the forthcoming report, it is evident that the most appropriate approach would be to retain the current municipal district system but strengthen it with measures to enhance the role and status of the municipal district members, and reconfigure the local electoral areas to reduce excessively large areas and designate more distinct urban electoral areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> The powers and functions of municipal district members can be enhanced in a number of respects, with particular emphasis on strengthening their financial role and their capacity to promote the economic and social development of towns. Other measures can be implemented to improve the operation of the system generally, including ensuring that the new arrangements are being operated fully in all areas, for example, the range of functions performed at municipal district level.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">Important features of the current system which have proved to be clearly beneficial should be retained, notably, a single, integrated county-wide executive, operational structure and resources; a unified representational and electoral system, with all county level members being members also at district level; a single statutory authority for each county, embracing the county and its component districts within one corporate legal entity, with appropriate roles for the elected members at district and county levels, respectively, and sub-county governance arrangements for all areas of the county, rural and urban, unlike the former unbalanced town council system. The retention of integrated governance arrangements, particularly with more distinctly town-based electoral areas, will also support objectives in the context of the national planning framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> In summary, there were compelling reasons for replacing town councils, which still apply. There is limited demand for reversion to the pre-2014 system. The new arrangements are generally working very well and are expected to produce further benefits, albeit with scope for improvement in some aspects, which will be addressed in the forthcoming report to Government under A Programme for a Partnership Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_940"> In conclusion, I pay tribute to Deputy Cassells for his commitment to local government and local government reform. I will take note of his input and that of other Deputies as we progress the report under the programme for Government. I look forward to future engagement with the House in that regard. However it would not be appropriate to pre-empt consideration by Government and Oireachtas of all the local government matters which will be dealt with in the forthcoming report. If, following consideration by Government, a commission on local government matters, as proposed in Deputy Cassells' Bill, is warranted, that could, of course, be pursued, but it should not delay changes that are clearly desirable such as the reconfiguration of local electoral areas. Accordingly, in the event of the Bill passing Second Stage I would intend bringing forward appropriate amendments, but I do believe it would be premature at this point to progress the Bill further until such time as we in the House can examine the outcome of the current review, which I hope we can do in September.</p>

          <p eId="para_945">There is a growing realisation that the passing of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 was an unmitigated disaster for local government and accountability. The Act wasted a valuable opportunity to effect real change. It did bring about change, but that change was a negative one. Towns have been left behind, abandoned and neglected since their councils, whether they were town or borough councils, were abolished.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> My home town of Drogheda is the largest town in Ireland. The Fine Gael and Labour parties stripped Drogheda of its borough council status. They stripped Drogheda of its town clerk. They stripped Drogheda of all local authority departments bar one. They stripped Drogheda of any resemblance of local power that it had. That damage has been replicated in 80 towns across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_947"> Municipal districts and their meetings are now a toothless tiger. They do not even have a budget. The Government handed over power to unelected officials, who in some cases have shown no enthusiasm, vision, foresight, forward planning or even interest. They have even told elected representatives that they - the unelected officials - would decide what happens, if it happens, what will be done locally and what will not be done. The Fine Gael and Labour parties presided over that and defended the decimation and abolition of 80 town and borough councils right across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"> One could ask what it was all for. The Department claimed in a statement prior to the introduction of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 that savings of €15 million to €20 million per year would be achieved through the abolition of town councils. I requested information in a parliamentary question on the annual savings achieved each year since the introduction of the Act in 2014. I sought the relevant, quantified data relating to those savings, in tabular form, but the Department refused to give them. Not only has the Government stripped town and borough councils of any resemblance of power and local democracy they might have had, but it also refuses to publish the savings it claimed would be made. The Fine Gael and Labour parties have made a complete hames of local government structures and they are directly responsible for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> This Bill could easily allow for a wider range of topics for review by the proposed commission. For example, it could carry out a thorough review of the powers afforded to local authorities and their funding streams, and the obvious need to enhance and increase them both. Rather than merely assessing the need for town councils, it is important that a wider view is taken to ensure that local government structures are fit for purpose across the State. Currently, they are not and both the Fine Gael and Labour parties have brought that about.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> It would be worth providing for gender balance in the Bill when choosing members of the commission. It goes without saying that we need to ensure the appointees would be suitably qualified. The thrust of the Bill is correct; we should establish this commission. I hope that when, or if, the Bill reaches Committee Stage we could table amendments such as the ones I have outlined.</p>

          <p eId="para_951">The abolition of our town and borough councils in 2014, following the enactment of the Local Government Reform Act, was a sad day for democracy in Ireland. A total of 80 town and borough councils were abolished and 95 municipal districts were established. In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, we lost eight town councils. When one considers that each of those had nine elected members, that amounted to a loss of 72 very committed public representatives of all parties and none. There were three such councils in County Cavan, namely, Cavan town, Belturbet and Cootehill and five councils in County Monaghan, namely, Monaghan town, Clones, Castleblaney, Carrickmacross and Ballybay.</p>
          <p eId="para_952"> The impact of abolition has been unprecedented. I do not believe there is another such example in the history of local government that has had a parallel impact. A partial vacuum has been created and our local communities have suffered. That is at the kernel of the consideration we have given to the proposition here before us this evening. It is a fact that local communities have suffered as a consequence. In my own personal capacity as an elected public representative, I have noticed a huge difference in the range of issues being referred to me due to the decrease in local representation. While my primary function as a Teachta Dála, and that of each of us here in this Chamber, is to legislate, I have noticed – it is apparent to every one of us - that since the abolition of local town councils more and more cases are being referred to us that would otherwise have been effectively dealt with by our town council colleagues. I acknowledge that we all do our level best to represent our constituents on whatever issue they raise, but our constituents and communities deserve more. They deserve access to locally domiciled voices who can, in turn, access local authority officials and services, and on every day of the week. Our communities deserve strong local government. As the saying goes, all politics is local, and for that reason we will support the Bill, which seeks to create a local government commission to carry out a review and make recommendations relating to the establishment and boundaries of a town council system and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Sinn Féin would have liked this proposition to go further because we recognise local government as we have known it is in need of real reform. That is accepted. We have always been vocal in that regard. We support strong city, county and local district councils with devolved powers that are democratic, accountable and deliver local services in an efficient, cost effective way. I recommend the Bill to the House and I hope it will not divide on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> I want to make a brief comment on the publication this evening of the Constituency Commission report on Dáil constituency boundaries. As a Cavan-Monaghan elected representative in the constituency, and having coined the phrase "Reunite Cavan" after a significant part of west Cavan was taken from us and adjoined to Sligo-Leitrim, I welcome the reunification of Cavan and the restoration of Cavan-Monaghan as a five seat constituency. With regard to the argument I made in my own presentation, and the petition that I and other colleagues of all political hues across Cavan-Monaghan were instrumental in gathering in association with <i>The Anglo-Celt </i>newspaper in Cavan, the kernel of the argument has been lost because a section of north-east Meath is being adjoined to Cavan-Monaghan. In compensation to Sligo-Leitrim and the big toe of Donegal there is now a section of north Roscommon being appended to Sligo-Leitrim. The integrity of county boundaries should have been respected in relation to this with a greater flexibility allowed around population difference. It is regrettable that the problem continues. Having said that, I welcome the reunification of County Cavan and the restoration of Cavan-Monaghan to a five seat constituency. I hope that the commission to be established will come up with recommendations and proposals that we will all look forward to supporting.</p>

          <p eId="para_955">Since the town councils were abolished, morale has been very low. I have spoken to many ex-councillors and I keep in touch with my own municipal district office and so on. Since the abolition of town councils the democratic right of the people has been taken away at a very core level, which is local politics. I do not often use the word "oligarchy", but it has replaced democracy. We are being governed by the few. As many Deputies have pointed out here tonight, the municipal district does not have bidding power and, as Deputy Munster said, they are feeling pretty toothless. If that is putting people first then we have much to learn about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to issues locally and these include cuts to Leader programme funding. The then Minister, Phil Hogan, spoke about the great property tax that would be spent on local services. We have not seen it going into local services. Rural towns and villages in Ireland are absolutely falling apart. We have area engineers and municipal district officers who must wait two years to draw down funding for low-cost safety measures while people are being knocked down in housing estates. Is this local government? Is this local democracy? Is this representing the people? It is absolutely ludicrous. Two children were knocked down in Fermoy within a number of months in a housing estate and we still cannot get road safety measures. Where is the local representation? We have been banging our heads against the wall on this matter. Workers in Cork County Council have gone out on strike over staffing agreements. The best way to replace local council workers was the Gateway programme, but it does not work. Some years ago we had flooding in Midleton and out of a possible 22 staff, six were on the books. That is who looked after the town. That is not local representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_957"> I welcome the Bill and hope it will be extremely progressive. Obviously, it can be broadened out and it is vital that we get information back from our own local councillors and from our municipal district officers. They are feeling the pain. The area engineers would have a better chance of emptying the Red Sea with a bucket with no ass in it than what they have to do with the pennies and pittance they get at local government. I could speak on the Bill for hours but it must be remembered that democracy starts at home. The local lad has the local knowledge. The local councils were perfect; I sat on them, they had the power and they represented the people locally. It was a bottom up approach, not the top down. This is what is ruining the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_958">I welcome this debate and I applaud Deputy Cassells for bringing forward the Local Government (Establishment of Town Councils Commission) Bill 2017. It is a start. It is not earth shattering but it is a very important start. The Bill proposes to establish a town council commission. It will not lead to a return of town councils any time soon. In fact, it is more likely to delay the restoration of town councils. We need to know what functions or powers they might have and the commission would be established to do that. We already know, however, what powers town councils and borough councils should have. The legislation that abolished them can be reversed. I know it would not be simple as there are about 80 or 90 different inputs into the Local Government Reform Act but the significant changes that were made in the Act and the Putting People First policy have been nothing short of a disaster. I wish to be clear about this and we should face up to that reality. It is not just that a Bill or an Act is passed. I do not know who informed him but I am surprised the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, thought those reforms were successful.</p>

          <p eId="para_960">They are anything but successful. The former Minister, Phil Hogan's reform of local government has not worked out. It is one of my and the Labour Party's great regrets. We should have been more resilient, obstructive and obstinate in making sure that the reforms did not see the light of day. It has led to wholesale destruction. What passed for local government reform was not reform at all, it was abolition. Improvements had to be made because there were some town councils or town commissions that could be elected with 100 or 120 votes. We all know there were small town councils and they had to be reformed because they were unsustainable in the long term but this was not the case for towns such as Mullingar with 20,000 or 25,000 people, or for Athlone, Longford or larger towns of that nature. I was surprised at the Minister, Deputy Murphy, saying what he said. I am big and bold enough to admit that it was a disaster. If we cannot admit that in here then we are deceiving people.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> When then Minister, Phil Hogan, brought through his reforms I believe he had a vision of how municipal districts would work but the reality has not delivered. Many towns have been left with little or no representation and decisions that impact them are being made by councillors from the hinterland and surrounding countryside. I live ten or 12 miles outside Mullingar and I was never under the Mullingar municipal district, nor should I be. This is not a good way to plan, develop and run a town. The problems of a major town are very different from those of a rural village or a parish. There are multiple examples across Ireland where towns are split across districts or where multiple small towns are in one district. Many of our borough councils had a centuries-long history and tradition of municipal government. Since the abolition of the councils these towns have suffered as a result of key planning and resource decisions being made elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> The Labour Party election manifesto in 2016 committed to restoring town councils. My colleague, Senator Denis Landy, who has a very keen interest in local government, has been a passionate advocate for the restoration of town councils. Our party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has admitted upfront that it was a mistake to abolish them and he has seen at first hand the impact it has had on his own town in Wexford. I have seen the same in my own constituency. Athlone, Mullingar and Longford towns all need their own local democratic structures. Our recent party conference in Wexford passed a motion to re-establish borough and town councils. We are committed to doing so and have commenced drafting comprehensive legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">The Minister of State, Deputy English, will be aware that with 90 sections or so, there will be a lot of reversing to be done. The tentacles of the expansive 2014 reforms have stretched out and have significant ramifications. We believe all urban settlements with a population of 5,000 or more should be considered eligible to have a town or borough council. I think that is the best cut-off point. We cannot reduce it to 800 or 1,000. The larger the town council, the more powers it should have. There should be a minimum of six councillors on each town council. That can be scaled up to a maximum of 15 or 20.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> Critically, I believe a boundary commission should be established to consider how to define the urban area for each town council. The Central Statistics Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland can provide key information in this respect. This should be one of the key functions when local election boundaries are considered. When town councils are being re-established, it will be essential to give them planning functions and a rateable base. Money is where the real power lies. A formula will need to be agreed to apportion property tax revenues within each county to ensure each area gets its appropriate share.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> A great deal of institutional knowledge was lost when town councils were abolished. Many small towns had developed special skills or offices. Each council from Carrick-on-Suir to Westport had its own way of doing things. Some councils specialised in tourism. Others ensured they had town gardeners and specialist planners. Many councils are now incapable of building social housing. Locally delivered services like fire and rescue operations, road maintenance, street lights, arts and culture amenities and parks are key parts of our towns. The restoration of town councils would ensure they are subject to local democratic accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> The abolition of town councils saw a concomitant reduction in the power to strike a rate. Nobody has a better understanding of the infrastructure, housing and tourism needs of a town than the local council members. It is clear that the remuneration available to councillors has not kept pace with the responsibilities and demands that are thrust upon them. Some of them attend 75 to 80 meetings a year. In 1983, council members attended approximately 20 meetings a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> I believe Better Local Government was another disaster. In the early 1980s, the county manager, the county secretary and the county engineer attended every meeting. This meant there was a far greater degree of interaction and much speedier resolution of issues. The presence at the top table of the top three executives led to a greater level of accountability. I remember dealing with Jack Taaffe, Jim Hearn and Ciarán McGrath at the top table. We addressed them and fought for the issues of the day pertaining to the delivery of essential services for the people of our local areas. Now there is a multiplicity of layers of officialdom. As I look back, it seems to me that the old system worked best.</p>
          <p eId="para_968"> I would like to refer to the findings of a survey conducted by Senator Landy. They give the lie to some of the stuff we heard from the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. Of the 280 councillors who responded to the survey, 85% felt that the 2014 reforms had not strengthened local government. The same percentage of respondents felt that the abolition of town councils had weakened local democracy. This key finding highlights the need for further changes like those set out in the Bill proposed by Deputy Cassells. We are focused on this issue now. The major initiative before the House would accelerate the changes that are needed. I congratulate the Deputy on his Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_969"> The view of the councillors is that there is a need to embed real local democracy and decision-making power in locally-elected representatives. They believe the current arrangements have to be revisited because the loss of a lower tier of local government has not resulted in more representative and powerful municipalities. It is worrying that so few councillors think the role of local government has been strengthened. Many of them believe the removal of town councils has weakened our democracy. The figures set out in Senator Landy's survey show that the ability to hold officials to account and represent local communities has not been improved following the 2014 changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_970"> It is important to take account of the failure of Putting People First to deliver new devolved powers to democratically-elected councillors, especially in the context of the perceived strengthening of administrators and central government. Three out of four councillors feel the 2014 reforms have had a negative impact on local people and community groups. Over 90% of them believe further reforms are now needed. This is the point. People want more democracy through sub-county structures. Such structures are where it is at. Underpaid councillors have to attend multiple big meetings. People give out when it is proposed to increase their salaries. Councillors have to go from Billy to Jack, from one meeting to another. If this keeps going, we will get to the point where we will need to have full-time councillors. People who are in part-time or full-time jobs will not be able to take up the mantle of elected representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_971"> Reforms were needed, but we threw the baby out with the bathwater. We got rid of some of the best aspects of the system. We need to admit that we made a mess of it. If we were starting now, we would not start from here, but we have to start from this point. I do not think we should divide on this issue. I believe this House should be united in ensuring there is a return to local democracy. I suggest that a population base of 5,000 in a town would be a good starting point. It is not sacrosanct, but I think it is a reasonable starting point. Sometimes people say we are looking after ourselves, but that is not the case. We are trying to look after them in a reasonable and democratic way.</p>

          <p eId="para_973">I support this Bill. When the previous Government decided to abolish town councils, people on this side of the House who opposed the legislation providing for their abolition made the point that it was a regressive step. It is good to hear that the Labour Party has realised the error of its ways. Deputy Howlin has outlined that his party now recognises that it was a mistake to support the 2014 reforms. It should not have happened. It seems from much of what the Labour Party is now saying that it regrets many of the things it did when it was in government. It is now proposing measures that it opposed when it was in power. Certain things that were deemed to be unnecessary then seem to be necessary now. The removal of the town councils was certainly a regressive step. Anything that strengthens democracy and brings it down to a more local level has to be welcomed. I commend Deputy Cassells on the introduction of this Bill because it will bring us in the direction we should be going.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> It is more than likely that Ireland has the most undeveloped form of local government of any progressive or modern democracy anywhere in the world. France has a unit of local government for every 1,500 people. The reforms introduced by the last Government were supposed to bring more democracy to local people. We did away with units of elected responsibility and brought such powers up to council level to the extent that Donegal County Council now has 37 members but does not have a chamber capable of facilitating all of them. If this continues, the council will have to spend money on renovating the county house to accommodate its members.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> I do not think the 2014 reforms, which involved growing the county level and getting rid of the lower levels, have been to the advantage of local democracy or local delivery. I suggest we should be looking at going an awful lot further than merely restoring town councils. I believe we should consider having elected councillors at parish level in every parish in the country. It is only by taking such steps that we will be able to start delivering real local democracy. I think it should be possible to achieve such units of local government in a modern developed democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> The underlying point in all the contributions we have heard here tonight is that our local authorities are not properly resourced. They have very few ways of raising funds locally. This was particularly true during the recession. When the property tax was given to local authorities, it was supposed to provide funding at a local level. It is probable that for every €1 of fund-raising power that was given to local authorities, €10 was taken back into central government under the auspices of austerity to ensure budgets could be reduced at a national level. I do not think that did anything to further the delivery of local democracy and local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> I have travelled through towns around the country that used to have urban district councils. I accept that town commissioners were probably a waste of time. Councillors in vibrant towns like Westport that were in control of their own development were able to work together to develop those towns. Such towns seem to be doing much better than towns that were outside the urban district structure and were relying solely on funding at county council level. It is probable that there are examples around the country of towns that did not develop even though they had urban district councils. This is something that could be looked at as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> We need to get back to this level of local democracy. It has been suggested here that towns with a population of 5,000 or more should have their own local authority. We should be going an awful lot deeper and lower than that. We should go down to parish level, depending on the size of the parish. Smaller parishes could have an elected mayor who makes an input into local administration. There should be different levels and tiers of local government depending on the size and population of each area.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">That could be really progressive. It could change democracy and how things are delivered on the ground but for that to happen there has to be a recognition at national level that something has to be given up and that the strings have to be loosened. Control has to be given to those democratically elected bodies because there is no point in setting up urban councils, or setting up town councils again, without them having real control, revenue-raising powers and the ability to decide where funding is spent. The central Government will have to give up some control. There has to be a broad look at the issue, not just of establishing the councils but of the funding mechanisms as well. Overall, I support the Bill, which is worthwhile. </p>

          <p eId="para_980">I will share time with Deputies Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae and Michael Collins. I support this Bill and compliment the Deputy from Meath on bringing it forward. Town councils were abolished by big Phil the enforcer, the Minister at the time, Phil Hogan, and Fianna Fáil did not oppose it then. I tried to call a vote and I got FLAME, the former local authority members in Ireland, to organise a press conference in 2015 on the urgent need for a judicial review of the legality of the Act, which led to the eradication of 80 town and borough councils throughout the country. Recent statements from Government sources that the merger of Cork County Council would not go ahead are solo runs. We went to the High Court and I compliment the former councillor, Niall Dennehy, who was the leader of that group. I served a summons on the then Minister, Phil Hogan, in the restaurant here when he was having beverages.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> It was nothing short of an attack on local democracy. They called it better local government but it was bitter local government. Deputy Penrose is right to say the town councils played a huge role in holding county managers and their secretaries to account. Now there are county managers, six or seven directors of services and a plethora of engineers. One would not know who was in charge of anything. It is worse. The document was called Putting People First but it put people last and had no respect for ordinary members, town council members or councils. The council areas, so-called municipal districts, are very big and I heard a Fine Gael councillor lamenting the state of affairs after three years. It takes away democracy from local people. Many of those on town councils worked on a voluntary basis, for free or for a pittance. They are not half well enough paid but they were at the beck and call of everybody, day and night. They gave huge service and knew what was needed in their areas, such as when things were going wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> We had a serious debate on this in the talks on a programme for Government but the Government paid lip service to us. We need local democracy to be restored. The Government got a wallop and the former Taoiseach got his kick from the electorate but it is not listening to the electorate and denying it what it deserves. I ask the Government to pay heed to this Bill and for all Members to work together to bring back some degree of local democracy.</p>

          <p eId="para_983">I welcome the opportunity to talk about the return of town councils, which did great work on behalf of the people, residents and businesses in many towns around the country. I thank the former members and management in the town councils of Killarney, Tralee and Listowel, who did great work in building up their towns to the great places they are today, providing the basic infrastructure such as water, roads, sewerage, footpaths, housing and amenities, all with very limited funds. Town councillors did not receive big money but gave great service to the people in areas they represented. The former Minister, Phil Hogan, thought that when he struck out town councils he was saving a lot of money but no money has been saved and it is good that we retained management, staff and work crews who are still working on behalf of our towns and the people in them. That is what the people got when they elected the last Government with one of the largest majorities in the history of the State. Fine Gael and the Labour Party did this to the people who elected them. They kicked them in the teeth and they kicked them in the backside because they have practically got rid of local development companies which delivered the Leader programmes and gave a bottom-up service to people in rural areas. I call on the Government to reinstate town councils and give the people the service on the ground which they require.</p>

          <p eId="para_984">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill and I commend Deputy Shane Cassells on bringing this forward. As Minister, Phil Hogan introduced the Local Government Reform Act 2014. This Act did not offer any reform to the local government system in Ireland. Instead it abolished 80 town and borough councils, transferring their functions to the city and county councils, putting further stress on an already cramped system.</p>
          <p eId="para_985"> This Bill to allow the local government commission to carry out a review of the establishment and boundaries of a town council system is certainly most welcome. In 2014, the then Minister, Phil Hogan, attacked Irish democracy and got full support from his own political party and coalition partners to destroy communities or, as some people said, to destroy the bottom-up approach. Community voluntary forums were disbanded. Why? The reason was they were community driven, helping the local communities they represented. The Irish success story across Europe, the Leader groups, were dismantled. Why? The reason was they were community driven, delivering to their communities and now the Leader programme is nothing short of a shambles. Two town councils were eradicated. Why? The reason was local democracy and the then Minister, Phil Hogan, and his coalition Government felt they had to be got rid of. Cork community councils, which do such great work in local communities, are lucky to have their independence because without it Phil Hogan would have got his claws into them too.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> On June 15 I left the Dáil to attend the election of the mayor in Clonakilty. John Loughnane was elected to succeed Anthony McDermott, who had attended over 200 events in the past 12 months on behalf of the people of Clonakilty. Along with Colette Toomey, Gretta O'Donovan and Cionnaith Ó Súilleabháin, they have defied Phil Hogan's orders and have continued Clonakilty's community mayor. They meet monthly on a voluntary basis for the good of their community and surroundings. Such communities, including communities in Skibbereen, Bantry and Bandon, need to have their town councils reinstated immediately to give their communities a chance to get their feet back on the ground and undo the destruction caused in 2014.</p>

          <p eId="para_987">I compliment Deputy Cassells and Fianna Fáil for bringing forward this Private Members' Bill. It is one of the most important Private Members' Bills to have been brought before the House. The last decision was based on blind arrogance on the part of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, which brought this before the House knowing that they had a massive majority and could do whatever they liked. They totally disregarded the great town councillors, many of whom have now gone to their eternal reward but who gave selflessly of their time to work for their communities. They were excellent people who were committed to their communities but they were disregarded by an arrogant Government which thought it could do whatever it liked.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> Mr. Hogan did not save one euro by ripping the hearts out of communities. In Killarney, Listowel and Tralee, I admired and liked the town councillors, whether they were of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin or independents. I liked the way they operated, the effort they put into their work and how deeply committed they were to their communities but the disgraceful Fine Gael-Labour Party Government of arrogance did away with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> I want to remind Members of something that is on the record on the Dáil and I believe I can repeat something a person said inside the House. They are the words of Phil Hogan as Minister. I was talking about great Fine Gael town councillors I had known. I said they were excellent, genuine people who worked very hard in their communities. I said they, their families and their supporters were extremely upset by what he was doing but the Minister, now Commissioner, said I could go back and tell them all that he was quaking in his boots. It was one of the worst attempts of arrogance I had seen in this House, as well as in the years before I came into the House. I was really shocked that night as he disregarded his own people.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">I ask that the Government take on board this very sincere Private Members' Bill. I again thank Deputy Cassells and Fianna Fáil for bringing forward one of the finest Bills ever put before the House. They are marking the Government's card. If the Government will not deal with this issue, Fianna Fáil will. By God, I hope I will be here to support it in so doing. Neither I nor Fianna Fáil are saying that every town council should be reinstated but rather that town councils must earn the right to be brought back. In County Kerry, our town councils would be well able to display that they deserve to be reinstated because they made our towns what they are. The towns are vibrant. The councils brought them from the ground and built them up through hard work and co-operation across all parties. I again thank Deputy Cassells for bringing forward this very important Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_991">I agree that this is a very important Bill and I commend Deputy Cassells and his colleagues for putting it forward. I agree with previous speakers that we have to undo a lot of the damage done at every tier by Phil Hogan through political measures he introduced in 2014. Those measures were inspired by the fairly simplistic analysis that getting rid of political institutions was, <i>per se</i>, a good thing in order to assuage the anger of the public at how the political system had led the country into a crisis. However, the measures actually undermined our political system, weakened our democratic institutions and need to be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_992"> The action taken needs to be reversed at city level. I do not know why the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy John Paul Phelan, is not here. I thought it would be central to his brief to be here to listen to the arguments and make his own case. That said, I wish him well in his new position. However, I cannot believe that the Government, having killed the idea of a directly-elected Mayor of Dublin in 2013 or 2014 by setting up a mechanism that was designed to fail, the Minister of State thinks that Dublin now needs four different mayors. New York has five boroughs but is run by one Mayor. London has 32 boroughs but is run by one Mayor. Dublin is a capital city that has to compete on the world stage. It will not be able to do so if the four boroughs or council areas of Dublin are to compete with each other. That has damaged this city for the past 20 or 30 years. It is utter insanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> Similarly, at a regional level, the division of the country outside Dublin by Phil Hogan in 2014 into two massive regions, one running from Dundalk to Louisburgh and the other from Bray to Ballybunion, was utterly insane. There was no coherence or strategic logic to it. The country needs at least five regions. A place such as Waterford should be the centre of a new region in the south east and there should be a region for south-west Munster. It can be divided in different ways but we do not need the current configuration.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> The issue then comes down to town council level, which is the key issue here. Again, the town councils should have been reformed rather than gotten rid of. The boundaries should have been changed so that the likes of Killarney Town Council, for example, would not have ended as a kind of 19th century phenomenon where the boundary ended somewhere out the Muckross Road when, in the reality of the 21st century, people who should be covered by the council area live far beyond that point. Council areas should have included the surrounding districts rather than solely the town itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> I support the points made by Deputy Michael Collins. God help us, but Clonakilty is the best example of how this should be done. Its independent action in setting up voluntary town councils which meet, as the Deputy said, on a monthly basis and the mayor of which attended 200 functions within the past year, has strengthened the area. It is no wonder that Clonakilty is such a successful, vibrant and attractive town if such spirit is present within it. Such a voluntary approach is one of the mechanisms that could be considered in terms of bringing back town councils. It does not have to be a big institutional arrangement with a big budget but it needs statutory recognition and the voluntary next tier down of democratic systems needs to be established. The model provided by Clonakilty should be replicated everywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> I regret that I do not have the Minister's speech because I wanted to inspect the detail of what he was suggesting as I could not catch it at the time. I will read it tomorrow. As I understand it, he is proposing a municipal district system, which is a continuation of local area committees, on one of which I used to serve and which I know work and are not bad structures. However, there is a need for a tier beneath that and something more than that. There is a need for an institution that allows people to be drawn into politics. A voluntary district council system would do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_997"> I commend the intent behind the Fianna Fáil Bill. The Minister said he might have to amend the legislation and it may not be a bad thing to get into the process of thinking through this legislation in a flexible way. That is the type of really important and useful work that should be done in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_998">I support the Bill and commend Deputy Cassells for bringing it forward. There is no doubt that the abolition of borough and town councils in 2014 by the then Minister, Phil Hogan, and the Labour Party was a black day for democracy. Eighty borough and town councils were abolished in that year. In my own county of Tipperary, seven councils were abolished at the stroke of a pen with the support of the Labour Party, namely, those of Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Tipperary Town, Thurles, Templemore and Nenagh. These councils should be re-established and other towns in the county such as Roscrea, Cahir and Fethard should also have their own town councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> In the case of Clonmel, the abolition of its council struck out 400 years of mayors and democratic governance of the town. I served on Clonmel Corporation and Clonmel Borough Council for 17 years and was very proud to be Mayor of the town. I know the need for various structures to ensure that the issues that arise in a town such as Clonmel are dealt with properly, locally and as close to service users as possible. To use Clonmel as a very brief example of the type of town that had its councils and mayors struck out, it was first mentioned in the Annals of Ulster in 916. It was established as a free borough in 1608 by royal charter granted by King James I. In 1650, the people of the town, led by its Mayor, Mayor White, and Hugh Dubh O'Neill and his Ulstermen, defeated Oliver Cromwell. It has had great mayors such as Charles Bianconi, an immigrant from Italy who established a public transport service not just in Tipperary but throughout the country from 1815 on and served as Mayor in 1845 and 1846. The foundation of the Labour Party took place in Clonmel Town Hall in 1912 and it is ironic that the Labour Party put its name to the abolition of Clonmel Borough Council in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> There is no doubt that local democracy is absolutely necessary in this country and that we need the re-establishment of town and borough councils. We must ensure that services are provided for and as close as possible to local people. I absolutely support the proposal for a commission to review the establishment of councils and to determine boundaries, propose functions, and deal with the rating powers, composition and size of new councils. I hope that commission can be established, produce a report and that the resulting implementation of the re-establishment of town and borough councils would be in place for the 2019 local elections.</p>

          <p eId="para_1001">I thank my colleague, Deputy Cassells, for bringing forward this Bill this evening. From listening to the commentary so far I believe it has been a very welcome and positive move. The Bill aims to bring decision making back to local communities. The fundamental purpose of the Bill is to empower local communities by enabling the towns across Ireland to have an opportunity to fight for their own areas. Abolishing town councils has left many urban areas without a voice. It resulted in paltry savings and robbed people of local representations. It deprived towns of councils dedicated solely to fighting their corner. In my own county of Galway we lost Ballinasloe, Loughrea and Tuam. The work that was put in through the years is very evident. In Loughrea, when it got its new motorway, everyone said that it was going to bypass them and they would be left out. In fact, the town council there had a direct inroad with the county council and worked really well with them. It managed to get two exits, and even though it is 10 km from where the motorway is Loughrea is a good, vibrant town because of it. Ballinasloe and Tuam lost their town councils and have lost a voice. Those towns are not getting the representation they need. They do not have the nine local representatives from their own town representing them on issues such as rates and car parking. When Ballinasloe was disbanded some €20 million was given over to Galway County Council that never came back, and then a process of equalisation had to be carried out with their funding. These towns are struggling and need the support of a local voice. The moneys they had amounted to very little. They were used for the tidy towns or the local voluntary groups. In fact, the major loss was the opportunity to get to the round table and talk with executives. There are now 39 councillors on the county council. Some €500,000 was spent extending the chamber to facilitate all of the new members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> While I believe that the municipal areas are working really well - I was part of it - there should be another layer where the voices of the larger towns can be heard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1003">The Local Government (Establishment of Town Councils Commission) Bill is being introduced to help strengthen local democracy across the country. The Bill aims to legislate for a key part of the Fianna Fáil general election manifesto commitment to re-establish town councils across Ireland on a fair and equitable basis. The Bill establishes a commission under the Local Government Act to review the geographical distribution of proposed town councils, and most importantly their powers and finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> Back in 2014, the last Fine Gael and Labour government made the short-sighted and destructive decision to abolish all 80 town councils in the country. I accept that the Minister of State was not in place at the time, but I still believe that it was a very destructive move. In my own constituency it included town councils based in County Waterford, namely Dungarvan, Tramore and Lismore. </p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> The purpose of this Bill is to provide a sound, fair basis to further legislate for the re-establishment of town councils. The main strength of town councils was in the personal touch. One of the town council’s most vital roles was regular liaison with the local area office of the county council on issues such as grass cutting, road and footpath maintenance, signage, area enhancement, weed control. These are the simple things that go unnoticed unless they are not done. The town council has an overall vision for the town. Take Lismore, for example. It is a stunning heritage town that was dependent on its town council for many roles to promote tourism, interact with the Tidy Towns groups and liaise with the local authority. The loss of the town council was widely felt by that local community. </p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> In Ireland towns were used to electing representatives to represent them at local level. These elected people worked for the betterment of their own town and local area. I looked at the county town of Dungarvan, with a population of 10,000 people, and noted that in 1898 local government in Ireland was reorganised and Dungarvan became an urban district. Local elections were held and new urban district councillors were elected. On 23 January 1899 the first meeting of the Dungarvan urban district council was held, and then in 2014 it was all wiped out. This system worked well, and contrary to what was peddled at the time, that we had too many elected representatives, we actually had the lowest number of councillors relative to population in the EU. </p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> Another example is the seaside town of Tramore, with a population of 12,000 residents. It lost its town council and the right to make local decisions. We need local solutions to local problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008"> Waterford was really hard hit by this Bill. It is the oldest city in Ireland, but we lost our city status. We had 800 mayors for 800 years. We always had our mayors and a fantastic status. Now we have two mayors. We have a plenary mayor and a metropolitan mayor. Confusion reigns supreme. Which mayor attends which event? It is unbelievable. One could not make it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> Fine Gael took a slash-and-burn approach to local democracy. Abolishing town councils has left many urban areas without a voice. It resulted in paltry savings and instead robbed people of local representation and deprived towns of having a council dedicated solely to fighting their corner. Its replacement, the municipal district system, has clearly left some towns at a disadvantage. Some of the bigger towns may have thrived. However, medium and smaller towns are still feeling the effects of the loss of local representatives. </p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> This Bill sets out a strict timeframe that will have the new structures up and running by the next local elections which are due to be held in May 2019. I am calling on the Government and all other parties to support this important piece of legislation so that local communities can be empowered in the decision-making process once again. </p>

          <p eId="para_1011">It is extraordinary to think that we are having this discussion this evening as the constituency review has come out, which I can only describe in terms of my own constituency of Roscommon-Galway as brutal butchery. I really feel sorry for the people of the Boyle area tonight, that famous village of Keadue and right up to the area of Carrick-on-Shannon, who are now going to be thrust into Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal. We were all in agreement with Cavan being taken out of that arrangement because it did not suit, but now they have put Roscommon into that area. What is happening is simply outrageous in terms of local democracy. There is no local democracy in this scenario. I welcome the fact that we have places like Aughrim, Kilconnell and Ballymacward coming into the constituency from east Galway. Deputy Rabbitte would know that many of the people there would have been quite unhappy with how they were left, and hopefully this will be better for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> We have to practise what we preach in terms of local democracy. That is why it is great to see Deputy Cassells bring this Bill forward. A commitment was given by Fianna Fáil that this would be revisited. What was done to local democracy by former Minister Hogan was simply outrageous. At the time there was much smirking and sneering at the town councils. Some of those town councils had given a profile to their areas that nobody else could give, and Ballinasloe is a case in point. It has a population of close to 7,500 people. Those people feel completely lost since their town council was taken away, simply because Galway County Council, based in Galway city, is not giving those people a good enough service. It is a great community with huge ideas and has fantastic plans for going forward, but it has no support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> The reality here is that town council for places with populations of around 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000, had a very important role to play. They gave a national profile to their locality. In this country we decided that town councils were only talking shops that do not achieve anything. The reality is that those larger town councils created quite a lot for their towns, such as Ballinasloe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">The pride they had in their locality was second to none.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> I am delighted with what Deputy Cassells has done and with the almost unanimous support across the House for this Bill because it is necessary to ensure that they come back. We have the town councils in the bigger towns. We are going to have to revisit the review of the constituencies in this Chamber if we are true democrats.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2017-06-27T22:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1016">I am glad to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on an important aspect of local government. I commend and thank Deputy Cassells for bringing forward the Bill. It takes a lot of time to get a Bill together and get one's colleagues and the rest of us to support it. This is a worthwhile discussion. It is one I have had around the country with councillors over the past year in my job in this Department. I have had interesting conversations with many councillors who work almost full time in their role and have been doing that for many years. Their views are mixed. Many would say they are happy that the municipal areas are beginning to work. There were teething problems at the start but they believe they can work. In many areas they are too large. We made a commitment a long time ago to consider reducing those areas. What Deputy Cassells is saying tonight is not very different from what some councillors say. Most agree that some change is required. I look forward to having that discussion with the Members opposite over the months ahead as we bring forward the report summarising the thoughts and views of councillors. We will make the changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> We differ on tonight's Bill not just on principle but also timing, which I think Deputy Cassells understands. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said earlier that it could delay our work as well. We will have some common sense when it comes to working on the issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> Some people mentioned people coming together in a voluntary capacity on Clonakilty Town Council and other areas, where there are business fora and other fora. Most people in this House started their political careers as councillors when the work was voluntary. That proves they were dedicated to public service. When Deputy Cassells and I were elected on the same day it was not a paid job. Today there are expenses which cover some costs but it is not a fully paid job. Very often the discussion of councillors' pay is driven by the media and is not fair because it does not reflect the cost of doing the job. That is something we should stand up to but it is being addressed in changes we will make to councillors' expenses and pay, hopefully in July of this year, to recognise the greater workload they have. We should all get behind that. </p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> When introducing the Bill, Deputy Cassells indicated that the main reason for proposing the legislation for the restoration of town councils was to address perceived neglect and lack of focus on town centres since their dissolution. He also raised issues such as the fact that towns are now part of much larger local electoral areas and have lost power to develop facilities such as arts centres, parks and enhanced urban spaces. He referred to some areas in Navan that we worked on together over the years where some great projects were brought forward by a combination in some cases of town and county councils. I accept, however, they were led by the town councils. </p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> I fully appreciate Deputy Cassells's intentions in raising these issues and would go further by accepting that his point about the size of the local electoral areas seems to have much validity. A Programme for a Partnership Government requires to be addressed. It is fundamentally important for its effect on local government and democratic representation. We did agree, and it was part of the talks this time last year, from May or June 2016, around the formation of Government. Deputy Mattie McGrath touched on that earlier but then he decided not to be part of that Government. He remembers all the discussions he had about issues he wanted raised but he was not prepared to back them up and come into government to make them happen. Most people around that table are concerned and did have issues related to changes in local government, the need for reform and so on. This Department recognises that and is willing to make changes when the need is proven and factually driven. That is the discussion we can have on foot of tonight's debate because we will not have time in these two hours to put all those facts on the table. We can certainly have that conversation as we tease this out and see how best to make the changes and the reforms as well. </p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> I do not necessarily agree that bringing back town councils is the best way to do that but I am certainly willing to have that discussion, to analyse the facts and the evidence gathered, along with all the different surveys of councillors who have given their views as well. A report was cited earlier which represented a couple of hundred councillors and which would be little different from ours and the feedback we are getting more formally. We can put that information together and analyse it to see how best to deal with it. </p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> Concerns raised by Deputy Cassells and others who advocated the return of town councils are not supported by available evidence. For example, the overall development capacity of local government across each county has been much strengthened by the integration of local structures and resources. We have evidence to prove that. There is peer evidence that many towns have benefited from direct access to the overall resources of the county councils. Various programmes of investment in the development and enhancement of towns have been implemented since the 2014 reorganisation. We want to be clear that when the former Minister, Phil Hogan, made those changes and the Cabinet backed and agreed with him - it was a coalition Government - it was in part to save money and reduce the cost of local government but it was also a genuine attempt to bring more efficiency to local government. I served on area councils at one time. I was not on a town council. Deputy Cassells was on both at different stages as well. There was often duplication and delays in decision making. I would go so far as to say that sometimes officials played us off against one another. It suited them to delay decisions. There was a genuine attempt to fast-track decision making in some areas on behalf of towns but not in every area. Some worked quite well but there was duplication, delays and inefficiency that had to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> Clear evidence of the progress made by local authorities has been compiled by the Local Government Management Agency. An outstanding example is in our own town, Navan, which Deputy Cassells mentioned. Meath County Council, in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, NTA, has launched the Navan town scheme, Navan 2030. This follows extensive consultation with local stakeholders. This scheme, involving investment in the order of €12 million, will revitalise and rejuvenate Navan town centre making Navan a better place to live, work and visit, along with many other schemes.</p>

          <p eId="para_1025">It started there but the wider county council is making it happen. That is my point.

          <p eId="para_1029">That supports the argument on both sides here. A reduction in some municipal areas might be a better way to do it. That is worth thrashing out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030"> The scheme involving investment in the order of €12 million will strengthen Navan's case. It will also strengthen economic growth in the town, supporting business, retail and tourism to meet the needs of Navan for present and future generations. I have seen many similar schemes proposed for other towns in my travels over the past year or two. </p>
          <p eId="para_1031"> I could cite other projects that have been brought forward since the 2014 reorganisation on lines similar to the Navan programme, such as the €3.2 million Tralee urban development project which Kerry County Council is developing with the close involvement of the Tralee municipal district members to revitalise, regenerate and improve the urban environment of the town of Tralee. In many areas projects of this scale and ambition would not have been feasible through the former town council system. I am not saying all areas but many areas, especially with constrained resources in the wake of the economic crisis which really affected many provincial towns in recent years. We may all accept that fact: it is not because of the changes made to town councils that some towns have suffered but because of the times we were in, and if we are to have a discussion or an argument and make decisions we should probably base them on factual evidence as we go along. </p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> The current strong and integrated system means local authorities are much better positioned to address these problems than the former system with 114 separate local authorities could possibly be. Further examples of continued and enhanced focus on towns by local authorities include: town management and development initiatives; creation of town teams to support the municipal districts; establishment of town forums; enabling the private voluntary and community sectors to work with the local authority to promote and market a town and support the municipal districts; the environmental community and economic activity; rates relief and waiver schemes; and use of former town council premises as enterprise centres in some cases. In our case the local sports partnership will come into that building which puts sports at the centre of a town and sends a message to young people. Some interesting programmes have happened because of this, as well as the provision of facilities such as public parks, playgrounds and closed circuit television, CCTV. Not all town councils really represented their towns when it came to meeting their different needs. In some town councils there were reports over the years of differences in relationships with local businesses. Some of these town fora which I have watched develop over the past three or four years have worked quite well. There are some things we can learn from as we make the changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> A range of initiatives, plans and programmes is being implemented, not only to revitalise towns but to maximise their capacity to act as key economic and social drivers for the wider hinterlands. As one of the Ministers of State in charge of urban renewal and regeneration, that is something I take a very active interest in. We are making several proposals in that area which will help revitalise and rejuvenate towns, regardless of the changes that will be made to the situation. Previous ones include the regional action plan for jobs, the local economic and community plans and schemes and programmes under which significant funding schemes are available for town development and improvement such as the town and village renewal scheme and the designated urban centres grant scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> Many local authorities have put in place arrangements to maximise the opportunities under these programmes and funding lines, ensure a strong focus on the management and development of towns and provide for a co-ordinated approach to the economic, social and cultural regeneration of towns and their environs. In addition to securing and co-ordinating investment under national and EU programmes, local authorities are making significant investments in town development and enhancement from their own resources, for example, through property tax revenue and savings from local authority reorganisation, or by providing matching funding under various programmes or on a stand-alone basis. For towns and rural areas which did not previously have local government arrangements, the benefits of local government reorganisation have been particularly important. Members spoke today about four or five areas which had town councils, but there were many towns which did not. In most counties, fewer towns had them than did not. That is not good enough. How could one make a decision at that time on reform? It was not possible to have the resources to widen the net to give all towns councils, but that is the reform being suggested. There are many good examples of towns which have benefitted through these changes.</p>

          <p eId="para_1035">I refer to the review of constituencies published tonight. Thankfully, Lower Ormond has been put back into Tipperary, with which the people of Lower Ormond will be extremely happy. The report stated that it was due to a lot of lobbying and recommendations which were made to the Commission. Inexplicably, however, it has taken another 4,500 out of Tipperary and put them into Limerick City. Already tonight, I have received four or five calls from people in Newport who feel extremely aggrieved. While lobbying thankfully brought back Lower Ormond, the Commission has failed to respect Tipperary's county boundary and gerrymandered it once again. This is not acceptable to us. We have had people feeling extremely disenfranchised over the last five years. While they have brought back Lower Ormond, they have taken out Newport town. I will be making my views known strongly to represent the people of Newport who cannot understand how this decision was arrived at.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> I commend Deputy Cassells for bringing forward the Bill. It was part of our election manifesto. As a party, we are trying consistently to get our manifesto into legislation. The only people the abolition of town councils suited were council officials. Once a month, they had to come into seven local urban or borough councils in Tipperary, depending on the size of the town, and answer for the way money was being spent and the jobs which had been done in the previous month. They had to say what jobs were up for completion in the next number of weeks. They knew they would have to come back within four weeks to give an account on the progress made on different projects. We had seven councils in Tipperary at Nenagh, Thurles, Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Templemore and Cashel. These were towns of varying size, but each one feels aggrieved at the loss of democracy they experienced. The former Minister, Commissioner Phil Hogan, took away this democracy from us with the stroke of a pen but what was saved was minuscule. All that was achieved was to take power away from local people. Whether it was TidyTowns or some other programme, people had nine people on a council to whom they could go. There was always a representative on the next street or down the road to whom they could make a point. To remove that democracy for no gain is hard to understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037"> I look forward to the commission. In our manifesto, we mentioned a figure of 7,000 and we need to revisit that. It would not satisfy a lot of towns in Tipperary which had urban local councils. We can do that when the commission has been established and we can get our urban councils back in place. It is essential for local democracy. I commend Deputy Cassells on the Bill which is good for local democracy and the people of our rural countryside.</p>

          <p eId="para_1038">On behalf of the people of Kildare, I convey their happiness that the county has been unified for the next general election. However, I feel for the people in Laois, Portarlington, Ballybrittas and Killenard who have been disenfranchised from their own county and placed in with south Kildare. While I look forward to working with them in the future, a county boundary should always be preserved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039"> I commend Deputy Cassells on the Bill which marks a decisive shift towards the empowerment of local communities and giving towns across Ireland a strong voice to fight their corner. The whole point of the Maastricht treaty was to ensure that decisions would be made as close as possible to the citizen on the ground, but that certainly is not what happened with Phil Hogan's decision. We now have the lowest number of councillors relative to population in the EU. The abolition of town councils increased the average of councillors to citizens to by far the highest proportion in the western world, which is appalling. A lot of the time neither national nor local government is popular. Local level can become the catch-all for a lot of problems. While it is easy to criticise, however, we have to work within an improved system to effect real change. Effective and autonomous local government with sustainable funding and better resources must be the catalyst for a better future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> As a town councillor for many years, I saw at first hand the incredible and unpaid efforts of communities and community groups to ensure we all got through the recession and worked to help one another. I was privileged during that time to see so many dedicated people carrying out work, delivering new, exciting and innovative projects, activities and initiatives throughout my town. When I look back, my mind is full of images which tell powerful stories of activities and people coming together to achieve and accomplish. I returned last night with a 90-strong delegation from the 20th anniversary of the twinning of my own town of Newbridge and Bad Lipspringe in Germany. Thousands of people have travelled over the last 20 years which I have no doubt would never have happened without the support of an existing town council at that point in time. It is therefore hugely important to restore town councils. I would not stop there. We need strong community councils and we cannot talk about local government without talking about the need to reform rates. I commend the Bill and look forward to the cross-party support.</p>

I listened to Deputy Munster speak passionately about her town of Drogheda which I know well and worked in with the <i>Drogheda Independent</i>. I have seen the impact in that large old borough town. The Government's Deputy Fergus O'Dowd spoke only in the last couple of weeks under a Topical Issue matter to call for its status to be returned. He spoke passionately about his town that night. In the context of the Government being in synch with its own Members, that Deputy spoke passionately about retaining the status of Drogheda, for which I commend him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, for his measured comments this evening. The take of the Minister, Deputy Murphy, on proceedings was disappointing and, more than that, surprising. To say there was no justification was an amazing statement. The justification comes down to the provision of services and the fact that one would have finances and a statutory budget. The most important thing is the difference between a statutory budget for one's town council area and what is in place now where local authorities throw a couple of hundred thousand into a discretionary fund which has no impact whatsoever in a meaningful sense. It is about the ability to be able to draw down one's own finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">On the retention of the local property tax, which was not in existence at the time of the abolition, that will be an interesting dynamic in terms of the 10,000 homes that are in my town and what it would mean if we had a statutory town council and the money was retained within the area. There would be a dedicated spend in that particular area. I mentioned the commercial rates earlier and how equalisation is hitting every business in an old town council area. That is the justification. If it cannot be understood by the Minister, there is something wrong at his end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> In terms of the county councils, there is a huge urbanisation drive in the country. This is driven by a planning philosophy in the Department that is concerned with creating critical masses of population under the national planning framework to progress major capital infrastructure. I do not disagree with the principle; I totally agree with it in terms of having dedicated services supporting dedicated centres of population. However, if we are to have that, we need an equitable system of government to support it and to ensure the huge towns we are creating have proper representation and that they can react to the issues and, more importantly, set out a vision for those towns so that we can help families. The Minister of State and I saw a massive explosion of population in our town over a ten-year period and we saw people trying to react to it rather than lead from the front, which is what these councils would do.</p>
