          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">Yesterday a young man by the name of Thomas Power was buried in Ballygunner, County Waterford. He has left behind a grieving wife, Bernadette; a mother, a father and two sisters, as well as a broader community of family, friends and neighbours. The previous Sunday, not feeling well, he had driven to University Hospital Waterford. He was subsequently transferred by ambulance to Cork but died on the road near Dungarvan. The case raises many questions. I do not know the Power family and do not want to add to their grief by raising this issue, but I would absolutely be failing in my duty if I did not highlight the case because the broader issue of the provision of cardiac services in the south east, including Wexford, Kilkenny, south Tipperary and Waterford, needs to be addressed. There are many questions that need to be asked, both in the context of the individual case and the broader issue. Was Mr. Power seen by a consultant who had travelled in the ambulance when he was being dispatched to Cork and were all protocols followed in the normal procedure of transferring a patient? That is the issue that really needs to be addressed in the individual case, of which there has to be a full clinical review.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">We need to get to the bottom of it. We have to learn from this tragedy. It must not have been in vain.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> Of course, the broader issue is the provision of a 24-hour catheterisation laboratory, cath lab, service, as well as broader cardiac services, in Waterford. Last year there was a commitment given by the Minister to review percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, and primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, services across the country. The Herity report assessed the need for cardiac services in Waterford and found that there was no need for 24/7 cardiac services, yet many clinicians on the front line there in providing life-saving care on a daily basis have stated publicly and to me privately that patients will die if cardiac services are not available 24/7 in Waterford. Tragically, we saw that unfold on Sunday evening outside Dungarvan.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> I will ask the Tánaiste a number of questions. Will she ensure there will be a full clinical review of the tragic case of Mr. Power? Will she also accept that there is now a need to address the fact that there is a deficiency in the provision of cardiac services in Waterford that is costing lives? Does she accept that there is a need for a full review and the prioritisation of the delivery of 24/7 cardiac services in Waterford as soon as possible?</p>

        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_2" as="#Tánaiste">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_5">I join the Deputy in expressing sadness at the news of the tragic death of a young man at the weekend while being transferred between two hospitals. I offer my sincere condolences to the family. Like the Deputy, I do not want to say anything that would add to the distress his wife and family are feeling at this time. I have discussed the issue with the Minister for Health who took a Topical Issue in the House yesterday when he gave as much information as he could. Obviously, we never go into the details of individual cases in the Dáil, but let me address some of the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> Of course, we want to ensure proper procedures are followed. That includes what the Deputy is saying about the circumstances surrounding this tragic death. Undoubtedly, in the first instance, the hospital will undertake a clinical review and a decision will then be taken on whether further action is needed. That is the normal process and it would be the right thing to do in this instance. If there are lessons to be learned, they should inform ongoing decisions in the provision of labs such as that discussed by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> To outline the approach the Government has taken, in the programme for Government we stated there would be a review of services in Waterford. That review was undertaken by Dr. Niall Herity, an independent international cardiology expert. It concluded that needs in the catchment area could be accommodated from a single cath lab. However, it recommended investment - the Deputy will be familiar with this - to improve services by providing for additional hours of cath lab activity each week to address the issue of waiting times and provide extra access for patients. The Minister is committed to providing the extra hours to ensure the mobile cath lab will be provided. The national service plan of the HSE contains a sum of €500,000 to ensure the improvements will be made. I should also mention that this week the HSE issued a tender for the provision of a mobile cath lab which will on an interim basis contribute to a further reduction in elective cardiology waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> Like everybody in the House, I recognise that we had a tragedy last weekend, but the broader point I want to make is about provision. As Health spokesperson, the Deputy will be familiar with it. We have had to deal with this issue in the context of cancer services generally, for example, breast cancer services. The precise location and the development of specialist services have to be based on best clinical advice. There has been a lot of debate in the House about specialist services. We know that we would be doing the very best for patients if we were to centralise services in so far as possible, while also ensuring good access for patients all around the country. However, we must ensure the location of PCI services is based on the very best clinical assessment.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">As I said, Dr. Herity undertook that review and the Minister is following his report.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_11">Of course the issue here is that there is a lot of clinical advice from Waterford suggesting that the Herity report, in essence, is flawed and does not take into account the broader geographical challenges of the south east. The fact of the matter is that, as we sit here, 170,000 people are more than 90 minutes from an acute cardiac service. This is because there is no 24-7 service in Waterford. There is considerable fear and anxiety in communities throughout the south east. This particular tragic case brings it to the fore and is very much in people's minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> This issue cannot be let rest. The Herity report is flawed in many other ways and clear issues have been raised numerous times by the clinicians, including the cardiologists who are working in the south east. They have said consistently that they need a 24-7 service. The mobile laboratory will deal with waiting lists but it will not deal with emergencies, for example, the emergency that presented last Sunday evening in Waterford.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Last September, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, committed to a review with regard to primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Can we now accept that the Herity report should not form any basis for that review and that it should be a full clean sheet with regard to assessing services in the south east?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_6" as="#Tánaiste">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">The organisation of primary PCI centres throughout the country is a national issue - there is no question of that. It relates to how we provide services for the entire population. We have had this debate in respect of other services. We absolutely have to take account of the best evidence available. The best evidence was got from Dr. Herity at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> There is a national review of the provision of PCI centres. It is important that we have this national review. I believe that the Herity report should be taken into account; of course it should, because it is an expert report that we already have. That does not rule out further developments in the Waterford area.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> It is time for a full national review of primary PCI services and that is being done. Based on the population of the country we can only operate a limited number of PCI services. I put it to Deputy Kelleher, as the health spokesperson of his party, that I believe he recognises that the location of specialist services and access to those services is singularly important. However, it is not feasible, in terms of giving the best service to patients, to have a PCI centre in every county. Certainly, every region needs to have access.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">Toilim leis an méid a dúirt an Leas-Cheann Chomhairle. I want to raise with the Tánaiste the matter of the Government's clear lack of preparedness in respect of meeting the challenges that Brexit poses for the island of Ireland. Tomorrow marks the anniversary of the Brexit referendum. Yet, there is no sense that the Government has grasped the magnitude of the economic social or political threats arising from Brexit. Let me spell it out for the Tánaiste. Brexit will negatively impact our people, economy and agreements. It is bad news for the island of Ireland as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> The reality of all of this is underscored in the warning delivered by the ESRI this morning. The latest ESRI report states that a hard Brexit will reduce the State's spending ability by €200 million per year for the first three years post-Brexit. The report states that it could cost us up to 49,000 jobs. That means €600 million less will be available to the Government to spend to end the crises in health and housing and to invest in public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> This should be a wake-up call to the Government to end its prioritisation of tax cuts for the wealthiest over investment in key public services. The Government needs to get real about the impact of Brexit. We know that the Taoiseach is attending his first European Council today.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The people of Ireland deserve to know which Leo Varadkar is attending. Is it the tough talking Leo Varadkar who, during the Fine Gael leadership contest, promised to campaign for the North to remain within the customs union and Single Market and that there would be no economic border on the island of Ireland or is it the weak Leo Varadkar who, after one meeting with Theresa May in Downing Street, became overawed and started talking about invisible borders? That is a fantasy in the context of the North leaving the customs union.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> If the North is dragged out of the customs union by the Tory Government, it will mean an economic border on the island of Ireland. Goods crossing the Border will become imports or exports and potentially subject to tariffs. It will mean an average administration cost of €100 for each of the 2.3 million lorries that cross the Border with goods every year. That is not seamless, frictionless or invisible. It is very real and it is time for the Government to get real. It is reported that only one in 20 firms has a plan in place to deal with the consequences of a potential customs border with the North. Yesterday, the Irish Exporters' Association called on the Government to up its game. The challenge posed by Brexit must be met with the seriousness it demands. That means a seismic step-change on the part of the Irish Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Can the Tánaiste tell the House whether the Taoiseach's position on the Border is as outlined in his leadership campaign, namely, that he will campaign for the North to remain within the customs union and Single Market with no economic border on the island of Ireland? Is that the position he will present to the European Council today? Can the Tánaiste also inform the House of the steps the Government is taking to prepare businesses for the withdrawal of Britain from the customs union?</p>

          <p eId="para_24">The Deputy's summary of the Government's approach to the Brexit negotiations lacks the reality of the work that has been done. All he has to do is look at the agreements reached and statements made so far, all of which put at their centre the priorities of the Irish Government. That is absolutely clear from statements by the British Prime Minister and EU levels. Michel Barnier's understanding and appreciation of the critical nature of the Irish position is clear. The issues about which we are concerned have been given priority over the last months in all the speeches by all the relevant people. There is acceptance that the priorities of the Irish Government need to be fully dealt with in the negotiations. What the Deputy has said is completely inaccurate. The Government has been working at a pace and has been carrying out extremely intensive diplomatic engagements, as all Members of the House know, with all the relevant people across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Having said that, we all recognise the seriousness of the challenge ahead. This morning's ESRI report clearly addresses the economic implications of a hard Brexit and the job losses that could follow. Every Minister, in all our negotiations and actions, has recognised this. This week I met the IDA and Enterprise Ireland. The engagement they have with business in terms of preparation for Brexit is absolutely clear and is going on up and down the country and, indeed, internationally. There is an increased focus on making sure we have new markets, that current businesses are protected and that our small and medium enterprises engage in innovation to ensure they continue to create jobs and deal with the challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> One year on from the decision of the British people to leave the EU, the opening of the negotiations is very welcome. They are important for all of us. It is one of the most serious sets of negotiations this country will ever have to face. The Irish issues are very well placed. I reiterate what we have said consistently, namely, that safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement and avoiding a hard Border on the island of Ireland will be an early priority. That was actually reaffirmed at the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in Downing Street. A long and difficult road lies ahead but I assure the Deputy that every initiative and step will be taken to safeguard the current situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in this regard this morning. As far as the economic implications of Brexit are concerned, we will continue to monitor them very carefully and the decisions we take in the months ahead and leading up to the budget will be prudent ones in terms of managing this economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">It is also worth noting that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which appeared before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight this week, believes the model the ESRI is using is seriously underestimating the impact of Brexit.

          <p eId="para_31">I have a very simple question for her and I will pose it again. The Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, when he was a Minister travelled to Donegal during the leadership election campaign and made a commitment to the Fine Gael members there. He said clearly, and stated this publicly, that he, as Taoiseach, would campaign for the North to remain within the customs union and within the single economic union to ensure there is no economic border on the island of Ireland. Can the Tánaiste state that this is Government policy? We need to get real about this discussion about a frictionless, seamless and an invisible Border and a hard Border. Is the position of the Irish Government that the North would remain within the customs union? Is it bringing that to the negotiating table at the European Council meeting today? Can the Tánaiste inform us what she is doing to address the fact that only one in 20 companies has any type of plan for Britain leaving the customs union?</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I am going to speak now.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> It is not possible to put into words the sheer horror of the inferno that engulfed the lives of maybe as many as 80 innocent people in the Grenfell Tower in London. It is emerging now that not only were people burned alive in that inferno but many of them were poisoned by cyanide released from the combustible material that was used to clad that building. What is now becoming increasingly apparent is that this is not simply a huge humanitarian and personal tragedy but it is an absolute scandal and outrage. It is not an exaggeration to say that what happened in Grenfell was murder by negligence, murder by austerity, murder by cutbacks, murder by inequality and murder resulting from utter contempt for the well-being of the less well off in British society.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> The Grenfell Action Group, the residents association, warned several times in the two years preceding this tragedy that the tower was an accident waiting to happen. </p>
          <p eId="para_45">In November last year, in prophetic words, they said, "It is a truly terrifying thought, but the Grenfell action group firmly believe that only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord", the housing association managed by Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council. As well as extending our solidarity to people, the question for us is could Grenfell happen here and are we prepared to ensure that it does not? We have had warnings from Kevin Hollingsworth, quantity surveyor and expert in this area, from Dublin Fire Brigade and other fire experts, all saying categorically that Grenfell could happen here. </p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Kevin Hollingsworth has said that 40% of the multi-occupancy units built during the period of the Celtic tiger are fire hazards. Fire expert, Noel Manning, says that the building regulations which were updated this year have completely ignored the warnings of fire consultants, that the regulations themselves are defective and can produce the sort of chimney effect that we saw in Grenfell because they do not have proper fire resistance because they do not provide for proper fire resistance between units in multiple-occupancy buildings. We have the scandal of self-certification when buildings are being designed and constructed and we have no inspection whatsoever of buildings that may be unsafe. What is the Government going to do about this to ensure we do not have a repeat of the utter tragedy and outrage of Grenfell?</p>

          <p eId="para_47">No words can adequately deal with the horror that unfolded in London with this horrific and tragic fire which saw the loss of so many lives. It undoubtedly raises questions in the UK regarding the kind of issues that the Deputy mentioned, but every country will want to examine whether their own fire safety measures are good enough, if materials are being used in cladding such as the ones used in the UK, and to review fire safety. The Minister has already started to do all that. Of course a tragedy like that raises question and means that we have to review everything. I want to assure the House that is being done. That process was started immediately by the Minister, Deputy Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> I will make some points on fire fatalities in this country. While each fire death is one too many, the annual fire death rate per million people in Ireland has been almost halved over the past 15 years from on average 11.9 fire fatalities per million population for the years 2001 to 2003 to 6.9 in 2014 to 2016. It is important to note that because we do not want people to become unduly anxious about this issue here, although questions arise. Our country is among those with the lowest incidence of loss of life in fire, which is an important context in which to consider this matter. Nevertheless, we need to examine recent builds and I take the point that the Deputy makes. We need to be sure that our building regulations are up to the task, that we have the personnel in force to supervise them, that the local authorities have the staff they need to continuously monitor the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> At present, there is a report into the fire in Newbridge, which I expect the Minister will discuss in the House once it is available. Following the introduction of the building control amendment regulation 2014 there is a requirement on the owner of a building to assign a competent professional to act as an assigned certifier in relation to individual projects, and to lodge a statutory certificate of compliance on completion with the local building control authority. We have been taking increased action to ensure that the building regulations are adequate to deal with the task that the Deputy outlined. Again, part B of the building regulations set the minimum standards for fire safety in the new buildings and in buildings that are undergoing material change, which is also important. That is now captured in our building regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">One can never be vigilant enough, but, as I said, the Minister has started a review and is examining the overall position. I have no doubt that if extra precautions and further initiatives are needed, they will be taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I know that we had a break and the nomination of the Taoiseach and so on, but even at this late stage it might be useful, if there is agreement, to have a minute's silence before the Order of Business in memory of the Grenfell Tower residents. A strong statement needs to go out from all of us in this House expressing our solidarity in the matter. It is welcome that building standards have improved and that the number of fire fatalities is low, but I am not satisfied with the Government's response to date. I have been told that, despite seeking submissions on the new building regulations and meeting some of the fire experts, the Government has ignored requests to update the fire regulations to ensure fire resistance and structural integrity between units is at the level it should be. The fire in Newbridge proved this. The buildings had been signed off on and certified as safe, yet the fire spread through eight units in 28 minutes. It should have taken 420. What we are being told by fire experts is that a huge percentage of buildings in this country are not safe because the regulations are defective and local authorities have been gutted of their ability to inspect them.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">As I said, this area is being reviewed by the Minister who took action immediately. He requested all local authorities to review their multistorey social housing units to ensure all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems; emergency lighting; means of escape - a big issue in the Grenfell Tower fire; and corridors, stairways and emergency exits, were in place and fully functional. I agree with the Deputy that safety must be our first concern. A meeting of the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management also took place. It was convened by the Minister on Tuesday, 20 June, to assess the readiness of fire authorities to respond to emergencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> On raising awareness among landlords, including landlords of households in receipt of social housing supports and rental assistance payments, the Minister asked the Residential Tenancies Board to notify all landlords immediately of their responsibilities and obligations to ensure their properties were fully compliant. A business control management system alert was issued to all registered users to remind those involved in works in existing or new buildings of the need to remain vigilant to ensure their compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> The Deputy has raised very relevant issues, as I said, not just in the United Kingdom and Ireland. I am sure that what happened in Grenfell Tower will prompt a re-evaluation internationally of the approach to fire safety, particularly in high rise buildings. Ireland should and will be no different. If what the Deputy says is true, if some people are concerned about specific issues, I hope they will bring them to the attention of the Minister immediately in order that they can form part of the review and the response to ensure extra measures will be taken, if necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">South Tipperary General Hospital is about to enter its 19th month of being forced to operate under the HSE's full capacity protocol. According to Paud O'Regan, a consultant who has been working at the hospital for a long time, the 79-bed medical department has been working at 150% capacity for a dangerously long period. Given that the new Taoiseach was Minister for Health, visited the hospital at the time and introduced the full capacity protocol, he will be aware that it was issued in spite of overwhelming objections from the INMO and all nurse and other trade union representative organisations. It results in the placing of additional patients in inappropriate areas of hospitals, leading to overcrowding on wards, not just emergency departments. It creates overcrowding problems in two areas of the hospital, instead of one. Organisations such as the INMO and emergency medicine practitioners regularly damn the protocol because, in their view, the care of all patients is compromised by this practice which creates a loss of dignity for patients and an increased risk of cross-infection. There are 19 patients on trolleys today in South Tipperary General Hospital, STGH, in this fine high summer weather.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">The longest day of the year was only yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> With regard to providing additional support to STGH in the short term, I was advised by the Minister for Health that the HSE is working towards additional surge capacity - these are wonderful words - through the fit-out of additional space on the first floor of the hospital to alleviate pressure on the accident and emergency department under the national framework for alternative accommodation on hospital sites. All we get is words, analogies and acronyms. This additional capacity was expected to be available from May and could be used to accommodate up to 11 trolley bays on a corridor. Yesterday, the Minister told me that he has not even begun recruiting to staff this accommodation.</p>

How can any hospital be expected to cope under such conditions? We have years of acknowledgement of the capacity issues in the hospital but there has been almost zero impact in reducing numbers of patients on trolleys. I would like to praise the consultants and all the front-line staff who try to deal with patients under those conditions. They have been working for 19 months under a full capacity protocol, FCP, which is another great acronym drawn up by the HSE. What does that mean?</p>

          <p eId="para_66">That protocol is for an emergency, not a 19-month period. This is not acceptable. Cashel hospital is lying idle up the road and we have brought the Minister to see it. Yesterday, the Taoiseach quoted John F. Kennedy but I have another quote from him from 1962: "The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie, deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth, persistent, persuasive and unrealistic". It is not acceptable that we have to put up with this. Deputy Kelleher outlined earlier what happened down the road in Waterford. We are not second-class citizens in Tipperary or Waterford and we need this hospital to be included in the new capital programme this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">Local public representatives were recently in the hospital to see the progress and to be brought up to date on the plans and the actions the Minister has taken in respect of the capacity issues the Deputy has raised. The Minister recognises that action needs to be taken and the Deputy will acknowledge that he has taken action. He outlined to the Deputy yesterday the provision of 11 new trolley bays on the first floor of the hospital, which are being put in place to alleviate pressure on the accident and emergency department. The recruitment process has been undertaken to provide the staff to support this.</p>

The Minister is also examining the additional supports that can be put in place for Our Lady's Hospital Cashel, because, as the Deputy rightly said, that could also help to alleviate pressures on the accident and emergency department of STGH. There has been progress. The Minister is examining the provision of additional modular units across the country and Tipperary could benefit from that as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">The myth has been peddled by the Government and the previous Government that the trolley crisis is getting better but we all know it is not. Deputy Barry mentioned The Who. I quoted lyrics from the band last week: "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss". Now meet the new Tánaiste and the new Minister for Health; they are the same as the old Tánaiste and the old Minister for Health</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> With regard to temporary patient accommodation solutions for STGH, the Minister confirmed in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled only eight weeks ago that the mini-tender procurement process for the hospital had still not even been finalised 18 months later.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">The Minister in his reply also made it clear that decisions will be made based only on the outcome of that mini-tender procurement process.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> It is all baloney. This is an indictment of the lack of HSE will to escalate this issue, particularly since there is, at least on paper, an explicit acceptance from the HSE and the Department that South Tipperary General Hospital has specific challenges in regard to capacity. That is not acceptable. We have to be included in the mid-term review of the investment programme. We have been neglected for too long. All the platitudes, mini-tenders and hotel accommodation in the world are no good for the sick people of Tipperary or the staff at South Tipperary General Hospital, who work so hard. We need new ideas. It cannot be the same old boss, old Tánaiste and old Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">On promised legislation and with regard to outlining Government policy, I need help to find out what is Government policy with regard to homelessness and moving people from emergency hotel accommodation into more appropriate settings. Despite the fact the previous Minister said they would be all moved from emergency hotel-type accommodation into more suitable accommodation by the end of July, the new Minister has now stated that is not the case. There seems to be continual drift and regular change of policy. In the context of the scrapping of the help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers, will that require legislative change and is the review ongoing? The Tánaiste might advise me where I can find out what Government policy is on housing in general, or is there a policy at all, given it seems to be changing very frequently? It is urgent, given many families are homeless continuously in this city and are being put into emergency accommodation that is wholly unsuitable.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">Those families who are in emergency accommodation deserve a straight answer from the Government today. We all know the figures. There are 695 families living in emergency accommodation at present. We know 60 families present each month to emergency accommodation. We know the Government in its action plan last year set a target that none of those families would be in emergency accommodation on 1 July. We know now the Government will not meet this target. Will the Tánaiste give clarity to these families? What is the new target whereby all families will be out of emergency accommodation in terms of hotel or hostel accommodation? Will the Tánaiste tell us how many of them will go into permanent housing accommodation as opposed to being just moved on to a different type of emergency accommodation?</p>

          <p eId="para_110">Today the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, outlined his top priority since his recent appointment as Minister is to ensure virtually all homeless families accommodated in commercial hotels at the end of May will, in the coming weeks, either have left their hotel accommodation or will have been notified of the alternative accommodation to which they will move. He made this clear today. It is worth noting that since Rebuilding Ireland was announced, more than 1,200 families have exited or have not entered homelessness. They have been prevented from entering hotel accommodation. They have been provided with alternative accommodation. That is a very significant number. It is important to say also that right now 650 homeless families are being accommodated in commercial hotels, but it is a reduction, which is going in the right direction, from the number of 871 recorded at the end of March, particularly against the background of the significant number of homeless families who have presented over recent months. The delivery of some of the accommodation solutions will extend beyond the 1 July deadline, but it is a considerable achievement now to have a very clear pathway out of commercial hotels for virtually all of the families accommodated in commercial hotels at the end of May.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">Tomorrow, at least 25% of the shares of AIB will be sold despite the expressed wish of the House that it should not happen. The new Taoiseach has promised to increase capital expenditure but has not indicated from where the money will come. We remain committed to using the proceeds of this sale simply to pay down debt. There has been no discussion in the House on the sale. We rely on the media to tell us what the share price will be. Originally it was to peak at €4.90 per share and now we understand after two alterations it is to be €4.30 peak per share, which is 40 cent less than originally expected. This lower valuation means the State is selling AIB at a discount, potentially leaving €500 million on the table. Will the Tánaiste confirm the Government will sell the AIB shares tomorrow and that it will sell them at a price that, in effect, is giving away the people's investment at less than what it is worth, simply to ensure a good market reaction and good headlines?</p>

          <p eId="para_119">Last Saturday morning Vera Twomey and her family packed their bags, left their home in Aghabullogue, County Cork and travelled to the Netherlands where they will remain not for days or weeks but for months, at least. They have done this to obtain medicine for their sick child. They have effectively been forced out of the country by Government policy. Shame on the Government. Last December, Deputy Gino Kenny's Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 passed First and Second Stages. Now, seven months later and mere weeks from the summer recess, it has still not been taken on Committee Stage. Why is that? The health committee has stated it is waiting for legal advice. When will it receive that written legal advice and when will it meet to discuss amendments?</p>

          <p eId="para_120">On the case mentioned by the Deputy, the Minister for Health has met the family on numerous occasions. He has made it clear that a course of treatment can be prescribed where a consultant endorses that approach. If a consultant endorses that approach and recommends it in a particular case, the treatment can be prescribed and made available. However, the Minister does not make that decision. It is a clinical decision and if it is not made in a particular case, his hands are tied. In the meantime, the work of Dr. Máirín Ryan from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is ongoing. She is chairperson of the expert group that is developing the operational, clinical and practice guidelines for the access programme for medicinal cannabis in Ireland. Officials are working on the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">I refer to the nearest school rule under the school transport scheme which was introduced a number of years ago. It has a particular impact on families living in rural parishes. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy John Halligan, established a group to deal with the issue but nothing has come of it. I can give an example of the rule's serious impact on people living in rural areas. In my constituency the parish of Gortletteragh is quite large, with 47 townlands. The school is smack in the middle. A number of families live on the periphery and are entitled to a school bus service but not to the school in the parish in which they live. They must travel to the next parish. In fact, some of them have to travel to Drumlish in the next county of Longford, which is totally inappropriate. When the rule was introduced, there was no consideration given to the impact it would have on people living in rural areas. My understanding is that it resulted from a directive or circular from the Department. Can an addendum be attached to it to recognise the situation in rural parishes? Everybody knows that people living in rural Ireland have a particular affinity with their parish. The school in Gortletteragh is holding a meeting next Saturday to discuss the issue. It is a serious problem throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I support what Deputy Martin Kenny said. I am aware of the problem. The school transport scheme is based on regulations that were introduced 50 years ago. The system must be re-examined. Owing to the changes in how the distance between the home and the school is measured, children who have been attending schools and are taking the junior and leaving certificate examinations find that they have to move 13 km or 14 km away. It is the wrong time to do it. These children are under enough pressure as it is taking their examinations without having to change schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">The scheme costs €175 million and provides support for 116,000 children. It has been designed on the basis of eligible children being necessary to define a route for carriage. Those who are not eligible can be carried on a concessionary basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">It also defines eligible children on the basis of distance to the school, and that is the way it is administered uniformly throughout the country. Any new approach would also have to be administered uniformly across the country. It is not possible for the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to devise a scheme for Leitrim, Laois or any other county and then say the Government will follow those contours because that would have a knock-on effect on other areas. The all-party approach was tried to determine whether there was an arrangement that could be uniformly applied. That is the basic difficulty. This is a uniform scheme applied nationally.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">With regard to the programme for Government's reference to building capacity for emergency and acute services, which is geared at reducing the number patients on trolleys, there is a four-pronged approach, each of which prongs I could discuss with the Tánaiste in detail demonstrating how it is not having a positive impact in reducing the numbers of patients on trolleys. I do not have the time to do that today, however. The problem affects Naas hospital, in my constituency, and the feeder hospitals of Tallaght and Blanchardstown. What is the Government doing to achieve better delivery in this area? Trolley Watch shows there are 303 people on trolleys today. This is 23% more than for the very same time last year. This is a considerable issue, as the Tánaiste is aware, and we need action and delivery for the people directly affected.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">Data from the HSE TrolleyGAR indicate that there was an improvement nationally from January to early May. The Deputy is correct that there has been an increase in trolley numbers since May. This is due to a series of factors, including an increase in emergency department attendances, elective activity and delayed discharges in certain hospitals. The figures remain too high; there is no question of that. The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE to identify measures across all hospitals to reduce overcrowding and drive those key implementation measures, which the Deputy referenced, aimed at reducing trolley numbers and improving patient experience and access to care in our emergency departments.</p>

I understand the steering committee has been established and that work has been ongoing for a considerable period. That steering committee last met about a month ago. My first concern is that, while the committee met a month ago, there is no report and we are months behind schedule. People who are at the front line are particularly concerned that the emphasis on alcohol in the last substance misuse strategy will not feature. The new strategy is now likely to be published some time after we go into recess. Could the Tánaiste, with the Minister for Health, ensure the principles of the strategy, if the not the strategy in full, are published so Members will have a chance to debate it? Ultimately, the strategy will run for several years and needs broad support to be successful. If it is not to be published before the House rises, could the main points of emphasis be published?</p>

One of them was the development of the new GP contract. I am glad to say that discussions are under way through initial engagement with the GP representative bodies. That has been very important and it started in January 2017. The aim is to develop a new and modern GP services contract because, as the Deputy said, it has not been renegotiated for decades. It is absolutely essential. The discussions have started and it is a priority. The situation we want to arrive at is that the GP services contract will incorporate a range of standard and enhanced services to be delivered to the public. The discussions are under way and there is engagement.</p>

We have developed, and the Government has prioritised, early childhood care. We have prioritised the funding of Tusla. We have prioritised making sure that there are enough social workers available to do the kind of work in the professional way that the Deputy outlines that needs to be done. Very importantly, we have had a whole series of reports from HIQA into fostering services identifying the very many strengths. Again and again, we have seen reports that state that children are getting an extremely good service from our foster parents. There has been increasing support of foster parents, which of course they need.</p>

It is a measure that Sinn Féin broadly supports. I know that there is broad support for it in the House. There is a commitment to develop that and to set out a plan within the first 100 days of Government. A situation is arising with the cost rentals. In their absence and in the absence of the affordable housing scheme, which was cancelled by the last Government, in County Laois a couple on more than €26,250 cannot get onto the social housing waiting list. That is an income of €504 per week. If they went into a bank to look for a loan, they would be swept out through the door by the bank manager. They would not even get a look in. We have a whole cohort of people caught between incomes of €500 and €1,000 a week who can neither afford a place to rent nor can get a mortgage. We have no affordable housing scheme and we have no cost rental scheme. This is in the programme for Government and we broadly support it. What is happening to it?

          <p eId="para_154">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_155">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to remove wages and working conditions of employees from being used as elements of competition among bidders for public contracts; to resist any downward pressure in wage rates and workers' rights; to safeguard the highest minimum standards established nationally by law, arbitration or collective bargaining and for that purpose to specify particular considerations which will apply to the selection of tenderers and to specify particular considerations which will apply to the awarding of contracts to economic operators and to provide that different considerations may apply in respect of procurements whose value are either above or below the EU threshold and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">In simple terms, I wish to address a major issue that has struck me since I entered Dáil Éireann. I have been contacted repeatedly by workers whose employers either refuse to recognise their unions, pay into a pension scheme or abide by a registered employment agreement or all of the above. This in itself is not unusual. The growth of precarious and low-contract hours that has mushroomed during the recession is not what surprises or worries me nor is it the ability of some employers to justify bogus self-employment ruses. It is the fact that this State is actually complicit in many of these practices. The State dispenses through its procurement policies and contracting for services directly and indirectly billions of euro every year yet it takes no real responsibility for what kind of conditions, pay or rights the workers who do the work for those companies are subjected to. Beyond the very minimal legal rights afforded by legislation, the State seems to have no interest in what happens to workers in companies it hires to carry out various practices or to provide various services. I believe this must end. This procurement Bill is about trying to start the process of ending the issue and addressing the wider issue at its heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> The Bill states that in procuring services or contracts, a public body can have regard to wider concerns other than simply the most economically advantageous tender, MEAT. This means that a public body when using public funds must have regard to the wider social and economic good of the country. It seeks two different categories of thresholds - to raise the bar in terms of workers' rights and to say that the State has a responsibility to ensure that employers that have the highest standard of employment rights are not at a disadvantage when seeking public contracts. It seeks to remove competition in terms of wages and working conditions among bidders for public contracts and to stop the State colluding either deliberately or by accident in a race to the bottom in terms of workers' rights. It specifically says that companies with a history of abusing workers or denying them the right to organise and be recognised as members of a trade union or companies that have failed for the previous three years to abide by a Workplace Relations Commission decision should be denied the right to enter into a tender for contracts from the State. It goes beyond these minimal steps and says that public contracting bodies should weight tenders in a way that will positively advantage those companies that allow union recognition, pay a living wage, ethically source their goods and services and do not use low-paid and precarious contracts. I will give a few examples. I started by saying that I have been consistently approached by people and workers who have failed by this state of affairs. Viking Direct supplies the Dáil with much material.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">It recently made its workers redundant because it wants to move to a lower-paid type engagement, which is much more profitable for it. It is not unprofitable - it makes considerable profit - but it wanted to move to a much different, lower-wage economy. It would not negotiate with the union that represents its workers about the redundancy they are receiving. I do not believe this State should support those actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Conduit and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment will know about another company that was recently awarded a lucrative contract for the emergency call-out service. This contract was awarded to British Telecommunications. It subcontracted to Conduit. I brought this to the attention of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and I brought to him the fact that it refused to recognise those workers' rights to join a trade union. It will not go to the Workplace Relations Commission and it will not deal with the union, and yet we are supporting that company.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Another case recently came to my attention. An employment order was passed by the State for security services, to allow for a small wage rise to €11.05 per hour. The State passed that order, yet 40 security companies have refused to increase workers' wages and have said that they are going to take a court case against the State to overturn that order. I believe that some of the security companies being used by local authorities, one being Top Security, are among those refusing to pay this increase. The State should not be financially rewarding those who are actively seeking to usurp basic attempts to give workers security, a decent wage, and a right to be recognised by trade unions. I recommend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_68">The following motion was moved by Deputy Catherine Martin on Wednesday, 21 June 2017:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">That Dáil Éireann:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">notes that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">- thousands of people in Ireland have been affected by poor quality housing following the building boom of the past 20 years;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">- the record of the current Government and the previous Government is one of clear failure to properly regulate the building industry and of regression of building standards;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">- there is a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to provide quality housing;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">- effective building regulation requires an independent regulator, not self-regulation by the building industry;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">- claims have been made by the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, that it will draft upcoming Government legislation in this area;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">- with the exception of the Pyrite Panel, there has been no public inquiry or reflection on the causes of the widespread quality problems in housing which continue to emerge and which are a heavy burden on the lives of those affected;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">- there has been no law reform that addresses the lack of remedies available to homeowners affected by pyrite, building regulations breaches and other housing failures;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">- the availability of effective remedies for defects when they occur is an essential part of the quality of housing;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_79">- the defects in housing resulting from this situation include defects which cause risks to life, health and well-being, as well as creating environmental damage and economic costs;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">- Irish home buyers in both the public and private sectors are poorly served by the law, as it stands:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">- the builder may be insolvent;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">- the building contractor may not be available to provide a remedy when the defect appears, for example, where the house or apartment has been sold;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">- the Statute of Limitations may bar the action; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">- there may be no defects insurance policy available to pay for the repair works;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">- these problems have not been addressed by the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, as while the regulations provide for mandatory inspections by certifiers appointed by building owners-developers and which require a certificate of compliance with building regulations to be lodged with the local building control authority before a new building is opened, occupied or used and are changing the culture of construction regulation, they do not create new legal remedies for homeowners;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">- the Law Reform Commission has proposed appropriate legislation on several occasions to deal with many of these issues and there is also a commitment in Construction 2020 ‘to consider and report on potential forms of redress for consumers and homeowners, including the potential for latent defects insurance’ and that redress must include new legal remedies; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">- many housing defects have ultimately been rectified at the expense of the State, rather than those responsible for those defects; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">calls on the Government to:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">- introduce new primary legislation to include a transmissible warranty of quality and assignment of causes of action in negligence from builders and those involved in the building process in favour of the first and subsequent purchasers of houses;</summary>

          <p eId="para_717">Fianna Fáil will support the Bill, which makes minor technical amendments to the relevant Act and will facilitate the implementation of the decision to protect the title, physical therapist. This decision was taken following a consultation process and was welcomed by the professional bodies involved. The Bill will amend provisions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 to address identified gaps in the provisions relating to the appointment of professional members to the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and to registration boards. It will permit a registration board to apply training and education conditions to applicants for registration who have not practised their profession and it will provide further conditions for the registration of physiotherapists and physical therapists in the register of physiotherapists.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> The issue of the protection of the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title, physiotherapist, relates in the main to the confusion among the public and other health and social care professionals regarding the similarities and differences in the role of physiotherapists and physical therapists. The legislation proposes to protect both titles under the one prescribed, protected title of physiotherapist to eliminate the ongoing risk of title confusion and the consequent risks to public safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> The Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists welcomed the decision made to protect the title "physical therapist" under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 which will eliminate the ongoing risk of confusion between the titles "physiotherapist" and "physical therapist". The Irish Association of Physical Therapists also welcomed the decision to introduce a new regulatory regime for physical therapists and physiotherapists. However, concerns have been raised by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists and these issues will need to be considered on Committee Stage. I would like to address some of them now.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> The society is actively liaising with the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and Department of Health officials on its concerns which are as follows. First, the Bill provides for access to the register for persons without a qualification. This is a huge public protection issue as anyone calling himself or herself a physiotherapist or a physical therapist without a qualification can apply to join the register. The only clinical requirement will be to pass an assessment of competence. This will expose the public to huge risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> Second, access for those who have never practised the profession does not have a time limit. This is a loophole that needs to be closed. Any assessment of professional competence must be equivalent to that for the physical therapy profession in order that all registrants will have a similar level of professional competency in order to ensure public protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> Third, the assessment of professional competence needs to be set at the standard of an IPTAS qualification, not a physiotherapy qualification. As this is the register for the profession of physiotherapists, the assessment of competence should be based on the physiotherapist qualification. It is imperative that all registrants have the same level of professional competency to ensure protection of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> The fourth issue is one I hope the Minister will consider. I also hope it will be discussed on Committee Stage. It arises because the Bill does not include the decision that registrants shall be required to confine their practice to musculoskeletal therapy. This is a requirement the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists believes is necessary in order to safeguard the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Given the urgency of all of these matters, I urge the Minister to ensure they will be discussed when the Bill moves to Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#FionaOLoughlin" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_725">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill and outline some of my reservations about it. I hope they will be taken up on Committee Stage by way of amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_726"> My essential reservation about the Bill is that it makes more than minor technical amendments to the relevant Act, particularly in its protection of the title of "physical therapist". I have discussed this issue with chartered physiotherapists and others in the medical and health profession and they share these concerns. Physiotherapists are trained in a medical system and share lectures with students of pharmacy, medicine, occupational therapy, speech therapy, radiology and so on. They also receive compulsory training in hospital settings as part of multidisciplinary teams, which leads to an holistic understanding of the whole self. This training is even more important in the isolated private setting in which we have a duty to protect the public. The networks of cross-disciplinary knowledge built mean that red flags are picked up and that there is an appropriate system for referral to other medical professionals. For example, chartered physiotherapists fast-track referrals to GPs and oncologists where there is a need to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> There is most certainly a role for physical therapists in the health system, but there needs to be a clear division in the interests of public health and safety between physical therapy and physiotherapy. None of us would like to hear that our dentist was regulated without proper and appropriate qualifications because of a dubious amnesty. We cannot have a dilution of services or of the standards of appropriately trained professionals. We have a duty of care to ensure the best possible professionals are available with appropriate training and education for all in the health care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> I want to deal with some of the specific issues outlined by my colleague, Deputy Mary Butler. The Bill provides for access to the register for persons without a qualification. This is a huge public protection issue as anybody calling himself or herself a physiotherapist or a physical therapist without a qualification can apply to join the register. The only clinical requirement is to pass an assessment of competence. This certainly exposes the public to huge risk. We believe the assessment of professional competence will be set at the standard of an IPTAS qualification, not a physiotherapy qualification, the designated profession in this case. The assessment of competence should absolutely be based on the physiotherapist qualification, not a lower one. It is imperative that all registrants have the same level of professional competency to ensure protection of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> There is a loophole in the Bill in that access for those who have never practised the profession does not have a time limit, an issue which needs to be addressed. In addition, the Bill does not include the decision that registrants shall be required to confine their practice to musculoskeletal therapy. There is a requirement to include this issue, purely to safeguard the public, which is at the forefront of the issues we are raising.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_730">The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the statutory regulation of the 14 professions currently designated under the Act, namely, the professions of clinical biochemist, dietitian, dispensing optician, medical scientist, occupational therapist, optometrist, orthoptist, physiotherapist, podiatrist, psychologist, radiographer, social care worker, social worker and speech and language therapist. Its main aim is to ensure greater patient care and tie all of those professions under one registration body known as CORU. Regulation is primarily by way of the statutory protection of professional titles by confining their use solely to persons granted registration under the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> This is a necessary Bill which is essential for the professions in order to ensure only those who are properly qualified and subject to statutory regulations will be allowed to practise the various disciplines outlined in the Bill. There is no doubt but that the public needs this statutory protection and guidance in order to be confident that those from whom they receive treatment are fully competent and accountable within their respective professions.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Before addressing the specifics of the amending Bill, it is appropriate to make a brief comment on the issues surrounding health and social care professionals in Ireland today. The issue of accessibility to the skills, knowledge and care of these professions is central in health and social services. Access to care for many citizens is very difficult and often denied. While citing the above named professions, one cannot fail to acknowledge the dreadful waiting lists on which young children with special needs must linger in order to access speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">The undercapacity of the public system means that parents are forced to spend hundreds of euro every month on private therapy if they want to see their child talk, walk or have any hope of realising their individual potential. This is wrong. The level of funding and efforts to alleviate this crisis have been grossly inadequate, and I call on the Minister of State and her colleagues to ensure this most urgent matter is addressed in the upcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> The Bill being debated today seeks to amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, and the main measures provided for in the Bill are to address gaps in respect of appointing professional members to the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, and to registration boards; to permit a registration board for the designated professions to apply training and education conditions to applicants for registration who have not yet practised their profession; and to provide further conditions for the registration of physiotherapists and physical therapists in the register for physiotherapists. Sinn Féin has concerns about the last of these three main measures of the Bill. This is the proposal to amend the 2005 Act by allowing practitioners to enter the physiotherapy register and continue to use the title "physical therapist" in their practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> We note arguments made by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, ISCP, that this timeframed arrangement must be firm and specific. IMPACT, the union which represents social care professionals, has not only voiced concerns but its opposition to the measure. It believes this has the potential to cause confusion for the service users whom the regulations are designed to protect. It argues that if the physiotherapist register allows access to practitioners who do not possess the equivalent qualifications and competencies to practice as a physiotherapist, the rights of the service users, patients, are diminished. Their access to the type of treatment and advice they require is effectively denied if they are unable to make a distinction between the effectiveness and the training of different professional practitioners. There can be no doubt about this, and it is at the core of what I believe is the whole tussle about the proposal involved. Patients should be able to make an informed choice between different service providers, and to do so with support from a clearly regulated system.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> In 2005, when the Act was being discussed, I raised serious concerns regarding the establishment of undemocratically accountable quangos. That concern remains today, and our apprehension regarding the lack of accountability has not been abated. It is proposed in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill that the Minister would have the power to appoint professional members to a registration board within CORU during the transitional period of the profession concerned. We believe that this should be done and overseen by the Public Appointments Service. Furthermore, we are disappointed that there is a possibility that the Minister missed a chance to bring counsellors and psychotherapists under a cohesive body with this amending Bill, although I did note the opening contribution of the Minister, Deputy Harris, on Second Stage of this legislation earlier in the week. In November, the Minister said he would do this, following a Private Members' debate on seeking to regulate crisis pregnancy counsellors. The Minister, Deputy Harris, started a consultation on this last August, but, to date, there has been very little information about the outworking of that consultation, until his contribution here on Tuesday.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> There are elements to the Bill which we support, such as the amendment to permit a registration board to make by-laws to apply conditions in relation to education and training to applicants for registration who are qualified for a specified period of time but who have never practiced their profession. The Act already has such provisions in respect of applicants who wish to resume the practice of that profession after not having practised the profession for a period specified in the by-laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> Sinn Féin would commend a revisitation of this amending Bill. We will, of course, table amendments to address all our concerns on Committee Stage. I look forward to hearing further comment from either the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Harris, before the conclusion of this Stage of the Bill's passage.</p>

          <p eId="para_742">No, I may not.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> The Bill is broadly welcome. From our point of view, it is more notable for what it does not do rather than what it does. In concentrating my points on the bits that are not in it, it is no reflection on the bits I favour that are in it. I will begin by echoing by the points made by some of the other Deputies earlier on the concerns that have been highlighted to us today and yesterday by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists which, as other Deputies have said, has raised a number of concerns and suggests putting forward minor amendments to protect physiotherapists' professional title. From the bits I have read on it, it would appear to be to be eminently reasonable that we would accede to these amendments. No doubt they will be dealt with at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> One of the issues not dealt with, which is something I have raised with the Minister on a number of occasions, is the gap in the law around section 47 on family law reports, which are compiled by psychologists and psychotherapists. The Bill could have addressed what is a gaping gap but did not do so. It probably addresses the deficit in terms of psychologists because when the psychologist registration board is established and the members appointed in the coming weeks it will bring the profession under full statutory regulation, which is obviously very important and will allow CORU to be empowered to investigate complaints which, to date, we have not been able to do. The gap with regard to psychotherapists is still wide open, and the Bill is disappointing in that we are speaking about legislation which is designed to increase regulation and oversight in the health sector but we are not doing anything about it with regard to psychotherapists.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> Section 47 reports are an incredibly important element of family law and custody cases. The reports are carried out by either a psychologist, a psychiatrist or a psychotherapist, with a view to determining the best interests of the child in separation or custody proceedings. Obviously, it is an incredibly delicate and stressful situation for all involved. The outcome can be decisive in terms of a child's life and whether it is joint custody, full custody or visitation rights. The potential for upset is vast, like everything in family law, and everything has to be transparent. The problem is that it is not. I have had a huge number of complaints from parents with regard to the lack of professional behaviour by people who are supposed to be professional in dealing with these section 47 reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> I will not go on about it too much, but one parent wrote to me about how she was relieved when she started the process because she thought that at last someone would listen to her children. She stated the first meeting took place in December and she felt from the beginning the therapist had taken an instant dislike to her and made no secret of it. It continued to Christmas and she explained the difficulties experienced and how, by the end of the assessment, she felt extremely vulnerable. She stated she was walking on egg shells, afraid to speak and afraid to say something that would annoy her. She said her devastation was set to continue as the report issued, as it was unbalanced, biased, completely inaccurate and highly critical of her as a mother. She stated the trauma and manner in which the report was conducted will remain with her for a very long time, and that she is beyond words to describe how she feels. She stated the psychotherapist failed her and her children.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Obviously, as none of us was there, we do not know what happened and cannot comment on the details of the case, but we know that despite this woman's deeply traumatising experience, there is no one to whom she can complain and nobody to investigate it, which is appalling. There is a missed opportunity to regulate psychotherapists under this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> In the absence of regulation and as an interim measure, it would be possible for complaints about psychotherapists producing section 47 reports, for example, to be investigated through a minor amendment to a statutory instrument. Like Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, I note the Minister's comment last Tuesday that he will examine this issue, but it is past time for examining it. The reality is that anyone can set up as a psychotherapist without qualifications, experience or training. It is good that we are considering this legislation and I welcome the Minister's statement on Tuesday about his decision to proceed with the designation of two distinct professions under the 2005 Act, counsellor and psychotherapist, but it is a question of how long we will have to wait for this. The Bill is a missed opportunity to do it. I should balance my remarks by pointing out that there are thousands of brilliant and dedicated psychotherapists who have undergone extensive training. It is also unfair on them because the hard work they have done is not recognised by statute; they are, therefore, on the same footing as the man or woman who undertakes a six week programme online and puts up a plaque stating he or she is a psychotherapist.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> There is incredible urgency attached to regulating this area. A woman who had suffered a miscarriage of a much wanted pregnancy rang my office recently. She was distressed and upset at the loss of her baby. The counsellor to whom she had gone had actually told her it was her fault, that she obviously did not want the baby enough and that that was the reason the baby had died. One can imagine the trauma that caused. We have heard about so-called therapists telling people to do their garden or clean their house as therapy. There were the scandals at Roebuck Counselling Centre where management tried to scalp money from clients and their families. One farmer from County Mayo whose wife was an alcoholic and being treated there was asked to hand over €200,000. There is no regulation. While I acknowledge that the Minister has said he will address the issue, the reality is that if we do not do something in this legislation, it will probably be years away. It is urgently required.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> To emphasise how dangerous it is to leave professions unregulated, I will refer briefly to the case of Joseph Maskell, a defrocked priest who was accused of sexually abusing young girls while working as a counsellor in the United States. He fled from America back to Ireland in the 1990s and set himself up as a psychologist in Wexford. He was employed by the South Eastern Health Board for a time before setting up in private practice in Wexford. As well as being an alleged serial child abuser, he was also allegedly involved in the murder of a nun who had exposed some of his activity in America. What is interesting about this case is that it was the diocese of Ferns, rather than the health board, that first rang the alarm bells after he had said mass one day in Curracloe. The Ferns diocese had been alerted by the diocese in America about him. However, it is worse than that. The diocese tried on several occasions to warn the health board to stop this individual from practising, according to a file disclosed by the diocese which we have seen. Despite this, it was two years before the health board received an undertaking from him that he would not work with children under 18 years of age in his practice. It is incredible to note that the health board did not make him stop practising but just accepted an undertaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> That is what happens when professions are not regulated. If the registration of psychologists had been compulsory in the 1990s, would it have been as easy for a paedophile priest to be employed by the State and work as a psychologist with children? These are the consequences. The dysfunctionality of the South Eastern Health Board is well known and perhaps it might not have made a difference, but we must hope it would have. The desired impact of regulating professions which the Bill seeks to do is laudable. In that sense, I support it and believe it is urgent. However, there are still substantial gaps that must be addressed and I am keen to examine how we can address them. </p>
          <p eId="para_752"> Again, I support the proposals for amendments on a later Stage relating to chartered physiotherapists.</p>

          <p eId="para_753">I have taken many notes on what Members have said. On behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, I thank Deputies for their contributions. I note that they broadly support the Bill. As the Minister indicated, its main purpose is to address the gaps identified in provisions for the appointment of professional members to the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the registration boards to permit a registration board to apply conditions relating to training, education and experience to applicants for registration who have not yet practised their profession and to provide for further conditions for registration on the register of physical therapists in advance of making regulations to protect the title of "physical therapist".</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I have noted the concerns of Deputies Mary Butler and Fiona O'Loughlin and the issues they raised, particularly regarding best practice and relevant issues surrounding who is and is not included. As Deputy Clare Daly said, people can think that after taking an Internet course they can put up a sign and claim they are professionals, but they are not. I will relay these points to the Minister who concluded his speech by saying he looked forward to Members making a contribution on this Stage and discussing amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> I cannot answer on some of the issues raised by Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, but I will identify them to the Minister. I agree with the Deputy on waiting lists, as an individual and a public representative. Many parents are obliged to seek proper speech and language therapy services in the private sector. There is an urgency and the Bill will help in that regard. However, we must recognise that many parents are in a desperate state in trying to get their children into services which are not available when they should be. Some of the issues raised by the Deputy can be revisited on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> I welcome Deputy Clare Daly's comment that she believes the Bill will go a considerable way, even though there are still some areas to be covered. These gaps can be covered by amendments on Committee Stage. I will also relay her comments on section 47 reports to the Minister. I listened to her description of an individual's experience in going to a therapist and being treated in the manner described. None of us was there, but there is no need for anyone to treat a person who is attending a service during a difficult time in such a way that the person comes out feeling, first, that they were not heard and, second, that they were not treated with respect, regardless of the service they were attending. I have also taken note of that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> I again thank Deputies for their contributions. The Minister looks forward to a further constructive examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_763">This is a very important Bill. It has many ramifications. We need to make sure that we consider carefully all the interests concerned. We should seek to accommodate those who have genuinely held concerns with regard to road safety, the protection of biodiversity and the interests of landowners and farmers so we can have meaningful accommodation for all relevant interests appropriate to a Bill entitled Heritage Bill 2016. This has not happened to date, however. The Bill, as originally drafted, caused deep concern regarding the impact on national heritage and biodiversity. As completed in the Seanad, following further changes introduced by the Minister, it is arguably worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> There are a number of different, but equally serious, issues at play here with this Heritage Bill. The primary rationale for the Bill was to reverse the provision in the Wildlife Act 2000 and allow for the burning of vegetation in March and the cutting or destruction of hedgerows in August. Of course, there are many arguments for and against such a measure that must be considered in this Chamber but much is at stake between environmental concerns, farming concerns and issues of health and safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> The pretext the Minister has given for allowing the destruction of hedgerows in August is that of road safety. Of course, road safety is vital. A year ago, early on a Sunday morning, my wife and I and my four young children were driving along a narrow country road just beside my house. A speeding white van came in our direction and, without slowing down, it smashed into our car and shunted our seven-seater about 10 ft. back into the ditch. We were all injured. My very young daughter and I sustained head injuries. I am thankful that we all seem to have recovered since then. I know how important road safety is, therefore. It is of paramount importance. It is a life and death issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> A provision exists within the Road Traffic Act 1993 to allow for the removal of overgrown hedges if they are deemed hazardous or potentially so. If it is not sufficient or used properly, then we have a responsibility in the Oireachtas to reform it or make it fit for purpose. In the Seanad, Sinn Féin cosigned an amendment to extend the application of section 70 orders so landowners and members of the public could apply to the authority for the section 70 order so they could cut roadside hedges if they are a risk to safety. This is a very practical measure which would allow for a degree of shared vigilance and responsibility. This was voted down by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> I would like to know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, or the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, consulted the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, on the issue raised in the Seanad debate. If road safety is the primary motive behind a section of this Bill, why has the Minister responsible for transport not been more closely involved? It is of great importance to his portfolio. Why has the Minister not contacted the Road Safety Authority to discuss the road safety concerns she has? If she has not, it is a glaring gap. The Road Safety Authority confirmed to me two weeks ago that it has had no contact with officials from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on this matter. We are told this Bill will bring about road safety, but neither the Minister responsible for transport nor the Road Safety Authority has had an input into its development.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> How closely has the Minister worked with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the proposals to assess the legislation's impact on nature? What consultation has there been with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine? The IFA has met the Minister on a number of occasions to lobby for this Bill. The advantage to farmers is that land management is easier if hedge-cutting is allowed in August. It can be more convenient for them to cut during this time. There is, however, an environmental cost. The Minister responsible for the environment may not be aware of this as he has not met environmental groups such as BirdWatch Ireland or the Irish Wildlife Trust, despite their numerous requests. Ministers must realise that the importance of hedgerows to Ireland's nesting birds and to biodiversity cannot be exaggerated. Approximately 50% of Irish birds nest in our hedgerows. The role of hedgerows is particularly important in light of the very low percentage of tree cover in Ireland. We have only about 10% tree cover in this country. Ireland's forest cover is among the lowest in Europe, second lowest only to Malta. The total amount of hedgerows in Ireland is equivalent to 37% of our forest area. Our native woodlands make up only 1% of the country's land area.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> Last year, in the north of Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales, the month of August was closed to hedge-cutting in order to comply with an EU directive to protect wildlife. Therefore, why are we seeking to extend the period when it raises environmental concerns?</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> We have experienced a huge decline in the variety of our bird species over the past two decades. Currently, one quarter of our bird species are in decline, as are 31% of our habitats. Increased hedge-cutting would not only have a negative impact on our bird population but also on our bees, which are an integral part of the environment for pollination. Believe it or not, it is worth an estimated €54 million in economic terms every year. It is invaluable in supporting our delicate ecosystems. Has the Minister factored in the effect this will have on the all-Ireland pollinator plan?</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> A study carried out in Britain indicated that the frequent cutting of hedges has a significant impact on biomass production, with fewer flowers, whose number is down by 75%, and fewer berries, whose number is down by 83%, than with monitored, uncut hedges. Frequent cutting obviously has a serious effect on wildlife.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> Hedgerows have another valuable environmental role as they sequester carbon from the environment and help prevent soil erosion and flooding.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The importance of reducing the cutting of hedges was recognised in the North. The practice in the North is now in line with ours. The National Trust stated that this date change would present little difficulty and that farmers recognised the benefits of biodiversity that an extended protected period for hedgerows will deliver in providing wildlife corridors. However, the Minister wants to take a retrograde step and reverse the measures put in place by the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> What is bizarre is the pseudo-scientific approach that the Department is taking. It talks about a pilot, but there is no scientific basis for the proposed changes and there is no methodology for this particular pilot. Pilots, by their very nature, should have measurable data that can be collected for a level of analysis. This does not exist in the Government's plans. BirdWatch Ireland urged the Minister to commission research on Irish egg-laying dates before any changes were made. The Minister has ignored this advice and wants to make legislative changes first and then conduct the research afterwards in this nationwide two-year so-called pilot programme. The public consultation on the Wildlife Act in 2015 received 187 submissions, but no report was ever published. Why was that?</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> Effectively, the Government is now railroading legislation without actually having the vital engagement with the public. Engagement implies a conversation and reciprocation. This seems to me like a data collection exercise with no public output. However, a copy of an internal report on the consultation was acquired by the Hedge Laying Association under the access to information on the environment legislation, which states that the existing closed period is "a strong, effective protection measure and any changes proposed will need to be underpinned by a robust, credible case". It would be important to engage with the European Commission on any proposed changes, given the interest in the protection of wild birds generally and in the context of the implementation of the birds directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> The Minister stated in a response to a parliamentary question I asked a number of weeks ago that officials in her Department have had informal discussions with the European Commission on only one occasion. As far as I am aware, the actual detail of the proposals have not even been presented at EU level. Sadly, but obviously not surprisingly, this seems to be a decision grounded in political rather than environmental or safety concerns. I find it laughable that this Government gives out about Trump when it comes to the environment. This Government's output with regard to the environment is extremely poor. With regard to the level of carbon output, this country is going to miss its targets and will be lumbered with millions of euro of fines in future. We are going to be one of two European states that will miss our objectives with regard to carbon reduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> The Minister railroaded through a measure on Report Stage in the other House which provided for wholesale and ungovernable derogation to anyone purporting to cut hedges in the interest of public health and safety. That has been introduced by the Minister as a permanent change to section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976. There is no mechanism to govern this and it is wide open to abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> The great irony of this is that it is not a heritage Bill. This does not serve to preserve our heritage. The Minister should be a guardian of our heritage and not the servant of lobbyists. Our hedgerows are a national asset and need to be treated as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> In the so-called consultation two years ago, Ms Shirley Clerkin, the heritage officer of the Minister's own county council of Monaghan, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_780">An assessment of data and research with regard to which species will be impacted by any proposed changes is necessary before decisions are made, in addition to the impacts on the overall functioning of the hedgerow as a habitat and a wildlife corridor.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_781">Science based research is required for Irish conditions including bud burst, individual species behaviour and breeding habits in relation to climatic conditions. Further research is required into percentage of birds having third broods. The bird nesting season is starting earlier each year and in recent years we are seeing an increase in the number of birds nesting outside of a closed period. There are already many exemptions to the current closed dates, and any move towards more exemptions or a blanket exemption for roadside hedges all year round could have a devastating impact on wildlife.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> In the sections dealing with canals and Waterways Ireland, there is a failure to include the protection of natural heritage in the remit of the authority and a failure to allow it make by-laws to protect natural heritage or even to control invasive alien species. Again, we see that this Heritage Bill does little to protect our heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> The Minister must also take heed of the almost 30,000 concerned citizens who signed a petition demanding that this Bill be scrapped due to the very certain and devastating environmental impact it will have. To quote one of the submissions received from a member of the public, "Hedgerows represent one of the potentially greatest assets to an increasingly intensively managed countryside and we need to set national policies which recognise this and reward farmers for correct management."</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> In Meath, there are more than 22,000 km of hedgerows in the county, more than in most other Irish counties. Meath hedgerows are not only part of the ecological fabric of the county, but part of the history of our county. Some 80% of the hedgerows in our county can actually be seen on maps from 1840 and many of those hedgerows are much older than that. There are 36 species of trees and shrubs in the hedgerows in County Meath with hawthorn, elder and blackthorn the most commonly found. Other common hedgerow shrubs include gorse, wild privet, holly, willow, wych elm, and hazel.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> The heritage officer for County Meath has said that there is "no scientific basis presented for a proposed revision to the dates of the closed period". She stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_786">It is the opinion of Meath County Council that the current provisions of Section 40 of the Wildlife Act already allows for significant derogations for road safety concerns, agricultural, forestry, fisheries and construction activities. These dates are firmly established within the Local Authority work programme and are not presenting any major operational difficulties which would warrant a revision.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> Burning is a huge issue, with many valid concerns on both sides. In the last number of months, we have witnessed huge-scale out-of-control wildfires destroying habitats, killing wildlife and significantly endangering people. According to the chief executive of Coillte, Mr. Fergal Leamy, the recovery costs from the large-scale blaze at the Cloosh forest alone is expected to reach €4 million.<b>
						</b>Controlled fire has obviously been used by Irish farmers for centuries. When correctly planned and applied, controlled burning techniques can produce beneficial results. While many farmers manage their land responsibly, it only takes one irresponsible, less than environmentally aware farmer to do huge damage. However, the blame for wildfires cannot be laid solely at the feet of farmers. Many are due to the irresponsible behaviour of the non-farming communities. Some of the practices are the practices of thugs who live nowhere near rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> Many of the measures laid down by the Government are particularly unhelpful to farmers who wish to practise controlled burning. It is nearly impossible to adhere to the guidelines as set out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on controlled burning. One has to contact numerous different bodies and give a seven-day notice, which makes it nearly impossible for farmers to plan ahead given the unpredictability of Irish weather. There is a shocking statistic in this regard. Only one group applied for a controlled licence to burn last year. In the whole infrastructure of the State on this particular issue, which is taking the time of this Bill, only one group applied. That means that the Government practice as it stands is irrelevant as it is failing farmers miserably and failing the environment as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> Our wildlife is suffering hugely as a result of uncontrolled upland burning - the charred habitats; the lifeless burnt bodies of sheep, lambs and other animals; and the destroyed nests and burnt eggs not to mention the impact on our blanket bogs and water supply. The problem of illegal burning is greater than what this legislation can provide for. I urge the Minister of State to get involved in co-ordination between the relevant Departments on this matter. The Departments responsible for this should be the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government; Agriculture, Food and Marine; and Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. </p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The nature of this debate is very worrying. In fact, it is only a veneer of a debate. On Report Stage in the Seanad, the Minister railroaded measures through that undid much of the good inter-party work that was done in amending the Bill to begin with. We are particularly concerned with section 7(1) of the Heritage Bill 2016, as concluded in the Seanad. It provides that the Minister may make regulations relating to land referred to in that section to allow the burning of vegetation during such period or periods during the month of March of such year in such part or parts of the State as specified in the regulations, subject to such conditions or restrictions specified in the regulations to ensure the protection of fauna or flora. This is hugely concerning because regardless of the ban on burning in section 40, the Minister can make regulations to specify when and where burning can be done in March. As these regulations will be done by statutory instrument, and they can be drawn as broadly as the Minister chooses, specifying that burning can take place any time in March in any place means that there is no guarantee or oversight from the Oireachtas on the type of restrictions and conditions the Minister has discretion to impose. This is effectively a blank cheque for burning. </p>
          <p eId="para_791"> These provisions are introduced for a two-year period initially pursuant to section 7(4)(a) but can be extended by the Oireachtas for three years and endlessly extended, pursuant to section 7(4)(b). At no time and in no place in the Bill does it require the collation of data or the evaluation of controlled areas to compare the effect of these resolutions or speak to how oversight of these provisions or assessment of them would be addressed by a very under-resourced National Parks and Wildlife Service. There are genuine concerns on all sides irrespective of the issue at hand but the current Bill's provisions and the approach to this Bill are not the way to resolve the complex issues underlying these issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_792"> In the long run, the Bill will not help farmers either. We need a new strategy for our uplands where farming is in decline instead of not under-researched, piecemeal measures that will ultimately do more harm than good.</p>

        <speech by="#BridSmith" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_793">I want to concentrate on Part 3 of the Bill. The Minister of State will probably not have time to answer me today but could he tell me why there is such passion on the part of the Government, Fianna Fáil and others to get this Bill passed? If the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is charged with safeguarding our heritage, how could it be so adamant about getting this Bill through when all of the scientific and natural evidence shows that this Bill has little regard for the consequences for wildlife and the various habitats that dominate the country? Like other Deputies, I have attended many briefings from groups like BirdWatch Ireland, the Federation of Irish Beekeepers' Associations and An Taisce, which want to stop these proposed changes. As Deputy Tóibín said, tens of thousands of people have signed petitions to try to stop this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> For me, the most important thing is the experience one has in this country despite the fact that we have lost a lot of habitats and species and given also that there has been a reduction in the number of bees that inhabit the country to the tune of about 40%. There is red listing on about six or seven native species of birds. Despite that, one gets a huge amount of pleasure from walking the hills and laneways, cycling the pathways and using all the new tourist attraction schemes that have opened up like the Wild Atlantic Way and the use of the old railway networks for cycle paths. I was recently on the Saltee Islands. The amount of visitors who go there to see the wildlife, including sea birds, take photographs and bird watch is incredible. We are a very wealthy part of the planet when it comes to attracting tourism in addition to being advantageous to our own population in terms of enjoying what the planet has to offer. I noticed that a new pathway has opened up that ranges from the glens of Antrim down to the Beara Way in west Cork. This is 900 km of walkways that will be something like Ireland's Camino. Can one imagine the kind of beauty and wildlife this walkway will pass through that will be vulnerable if this Bill is passed? </p>
          <p eId="para_795"> What this Bill does is take the period for cutting, which is now closed from April to August in order to protect vegetation and wildlife during the months of growth and reproduction, and extend it by an extra month at either end. I cannot understand the thinking behind that. During these periods, wildlife is beginning to nest and reproduce and is at its most active. One looks at the level of insect species that inhabit our bogs, uplands and hedgerows. Why would we deprive them of the opportunity of reproducing and existing with a knock-on effect on the food chain and other species? Recent reports indicate that 28% of Ireland's breeding birds are currently in decline and another 31% of habitats are in decline. Bird species are in decline including the barn owl, the yellowhammer, the curlew, the golden plover, the red-breasted goose and the meadow pipit. Their names are beautiful never mind the type of creatures they are. This sort of action would deliberately endanger them. Due to the low cover of native woodland, hedges are very important in providing habitats for many birds. Originally, these woodland species had corridors for maintaining the diversity. This makes the maintenance of hedgerows very important because these birds depend on them. </p>
          <p eId="para_796"> This Bill has been amended somewhat. I understand that there is a described trial period of about two years for hedge cutting limited to hedges by the roadside. However, I would argue vigorously against this because this kind of measure and the logic behind it have complete disregard for what should be the guiding principles of any action of the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht in connection with habitats and wildlife. I do not believe that it would be countenanced anywhere else in Europe. Indeed, many Europeans come to this country precisely to see and experience the wildlife. As Deputy Tóibín said, I cannot see any merit in the argument that it is about road safety. Allowing land users to define what road safety means is crazy. It is ludicrous. We would not allow any other group to make that definition. That definition must be the ownership of the Road Safety Authority rather than a bunch of land users. This is not to insult them. However, no group of land users, regardless of what county or area they are in, should be able to define road safety. They should, of course, contribute to road safety policy in an area but they should not be able to make those decisions and carry out those actions. </p>
          <p eId="para_797"> I think the Minister of State was here when I spoke about the spate of wildfires we saw during May and their devastating consequences for bird habitats, food stores for animals and animals themselves. There is very little effort here by the State. It was clear from the answer I received from the Minister of State that the effort in policing the deliberate setting of wildfires is minuscule. The Minister of State did acknowledge that there has been only one application for controlled wildfire during the period but this indicates that most of them do not bother applying because the policing is so lax and hands-off. Why would someone bother applying for permission to burn when they can get away with doing it illegally? Events this summer have proved this to be so. Regardless of what we say and the laws we pass, the Bill will give a green light to future illegal burning. I do not want to see more people prosecuted and I certainly do not want to hound farmers or hill farmers but there is a lack of a serious effort and enforcement by the State in terms of taking sustainable farming seriously. There is one area where I have seen it work and work beautifully and that is the Burren in County Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">There is a huge buy-in from farmers into the idea of sustainable farming and local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are very much focused on ensuring that sustainable farming works. That sort of attitude to nature and the environment is what we need and it is how we need to approach the farming community, whether in the uplands or the lowlands, and those to whom this Bill wants to give authority to decide on road safety policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_804">I have only been here for ten years, but I am still learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_805"> Food Wise 2025, the new ten-year strategy for the agrifood sector, was published in July 2015. It includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness, as well as specific sectoral recommendations. The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success. The Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, chairs the Food Wise high level implementation committee, with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies. The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis in order to identify and solve problems quickly. Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular themes or sectors. We will be publishing Steps to Success 2017, the second progress report, next month.</p>
            <p eId="para_806"> Any concerns on the impact on the agrifood sector are at the top of the Government’s Brexit agenda. Our ongoing consultation with stakeholders, together with our engagement with UK, Northern Ireland and EU counterparts, will be informed by the need to have the implications for the agrifood sector understood and taken account of as the negotiations unfold. In light of the UK vote to leave the EU, Brexit has been included as a standard item on the agenda of each meeting of the high level implementation committee. It is clear that driving the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, in particular those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will assume even greater importance in light of the UK decision. My Department and State agencies are working together to ensure that the short-term and long-term impacts of Brexit are taken into consideration and that appropriate supports are in place to help the sector to respond and adapt to the new realities.</p>
            <p eId="para_807"> On farm incomes and volatility, Teagasc's national farm survey of 2016 showed average farm income of €24,000, a 9% decrease over 2015. Average farm income has been relatively stable over the last few years, fluctuating between €24,000 and €26,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_809"> There are significant differences in farm income depending on the farming system and size of farm. It should also be borne in mind that over 60% of the farms represented by the national farm survey are classified as part-time, based on labour input required. On half of farms, either the holder or spouse or both have off-farm employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_810"> Ireland is a small, open economy which exports the vast bulk of its agricultural commodities and, therefore, will always feel the effects of volatility on world markets. However, there are measures in place to help Irish farmers through these periods. I believe that moving up the value chain where possible, in terms of the type of products sold and how they are produced, is an important insulation against volatility. The Food Wise strategy contains detailed recommendations aimed at improving value added and productivity at farm and food industry level through a focus on sustainability, efficiency, knowledge transfer and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_811"> It has been one of my priorities to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors. The agriculture cashflow support loan scheme was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, making €150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%. The loan scheme, distributed and administered through the commercial banks, provides farmers with a low-cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow farmers to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_812"> The scheme was launched on 31 January and, by the beginning of March, all of the participating banks had reported that their funds were committed. The SBCI reported that €60.2 million has been drawn down by farmers to the end of April. The average loan size is €32,000, with more than half the loans being advanced for terms of four years or more. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the scheme, which has proven that significant demand exists for low-cost flexible finance. I have met with the chief executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agrifood sector. I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cashflow loans in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_813"> My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance on key agri-taxation policy objectives, including responses to income and price volatility. Risk management is one of the topics covered by knowledge transfer groups. Animal disease risks are covered by the targeted animal health and welfare advisory measure. Fixed price contracts are increasingly becoming a feature of the relationship between producers and processors in the dairy sector, with numerous milk purchasers offering such contracts, which provide producers with the opportunity to lock in prices over the medium term, taking costs of production into account. Such relationships are a welcome development in terms of their potential to mitigate volatility.</p>
            <p eId="para_814"> I am confident that my Department is taking every step to support measures which mitigate price volatility and improve competitiveness in the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_815">The Minister of State referred to the Teagasc farm survey. As it shows, farming is a very difficult career. It is difficult for farmers across the various sectors to make a living and to keep a family. We see that almost 40% of farms have an average income of less than €10,000. On sheep and cattle-rearing farms, the net income is the single farm payment from Europe, and incomes were down for dairy and tillage over the past year as well. We find that there is increased volatility in respect of farm incomes and product prices, in particular. It should be Government policy and EU policy to try to ensure the agriculture sector across Europe and, in particular in our country, is underpinned by farmers getting a fair price for quality produce. Farmers are producing quality produce to the highest standards but the price is not there. Could the Minister of State say what initiatives he and the Minister have taken to ensure we can grow agriculture based on farmers being properly paid for what they produce?</p>

            <p eId="para_816">I am acutely aware of it. One perhaps ironic fact that emerged from the statistics in the survey was that the reduction between 2015 to 2016 was almost entirely in the dairy sector, which represents 19% of all farms. Income has gone from an average of €62,000 to €51,000, whereas the other sectors are stable. It is hard to believe, with the exception of tillage, that is the case. Tillage, or arable, farming has taken a significant drop. It represents 9% of farms, and I think we are all acutely aware of it. There have been tools, such as the agri-cashflow, which have tried to help people through it. In response to the Deputy's question, a fair price for a fair product is important. As a farmer, I understand this as well as anyone. Commissioner Phil Hogan is planning to present a report with a recommendation for EU-wide legislation on fair trade practices later this year. I have been advocating for that since I came into this House. I started off with the fruit and vegetable sector, the horticulture sector, which had perishable products often being sold through a producer group to domestic retailers, and it was suffering. We must continue to ensure we advocate for that. A report is due from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on how that fair trade legislation is working. That also needs to be reviewed in terms of taking new measures, if needs be, to strengthen that. It is something that we would want also.</p>

            <p eId="para_819"> In the Minister of State's previous reply, he also referred to Food Wise 2025 which my party certainly supports, albeit we feel it needs to be reviewed to meet the challenges of Brexit. Food Wise 2025 looks at increasing agrifood exports from €11 billion to €19 billion, but the following is also key. While overall production needs to increase and is beneficial for the country, we also need to see that benefiting the farmers and those who are driving that strategy and driving that projected increase in exports. That means fair prices. It also means that we see proper support from the Government for schemes, in particular, the rural development programme I have mentioned, to ensure that the spending is at committed levels. I ask the Minister of State about the funding of the rural development programme and the steps the Government is taking to ensure the CAP is maintained, at a minimum at its current level, in upcoming negotiations and address what has been a very slow roll-out by the Department of some of the rural development programme funds.</p>

It was Deputy McConalogue's colleague, the then Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, who brought in Food Harvest 2020. It is important that we build on that continuous process to engage, through the various different beef and dairy forums, to build this understanding between all players in each sector and then collectively as a sector itself.</p>

            <p eId="para_824"> I suppose the essence of my question is farm income and where it is at. Deputy McConalogue dealt with some parts of it. What gets me, and what gets most farmers, is the way Irish agricultural produce, particularly meat produce such as beef and sheepmeat, is marketed across Europe and the world as being the cleanest, the greenest and the best produced to the highest quality possible, and yet the prices returned, which I can see when I look at the factory prices for cattle in Ireland or in other parts of Europe, are average or below average compared with those of EU farmers. That should not be the case. If we are producing such a high quality product, the Irish farmer should be a prosperous individual and that is not the case. I want to ascertain here today what plan the Government has to drive this forward to ensure the primary producers get the maximum benefit for the work they put in because they are the ones who put all the work in.</p>

            <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_825">I thank Deputy Martin Kenny for his good wishes. I would be a little bit more optimistic than a couple of months but nobody knows.</p>
            <p eId="para_826"> Teagasc released the preliminary results of the National Farm Survey 2016 recently which showed average farm income of €24,000, a 9% decrease over 2015. However, there are significant differences in farm income depending on the farming system and size of farm. The preliminary results also showed that 19% of farms produced a farm income of less than €5,000 while 14% of farms produced an income of more than €50,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_827"> However, it should also be borne in mind that 64% of the farms represented by the national survey are classified as part time with a family farm income of €11,355, based on labour input required. The remaining 36% are classified as full time, with an average family farm income of €46,500.  In addition, on almost half of all farms, either the holder and-or spouse has off-farm employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_828"> I am aware that 2016 was a challenging year for some sectors. As a small open economy which exports the vast bulk of its main agricultural commodities, Ireland will always feel the effects of volatility on world markets. However, there are measures in place to help Irish farmers through these periods, including the following. In 2016, direct payments per farm as estimated by Teagasc increased by 4% to almost €18,000 and accounted for 75% of income on average. These provide a fundamental hedge against volatility. The agriculture cashflow support loan scheme was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, making €150 million available at interest rates of 2.95%. The loan scheme distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, provides farmers with a low-cost, flexible source of working capital and allows farmers to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_829"> The scheme was launched in January and by the beginning of March, all of the participating banks had reported that their funds were committed. The SBCI reported that €60.2 million has been drawn down by farmers to the end of April. The average loan size is €32,000, with more than half the loans being advanced for terms of four years or more. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for this sort of low-cost flexible finance. The Minister met the chief executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance and he asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_831">My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance on key agri-taxation policy objectives, including responses to income and price volatility. Risk management is one of the topics covered by knowledge transfer groups. Animal disease risks are covered by the targeted animal health and welfare advisory measure. Fixed price contracts are increasingly becoming a feature of the producer-processor relationship in the dairy sector, with numerous milk purchasers offering such contracts, which provide producers with the opportunity to lock-in prices over the medium term, taking costs of production into account. Such relationships are a welcome development in terms of their potential to mitigate volatility.</p>
            <p eId="para_832"> I believe that an important insulation against volatility is moving up the value chain where possible, in terms of the type of products sold and how they are produced. Food Wise 2025 contains detailed recommendations aimed at improving value added and productivity at all stages of the food supply chain. It is clear that driving the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will assume even greater importance in the light of Brexit.</p>
            <p eId="para_833"> The UK's decision to leave the EU reinforces the need to develop as many outlets for our agrifood exports as possible in order to minimise our dependence on any one market. Indeed, this principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise. We have been very active in recent years in efforts to diversify markets, and in aiming to respond to consumer demands in emerging markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_834"> The challenges linked to Brexit are immense, given the very close trading relationships between Ireland and the United Kingdom and on the island of Ireland. We are determined to work closely with the industry and with other governments to identify strategies and approaches that will maintain the success of the Irish agrifood and drinks sector, at both farm and processing levels.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_835">The Minister of State is quite correct. Putting measures in place, for example, for loans, to help the farmer to get over the difficult times has always been the solution to try and deal with volatility and what I suggest here is that the Government needs to have a plan to address volatility in the first place to ensure it does not arise as often or as deep when it happens. I hope the Government concurs with my belief that to do that, when we move into the next number of years where the Minister of State was talking about Food Wise 2025, we would look at not only increasing the volume but the value of produce, particularly the value to the farmer.</p>
            <p eId="para_836"> At the essence of all of this is that the Irish farmer does not get the level of payment for the work that he or she puts in, given the quality he or she is producing. It is a family farm that produces the product in Ireland in the first place. The animals all are grass fed. They are free roaming. They are free from all hormones. They are free GM. We have all these elements in place, there is traceability from farm to fork and yet the farmer finds that he or she will only get an average price with the farmer in other parts of Europe which we all have visited where we have seen the product, particularly the meat product, is produced in vast feed lots where there are thousands of cattle which never see daylight and are never on a family farm. Surely the Irish farmer should be getting a price way above the European average when one looks at the model of farming we have and it is also the kind of product that the European consumer has clearly stated he or she wants. Is there a plan in place to ensure that the Irish farmer will get an enhanced price for his or her product and have transparency around all of that?</p>

            <p eId="para_839">That is why, if we are going for volume, we cannot compete with countries such as Australia and the United States or countries in South America.</p>
            <p eId="para_840"> Bord Bia's strategy, and part of the purpose of the mission that the Minister is on in the US at present, is to move up the value chain at all times and select markets where we can aim higher so that there is such a return all the way down. One has to start by trying to get the highest possible quality product at the end of the line. Beef, through Lidl, which is opening a chain and hopes to have 100 stores open by the end of this year in the US, has been given premium-value brand approval in the US by the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA. That is really important. We are doing that in Germany also. It is important that through the forums, through Bord Bia's marketing and through engagement with all the stakeholders together in the one room, everybody understands that everybody needs to feel a piece of that if we are to continue to produce at that quality.</p>

            <p eId="para_841">I appreciate what the Minister is doing and note that he is in the USA trying to progress new markets for Irish produce. While all of that is excellent, we come back to the point that there does not seem to be transparency. The Irish farmer is not getting a fair price. We say we are going to start to try to aim higher and get to a higher place on the shelf, which is fine. However, the question is whether the farmer will get a higher return. That is the problem. The elephant in the room is the monopoly of many of the big meat processors. It needs to be dealt with. Is the Government prepared to deal with it?</p>
            <p eId="para_842"> Farmers have many environmental issues and costs. Green low-carbon agri-environment scheme and other payments are in place to support farmers, yet we find they are slow in getting their money. It has been said to me by many in the farming community that if officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had to wait as long for their pay as the farmer has to wait for his, there would be war and that they would be on the streets. We need to deal with these issues comprehensively. While I fully appreciate that Bord Bia and many other organisations are doing their best, at the end of the day, their best does not appear to produce a return for the farmer. That is the issue in hand.</p>

            <p eId="para_843">It was not today or yesterday when the priority for Bord Bia was set as aiming at the higher end of the market. There has been that realisation for a long time. Origin Green is based on the slogan of safe, sustainable and secure produce which has resonance throughout the globe. However, it is a competitive market. I remember my father buying shares in Cork Marts IMP, into which he put some money over 50 years ago. It bought into the meat business and it was its worst day's work ever. It was literally burnt alive. I hate to use that pun, but that is what happened. It is a really competitive business. Everyone lost money on that venture. We need everyone in the room together discussing and agreeing on a way to produce beef or dairy products - whatever the commodity - such that everyone will feel he or she is part of the process. We must have a return for the primary producers because young people will not enter farming unless they have a lifestyle. I have been saying this for years.</p>

            <p eId="para_845">We saw a merger here recently of Dunbia and Dawn Meats. It is an open secret and the Commission has been notified of it. It is easy to say the monopolies are price-fixing downwards. Let us consider the price Irish products are getting throughout Europe. It is getting as good a price as is available, but we would love to see them getting a better one. If we were competing at the low end, we would not be getting the price we are. That is the reality.</p>

            <p eId="para_848">I will get into some of the specifics in the supplementary exchanges. This is something that is exercising the minds of many in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_849"> Under the rural development programme the Department has delivered over 20 new schemes that have been supported by IT capability in the past two years. In the first two years of the current rural development programme the Department implemented substantially more RDP schemes than had been delivered in the entire ten-year lifetime of the previous programme. To date, Ireland has drawn down funding at a rate that is 2.4 times higher than the EU average. This rate of delivery and draw-down would not have been possible without the availability of high-quality complex IT software systems to support the business units in the operation of these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_850"> Since 2014 the Department has adopted a policy of implementing fully digital end-to-end support for all but the smallest of schemes. It has an excellent record in the delivery of high-quality ICT systems. In that respect, it is ahead of our European partners and also highly regarded across the Civil Service and the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_851"> We have been constantly among the first to make payments in the European Union. The Deputy will be aware from previous discussions on the GLAS programme that a number of issues have delayed payments. They have included a declaration by applicants of an incompatible parcel usage for the GLAS action chosen; changes in parcel boundaries on which a GLAS action is chosen, including splitting or the merging of parcels; an applicant no longer claiming the parcel on BPS 2016; incomplete documentation such as incorrect information on the low-emission slurry declaration; incomplete interim commonage management plans; and incompatible data and parcel history on Department databases. Separately, a number of issues arose relating to the GLAS IT system, with additional functionality being required to deal with non-standard cases. As advised previously, I regret the difficulties this may have caused for a number of farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_852"> I am happy to advise that the IT aspect of the delivery of these schemes has been reviewed and that a revised team structure has been put in place. This matter will continue to be monitored.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_854"> All but a small amount of outstanding work has been addressed and plans are in place to address this issue in the coming period. The delivery of payments in 2017 is ongoing, with GLAS I and II advance payments almost complete. GLAS + advance payments in respect of 2016 have issued to the majority of eligible applicants in recent days. In addition, the GLAS I and GLAS II balancing payments are scheduled to issue in the coming weeks, subject to the receipt of the applicant's nutrient management plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_855"> TAMS IT functionality is also available to pay the vast bulk of applicants. A relatively small number of TAMS II applications are subject to penalty and it is expected that payments for the majority of these cases will be issued in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_856"> The Deputy will be aware that I have recently extended the deadline for the knowledge transfer schemes to 31 July. This will allow facilitators and vets further time to finalise actions for knowledge transfer group participants. It is anticipated that payments under the scheme will be made as scheduled in the autumn. A recent difficulty in the operation of the new systems provided by my Department for knowledge transfer farm improvement plans and animal health measures has been addressed. I anticipate that payments under the scheme will be made as scheduled in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_857"> The Deputy can rest assured that I will do everything in my power to ensure the Department's ICT systems will have the necessary resources and capacity to deliver on our responsibilities to the farming community and other customers in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_858">I thank the Minister for the reply. I will call it as many in the farming community and I see it. Too often it seems like the Department is being run by a computer. Every time we come up with an issue, it is a question of the computer not letting officials do this or that. Even where there seems to be a reasonable problem that the application of a little common sense and reason would sort out, we are told that officials cannot do it and, unfortunately, payments are delayed. We have seen this happen across several schemes, for example, TAMS. I have learned of cases and know that Deputy Jackie Cahill has encountered similar cases. In such cases one small discrepancy means that the computer will not allow the payment to be made. There are delays for months and farmers are left in the lurch for money that they have already invested. We need to see the Department apply some common sense. It should be prepared in respect of its IT systems. It should be able to look at a file and deal with it to ensure farmers will be paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_859"> The Minister of State said he would address this issue in supplementary exchanges. I would like to know what specifically the Department has been doing to eradicate the problems we have seen with the IT systems. How will it operate a far more common-sense and farmer-friendly system that will not always seem to be directed by what the computer indicates?</p>

            <p eId="para_860">The Deputy says it seems the Department is being run by an IT system, but people have to manage the IT systems too. I accept what the Deputy is saying to a point. However, the IT system has to score an application correctly. What if it throws up a discrepancy? I have listed some instances in which there may be a discrepancy. This is what happened in beefing up the IT unit and changing the team structure. The process is really important. When the IT system indicates that there is a problem or a discrepancy, the problem or discrepancy is identified and dealt with by way of direct contact, e-mail, with the adviser or farmer and a response is sought. I met the IT people before I came here. The Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, has committed to the balancing payments being made in June under GLAS I and II. Up to 35%, or 13,000 odd, of the nutrient management plans are coming in out of the 35,000 odd. I urge everyone to ensure the plans are complete. There has been no IT problem with nutrient management plans, but they need to come in before the payments can be processed. A total of 13,500 can be commenced. The other applicants need a nutrient management plan. It is not that difficult to get the plans in. The essence is that everything has to be traceable and the IT system needs to be satisfied. However, the process needs to be managed in such a way that when a problem shows, we can address the discrepancy and receive a response. That will allow it to be corrected.</p>

            <p eId="para_861">I do not doubt the effort put in by departmental staff. We deal with them on an ongoing basis, especially at committee level. However, the Minister of State and the Department need to look again at the use of flexibility in the processing of the various applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">It should be possible to put a note on a file that explains what the situation is and why the money should be paid, and which would allow it to be paid. Surely there must be a record showing that it complies with the regulations. It should not be as rigid as the computer blocking it and then it not being dealt with for months and being put to the back of the pile. That needs to be examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_863"> In respect of preparedness for these schemes, I am aware that the likes of GLAS are big schemes and that it was the first year of GLAS. I take that point. However, we were assured many times by the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and the Minister, Deputy Creed, that they were on top of it and would be prepared and that all the systems would be up and running, yet it all fell flat and farmers were left to suffer without their payments. We cannot see that type of thing happening again. In particular, I ask for a review to ensure there is flexibility to apply common sense. The rules must absolutely be complied with but this must be done in a way that ensures that farmers are not made to suffer repeatedly.</p>

            <p eId="para_864">To be clear, the regulations do not allow payment to be issued until the scheme has been complied with. There is no flexibility to say we believe it will be complied with. We cannot do that. What we can do is ensure that when a problem is identified, the discrepancy is dealt with as quickly as possible. At times, it is a matter of waiting for the other side to respond. I am dealing with a couple of cases of this nature. It is the same point as the one I am made about the nutrient management plan. It is a matter of trying to speed the process up. That is why the team structure has been changed and extra staff and resources assigned. In the year the basic payment scheme, BPS, first came out there were hold-ups but they have not occurred since.</p>

            <p eId="para_866">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, on his well-deserved reappointment. The biggest challenge facing rural Ireland is Brexit. The €1.7 billion received by Irish farmers annually must be guaranteed in any post-Brexit adjustment to the EU budget. The Government must ensure that this vital EU funding stream is protected. The UK contributes about 12% of the EU budget with a net contribution of about €12.9 billion. That will be lost post-2020. A 12% cut to the CAP will have a devastating impact on Irish farmers as EU payments account for 65% of Irish family farm incomes. It is clearly critical for thousands of Irish farmers that those payments be preserved. Brexit is also a big challenge for the agrifood sector, the biggest it has faced in decades. It will be acutely felt by that sector. I want to make sure we are on top of our brief and ahead of the curve on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_867">I thank Deputy Penrose for his good wishes. I am extremely conscious of the importance of the CAP budget to Ireland's agriculture sector. The UK's withdrawal from the EU has been independently estimated to be likely to lead to a reduction of circa €10 billion, which will undoubtedly put pressure on the availability of funding for the future CAP. In the meantime, the amount of CAP funding per member state for Pillar 1 direct payments and Pillar 2 is fixed until 2020 in regulations of the Council and European Parliament. It would require a co-decided amendment of these regulations to change the figures. The only adjustment variable within that overall budget is expenditure on market supports, which is not allocated on a member state basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_868"> In my view, maintaining a strong CAP budget is one of the key challenges in the context of the multi-annual financial framework post-2020. The CAP budget is likely to come under increasing pressure, given the possibility that the overall EU budget will be reduced after 2020. Furthermore, there has been ongoing pressure from some member states to reduce the proportion of CAP spending within the overall EU budget and to divert this spending to newer priorities such as migration, defence and security. Brexit is also a significant factor and the loss of the UK contribution to the overall EU budget will undoubtedly put further pressure on the availability of funding for the CAP in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_869"> Ireland will continue to negotiate for a strong and well-financed CAP and seek to build alliances with member states with a common interest in supporting the EU's farm sector and consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_870"> Ultimately, the CAP is funded by taxpayers across European member states. It is critically important against that background to reinforce the legitimacy and importance of the CAP and its role in achieving European priorities and objectives in areas such as employment creation and retention; food security; food safety and quality; the protection and enhancement of the environment; the development of the rural economy; and the prevention of land abandonment and rural depopulation. I strongly believe the CAP has evolved considerably and very effectively in recent years in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands. It also plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_871"> I can assure Deputy Penrose that Ireland's objectives are clear as we enter into a new discussion on the financial perspectives and the shape of CAP post-2020. I will be working with Government colleagues, other member states and the EU institutions to secure the best possible outcome for the Irish agrifood sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_872">The negative impact of Brexit on the CAP budget is glaringly obvious. I reckon the UK contributes €12.9 billion to EU coffers. Clearly, unless addressed by significantly increased contributions by the member states, there will be a significant negative impact on CAP and direct payments to farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_873"> The EU budget is around 1% of EU GDP. That is far too small for a Union of 520 million people, or approximately 445 million people and 27 member states once the British have left. There is glaring incapacity at European level to support the ambitions of the EU treaties. That is the kernel of this. There will be debate as to whether we are for a Union capable of helping member states to tackle serious economic and social deficits. The current range of crises facing the EU is great and includes Brexit. There will be a serious rethink by member states about the budget and there will be resistance to the EU reforming and developing its own resources as envisaged in the treaties. There is huge resistance. We will have to be behind that, otherwise our State is going to be asked to contribute from its own coffers. Such a proposal will not meet with uniform acceptance. There will be sectoral resistance. We had better start getting this right and informing farmers who will have to come on board in a conjoined way and supportive way. Whoever is in government here by then will face a huge challenge.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">I can only agree with everything the Deputy has said. It is a huge challenge. It was going to be a challenge even if the UK had voted to stay because of the competing demands for the EU budget and because the perception of what CAP is about has been misconstrued and misunderstood for many years. It depends on the member state. During the last period of CAP negotiations, former Commissioner Ciološ's support for a more or less intact CAP budget was based on the principles of producing food sustainably, sourcing as much food as possible from within the EU, and protecting rural economies. That is why the likes of greening came in along with other environmental measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_875"> As I said in my reply, we have moved the CAP considerably from its earlier manifestations. It still needs to evolve and, furthermore, it needs to move towards what consumers and taxpayers across Europe want. We still have a huge challenge which is compounded by the fact that there will be a net loss from Brexit. The figure varies between €10 billion and €14 billion, depending on who one talks to. We took the lower estimate, which is still a frightening amount.</p>

            <p eId="para_877">There is no doubt that we need allies. There will be trade-offs. The last CAP was concluded under the Irish Presidency and under the aegis of the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney. Much of the groundwork was done with Commissioner Ciološ. It is important to build alliances and create understanding of what we are about.</p>
            <p eId="para_878"> One statistic that is a little bit concerning is that the EU 28 are currently about 100% self-sufficient in food production. With the UK gone, we will be at 115% or 116%. That void will have to be filled. The British are going to have to buy food but we are going to have to sell it.</p>

            <p eId="para_879">I would be suggesting safeguards such as seeking a suspension of state aid rules for two to three years. Small and medium enterprises dealing with the agrifood industry that are highly reliant on the UK market must be brought to the table. Solutions have to be found for the huge cross-Border trade in milk, livestock and other agricultural products. We have factories such as Lakeland and others that operate across both sides of the Border. Trade adjustment funds may well have to be formulated to support businesses in these areas. The Minister of State is acutely aware that the UK is deficient in beef. The British are now going to be looking for alternative sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">This facilitates Argentinian beef imports.</p>
            <p eId="para_881"> Another issue is that a significant element of Irish exports are transited through Britain and, clearly, a difficulty will arise with that. Will we face the reintroduction of veterinary certificates for beef exports to other EU member states if they are transited through the UK? The impact of Brexit on bloodstock sales has been clearly set out by Deputy Martin Kenny. We heard about it already from Mr. Kavanagh. There are major areas involved and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is just one aspect of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_882"> I believe we will have to set up some sort of a special unit within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that is properly staffed and resourced to tackle this fundamental problem that we will face during the next two to three years. We want to be ahead of the curve but we are falling a little behind the curve in terms of our preparation and anticipation of what will happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_883">On the Deputy's final point, I should point out that as soon as David Cameron announced he was going to hold a referendum the Department put together a contingency team. Once the referendum vote had taken place the Department established a Brexit unit. It is managed by an assistant secretary general but is answerable at all times to the Secretary General. As I said, Brexit is a standing item on the agenda of the high-level implementation committee. Of all the Departments, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was the most concerned about it and the most hopeful that it would not happen, but it was ready and it is working as best it can. As has been said to me several times, Brexit is not an Irish policy, it is a UK policy, but we have not got those in the UK to sit down to talk in any meaningful way about it. They are only starting, and we saw the opening salvos yesterday with the Queen's speech.</p>

            <p eId="para_886">My question is related to Deputy Penrose's question. What steps is the Minister of State taking to safeguard the interests of the Irish agrifood sector in light of the Brexit challenge? Our overall economy is exposed to the Brexit challenge with 14% of all our exports going to the UK, but with 40% of our agrifood sector exports going to the UK, the challenge facing that sector is particularly acute. The Minister of State might outline the specific steps his Department is taking to safeguard the sector?</p>

            <p eId="para_887">I fully recognise the potential difficulties that may arise in the agrifood and fisheries sectors from the Brexit vote.  These sectors are of critical importance to our economy given their regional spread and the fact that they underpin the socio-economic development of rural areas in particular.  I am determined to safeguard the interests of these vital sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_888"> My Department and its agencies have conducted various analyses of the likely impact of Brexit on the agrifood sector. These analyses range from initial and ongoing internal departmental assessments to published work by Teagasc and Bord Bia. This is an ongoing process, and will continue through extensive consultation with stakeholders via the Department's stakeholder consultative committee and through the all-island civic dialogue process, in respect of which I have already hosted five agrifood and fisheries sectoral dialogues.</p>
            <p eId="para_889"> While the main impact to date of the Brexit vote has been the effect of sterling volatility on those businesses that have a significant trading relationship with the UK, the medium-to long-term threats include the possible introduction of tariffs on trade between the EU and UK, potential divergences in regulations and standards between the EU and UK post-Brexit, and the implications of border controls and certification requirements. Difficult challenges also arise in regard to potentially restricted access to fishing grounds and resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_890"> In response to the challenges posed, I have undertaken a number of important steps within my Department, which include the establishment of a dedicated Brexit co-ordination unit and a Brexit response committee to prepare for, monitor and respond to developments as required. As referred to earlier, I have also established a stakeholder consultative committee, which is complemented by frequent contact with representative organisations and companies on an ongoing basis, and operates in parallel to the separate consultation structures under the all-island civic dialogue. </p>
            <p eId="para_891">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_892"> Last October, as part of budget 2017, I announced a range of measures aimed at alleviating exchange rate volatility pressures. These included the agri cashflow support loan fund of €150 million, enhanced taxation measures, and the allocation of additional funding to Bord Bia in order to ensure that it is in a position to provide Brexit-related supports to affected companies, including its new Brexit barometer. My Department has recently asked Bord Bia to conduct a market profiling exercise to inform commercial and Government market access priorities and it is intensifying its efforts to open third country markets for agrifood products.  I also provided for increased funding under the rural development programme and the seafood development programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_893"> I have also held a series of bilateral meetings with my EU counterparts which are aimed at building alliances to ensure that agrifood and fisheries issues are at the top of the EU negotiation agenda.  Building common ground with other member states will be critically important in the context of the negotiations. </p>
            <p eId="para_894"> In all of these engagements I am making clear our demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries. In relation to fisheries, Ireland wants to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal, and to protect our quota share for joint fish stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_895"> I wish to assure the House that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agrifood industry through the challenges ahead. I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p>

            <p eId="para_896">I will deal with the agrifood sector in my first supplementary and with the fishing sector in my second supplementary. The Department's response in terms of resourcing and having the dedicated staff needed to meet the challenge we face has been inadequate. The Brexit unit in the Department, to which the Minister of State referred, has only four people. I accept that everyone is working on this issue but there are only four people in that Brexit unit. There are only six people in the market access unit in the Department which is responsible for opening up new markets. Having regard to the number of agricultural attachés and embassies across the world, there are only five people dealing with those in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_897"> There are only four additional staff being employed in Bord Bia this year to equip it to meet the challenge and it has a massive role to play in this regard. Therefore, the Department's response has been insufficient to date and it needs to be beefed up. </p>
            <p eId="para_898"> Food Wise 2025 was developed in a pre-Brexit environment. Why has it not been revised to proof it for Brexit to meet that challenge?</p>

            <p eId="para_899">It is easy to say that there are only six additional people in the Department and four additional in Bord Bia. Everybody in the Department is focused on Brexit. It is a standing item on our agenda. I am based on the fifth floor of the Department building along with people from various different sectors. Brexit is on everybody's agenda. There is a dedicated Brexit unit and a co-ordination committee, but it is answerable to way beyond those four people.</p>
            <p eId="para_900"> The trade division is represented with the Minister in North America this week. Accompanying them are representatives of Bord Bia and of some companies. When a team goes on a trade mission, and I have led one, it can comprise 20 to 25 people. Sustainable Food Systems Ireland may be part of such a mission. It involves selling the whole Irish package and Origin Green is a very important element. We were engaged in such missions prior to the challenge posed by Brexit.</p>
            <p eId="para_901"> Regarding the Deputy's question on Food Wise 2025, an adjustment in terms of Brexit is being made to it as it evolves. That strategy needs to take cognisance of it because everything is a reaction to what has been happening. The volatility in sterling that we have seen has affected the mushroom and forestry sectors, in particular, and especially wood products. The purpose of the €150 million low-interest loan fund was to help specific sectors, including those sectors, but the wood or timber industry comes under a business sector. A great deal of work is under way and much of it is reactive as the situation requires it. It is very difficult to say we are going to do it a certain way now because we have not really figured it out. We do not know what way this process will be negotiated.</p>

            <p eId="para_902">I thank the Minister for his response. I certainly got the impression during the recent leadership contest in the Minister of State's party that the now Taoiseach was acknowledging the fact that there needed to be additional resources in terms of people and expertise allocated to deal with this challenge. I would have hoped that as a result of that there would have been a recognition in the Department that more support was needed specifically to work on this issue. While I understand and accept the point that it is an issue for everyone in the agricultural sector and in the Department, the dedicated unit and particularly the State agencies like Bord Bia need to have the necessary resources to meet this challenge and they have not had them up to now.</p>
            <p eId="para_903"> I wish to comment on the fishing sector. We have 11,000 people employed directly in the fishing industry across the country, many of them in my county, and the industry accounts for more than €0.5 billion in exports. While there is the challenge of market access and tariffs in regard to agriculture, there is also that challenge in regard to fishing but there is also the massive challenge of access to fishing waters. The UK has made this a big priority in terms of taking back their waters, as it were, and that makes it a very specific challenge for us with respect to how that is negotiated and the approach we take to it. </p>
            <p eId="para_904"> What approach and efforts has the Department taken towards protecting our position with regard to access to waters in terms of the Minister's engagement with the negotiating team to ensure that a positive outcome achieved?</p>

            <p eId="para_905">The Deputy is correct. Of all the sectors that one that is the most vulnerable, given the UK's opening position on Brexit, is the fishing sector. Ireland's position is quite clear; we want to maintain access to fishing grounds in the UK zone, in the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and to protect our quota share for joint fishing stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">That is our opening position. This crosses through a number of strands. If one looks at the opening statement in Prime Minister Theresa May's Article 50 letter, one sees it recognised the Irish position. Having met recently with the Secretary of State, David Davies, MP, from the UK side, Michel Barnier remarked that the Irish situation came up more than any other issue in that opening salvo. The fishing sector will certainly be part of that. It is the one that is the most vulnerable in the context of Britain establishing a very hard position on protecting its own territory. Maintaining our position is something that will have the support of everyone in this House and beyond.</p>

            <p eId="para_909">I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, the best of luck following his well-deserved reappointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_910"> What progress has the Department made in the review of the appeals process for farmers? As some of the questions have already outlined, there are pressures on farmers' incomes. Unfortunately, the single farm payment represents a huge proportion of many farmers' incomes. The appeals process is vital for farmers who suffer penalties. Could the Minister outline the progress that has been made on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_911">The delivery of the commitment under the Programme for Government is progressing. The Deputy will be aware that the commitment is to review the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 “to ensure the independence and efficiency of the Office in dealing with appeals from farmers”. </p>
            <p eId="para_912"> The appeals process is governed by the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 and Agriculture Appeals Regulations 2002. There are distinct and specific statutory functions assigned to the officials delivering the appeals service which require the appeals officers and the director under law to be independent in the performance of their functions when making determinations on appeals made by affected persons against decisions taken by the Department. The legislation also requires appeals officers to have regard to the principles of natural justice and to comply with the terms and conditions and EU regulations applying to the Department schemes. I am advised by the director of agriculture appeals that appeals officers are fully aware of their legal obligations.  </p>
            <p eId="para_913"> The agriculture appeals service is implemented through a separate executive office with its own premises and staff which operates independently of the Department. The functioning of the office is overseen by the director of agriculture appeals. </p>
            <p eId="para_914"> In regard to the outcome of appeals, in 2016 the outcome of all cases closed in that year was that 45% of cases were disallowed and 41% allowed, partially allowed or revised by the Department, the balance being withdrawn or invalid.</p>
            <p eId="para_915"> As an initial step in the review, the director of agriculture appeals has completed an assessment of the existing appeals service arrangements with a view to identifying any matters that might be given consideration when a formal review of the operations of her office commences. </p>
            <p eId="para_916"> The next step will be to establish a steering committee to oversee the delivery of the commitment. The committee will include independent experts.  The committee will consider the issues identified by the director and any other relevant matters and will also receive input from the management services division of my Department, which provides analysis and advice on organisational development, business process improvement, resource deployment and change management. It is anticipated that the committee will also invite stakeholder input to the process.   </p>
            <p eId="para_917"> I am informed that the review will be completed by the end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_918">The Minister of State has given me a very comprehensive answer. One word on which I want to hone in is "independence". Farmers' confidence in this system is paramount as well as the independence of the appeals process. The fact that the appeals office is staffed entirely by former Department of Agriculture staff is undermining farmers' confidence in the system. If we are to restore farmers' confidence in the appeals process, we need proper independence. That means staff other than former Department of Agriculture staff would be employed in the appeals office. A figure was given of roughly 40% success rate for appeals. That is well and good and I am not arguing with it but that means that 60% have failed. It is a question of farmers' confidence in the system. If farmers see that it is former Department of Agriculture staff who are manning these appeals offices, it undermines their confidence in the system. If this review is to restore farmer confidence, the staff employed in the appeals office must be the first item on the agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_919">It is not 60%. I think the statistic was 45% are refused, or disallowed, and 41% were allowed. Which is that 86% or the remainder are invalid or withdrawn. So it is a little less than 50% that are allowed.</p>

            <p eId="para_921">Of the applications, but some applications are invalid or withdrawn. I do not want to pre-empt what the final review will say. The Deputy has made a specific point here that the personnel who occupy the appeals office should not be former staff. I am not sure that I would agree that is necessary that the entire appeals office should not have anyone with the experience. That is my opinion, there has to be a healthy mix. Again, I cannot pre-empt the steering committee and the implementation of the review's recommendations and actions will be guided as I outlined in my opening statement.</p>

            <p eId="para_922">I understand that it would be of benefit to have staff who understand the application system but some people who sit on the appeals process should not be former members of the Department. In my county, we have had very high-profile cases where people have suffered 100% penalties. They have gone into the judicial system. That should never have to happen. In a working appeals system, that should never have to happen. In a popular appeals process that worked properly, people would not have to resort to the courts; that is a last resort. I accept that people from the Department might be involved in the process to provide background knowledge but when a farmer goes before an appeals body, the least he can expect is that a majority of those there would not have previously been members of staff in the Department. Good work is being done by the appeals process but the confidence of farmers in it is paramount and I appeal to the Minister to keep that at the top of his agenda when this process is being reviewed.</p>

I am not sure if one of the things which has been fed-in has been along those lines but fundamentally it is about the independence of the office and using independent experts from outside of the Department's cohort, which reflects the Deputy's point. Hopefully they will take it on board.</p>

            <p eId="para_925">I also wish to be associated with the good wishes expressed towards Deputy Doyle on his reappointment. It is well merited.</p>
            <p eId="para_926"> Some months ago, his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Creed, told me that three greyhounds were exported to Argentina in 2013, 33 in 2014, 3 in 2015 and 7 in 2016, even though greyhound racing has ceased in Argentina. He also said that no greyhounds were exported direct from Ireland to Pakistan during 2016. There are persistent rumours that those exports are taking place. Previously, the Minister mentioned the EU TRACES system which covers the export of animals throughout the European Union. Nevertheless, rumours persist that there are significant exports to Pakistan, where the animal welfare regime is deplorable.</p>
            <p eId="para_927"> Will the Minister be adopting the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill, a Bill which I myself sponsored, and including it in the Government's legislation?</p>

            <p eId="para_928">I thank the Deputy for his kind words.</p>
            <p eId="para_929"> My Department has a close working relationship with welfare charities on all aspects of animal welfare.  The Department has in the past met with the International Greyhound Forum, which includes members of Dogs Trust and the ISPCA, to discuss the issue of greyhound exports. Information received to date from my Department's local offices indicates that no greyhounds have been exported directly from Ireland to China or Pakistan to date this year, and nine greyhounds were exported directly from Ireland to China in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_930"> My Department has access to the figures for exports of dogs from Ireland to other EU member states through the European Commission's trade control and expert system, TRACES.  It does not have figures for the movements of dogs that are, for example, exported to the UK, the most significant destination for Irish dogs, and subsequently exported to a third country.</p>
            <p eId="para_931"> I am aware that the Deputy has introduced a Private Members' Bill on the subject of the export of greyhounds and to respond directly to the Deputy's query, my Department officials are examining the Bill. Once animal health and welfare standards, set by EU law for trade within the EU, are met, dogs, including greyhounds, may be exported.  Exporters are required to comply with EU law on the protection of animals during transport.  The Irish Greyhound Board advises all owners of greyhounds to only export to destinations that provide the expected levels of greyhound care and management as defined in its code of practice.  We fully endorse this view.</p>

            <p eId="para_932">The Minister of State will remember that last year, around the time the Government was formed, there was a major public outcry over the export of three Irish greyhounds to Macau, where they would have been raced in the infamous Canidrome, where dogs are effectively raced to death. Subsequently, a few dozen Irish dogs were returned to Ireland when the transport authorities in the UK stopped those who were carrying them. There is no adoption or protection system in Macau or in China generally but there has been much evidence regarding the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_933"> Constituents of mine have been in contact with me about persistent reports of exports to Pakistan. Videos have been uploaded on social media and so on showing animals being seriously maltreated with hunting animals, and the Minister of State needs to address this. He mentioned direct exports. As he will be aware, 80% of the dogs in the UK are our dogs, dogs that were bred here - beautiful, intelligent animals. Has the Minister of State made any contact with the equivalent Department or Minister in the UK to bring this matter to their attention and see what they might be able to do together? I know the Irish Department will be in contact with its equivalent in the UK regarding Brexit, our agriculture and fisheries and so on. In this context, the Bill I introduced was advocated strongly by the Dogs Trust welfare organisation. There is great eagerness to create a white list of countries that treat greyhounds and dogs generally well and to set the example for Britain. Has the Minister of State held any such discussions?</p>

            <p eId="para_934">I do not have the answer because I am substituting for the Minister today. The Deputy is right that 80% of the animals in the UK are exported from Ireland, so it would be helpful to have the level of information to which he refers. However, no more than anything else with Brexit, having control over the UK after its exit from the EU on the issue of further exports will be problematic if we continue to export to the UK, which we probably will. Given that there is demand, or enthusiasm, in some of the countries the Deputy mentioned for this kind of activity, there is work to be done on that end by colleague organisations across the globe in many ways. These are global bodies - NGOs and the like - and they have a body of work to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_935">In respect of the breeding and racing of dogs and horses, the UK and Ireland operate as a single entity, I think, so there is clearly an opportunity there for the Minister of State, even in the context of Brexit, to ensure that high standards are adhered to.</p>
            <p eId="para_936"> Will the Government just accept the legislation I tabled or will it incorporate it as part of the greyhound industry reform Bill? Deputy Penrose has been doing a lot of work in this area. Will the Government take all the legislation together and improve the welfare of our greyhounds?</p>

            <p eId="para_937">Welfare is an integral part of the new greyhound legislation. The Bill the Deputy brought before the House is more comprehensive than ours. As Deputies Martin Kenny and Charlie McConalogue will be aware, the agriculture committee hopes to return the greyhound Bill after our consideration of it during pre-legislative scrutiny next Tuesday. We will be anxious to expedite the Bill. It will be hard to get it done before the summer recess but we hope to advance it as quickly as possible. I think it would be better to work in parallel rather than trying to work the two Bills into one. The tripartite agreement between Ireland, England and France has a serious impact on our horse industry as well as our greyhound industry, so that is something to take up.</p>

Agricultural crops, including potatoes, provide a very strong livelihood for so many in south Kildare, and there are many potato farmers in addition to the thousands of home producers. The margins can be very tight, as we have witnessed with the impact of Brexit on the mushroom sector recently in Kildare and indeed throughout the country.

            <p eId="para_941"> All "copper compounds", including copper sulphate, used for crop protection purposes - predominantly organic production - were reviewed at EU level in 2009.  At that time, EU conditional approval was granted to "copper compounds" for a period of ten years.  It was then left up to member states to approve individual products which conform with the EU approval.  An application has recently been received by my Department to authorise a product containing a copper compound and there may well be additional product applications in response to demand, primarily, as I said, by the organic sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_942"> As with all plant protection products, authorisation and use conditions for products containing a copper compound will be established based on the comprehensive risk assessments carried out. In addition, risk mitigation measures such as buffer zones or the use of personal protective equipment are often applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_943"> Like all plant protection products, there are limits as to how much of each individual product can be applied to a given area, and copper compounds are no different. Member states are required to pay particular attention to issues such as impurities in the material manufactured, operator safety and the protection of water and non-target organisms.</p>

            <p eId="para_944">At a recent public meeting on agriculture that I hosted in Kildare with my good friend and colleague, Deputy McConalogue, the issue of EU over-regulation was raised. Farmers in Kildare, and I have no doubt throughout the country, want assurance that our Government is fighting for them and not being bound by regulations that may suit other countries that have different climates to the one enjoyed by us at the edge of Europe. Until recent years, we had but one single strain of potato blight to contend with in Ireland, but the arrival on our shores of a second type had the result of turning one line of blight into a family tree. Luckily, the new strains of blight have remained somewhat susceptible to copper, and this allows farmers to grow potatoes with a reasonable natural resistance to the disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">However, I was contacted by constituents who became concerned when discovering there was a difficulty using copper, as no company had registered a copper product as a fungicide in Ireland. This has been done in most other EU member states. Ireland is just one of five countries not to have done so. The other four do not have a similar climate to Ireland's, which is susceptible to the potato blight. Even though copper is a trace element that is essential for all forms of life, it faces an uncertain future as a fungicide since the EU seems to want to ban it.</p>
            <p eId="para_946"> When purchased, copper sulphate comes in a bag marked for use as a feed additive for animals. Is copper a feed or a toxin?</p>

            <p eId="para_950">One learns something new every day. This is a response to allow for the use of products containing copper in certain circumstances in organic farming systems. It is, therefore, permissible. One application for authorisation of a product containing the active substance, copper oxychloride, was received in March this year and it is anticipated there will be a decision on that soon. It is also anticipated there will be more applications. It is true that there is no product on the market but one was applied for three months ago. Perhaps that is why people are saying there is a difficulty. The EU permits copper use but each member state has to deal with each specific application because there are different compositions in products. They should not be contaminated but they may be and that has to be scrutinised.</p>

            <p eId="para_951">I accept that and I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Potato yield has decreased by 7.9% since 2015, even though the area under potatoes has increased by 6.1%. There is, therefore, an issue in this regard. According to French research, copper-based fungicides common in organic farming can be toxic to earthworms but this is not applicable to Irish soil and I welcome the Minister of State's comment that members states have the capacity to determine their own future on this issue. Bord Bia's Pathways for Growth report refers to Ireland's enviable position in respect of growing potatoes. The Minister of State will agree that it is essential for the economic well-being of rural Ireland that we retain the capacity to serve the customers have been identified in this report and it is also essential that copper can be used safely in our blight favouring climatic conditions. It will thus become an important option in the toolbox of organic and conventional farmers as we work towards fulfilling market demand.</p>

            <p eId="para_952">The application that was submitted in March is being processed and, hopefully, it will get the necessary sanction as soon as possible with the conditions as outlined attached. This is why sprayer safety courses, of which several thousand have been undertaken, are so important. The crop which is sprayed with these products must be treated with respect while the products should avoid the crops they are not meant to treat.</p>

            <p eId="para_954">Like my colleagues, I congratulate the Minister of State and I wish will him in the continuation of his Ministry. He will do a good job.

            <p eId="para_955">I thank the Deputy. We soldiered together ten years on the committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_956"> My Department has an excellent record in the delivery of high quality ICT systems.  In that respect, my Department is ahead of the rest of our European partners and are also highly regarded across the civil and public service.  We have been consistently among the first to make payments in the EU. </p>
            <p eId="para_957"> The basic payment scheme, BPS, which is operated from our Portlaoise office, was introduced in 2015, enabling Ireland to be among one of the first member states to make payments under the new CAP schemes. The online uptake for this scheme has increased steadily with more than 109,000 applications submitted by this means in 2017. The BPS system has been improved on year on year to make it more farmer-farm adviser friendly.  A total of 99.7% of 2016 BPS applicants have been paid to date while 97.7% were paid on the initial date of balancing payments, which is 1 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_958"> In the context of the Rural Development Programme 2015-2020, RDP, to which the Deputy referred specifically, the Department has delivered more than 20 new schemes that were supported by IT capability over the past two years.  In the first two years of the current RDP, my Department has implemented substantially more schemes than were implemented over the entire ten-year lifetime of the previous RDP programme.  To date Ireland has drawn down funding at a rate 2.4 times higher than the EU average. This rate of delivery and draw-down would not have been possible without the availability of complex IT software systems to support the business units in operating these schemes. Since 2014 my Department has adopted a policy of implementing fully digital end-to-end support for all but the smallest of schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_959"> A number of different issues delayed GLAS payments, which I outlined earlier.</p>

            <p eId="para_960">There is a need for an immediate review of the current IT payment systems following the massive problems faced by farmers submitting applications for overdue payments under many rural development programme schemes. Enormous barriers are being experienced with the online system for GLAS, TAMS, the beef genomics programme and the knowledge transfer group scheme. The addition of a plethora of wholly bureaucratic schemes has added hugely to the costs of farmers and has led to a lengthy delay in the issuance of payments, for example, under the GLAS scheme. More complicated rules on farm schemes have led to an explosion in compliance costs and reduced the net financial benefit of many schemes to farmers. Under GLAS, it was agreed that up to 75% of payments would be commenced by the third week of October 2016 with the balance of payments in mid-December. At the beginning of May 2017, approximately 3,000 GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 applicants were still waiting on 85% of their 2016 payments, despite a farmer's charter of rights meeting where the Department made a commitment that all outstanding payments would be made by the end of April. Six weeks later, 94% of payments have been made, according to an update yesterday. The Department is still behind and I hope the charter will be adhered to in the future and farmers will be paid on time.</p>

            <p eId="para_961">This issue has been well-documented by the Deputy, his colleagues and others. Approximately 94% of applicants have been paid under GLAS. Documentation is awaited for 1,200 applications while another 1,400 are under review. The loading of information relating to the knowledge transfer scheme was not being accepted but that has been resolved and the deadline has been extended to 31 July. Of the 11,800 applications under TAMS, more than 3,300 payments have issued. A total of 1,394 claims were received with 898 payments issued. The online payment claims facility has been open since July 2016 and payments are issuing on an ongoing basis. TAMS II had a three-year window, which is delaying payments. It, however, gives applicants a window to claim. The payments, therefore, are not being drawn down as quickly as they might be if there was a one-year deadline for the completion of works.</p>

            <p eId="para_962">The Department's administration of some recent farm schemes was branded totally unacceptable by the IFA as recently as last month.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">I understand the IFA requested meetings with the Minister to ensure the situation is taken under control as a matter of urgency. Will the Minister of State facilitate a meeting with the IFA? The IFA President, Joe Healy, has said the GLAS payments controversy, difficulties with TAMS payments and issues over the administration of the knowledge transfer scheme are evidence of serious problems within certain areas of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_964"> I began to chase up the TAMS issue in August 2016 with the agricultural liaison officer in the Minister's office. I then followed up with parliamentary questions in September and October. For four months the most up-to-date information I could get was a reply that stated that all applications received in each tranche have to be checked for administrative issues before they are then ranked and selected, and that this process was under way for the 2,000 applications received in tranche 3. A late payment might finally have gone through in early December, which would leave dairy farmers maybe six or weeks at best to complete the works applied for before the cows calve in January and they have to start milking. The barriers imposed on these farmers are completely out of order and there is a serious problem that needs to be rectified. It is a question of the timescale from when the applications are accepted. These farmers might have started milking in January and February with the spring calving, and they do not have time to get everything in order because of delays at departmental level.</p>

            <p eId="para_965">More than 20 schemes were rolled out in the last two years. There have been some teething problems but we do not anticipate these will arise again. The TAMS dairy schemes in particular were prioritised although one or two issues arose. In particular, changes were made to the criteria to allow people to proceed where planning permission may not have been secured but had been validated-----</p>

            <p eId="para_967">It was very difficult. At one stage the farmer had to have the planning permission cleared 28 days after the grant of conditional planning. That changed because it was going to cause a delay of 12 weeks from the time somebody applied. Therefore, once planning permission was validated, applications were allowed to proceed on the basis that they were going to get permission. That was risky enough at times in that the approval might have been paid for but a building would be found to be not in compliance with the planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_968"> Efforts have been made. I accept there is more to be done but we can address that in the programmes that follow.</p>

            <p eId="para_970">I want to ask about the Minister's plans to respond to the threats to agriculture from Brexit, with a particular focus on County Wexford.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_212" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine">
            <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_971">There is no doubt that Brexit will have an impact on the outlook for Irish agriculture in all counties, including Wexford.  Farming is an essential part of the social, cultural and economic fabric of Ireland. It is also part of a wider EU dispensation that values a Common Agriculture Policy built on family farming, food security, high standards of food safety and environmental sustainability.  These are values that we hold dear so it is critically important, when we consider the impact of Brexit, that the positive contribution of agriculture to the rural and national economy, and to society in Ireland and elsewhere in the European Union, is to the forefront in our deliberations.</p>
            <p eId="para_972"> Over the past few months the Minister and I have engaged with counterparts in other member states in an effort to sensitise them to the potential impact of an unfavourable Brexit agreement, or no agreement, not only on Ireland but on the EU agrifood sector generally. In this regard, there is regular engagement with the Commission, the UK, including Northern Ireland, and other member states, both at political and official level.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, and I have had specific bilateral meetings with counterparts in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Estonia, Poland, Luxembourg, Austria and Spain to seek to establish common ground on the Brexit issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_973"> My Department and its agencies have conducted various analyses of the likely impact of Brexit on the agrifood sector.  These analyses range from internal departmental assessments to published work by Teagasc and Bord Bia. This is an ongoing process and it will continue through extensive consultation with stakeholders via the Department's stakeholder consultative committee and through the all-island civic dialogue process, in respect of which I have already hosted five agrifood and fisheries sectoral dialogues.</p>
            <p eId="para_974"> While the main impact to date of the Brexit vote has been the effect of sterling volatility on those businesses that have a significant trading relationship with the UK, the medium-term to long-term threats include the possible introduction of tariffs on trade between the EU and UK, potential divergences in regulations and standards between the EU and UK post-Brexit, and the implications of border controls and certification requirements. Difficult challenges also arise in regard to potentially restricted access to fishing grounds and resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_976"> The Minister is very aware of these potential threats but he remains very focused on supporting the agrifood industry through the challenges ahead. He has already provided additional resources to Bord Bia and this has, <i>inter alia</i>, funded its Brexit barometer, which is a valuable tool to allow participating companies to assess their own preparedness for Brexit. The learning from this very useful exercise will also help to inform policymakers. He has asked them to conduct a market profiling exercise to help to prioritise market access efforts and he recently announced a seven-point plan to intensify the Department's efforts on this front. As part of the wider Government response, the Minister will continue to assess the risk to the Irish agrifood sector in order to provide appropriate supports to mitigate any risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_977"> The Minister has also provided a number of other supports for the sector,  including a €150 million low-cost loan scheme, agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the rural and seafood development programmes.  The Minister will also continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop and press Ireland's case at European level for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, together with the minimisation of the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_978">This question arises out of the current fears of farmers in my constituency. The Wexford agricultural sector is facing many threats with the imminent departure of the UK from the European Union. Wexford has a strong agrifood sector and the county provides 10% of the country's total agrifood output. Brexit presents a serious economic threat to the agrifood sector as a whole. As the Minister of State is aware, 270,000 jobs rely on the agrifood sector in this country. The value of agrifood exports arising out of agricultural output in County Wexford is €500 million. Several agrifood businesses have already been hit hard due to currency fluctuations and a reluctance to invest as a result of the uncertainty around Brexit. I am somewhat alarmed by the apparent lack of concern that seems to be emanating from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine concerning the existential threats to some sectors within the agrifood sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_979">I do not accept there is a lack of concern. The Department had prepared for the eventuality of a decision by the UK to leave the EU and had scoped out the potential damage that could do to the sector. As I outlined in my opening response, I visited the Netherlands and Belgium in March and the Minister, Deputy Creed, has visited a large number of member states in trying to reaffirm Ireland's particular set of circumstances and exposure to a very unfavourable Brexit deal, or no deal, which would be worse. We are working on this and it is an ongoing effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_980"> The Minister is this week in the United States and Mexico on a trade mission, which has been successful. That will achieve a certain mitigation but, nonetheless, we still export 40% of all our agricultural products to the UK. The mushroom sector exports 80% of its product to the UK and the forestry sector 70%, so there is particular exposure in some sectors.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Browne<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_981">I will give an example to show where my concern is coming from. In the event of a hard Brexit whereby the UK leaves the customs union, any goods getting to and from the Continent through the UK will face four customs checks out and in, including checks in Britain and France. Some 80% of the goods going to the Continent use the UK land bridge. If that land bridge is lost, how do we get our goods to the Continent, for example, roll-on, roll-off and livestock goods? The only option is through Rosslare Europort. The last time I raised this in the House, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade accused me of parish pump politics. To the best of my knowledge, until very recently the Minister, Deputy Ross, had not even bothered to contact anybody in Rosslare Europort and certainly had not met anyone there. He still refuses to publish in the Indecon report around it. That is the concern. If the hammer falls down and we cannot get our goods across the UK land bridge, come a hard Brexit, and we do not have the facilities in Rosslare Europort, how are we going to get our goods to the Continent? Nobody seems to be taking that issue seriously because nobody seems to be addressing it.</p>

            <p eId="para_982">It is important to point out in regard to the agrifood trade between Ireland and the UK that we export approximately €4.8 billion worth of product to the UK and, in return, we purchase €3.7 billion worth of product, which is 46% of our total food imports from the UK. Therefore, there is a mutual trading arrangement of almost €9 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_983"> With regard to the specific query, I have been speaking to members of staff at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who have been to countries such as Lithuania, which has an arrangement with Belarus whereby product goes to Lithuania and back to Belarus and is treated as if it never left the country. If we take the import of flowers to this country from the Netherlands on a daily basis over a land bridge, it is very exposed to the same scenario outlined by the Deputy. This is why we are engaging with countries which are likely to be the most impacted by Brexit, to build up strategic alliances with those nations.</p>

            <p eId="para_986">The Department owns, manages and maintains six designated State-owned fishery harbour centres, at Castletownbere, Dingle, Dunmore East, Howth, Killybegs and Ros an Mhíl.

            <p eId="para_992">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic. I submitted it yesterday but it was not selected for debate then. In the intervening period, the use of Lynam's Hotel has ceased. However, the question remains as to how a decision was made to allow seven children and eight adults to be accommodated in essentially a construction site with faulty electricity, no running water in some parts of the building and, most seriously of all, padlocks on the fire doors. At any time this would be a disgrace, but following the Grenfell Tower disaster it is all the more shocking. For anyone looking at them, the pictures of the padlocked doors would call to mind the Stardust. I do not think we should ever forget the lesson we were taught on that occasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_993"> We are potentially inviting a similar tragedy by not prioritising safety and quality when accommodating families whose only choice is either to take the risk or sleep on the streets. On Wednesday, Dublin Fire Brigade shut down Lynam's Hotel but on Monday somebody in the emergency accommodation section of Dublin City Council made a decision to put those families in harm's way. When questioned, Dublin City Council said it used the building - it is not quite so much a building as it is building site - when, after 10 p.m. on Monday, there was nowhere else to put families. The housing and homelessness crisis has got so bad that council officials are knowingly putting families with young children in harm's way. Thankfully, Dublin Fire Brigade has shut down Lynam's Hotel. My information is there have been 22 other instances where it has recommended units be closed down but where families have continued to be housed in them while remedial work is being undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_994"> Another point which must be made is that while the physical conditions in Lynam's Hotel were bad enough, there were also no properly trained staff available, no support workers for parents who found themselves sleeping in dangerous buildings with their young children and no linked services such as those provided by Tusla. Lynam's Hotel is being developed as a future family hub. There is a whole other debate regarding why we are investing in hubs and not houses. An urgent review of the criteria used to assess unsuitability for use as emergency accommodation is urgently required. This must include the provision of support services to those who find themselves having to use such units.</p>

            <from>Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government (Deputy Eoghan Murphy)<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_995">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. One of the key commitments contained in Rebuilding Ireland is that, by the middle of 2017, hotels will only be used as emergency accommodation in limited circumstances. My Department, housing authorities and approved housing bodies have been working hard to deliver on this very ambitious commitment. As Deputies will be aware, statutory responsibility for the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual housing authorities, which, at present, are advancing a range of housing solutions that will accommodate homeless families. These solutions include supported family hubs, which offer families a safer and more secure living environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_996"> Tackling homelessness is clearly the key priority for the Government at present. It is intended that the long-term housing needs of homeless households, including those families currently accommodated in hotels, will be met through a range of housing supports, including the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and general social housing allocations. Significant outputs are being achieved in this regard. Housing authorities achieved over 3,000 sustainable exits from homeless accommodation into independent tenancies during 2016, a record level of delivery in a calendar year. It should be noted that it is the responsibility of the relevant local authority to comply with all legislative requirements in respect of building works, including the provision of accommodation for homeless families and individuals and related services.</p>
            <p eId="para_997"> Building regulations apply to a wide range of works to existing buildings, including material alterations and changes of use. A building control authority may, if it considers it reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, grant a dispensation from or a relaxation of any requirement of building regulations in respect of buildings or works which are situated in the authorities functional area. A fire certificate is required for certain works to existing buildings to which the requirements of Part B of the building regulations apply. This triggers the provisions set out in the building control amendment regulations of 2014 for certificates of compliance and an assigned certifier.</p>
            <p eId="para_998"> In relation to the Deputy’s specific query regarding families being accommodated in a certain hotel in Dublin, the position is that Dublin City Council has contingency beds in place, which are part of a harm-reduction measure to ensure that families do not sleep rough. The hotel, which is currently undergoing transformation, forms part of the response to meet the growing demand of families presenting late at night and who are unable to source accommodation. Ten rooms at this property have been identified as suitable to accommodate families in this emergency situation only. To enable the use of the rooms as contingency beds, Dublin City Council and an independent fire consultant put in place all necessary precautions and requirements to ensure the safety of any families placed there, including the appointment of two fire marshals who are on duty while families are there overnight. Children have not been put in harm's way.</p>
            <p eId="para_999"> Dublin City Council met Dublin's fire services yesterday, 21 June 2017, and will be working with them over the next few days to implement further precautions to enable the facility to continue to be utilised for contingency purposes following the completion of works on the additional precautions. The priority is always the safety and welfare of families placed in all emergency accommodation. I assure the House that when advancing accommodation for homeless families, local authorities are required to adhere to current building standards, and there are strict quality controls in place to ensure that all facilities are fully regulated with regard to fire and disabled access requirements. There are also space standards in place that have been developed with my Department. Accordingly, support spaces such as dining and play areas are designed in accordance with the number of occupants who will reside at the premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000"> Returning briefly to the premises named by the Deputy, an order was not put in place to close those premises last night and, thankfully, no families had to be accommodated there last night.</p>

            <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1001">Did the Minister see the photographs of the chain on the fire doors?</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">I cannot imagine an independent fire consultant approving a situation where fire doors are chained. I wish to hear more about that. Dublin Fire Brigade has indicated that there are 22 other premises about which it is concerned. According to the council's building register, the completion certificate for the refurbishment works has not been filed and works are still ongoing, so the hotel is still technically and practically a construction site. We all understand that there is a serious homelessness problem but the last thing we want is for that to end up in a tragedy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003"> The Minister referred to the housing assistance payment. In many cases, part of the reason these people have ended up homeless is that they cannot find accommodation to rent. This case relates to Dublin City Council but that is the situation in many more locations, including my area. It is simply not possible for people to find rental accommodation. The housing assistance payment, even though a large amount is allocated for it, is still below the rents being sought, and the amount of accommodation available to rent is less than the need. Saying that a housing assistance payment is being provided to deal with the homelessness problem might well be technically true but, in practical terms, one cannot find any place to rent and if one does find a place the housing assistance payment will not cover its cost in many cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004"> I referred to the other 22 premises. The Minister said nobody was accommodated in Lynam's Hotel last night. Is it still the intention to use it? Will the Minister consult Dublin City Council and the fire brigade about those premises? Can he confirm that an independent fire consultant would approve a situation where there are chains on fire doors? I do not know if the Minister saw the photograph but I did.</p>

            <p eId="para_1005">This hotel will eventually become a hub. A hub is not a permanent form of accommodation. It is just a first response to make sure we can get families who are homeless out of hotels, because they should not be in hotels. I had an opportunity to visit one of the hubs that is under construction at Mater Dei, where 50 families will be housed. It is a fantastic facility with play areas, a playground, a media room for children and homework clubs. It will have all the necessary supports for families who find themselves in these incredibly difficult situations to move on quickly from the hub to other more permanent and sustainable accommodation solutions. While they are making that transition, however, they will at least be in the hub, a new environment with all the supports required, rather than being in a hotel, which is not the appropriate place and does not have the type of certainty, even day to day, a family would need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006"> The hotel in question would not have been used but for the fact that a choice was faced by the local authority, not last night but previously, as to whether families that presented would have to sleep rough. This hotel was made safe so they would not have to sleep rough. It was only ten rooms at the property on one floor. It was only for an emergency situation. I do not mean the emergency situation for all families that are homeless and in hotels, but an emergency contingency. Dublin City Council and an independent consultant put in place all the necessary precautions and requirements to ensure the safety of any families placed there. That included the employment of two fire marshals who were on duty while the families were there overnight. Those precautions and measures were put in place when there were families at the premises. There were no families there last night. Dublin City Council met with Dublin fire services yesterday and will be working with them over the next few days to implement further precautions to enable the facility to continue to be utilised for contingency purposes only following the completion of works on the additional precautions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007"> The Deputy mentioned housing assistance payments. These are only one part of the solution. There are other parts. I should also mention the new HAP homeless payment which was implemented earlier this year. That gives even greater flexibility in terms of negotiating a sustainable rent. The HAP homeless solution is working and it is being rolled out to other parts of the country.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1009">I am raising an issue reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on Saturday, 17 June, by Sean O'Riordan, an eminent journalist. The article states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1010"> More than 80 garda detectives are to stop providing armed cover on a 24/7 basis in the Cork region amid claims they have been left vulnerable by garda management's refusal to give them proper training and equipment to tackle gangland crime or terrorist attacks.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1011"> The Garda Representative Association (GRA) has told garda management, that, from July 1, detectives will no longer provide armed cover around-the-clock, which is likely to lead to gaps in service provision at certain times of the night.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1012"> Since 2011 the GRA has been seeking the same training and equipment for Cork-based garda detectives as has been given to the Special Detective Unit in Dublin, whose members are equipped with bullet-proof shields [and firearms training]. That unit was issued with the shields so they could provide armed cover when the Emergency Response Unit (ERU) was not working in the Dublin area.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1013"> The GRA call for the same shields to be issued in Cork was sparked a few years ago by an incident in the Minane Bridge area, 25 km south of Cork City, when a uniformed garda risked his life to save three children by taking off his bullet-proof jacket and using it to shield them from a man who was shooting at him and his colleagues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">There is a need to ensure that gardaí have proper bulletproof vests and training. There is now a situation whereby, potentially, there could be no armed cover in Cork city and county. The detectives not only provide armed cover in those areas but have also attended incidents in Kerry and south Tipperary. It is very serious if our detectives are not getting the same training and equipment as their colleagues in Dublin. We have a duty to ensure that An Garda Síochána is given the resources, capabilities and training to deal with any events officers might confront, particularly where firearms are involved and where there is a threat to both gardaí and broader society. Gardaí are fighting criminal gangs and others with poor equipment and a lack of training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015"> The more than 80 detectives in the Cork city division have informed the management that from 1 July they will not provide 24-7 armed cover because, in their view, continuing to do so would breach the working time directive and health and safety legislation. I urge the Minister to intervene to ensure this training, proper firearms and bulletproof shields are provided. The chair and vice-chair of the joint policing committee in Cork county have also raised this. It must be addressed. I would appreciate if the Minister could give a detailed response on what he intends to do and, more importantly, what Garda management intends to do to ensure members of the force have all the resources required to protect the public.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy David Stanton)<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1016">On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who regrets that he cannot attend this evening, I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017"> The Government is determined that the Garda will have the resources it needs to tackle to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities. The Deputy will appreciate that it is the Garda Commissioner and her management team who are responsible for the distribution of Garda resources, including personnel, among the various Garda divisions and the Minister has no direct role in the matter. However, the Minister is informed by the Garda Commissioner that arrangements are currently in place with detective personnel to ensure the capacity and capability of An Garda Síochána to respond to an armed or critical incident in Cork city and its environs on a 24-7 basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018"> Armed response units were established on a regional basis to provide an armed response capacity and capability on a regional basis and in support of and to supplement the national emergency response unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">Members of the armed response units are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high-visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout their respective regions. In the event of an armed incident or similar outrage, armed detective members from local district and divisional units will respond, as will the armed response units, which are based in each Garda region. Should the incident be escalated and further armed support be required, the Garda emergency response unit is also available and its members are also highly trained and specially equipped to respond to the most serious incident or terrorist threat.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020"> In order to ensure and maintain the capability and capacity of armed support units, a competition to select, train and allocate additional personnel for the regional armed response units outside the Dublin metropolitan region has recently been commenced. In the interim, the Minister has been advised that tactical awareness training, including the provision of equipment, is ongoing in the southern region for detective Garda personnel. The Minister has been advised that discussions are ongoing with the relevant authorities for the training of the next tranche of identified personnel, which is expected to commence shortly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1021">I seek assurances not only for myself but also, more importantly, for members of An Garda Síochána. If these reports are accurate and verified, we will have circumstances in which detectives will not, as stated in the newspaper report from which I quoted, be providing 24-7 armed cover in the southern division. That would be a considerable concern, primarily because it would jeopardise the safety of members of An Garda and potentially give signals to criminal elements that the force is effectively trying to fight crime with one arm tied behind its back. We simply cannot have that in any part of the country but, in the context of the southern division and the Cork city Garda division, these are issues of major concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022"> In the Cork area, there will be large gatherings of people. There are armed gardaí at GAA matches now, for example. They were very evident in Thurles last week. Páirc Uí Chaoimh will be re-opening soon. Additional resources will be required to ensure there is armed cover at events there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023"> These issues are of concern. While I accept that the Minister of State does not have a hands-on role every day in Garda management, it is important that he relay the concerns I am raising to the Garda Commissioner and insist that members of the force outside Dublin have the same training and access to equipment, including safety vests, bulletproof vests and the proper arms, as their Dublin counterparts in order to ensure they are not vulnerable when carrying out their duties on behalf of the Irish people and the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_1024">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. As I said, the Government is fully committed to ensuring that An Garda Síochána has the necessary resources and training to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities. I assure Deputies that, as confirmed by the Garda Commissioner, arrangements are currently in place with detective personnel to ensure the capacity and capability of An Garda Síochána to respond to an armed or critical incident in Cork city and its environs on a 24-7 basis. Training, equipment and personnel capacity of the regional armed response units and the emergency response unit are kept under constant review with a view to ensuring their functional capacity is kept at the optimal level. On foot of that continual review, a competition to select, train and allocate additional personnel for the regional armed response unit outside the Dublin metropolitan region has recently been commenced by Garda management. In the interim, the Commissioner has advised the Minister that tactical-awareness training, including the provision of equipment, is ongoing for the southern region for detective garda personnel. Furthermore, discussions are in train with the relevant authorities for the training of the next tranche of identified personnel. It is expected that this training will commence shortly. The Deputy is quite correct that these are serious matters. I thank him for raising this issue. It is important that the arrangements be kept under constant review. The Minister is anxious to do this with the Garda Commissioner to ensure we have the required capability and capacity.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1026">I thank the Minister of State for attending to deal with this issue. It relates to the women's refuge Amber, which is based in Kilkenny city but covers both counties Carlow and Kilkenny. As one can imagine, this is quite a large area for one refuge. It can cater for seven women and 23 children. I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to visit the refuge. It is an excellent facility and does fantastic work. It is very much respectful of women's and children's individual privacy. It has been doing fantastic work in the area in recent years. Last year, however, the refuge could not deal with 320 referrals made to it. This was due to the fact that Amber is being asked to deal with many emergency accommodation cases that arise in Carlow and Kilkenny. The service it provides and the role it plays concern domestic violence and women fleeing such violence. Everybody knows it can take an awful lot of courage and bravery to finally decide to leave certain circumstances, particularly if one has children. Where women make that decision and go to a service that says that, through no fault of its own, it cannot deal with them, the likelihood and reality are that most will return directly to the violent environment they left.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027"> The service provided is not just accommodation. The refuge also provides counselling and supports in respect of courts and court orders. It provides great services for children, such as play therapy, which is vital. It should be allowed to do that work and concentrate solely on it. It should not be asked to take up the burden of the emergency accommodation situation in both Carlow and Kilkenny. I argue that we should have a stand-alone facility in Carlow. Realistically, if one is based in Carlow and one's children are going to school there, it is unrealistic to believe one can move to Kilkenny city and still be able to go about one's day-to-day life.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028"> Will the Government consider having a stand-alone domestic violence facility for women and children in Carlow? It should also carry out an audit in the Carlow-Kilkenny area regarding emergency accommodation and domestic violence services and ensure adequate funding is put in place so the services can be separated. What is happening is completely unfair. Since being elected last year, I find myself time and again highlighting issues that directly and disproportionately affect women and children negatively. This is another example of that. I understand it is not the Minister of State's brief but he is very welcome to visit the facility. The staff would be happy about this. He would see at first hand the great work they do. I ask that adequate funding be put in place so emergency accommodation may be separated from domestic violence services and the services needed for the facility to be run adequately.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1029">I thank Deputy Funchion for raising this issue. I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position on domestic violence services in Carlow and Kilkenny on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, who sends her apologies for not being able to be here this afternoon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030"> Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic violence. In 2017, Tusla is allocating €22.1 million for the provision of services tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. This represents an increase of €1.5 million over 2016. Tusla provides funding to 60 organisations in this area nationally, 20 of which provide emergency accommodation to adults and children affected by domestic violence. In discharging its statutory responsibility, Tusla supports emergency refuges in providing services for adults and children fleeing domestic violence. Tusla also provides a range of community-based supports to victims of domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031"> It is important to distinguish between emergency refuge services funded by Tusla and longer term provision for housing needs, which is dealt with by local housing authorities. The challenges involved in providing longer-term housing for those who find themselves homeless can impact on the length of time that families stay in emergency refuge accommodation. This can have a knock-on effect on spaces for those with acute safety needs seeking access to a refuge, as the Deputy has quite rightly pointed out. At times where domestic violence refuges cannot accommodate families, service providers help with referrals to other refuges or safe accommodation. Services also provide emotional supports and advocacy for women. Where there is an immediate or serious risk of violence, refuges work with the women concerned, and An Garda Síochána, as needed, to find safe short-term solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032"> My Government colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has responsibility for Rebuilding Ireland, which was launched last year. It contains a commitment to provide additional emergency refuge accommodation spaces for victims of domestic violence. This is in addition to those emergency refuge spaces already supported by Tusla. In 2016, Tusla provided funding for 155 family units, comprising 147 emergency refuge family units and eight emergency non-refuge family units. </p>
            <p eId="para_1033"> I acknowledge the vital role that Amber Kilkenny Women’s Refuge plays in its community, providing safe, short-term emergency refuge accommodation for families, child care for affected children on site, a 24-hour helpline, counselling and other supports. I understand that the refuge can cater for seven women and up to 23 children at any time. The centre also supports women through the provision of information on all aspects of domestic violence and links to other relevant agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">These include social and community welfare, housing authorities and legal aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035"> I am concerned that the level of demand for services in the region is greater than the current available capacity, and I thank Deputy Funchion for raising this matter. Tusla is allocating funding of €493,000 to the refuge this year. Tusla is committed to ensuring that there is more equitable access to services. It is developing more evidence-based, targeted interventions for those affected by domestic violence. Tusla will work in partnership with local organisations, such as Amber Women’s Refuge, Kilkenny, in order to obtain the best possible supports for families experiencing domestic violence in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036"> As part of its approach to the commissioning, Tusla is currently assessing the level of need throughout the country, and is working closely with key stakeholders to develop appropriate service responses. This work will inform future decisions by Tusla with regard to priority areas for investment, including the development of services in the south east.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037"> In conclusion, I thank Deputy Funchion for raising this important matter. It is of key importance that the needs of those who suffer domestic violence are met in the best way possible. I can assure the Deputy that my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, will continue to work on this vital issue with Tusla and with service providers around the country and in Carlow and Kilkenny as well.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1038">I would like to pass along my condolences and thoughts to the Minister, Deputy Zappone. I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has stepped in to take this matter. I welcome the fact that Tusla is going to conduct an audit of services. However, I raised yesterday at a Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs meeting that I would have some doubts about Tusla and its capabilities with all of the crises that it is dealing with at the moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039"> Housing needs to be tied in with this as well. Something that I failed to say in my first contribution is that Amber has had to introduce a three-month stay. That is the first time it has had to introduce that. After three months, they are going to have to ask women to leave the refuge. That is extremely difficult on the women and children, as well as on the staff and management there, who are trying to do their best. They are already under pressure and have to deal with so many difficult situations that they end up having to turn away others. They will obviously offer other supports to people but might not be able to provide the accommodation. Now, after three months, they will potentially have to ask people to leave. Housing needs to work alongside this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040"> I urge the Minister to speak to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government about this to see if there is a possibility that Tusla and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government can work together. It is an issue of funding for domestic violence services but also an issue of accommodation, because that is why they are in this situation in the first place. I believe it is really important that an audit is carried out in Carlow and Kilkenny on the emergency accommodation needs and the domestic violence needs in order that those two services can be clearly distinguished and that one is not taking from the other, which always seems to happen when a service directly affects women.</p>

            <p eId="para_1041">I thank the Deputy for her work and sincerity in this area. It is very important. A range of integrated supports are required in order to reduce the need for women and families to use emergency accommodation and to ensure that families disrupted by domestic violence can be supported to resume normal and safe family living beyond refuse-type accommodation within the shortest possible timeframe. It is acknowledged that there are concerns in regard to the level of refuse space in the Carlow and Kilkenny area. However, there are a range of outreach services available, including information, advice, a 24-hour helpline and counselling. These outreach services are offered in a number of locations in County Kilkenny, as the Deputy knows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042"> Tusla is looking at the needs across Carlow and Kilkenny with Amber involved as the main provider of refuse services for women and families across the two counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043"> The recommendation of the Council of Europe is for one refuge space per 10,000 adult women. According to the Council of Europe's analytical study of the results of the fourth round of monitoring the implementation of recommendation rec (2002)5 on the protection of women against violence, published in 2014, Ireland's ratio of refuge space relative to the population is higher than the recommended rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044"> I know that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, will be happy to update the Deputy and her colleagues in the area on any related matters or developments. Again, I want to thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1045">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1046">That Dáil Éireann shall consider the Report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, entitled ‘Sláintecare Report’, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 30th May, 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> In last year’s general election, health care was the No. 1 issue of concern for the public. This was hardly surprising when one considers the huge level of unmet need, with over 600,000 people on waiting lists for hospital services, hundreds of thousands on waiting lists for community services such as speech and language therapy and physiotherapy, and great difficulties for many in accessing mental health services, home care and disability services. There is no doubt that the political system has failed the people in one of the most basic and essential public services, namely, health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> Unlike most other developed countries, we in Ireland have never sought to identify the most appropriate model of health care for the Irish people. A very disjointed, inefficient and inequitable system has evolved over the years which fails to adequately meet the needs of the people. Ireland is an outlier in terms of our two-tier health system. In no other European country are so many people denied access to services or forced into private health insurance. On the one hand, almost 40% have eligibility for free health care. This is eligibility rather than entitlement and is merely theoretical as many of the services either do not exist or are hopelessly inadequate. On the other hand, some 45% of the population feel they have no choice but to take out expensive private health insurance that rises every year, yet the level of cover provided fails to meet the cost of many essential services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> All service users are faced with significant out-of-pocket expenses that have risen significantly in recent years, often to a catastrophic level at which many are denied access to care. In the Irish context, the inverse care law clearly applies. Those most in need of care are least likely to receive it. This point was strongly emphasised and graphically displayed to the committee by a group of GPs working in disadvantaged areas known as "Doctors at the Deep End".</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">Our health service is very much dominated by vested interests. Going back as far as the mother and child scheme of the 1950s, proper public health services have been blocked by those who see health care as a commodity from which to gain profits. The reality is that the weaker the public system, the more the private system benefits. The reverse also applies. The better the public health system, the less opportunity there is for profiteering. As a result, too often attempts to reform our dysfunctional system have been stymied by those who care little about equity and put private interests ahead of the public interest. When we hear public commentary on the health service, including some of the negative responses to this report, it is always wise to ask <i>cui bono</i> - who benefits? Are these people more concerned with their own commercial interests rather than the public good? At a political level and often at official level, vested interests have held too much sway. Too often, the ministerial approach has been to juggle these vested interests and thereby maintain the <i>status quo</i>. This has happened at the expense of the patient. The interregnum last year provided an opportunity for the Dáil to take a new approach. Some 89 members signed up to a Dáil motion calling for an all-party consensus. Shortly afterwards, the Minister and Government came on board and the result was a unanimous decision of the Dáil to establish the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. The Dáil motion set the terms of reference for the committee. These had three key aims. They were to seek political consensus on a ten-year strategy for the health service, to plan for the introduction of a universal single-tier health service based on need rather than ability to pay and to re-orientate the health service away from our hospital-centric model so the vast bulk of care is provided at primary and social care level. Fundamental to these objectives was an acceptance that we need to stop making a political football out of health and reach a consensus on how our health service should be designed and structured in order to put the needs of patients first. From the outset, we decided that our approach would have a number of elements. We were determined that our work would be evidence-based. We said it was a priority to listen to service users and staff. We took expert advice, most notably from the Centre for Health Policy and Management at Trinity College Dublin, which worked very closely with us and guided us in developing our report. We learned from best practice in other countries and took advice from people like Allyson Pollock and Dr. Josep Figueras of the OECD. We held expert-led workshops and agreed on a set of values and eight principles which would underpin our work. They are creating a modern, responsive and integrated public health system comparable to other European countries through building long-term public and political confidence in the delivery and implementation of this plan; all care planned and provided so that the patient is paramount ensuring appropriate care pathways and seamless transition backed up by full patient record and information; timely access to all health and social care according to medical need; care provided free at point of delivery based entirely on clinical need; patients accessing care at most appropriate and cost-effective service level with a strong emphasis on prevention and public health; a health service workforce that is appropriate, accountable, flexible, well-resourced, supported and valued; only spending public money in the public interest or for the public good ensuring value for money, integration, oversight, accountability and correct incentives; and the centrality of accountability, effective organisational alignment and good governance to the organisation and functioning of the health system. The areas which we prioritised became the key chapters of our report. They are population health profile, entitlements and access, integrated care, funding and implementation. We have called our proposals Sláintecare. The key elements are a new general health card, cárta sláinte, entitling everyone to a broad range of treatments and medicines at low cost or for free, which will reduce out-of-pocket expenses for all; waiting time guarantees of 12 weeks for an inpatient procedure, ten weeks for an outpatient appointment and ten days for a diagnostic test, all of which are to be underpinned by legislation; delivery of at least 70% of peoples' health care services locally in their community, including chronic illness management, diagnostic services and minor injury care; more investment in preventive public health and the promotion of healthy lifestyles, mental well-being and early detection and management of chronic illness; and the phased elimination of private care from public hospitals. Everyone will be entitled to access public care in public hospitals. Those who have private health insurance will still be able to purchase care from private health care providers but there will be no subsidisation of that. Other key elements of the plan include significant up-front and ongoing year-on-year investment rising to €2.8 billion over a ten-year period and a transitional fund of €3 billion to support investment across the health system in areas such as infrastructure, e-health and expansion of training capacity and the settling up of a Sláinte implementation office under the auspices of An Taoiseach to develop a detailed implementation plan for the reform programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> On the question of funding, we very much recognise that Ireland already spends a lot on health relative to other countries but it is clear that the manner in which that money is being spent means we get very poor value for money and unsatisfactory health outcomes. Our approach has been to recommend spending in order to save where there will be significant saving for individuals and families in terms of out-of-pocket expenses, where the need for private health insurance will decrease, where we move to a much lower cost model of care and where this is facilitated by a full e-health programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> We urge the Government to endorse the detailed and costed approach set out by the committee in Sláintecare. This is not a menu of options from which to pick and choose. It is a comprehensive strategy whose elements are inter-related and interdependent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> As a result, I am concerned about the mixed messages coming from the Government in respect of its response. While the Minister is sounding positive, the Government Press Office seems to be briefing negatively. A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday went as far as to say that the Minister has signalled his intention to implement the future of health care report only partially and that he will tell the Dáil that he welcomes those elements which are consistent with Government policy. I also know that there was similar negative briefing of journalists after Tuesday's Cabinet meeting. I sincerely hope this is not what the Minister is going to say and I hope it does not represent his views because to do so would be to fly in the face of the hard-won political consensus on which Sláintecare is built.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> I take this opportunity to thank all members of the committee for their engagement in this process over the past 11 months. It was demanding and time consuming and involved a lot of meetings and much reading between meetings. We were all challenged to find workable solutions. I believe all members approached the task with an earnest desire to fulfill the remit which they had been given by the Dáil and to draft a strategy to ensure that their constituents and all people in Ireland would be provided with a modern, equitable and efficient public health care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I also thank the secretariat here in the Oireachtas, which provided important support and backup and worked to challenging and tight deadlines. The committee was particularly fortunate in being able to engage the expertise of the team from the Trinity College Dublin centre for health policy and management, under the leadership of Dr. Stephen Thomas. Its wide-ranging expertise and guidance was invaluable to the work of the committee. I also thank the Minister for Health, the Department of Health and the HSE for their support during the process, and for the data and responses which they were able to provide for the many queries which we raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> The Sláintecare plan will deliver for Ireland the sort of fair, affordable and effective public health system that we desperately need and deserve, and which most of our European neighbours enjoy. This is the first time there has ever been cross-party consensus on how to deliver a modern universal health care system that meets the needs of all people based on their medical needs, not on their economic status. Sláintecare is a realistic and achievable plan. It is about investing now in those key elements of the health care system in order to bring about better results and to save on funding later. It has been costed by health experts and has strong support among many patient groups and medical practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057"> What we now need is a Government commitment to implement this plan in its entirety. We cannot continue with our broken health system where patients are dying on waiting lists, where many people's lives are limited by the lack of availability of much-needed services, and where families are impoverished because they have had to bear the costs of services that should be available free of charge in a modern, fully-developed country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> This is an historic opportunity to introduce a high-quality public health service for everyone in Ireland. We will not be forgiven if we allow this opportunity to pass.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1059">I thank Deputy Shortall for her contribution to this debate. She has once again spoken with passion and determination in pursuit of better health services for the citizens of our country, and I would also like to state that her contribution as Chair of this committee has been enormous, and I acknowledge that today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> I also commend all members of the committee, from all political parties and none, for the time and effort they have dedicated to this process. There are many people, both in this House and outside, who remain sceptical about the political make-up of the current Dáil and about what we can achieve together. The way this committee went about its business, and the near unanimity in support for its report, provides a solid rebuttal to those critics. Members engaged in an open, respectful and positive approach to discussions, and understood the prize of achieving a consensus position for patients and for all citizens. It behoves us all to continue in this spirit, and to do our utmost to act on the vision and the strategic direction set out by the committee in the Sláintecare report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> I will not dwell for long on the challenges facing our health system. They have been recounted here and elsewhere with increasing frustration in recent years. We have a fractured system, an outdated model of care that is unfit for purpose, chronic access issues, and growing sustainability concerns as we face into a period of significant population ageing. These problems have persisted for some years now, and have unfortunately led to a real lack of public confidence in elements of our health service, particularly relating to the issue of access. That is not to say that there are not positives. Health outcomes continue to improve, and services are continuously adapting to provide more effective care. Every day, people in this country experience excellent care at the hands of extremely dedicated and qualified health care professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062"> Over the last year, I have had the opportunity to visit health care facilities right across this country. I know the difficult working conditions that people face. I have seen first-hand the commitment and professionalism of staff and management that underpin our services, and most importantly, I understand the genuine hope and ambition that still exists across the system, despite the bad days, to deliver health services of which we can all be proud. The committee's report demonstrates that this hope and ambition is shared in Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> I have no doubt that the publication of the Sláintecare report will come to mark a critical milestone in the history of our health service, and can provide us with the solid framework and guidance for health services development over the next decade. It is clear in its resolve that considerable change and transformation are required. I fully agree with this. The former US President, Bill Clinton, said "The price of doing the same old thing is far higher than the price of change."</p>
          <p eId="para_1064"> The report sets out a clear set of principles developed through political consensus. We should not overlook the importance of these eight fundamental principals outlined by Deputy Shortall. It is not possible to map out in advance all of the decisions that will be required over the next ten years. Some specific details may inevitably need to be revisited based on experience, as Deputy Shortall said about implementing any plan. However, the principles set out in the report provide a basis for getting the important calls right throughout the implementation process. They also provide clarity in challenging resistance based upon vested interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> I also believe that the ten-year timeframe is a key strength of the report, which needs to be viewed in that prism. In some of the commentary I have heard on this report, people have talked about it as if it all needs to be implemented right this moment. It is a ten-year plan. We need to be realistic about the timelines required to plan and implement large-scale system change in services as important as health care. It may be possible to make <i>ad hoc</i> changes over shorter timeframes, but it is not realistic to introduce meaningful changes on a sustainable basis without proper planning, the building of support, clear accountability for implementation, and the monitoring and evaluation of outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066"> The report strongly advocates for a new model of integrated care, centred on comprehensive primary and community care services. We all know that this must be the direction to travel. Our hospital system simply will not cope with the likely levels of demand in the coming years if we continue with our current model of care. More importantly, health outcomes and patient experience can be much improved by developing greater services in the community and by bringing about deeper and more seamless integration across the health and social care system, as set out in the Sláintecare report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067"> Proposals to develop capacity in both HSE primary care services and in contractor-provided services such as general practitioner and community pharmacy services, increased provision of diagnostic capacity, a greater role in the management of chronic conditions, and measures to support GP practice in rural and deprived urban areas, all dovetail well with actions set out in the programme for Government, and will be fundamental to supporting the desired shift to primary care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068"> A range of enablers and initiatives supporting integrated care are also given strong endorsement in the report, including the Healthy Ireland strategy, eHealth, integrated workforce planning, clinical governance, enhanced community nursing, integrated care programmes, and current strategies in the areas of maternity care and mental health. The support for these initiatives can add greater impetus to their successful delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> I will pick eHealth as an example. Just as in all sectors of society, the role of information technology in health cannot be overstated. We simply cannot achieve the responsive, integrated, effective system that we all desire without significant investment in information systems. We can all agree that we were coming from a particularly low base when the eHealth strategy was first put in place. This is a prime example of a challenge that, at the time, may have seemed too daunting to even contemplate with regard to systemic change. Now we can begin to see what can be achieved when a clear strategy is put in place and an effective implementation plan and roadmap is defined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070"> I will also single out the committee's conclusion that our health structures are in need of change. I spoke on this issue in my appearance before the committee. While I do not believe that structural change will be the panacea for improvement in our health services - far from it - I firmly believe that our current structure is not serving patients or staff in our health service in the best way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071"> I welcome the fundamentals set out by the committee that should underpin structural reorganisation, including the re-establishment of a HSE board, and the reconfiguration of the HSE to involve a leaner national agency, retaining national level functions complemented by a more devolved, responsive and integrated entity at regional level. I intend to move ahead with the establishment of a HSE board, and will publish the necessary legislation this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072"> As we evolve our structures, our overriding ambition should be for policy, entitlements and standards to be set nationally, but for these to be delivered locally to the greatest extent possible. We need to bring decision-making closer to the point of care delivery, and provide a counterweight to the unnecessary over-centralisation which impedes service responsiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> The report is also clear in its call for the establishment of a universal single-tier system where access to care is on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Let me be clear, that is a view I share and it is a view that my party has also endorsed in terms of both the terms of reference and the work of our members on the committee. Of course, this is in accordance with the terms of reference for the committee. To deliver on this aim, two fundamental policy changes are proposed by the committee: First, the introduction of universal entitlement to healthcare services underpinned in legislation, and at no or at low cost; and second, the removal of private activity from public hospitals. These are fundamental changes. There is currently an inherent unfairness in our system when it comes to accessing care. Ability to pay does have an influence today on access, and for many, accessing care comes at too high a price. This needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074"> The committee's report represents an important step in the reform of our health services. It provides us with a vision and strategic direction that parties, and indeed Independents, across the House have signed up to.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> However, it is only a first step. As recognised by the committee report, "mechanisms for implementation are as important as the report's recommendations". It is appropriate that we now allow time to reflect and deliberate on the findings of the committee and consider how best the vision and spirit of the report can be realised. I understand the desire of many to move quickly on the recommendations and to demonstrate real momentum and this is a desire that I share, but we need to balance this with the potential consequences of rushed or incomplete implementation plans. It is critical that we get this right. I agree with the need for a whole-of-Government approach and the role of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach as outlined in the report, but I also need to balance that with the responsibilities that I have, as Minister for Health, and indeed that future holders of this office will have, in terms of our own duties to the House, to the Oireachtas, to the Cabinet and indeed under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, but I believe we can tease that through, as I have already discussed with many members of the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> As Minister, it is my duty to consider the challenges we are likely to face in delivering the scale of reform envisaged in the report. At the outset, I would like to stress that I consider these as challenges with solutions, as opposed to immovable barriers, but they require consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077"> The first obvious challenge, and one that is recognised throughout the report in fairness to the report, is that of current capacity. To be blunt, out starting point is not good. Since taking up the position of Minister over a year ago, I have been clear that we need more capacity, both physical and staffing. This is a problem that is being experienced right across the health service and it is one that will not be remedied overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078"> A capacity review is under way which will report later in the year. It will give us a definitive assessment of capacity requirements across the system and will provide a platform for planning and delivering health services in the years ahead. There is also a concerted effort under way to recruit and retain staff. By the way, I believe this report, in having a ten-year plan, helps in that aim to recruit and retain staff in the health service. Recruitment and retention is not without its challenges but the development of a more attractive working environment will go hand in hand with the roll-out of system improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> However, we must be realistic about our current capacity situation when we are considering timeframes for delivering on the report's ambitions. It will take time to put in place infrastructure and a pipeline of trained healthcare professionals. Entitlement expansion and waiting list guarantees will be meaningless unless we match them with increased capacity - that is something on which we can all agree. It will be important to introduce sufficient increase in the supply of healthcare as we stimulate demand and utilisation through changes in entitlement or charging if we are to avoid exacerbating access issues for those most in need or reducing quality for everyone. We should also introduce changes in entitlement on a phased basis so that we can monitor and address the impact. We also need to be conscious of the ever evolving economic and fiscal environment and the range of demands across all public services for funding increases. It is a point we all agree on. While the report provides costings, I doubt there is a political consensus on funding. I am sure that will be an issue that we will debate on many an occasion in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080"> In saying all that, I do not want to concentrate solutions overly on capacity increases. We are all agreed that additional capacity and extra funding cannot be the only answer. Fundamental changes in our model of care, as I mentioned earlier, must be a central plank of long-term reform plans. The report also points to fundamental policy changes in entitlements and in the mix of public and private activity within our hospital system and in GP services. We are all aware of the realities in delivering reform in these areas. This process will require more than will and leadership from within the political sphere. It demands leadership and flexibility across the health service and within the health professions, and I appeal to all health professionals in that regard. Changes in contracts will not be easily achieved and this cannot be at any price to the taxpayer. It would be naive to consider that there will not be resistance to change in these and other areas. The Chairman acknowledged that when she referenced vested interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081"> Successive Governments have long advocated for a shift towards primary care. It is something upon which there has been genuine broad agreement for some time but we must ask ourselves why it has not been successfully delivered to date and what measures can be taken to realise and capitalise fully on the potential primary care has to offer. These will be important considerations for implementation. To achieve integrated care requires much more flexible, organisational and professional practices than has been the norm to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082"> The report quite rightly addresses the learning from the reorganisation of our cancer services but the reform of hospital services in cancer and other areas based upon quality and sustainability considerations has not always won support locally or in the House. There is a duty on every Member of this House to acknowledge - I include my party in this - that when it has come to reforming health services and when it has come to making changes everyone is in favour of it until it is in his or her own constituency. The committee rightly references in the Sláintecare report the success in cancer services but reform of hospital services involves all of us making decisions on the basis of quality clinical advice and sustainability, not on the basis of political point scoring. I hope we can build upon the political consensus achieved in this report when it comes to addressing these and other difficult issues in health over the next decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> In pointing to these challenges, I do not intend to be defeatist - far from it. I firmly believe that the time is opportune to deliver the kind of change that we all know is needed and that is indicated and outlined in the Sláintecare report. We now have a cross-party report which enjoys widespread political, and I would suggest widespread societal, support. There is a desire evident at all levels, both within the political system and across the health service, to work together to deliver lasting improvements in our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084"> This is a desire shared by the Government. The Taoiseach was very clear in his speech to this Chamber last week that delivering real improvements in our health services is a key priority of this Government. He has tasked me with preparing a detailed response to the report, including proposed measures and timelines. It is my intention now to discharge my duties as Minister for Health in that regard following this Dáil debate. I hope to bring forward not just proposals as to how we might gear up for implementation taking account of existing statutory responsibilities, but also some immediate decisions that we might be able to proceed to implement to show momentum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> I have already had the opportunity to hear initial views from some Members of the Oireachtas and from various stakeholders, and I look forward to hearing contributions from across the House today. Following this, I hope to bring detailed analysis and proposals to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086"> I remain positive that we can make a real difference to the lives of individual patients and the health system as a whole and I have no doubt that this report will be an essential reference point for all Governments and parties in the fundamental reform of our health services over the next decade.</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1087">Fianna Fáil was part of the cross-party Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare and believes it provides a pathway on how the health services should be delivered. However, it needs substantial investment and will also require a large number of reform measures to be delivered. There is an obvious need to build capacity in our health services to meet both current and future demands and Fianna Fáil is committed to working to achieving this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> We fully support building up our public health system, funded primarily by general taxation. We acknowledge that the proposals in the report are ambitious and exceptionally challenging. The committee recommends investment in the region of €2.8 billion over ten years and states that to implement system change, there is a need for additional once-off transitional funding estimated at €3 billion. It is quite a challenge in terms of both the required reforms and the funding necessary to ensure we have a health service that can deliver care to the people when they need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089"> On background, in June 2016, the Dáil established the Committee on the Future of Healthcare with the goal of achieving cross-party, political agreement on the future direction of the health service, and devising a ten year plan for reform. Specifically, the committee was to devise cross-party agreement on a single long-term vision for health care and direction of health policy in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090"> The terms of reference explicitly recognised the severe pressures on the health service, the unacceptable waiting times that arise for public patients and the poor outcomes relative to cost; the need for consensus at political level on the health service funding model based on population health needs; the need to establish a universal single tier service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than ability to pay; that to maintain health and well-being and build a better health service we need to examine some of the operating assumptions on which health policy and health services are based; that the best health outcomes and value for money can be achieved by re-orientating the model of care towards primary and community care where the majority of people's health needs can be met locally; and the Oireachtas intention to develop and adopt a ten year plan for our health services, based on political consensus, that can deliver these changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The report recognises that the health service as it stands is not providing the population with fair or equitable medical care and that our health services do not have the bed capacity to provide timely, urgent and planned care. The report emphasises the need to move decisively towards equitable access to a high-quality universal single-tier system. The Chair of the committee, Deputy Róisín Shortall, referred to the eight fundamental principles on which the committee deliberated to reach broad consensus. I wish to put on record my appreciation to the Chair, all the members, the staff of the committee and to those from outside the Houses of the Oireachtas who made presentations and oral and written submissions. This process was critical in engaging with the stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092"> We went through a journey over the past year. While we might have believed we knew a great deal about health services and health care, we learned that it is complex. There is considerable interdependence on the various specialties and professions within health care. Certainly, the fact there will be major challenges was exposed in the context of the change that is required, including legislative change and structural change, as well as in the context of funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> Reference has been made to whether the costings in this report were accurate. I wish to put on record that I believe the costings in the report are as accurate as they could be in the context of what we are undertaking over the next ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> There are certain issues we have to accept. The demographic is changing rapidly and fundamentally in front of our eyes. That is something that collectively, as a society, Parliament and Government, we have to take on board quickly. While this report highlights the challenges over the horizon, this is something we have to address collectively in the context of the cost of health care and in respect of the question of pension provision. Both areas will put extraordinary strain on resources. We have improving life expectancy. We have better health outcomes. We are living longer. The complexities that are provided in the context of treatment and services in health care are continually improving, but all this comes with additional costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> All these issues have to be taken into account when we try to implement the report. We need to ensure that, while we strive to go for universality, we do not go for universality of average outcomes. Universality must not mean diminishing returns. We need universality and excellence at the same time. I am concerned that if we do not commit the resources to this health care report and its recommendations, we will diminish the standards available to people in trying to roll out universality. There is need to provide the resourcing along with the structural changes and the legislative underpinning of same to ensure that does not arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> Let us consider the broad issues in terms of health care. The report highlights that we have an unusual system in the context of the interdependence and intertwining of public and private health care. The report makes a recommendation to the effect that there is need for us to unwind private health care from the public health system over a period of years. The report also acknowledges that this change will be complex and difficult. The Minister referred to contractual arrangements and loss of income to the public system. However, if we are to enhance capacity in the public system, then a good start would be to start to unwind from the public health system the demands that the private system is currently taking up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> Private patients, by and large, should be treated in private health care facilities, as one might expect. Public patients and people who wish to go publicly should have an entitlement to know that there will be a bed for them as well as provision of treatment in a timely and accessible fashion. Unfortunately, that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098"> Reference was made to the fact we are starting from a poor base in the context of the capacity we have in our public health system, not only in hospitals but throughout the primary and community care systems as well as capacity for supports in the home as well. There is no doubt this challenge, regardless of the other areas of this report and the associated recommendations, is going to put extraordinary strain and drain on our public finances to fund same.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> The Chair of the committee referred to how we spend a large sum of money in the provision of health care in this country. There is no point in pretending otherwise. We are going to have to commit additional resourcing in the coming years for several reasons. This is because we are coming from a low base in the context of our infrastructural capacity and bed capacity. Another reason is because of the changes in our demographic profile and the challenges that will come from same as well. These two things have to be addressed quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> The Minister referenced the bed capacity review. I look forward to that report. I have said previously that it should be independent, and I hope it will be. The last thing we need is to start basing assumptions and assessments on reports that are not fully independent or verifiable in that context. This is a critical part of the implementation plan. If we deny the challenges that exist, we will simply try continually to force more people into a system that simply cannot and will not be able to provide health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101"> Almost 50% of the population have private health care in some form or another at the moment. I have said as much numerous times in the House, and commentators outside the House have said it as well. There is no doubt that if this 50% did not have private health care, our public health system would simply implode. It would not be able to cater for the demand placed on it if there were no private health care facilities providing health care to people with private health insurance. The reason many people have private health insurance is not because they want a nice room on their own but because of the fear they will not be able to access timely diagnosis or intervention when they require it. Often, the motivation for taking out private health care is based on fear that the public health system simply cannot or would not be able to accommodate their medical needs in a timely fashion. That is undermining and sapping the confidence people have in the public health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> I urge for the report and the implementation plans to be taken on board and seriously assessed. We should have continual and incremental assessment of where we are in terms of the implementation of the report and the resources required in the short, medium and longer term to ensure the report is implemented in full over a ten-year timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103"> Reference has been made to consideration of the plan. Many commentators asked whether it can be delivered next week or next month. The report is clear on the timeframes. We have referred to decisions to be made in years one, two, three and four right out to the final horizon of the ten-year plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104"> I hope the broad political consensus arrived at in the committee will spread further afield into this Chamber and into various Governments that will take up office in the years ahead to ensure this report is implemented and to ensure the public will get a public health system of which we can all be proud.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1105">I served as a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare over the course of the past year. I thank the Chair of the committee and the secretariat for their work. I agree that the Trinity team are worthy of special mention. In particular, I thank all the groups and individuals who engaged with the committee either in writing or by attending meetings. There were many of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106"> There were 14 members of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. I did not sign the final report. Mine was the sole dissenting voice and, in the course of my remarks, I will explain why.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> However, I want to start by making some points about the positive proposals included in the report. There are three proposals I wish to single out and mention. The first is the proposal that there would be free general practitioner care for all by 2023. The idea is not that, five or six years down the road, this would simply appear. The idea is that it would be built towards 250,000 people gaining access to free general practitioner care year on year, starting with those without medical cards who are on the lowest incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">I would like to see a shorter timeframe but I am not going to make a huge point about that here. That is a very positive proposal which we will be supporting strongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109"> The proposal to legislate for maximum waiting times of 12 weeks for inpatient procedures, ten weeks for outpatient appointments and ten days for diagnostic tests is very progressive and many in society will be watching carefully to see that it is implemented. The proposal to remove private health care from public hospitals by the year 2024 is significant and important. While I would like to see it happen more quickly, the important issue for today is that it happens. We will be watching that one very carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110"> I share Deputy Shortall's concern at the comments attributed to the Minister, Deputy Harris, in the newspapers the other day about implementing those sections of the report that are consistent with Government policy. It strikes me that it is counter to the idea of establishing such a committee in the first place and has the potential to gut the report of many of its positive recommendations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1112">Members of his party signed up to the report and if the Government does not implement it, groups campaigning on the issues in society will take the matter up and apply pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113"> I support the idea of an Irish national health service, the cornerstones of which would be public ownership of the hospitals and primary care centres, free at the point of use and funded from a steeply progressive tax system. I believe that the committee has missed a golden opportunity to advocate for such a system. What is the difference between this and the proposals before us? I do not have time to go into them all but will highlight a few key points. On the question of charging, the World Health Organization is unequivocal that the complete removal of all charging is the best way to deliver universal health care based on need rather than ability to pay. In its world health report 2010, Health systems financing: The path to universal coverage, it states that one of the reasons direct payment is unsuitable to the delivery and consumption of health care is that it inhibits access. This is especially true for poorer people who must often choose between paying for health and paying for other necessities such as food or rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114"> It is true that the Sláintecare report advocates the abolition of some charges such as overnight hospital charges and general practitioner charges over a period of five to six years. However, it is not consistent and does not advocate for this across the board. It advocates maintaining the €100 charge for emergency departments for a full eight years and, crucially, recommends that drug payments currently set at €144 per month, so that the patient pays the first €144, be reduced to €100 but then maintained at that rate indefinitely. That is poor. Overall, the report allows for €437 million in charge reductions by the year 2028. In fact, that is actually less than 15% of the €3 billion spent by Irish people on out-of-pocket health expenses in the year 2014 alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115"> The report also advocates achieving public health care goals through a high reliance on for-profit market mechanisms. The proposed shift from acute hospital care to primary care in the communities is based around three pillars, namely, pharmacists - sole traders; general practitioners - also sole traders, although there is a proposal for salaried general practitioners which is not given sufficient emphasis, and new primary health care centres to be built by public-private partnerships on a for-profit basis. That is actually the most expensive way to build such centres. In 2001 there was a ratio of 80:20 between public and private nursing homes. Today that ratio has reversed completely to 20% public and 80% private, largely as a result of the tax incentives offered by right-wing governments. The result is that nursing home care in the State is controlled by those who prioritise the maximisation of profit over the care of the elderly, and rely on a workforce which is in significant measure comprised of low-paid women workers and immigrant labour. Government policy is for 9,000 new nursing home places in the years ahead, 7,000 of which are to be privately provided and 2,000 publicly. The report does not challenge this. It expresses an aspiration for a certain change but refuses to back it up with concrete proposals. Some 9,000 publicly funded nursing home places would cost €360 million. No provision is made for that in the funding proposals. The same applies in respect of home help services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116"> We talk of integrated care, yet the health system is divided up into silos. We have publicly owned HSE facilities, privately owned hospitals, section 38 facilities, many of which are church-owned voluntary hospitals, and section 39 charitable facilities, with about 2,000 entities which in other countries would be covered by the health service. None of the non-HSE pillars could survive for any length of time without taxpayer and public support. This includes the private hospitals, which have benefitted from massive tax breaks and from colocation with the public hospitals that do the more difficult and less profitable work. The vast bulk of these entities should be taken into public ownership with compensation paid on the basis of proven need, so that all forces can be brought to the point of attack to benefit public health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117"> That would involve, in part, the separation of church and State. The public is ready for that, as was shown by the controversy about the National Maternity Hospital. Those public hospitals should provide full IVF facilities, abortion facilities, and services for trans people such as gender reassignment and hormone therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118"> On the question of who pays, there is potential for enormous savings to households. In 2014, the average household in this State spent more than €5,000 in out-of-pocket expenses and private health insurance. There is potential for significant savings to the State by eliminating profiteering by the agencies that supply so many nurses to our hospitals and over-reliance on an insurance-based system with unnecessary administrative costs, competitive advertising and so on. Of course there would be a need for extra money and investment to implement a national health service of that kind. I can see no better way for the Apple €13 billion or €19 billion, whichever figure one chooses, could be spent.</p>

          <p eId="para_1122">I will be sharing time with my colleague, Teachta Nolan. I thank the Chair of the committee, Deputy Shortall, for driving the report. It cannot have been easy to achieve cross-party consensus on an issue as contentious as health. I would also like to acknowledge the work done by the secretariat - Ronan Murphy, Celeste O'Callaghan, Stephanie Bollard, Ronan McCabe, Denis McKenna, Claudia Zelli and Donal Smyth - and by the Trinity team for all the work and advice it gave us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">I am not sure they had an easy job but they made our job much easier with their assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124"> I am delighted this report has been published. I would have been even more delighted to hear a little more enthusiasm for it from the Minister. When he uses words such as "consider" and "reflect" in the context of the report that makes me think his approach may be to delay, postpone and have a think about its implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> It could be said that the health service has been researched to death. We know what and where the problems are. We know we have a problem with capacity and yet we keep being told we must have a capacity review. The Minister does not need a capacity review to tell us there is a problem with capacity. He need only take a trip down to any of the accident and departments and have a chat with any person on a chair or a trolley and they will tell him, in no uncertain terms, that there is a capacity issue. He can see it for himself. The only way we will be able to address the capacity issue is by reopening the beds that were closed and by addressing the staffing shortages. To address those, as I have said on more than one occasion and the Minister will be aware of this, we need to create a workplace where our valued health professionals and health workers actually want to work. We need to say to them that we will create a decent workplace for them and that we want them to work in the Irish health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126"> We in Sinn Féin want to see a national health service where health care is available on the basis of need and not ability to pay. This report represents a significant step in that direction. We in Sinn Féin are very pleased that we can see some, although not all, of our policies reflected in this report. It is a credit to members of the committee that we were able to put aside our political differences, in some instances, and consider good ideas, regardless of from where they came. Credit is due to the Chair of the committee in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127"> When I was a young woman my father and I had a conversation about politics. I note the Ceann Comhairle is smiling. My father told me that everything we do is political. He said the water we drink is political and, indeed, it is in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1129">The air we breathe is political. I had thrown my eyes up to heaven because my father was talking about politics again and he said "Louise, everything is political". We cannot depoliticise health. We can say we want to but we cannot. The Minister described the position very well, and I do not want to put words into his mouth, but he said something along the lines that "if you want to go there, I would not start from here". We are not starting from a great place. The political choices of previous Governments are what has led us to be in this place. However, that said, we have an opportunity now to come together, put our shoulders to the wheel, set aside those political differences and get behind this report 100% rather than implementing it in a piecemeal manner, which is my concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130"> I fully welcome the words of the Minister with regard to his support but I also noted a certain amount of equivocation, which is not what is needed. Rather we need a concerted effort to accept this report, and I say that coming from a party whose members believe this report could have gone an awful lot further. That said, we are prepared to do all within our power to ensure this report is implemented. There should not be a delay in its implementation or any waiting for the right time to do so. The health service is in a perpetual state of crisis. We read about it in the newspapers we hear about it in the media. Now is the time is be ambitious, to be bold, to take action and to get fully behind this report rather than try to implement it in a piecemeal manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_1131">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this important issue. Throughout the whole process of the development of this report, Sinn Féin has fought for an adequately resourced public health system that treats people on the basis of health need and not on their ability to pay. We fought to ensure that the future of the health care will be universal health care. I commend the hard work of my colleagues, Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Pat Buckley, who worked very hard on the committee to ensure that a number of progressive solutions were put forward in this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132"> In particular, I welcome the fact that this report recognises the need to establish a universal single-tier health service with treatment based on health need and not on ability to pay. I welcome the fact that it has been recognised that additional resources are required in order to reduce the waiting times and enhance community health facilities. I also welcome the fact that there is agreement to phase out private health care in public hospitals and introduce a carta sláinte, which would ensure access to all publicly funded health and social care services. These are just a few successes of this report. As my colleague said, Sinn Féin would like it to go much further.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133"> Our policy proposals outlined in our plan for universal health care include the recruitment of an additional 6,600 front-line staff, the roll-out of free prescriptions and investment in our ambulance service. We would support older people through increases in home help hours, respite and providing additional nursing home beds. We would implement universal health care and deal with the trolley crisis. I am convinced that a Sinn Féin-led Government is the only one that will truly deliver the type of a health system that the citizens of this State so badly need, want and deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134"> However, we recognise that this report provides a good starting point in addressing the crisis in our health service. It is a crisis that the people of my constituency know only too well. The latest figures show that the outpatient waiting list in Tullamore hospital stands at 13,000 with over 2,500 people waiting more than 15 months for treatment. The full capacity protocol and emergency measure was activated in the hospital last year 230 times, and that was the third highest in the State. Meanwhile key posts remain vacant and front-line staff struggle to cope with the sheer scale of the crisis with which they are faced I take this opportunity to commend those front-line staff. It is unfair that they are being put in the position of having to deal with the crisis in which we have been landed. Only 57% of children and adult community mental health services recommended for the region under A Vision for Change have been put in place. The health service in Offaly just like the rest of this State is in an absolute shambles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135"> This report is only worthwhile and only worth the paper it is written on if it is implemented. It simply cannot be allowed to sit on a shelf and gather dust. I hope, rather than believe, that both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are serious about implementing the necessary recommendations of this report.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Harty<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1136">I would also like to echo my appreciation and thanks to the chairman of our committee, Deputy Róisín Shortall, who did an excellent job in keeping us all together and encouraging us throughout the 11 months the committee sat to draw up this report. I also thank the secretarial staff and those who helped us from Trinity College. They were essential in getting this report completed almost on time. We took a little longer than anticipated but, as the Minister will appreciate, it was a mammoth task.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137"> We approached the report with pragmatic idealism. We understood this was a very complex and difficult task but we were idealistic in our outlook and we also realised the complexities of what needs to be done. We know the way things are but we want to see them how they should and could be. We have to see where this health service is at at the moment and why we need reform because the current system is not fit for purpose. It is fragmented, disjointed and incoherent. There are some areas of the health service that work very well and work to a high level of excellence but they also struggle like the other areas of the health service that are struggling for resources, capacity and staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138"> It is quite obvious that our system is under severe stress when we see the ever increasing waiting lists for outpatient appointments, elective inpatient care and urgent inpatient care and waiting times in our accident and emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">An emergency department opened in Limerick hospital three weeks ago. It still has the same number of trolleys in the new department as it had in the old one. There was never any expectation that that would change. We need to look beyond a piecemeal solution to our health service. I understand that we cannot believe everything we read in the newspaper, but I was concerned to read that the Minister was looking at the elements of the report which complied with Government policy. I hope that is not the case because this report must be looked at in its entirety. As Deputy Shortall said, it is not a report from which one can pick and choose areas that comply with Government policy because Government policy is not working. If we were to comply with Government policy, we would get nowhere. The central part of this reform programme is integration. The report must be looked at and studied in its entirety, because one cannot integrate fragmented, piecemeal structures. Integration is a large chapter in this report and it is central to it, because unless the report is looked at and implemented in its entirety, then the integration component means nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140"> It is a roadmap and a blueprint. We are not saying it is a perfect report and it will have flaws. If each member had written the report on his or her own, he or she would have written a slightly different report, but it is a consensus report. It must be looked at in its entirety. When the health system is reformed in its entirety, sequenced and phased properly, and properly integrated, we will have a health service that is more efficient, much more effective and cost-effective. I agree that pouring money into our broken health system is not a good idea. This is a ten-year blueprint for our health service. It needs to be studied seriously by the Government. I hope the Minister will accept it, not necessarily every word of it, but the direction in which it is going, which is a universal, single-tier public health service delivered on medical priority need, not on the ability to pay. It is a short sentence but requires a complex reform programme by which it would be delivered. It must be looked at in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141"> Delaying reform is not an option. We are at a crossroads and we demand that this health reform begins. I am delighted the Minister has continued in his office because the lack of continuity in the health Ministry would have been disastrous for this report. He now has the opportunity to adopt reform during his tenure. Reform should be the word he looks to each morning when he wakes up, and he should ask himself how he can reform our health service. This is critical. It would be of great import if the Minister came out with the statement, "I intend to reform this health service, and I intend to start now." If the Minister made that statement, it would improve the morale of the staff within the health service and it would make people looking for health care positive that something was going to change. It would be important if the Minister could make a statement like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142"> The Minister also needs to speak to front-line staff. I know he says he has visited almost every hospital in the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1144">He should visit them in an unsanitised way. He should talk to front-line staff. Quite often, if there is a problem in a hospital, when one talks to the junior staff or the lady who works in the canteen, they can say what is happening in the hospital and, of course, higher management will have its own view. If one talks to people who experience things every day, one will get a far greater feel for our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145"> The CEO of the HSE, Tony O'Brien, has commented on the report. It is important to read it into the record. He says it is a once in a generation opportunity to reform our health service. He says our service is no longer fit for purpose and has outdated structures and practices. This report requires unprecedented co-operation, collaboration and integration, and "unprecedented" is the word. There must be a huge cultural change in how we look at our health services. There should be a political and a societal consensus that this needs to happen. That is very important, and an important part of this report is that there must be political buy-in at the highest level, at the level of the Taoiseach and at the level of the Minister for Health. It must be driven forward by very strong political buy-in. In concluding, Mr. O'Brien said there has to be a constructive debate, and I know that the Minister is going to start a constructive review of the report, but there must be a constructive debate on how this programme is implemented. It is a reform programme for the entire health service. The Minister must look at it as a whole programme rather than picking bits and pieces. It is the entire health service. It must be looked at globally. It is a single-tier, public service, delivered on priority need, not on the ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146"> One of its tenets is a shift from hospital-centred service to community and primary care-centred service. That is critically important. We have had a huge change in our demography and, as the Minister will understand, the hospital system cannot possibly cope with the amount of chronic illness that is developing as people get older and with the multiple co-morbidities that people develop in older age. We need generalists, GPs and public health nurses, and people on the front-line in the community to look after those people properly. Of course, we need specialised hospital services, but those should be allowed to work for complex cases and urgent cases that require hospitalisation. Our hospital services are overwhelmed by care which could be delivered in the community much more effectively with much better outcomes for patients. Community services are what people want. We need to shift away from everything being concentrated into hospitals and recognise that hospital care is under severe pressure, with a bed capacity issue. Why do we have trolley queues and an ever-lengthening waiting list? It is obvious. I know a bed review is under way but we must increase our hospital capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147"> Another major reform in this programme is to disentangle private care from public hospitals. Ireland is unique in Europe that our public system is dependent on private medicine to fund itself. Some €650 million comes into our public system annually from delivering private care in our public hospitals. That is a fundamental change which we must untangle. The delivery of private care in our public hospitals is an obstruction to reform. It provides perverse incentives for hospitals to maximise money from insurance companies and a perverse incentive to consultants to treat private patients and, in some cases, to prioritise them above public patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148"> We need to reform our GP services. I have spoken to the Minister on this on many occasions. We need a new GP contract. General practice has been gutted by the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI. There was a 38% reduction in the money to run practices. That is not GP income. GPs are ageing. The average age of GPs in Europe is 57 years. In Ireland, 33% of GPs are over the age of 55 years. Unless these issues are addressed, one cannot transfer care from the hospital service to community service. We need a new GP contract. I have often told the Minister that the process of negotiating the GP contract is fundamentally flawed. He has entered into a series of negotiations with just one organisation. There are two organisations and it is fundamentally flawed if he continues in this way. If we are to transfer services from hospital to community, we need GPs, and unless there is an acceptable contract that cannot happen.</p>

          <from>Deputy John McGuinness<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1149">I congratulate the Minister on his reappointment. I also congratulate Deputy Shortall, who is passionate about the whole area of health, the committee and all those who contributed to its work, including those outside the House who made their professional services available. That this report has ended up being debated in the House is a first step in recognising that politics needs to be taken out of health. We need to have one single focus and support whoever is the Minister for Health in achieving the type of reform that is necessary. As such, a lot rests on the Minister's shoulders because he is the one receiving this report and he is the one who will have to action it. While others have said that the Minister should make a statement on his intent regarding the report, and that is true, the Minister will be judged by his actions. The sooner he can act and take a step in the direction of keeping this cross-political approach to the delivery of a better health system, so much the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">Political agreement is hard to reach in this place. Going back to 1997 and the period when Mary Harney was the Minister for Health, it was clear then that if political agreement had been reached, and if some kind of political peace were established in the area of health, we might have made far greater progress with the money then being allocated to health. It is never too late to start, and we have something now. However, as good as the report is, many other reports - hundreds of them, I am sure - have been put in place by various Ministers for Health that have never been acted upon and never will be. I hope this report does not end up on the same shelf as all of those reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151"> What should the Minister do to act on this report? The HSE is dysfunctional. It does not have the capacity or ability to fulfil any part of this report. The Department of Health washed its hands of health a long time ago and it creates that distance between the HSE and the Department of Health. The Minister is the one who must drive the reform and, therefore, is the one who must find the method to be put in place to manage this change. I remember previous health reform packages that were talked about publicly, and it was Eddie Molloy who said change managers within the HSE are required to drive change on the policy and direction to which the Minister refers. This is where previous policy failed badly. Therefore, there is a need for a cohort within the Department of Health or the HSE that will drive this necessary change, pick the quick wins we can have out of this report, implement them and show, by leadership, not only that we have a report covering the next ten years, but also that the Minister will have the managers of change in place to insist that all the pieces that are agreed upon and can be funded immediately happen. All of us in this House must agree on it, health professionals must agree on it and the trade union movement must contribute to changing the culture of resistance and bringing about the necessary change in co-operating with this House and the general health management to ensure we get the best deal for the patients we are all talking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152"> I would start with that change management, and then I would take the simple things. I would look at the parliamentary questions put to the Minister for Health every day and at the number of them that deal with single patients and the desire to get services for them and to bring about better outcomes. There are hundreds of such questions every single day, but what do we get? The Minister answers the questions by stating, "If you do not hear from the HSE within 15 days, give us a shout." One does not hear from the HSE within 15 days and one may as well be shouting in the middle of Croke Park because nothing happens. As a result, people have lost faith in their politicians, in the ability to change the system and the ability to get the services when and where they are needed. The Minister must stop this. I would like to see him take full charge of the parliamentary questions system in this House. As real accountability is introduced, we will get outcomes to our parliamentary questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153"> The Minister should tell the HSE to start by telling the truth at Committee of Public Accounts meetings and health hearings in this House. He should tell the HSE to acknowledge the wrongs early and stop the prolonged established legal practice within the HSE of fighting every single case, only to end up making an apology and giving out a heap of taxpayers' money. Billions of euro are being paid out on mistakes made within the HSE. I accept that mistakes will be made, but do we learn from those mistakes? Judging by the amount I see paid out from year to year, we do not. It is a colossal amount. How many people could be taken off trolleys if only that culture within the HSE were sorted? The HSE seems to think it is grand to do it because the taxpayer is paying for it. I ask the Minister to answer the parliamentary questions, deal honestly with committees and insist on taking responsibility for the HSE and change management.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154"> Primary care is essential to all of this. It is the cornerstone on which our better health services will be built. Every single statement from Minister states that services will be conducted in the primary health care sector, but there is no money attached to that sector. General practitioners, GPs, are leaving this country in droves. One practice got in touch with me to tell me that a GP of 30 years said the health system is going down the tubes and GPs are having to face more work in an ever-depleting workforce. We are educating our GPs to export them. That is essentially what is happening. GPs are pressed to their limits to try to deliver the services they provide, not to mention the services we, as politicians, want to see the primary health care sector provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155"> Psychiatric services are at crisis point. They do not have the professionals to deal with the issues with which they are being confronted. Only recently, the Union of Students in Ireland made a presentation to us on health services and access for their students who are under pressure. If one family wishes to access health services privately over a three-month period, cover with VHI costs €90,000. No one could afford it. As a result, the cost of cover by VHI and other private health care providers is going through the roof. There is no control and there is no transparency to it. There is a duplication of waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156"> Best practice in orthodontics and dentistry, for example, was highlighted. The two most prominent consultants in the country recommended change to all of this, but what happened? They were deemed to be the people out of step. They were the ones who were sanctioned in the Department and they are the ones who suffer to this day for wanting to provide a better service. They had a proven model that worked perfectly but it did not suit the HSE or the Department of Health and they ended up in poor health themselves. We have all been asked about Lyme disease and many other diseases, but nothing happens. Protests are held outside the gates, but nothing happens. Therefore, it falls to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157"> I wish to mention the case of the sarcoma specialist, which is just incredible. There were two applicants for the job. Seventeen people were on the interview board for two applicants, and the foremost person in the world who was <i>in situ</i> did not get the job. It is incredible. That is our health service. They do it their way just because they want to. The same goes for scoliosis. How many times has the Minister been asked about scoliosis? How many times has he been asked to change treatment for scoliosis? How many young people are suffering because of it? Between now and the change in this ten-year plan, the Minister needs to do something. He needs to make sure that those who are being paid huge money within the HSE to manage actually do so. People will say that if one gets into care, it is the best care one can get, yet there is an imbalance in who is employed by the HSE. There has been an imbalance in terms of the number of managers for years. The Minister must seek their co-operation to change that. In the context of this change, I ask that he implement some kind of management between now and the time he takes his first step in the process of this ten-year plan. I commend everyone associated with the report.</p>

          <from>Deputy Hildegarde Naughton<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1158">I wish to share time with Deputy Bernard Durkan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159"> I welcome this debate and the opportunity to discuss the report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, of which I was a member. I thank my fellow colleagues who sat on the committee as well as the committee secretariat, the Trinity team and, in particular, the Chairman, Deputy Róisín Shortall, who worked so diligently on the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160"> There is nothing startling in this document. At its core, it emphasises a move away from the traditional hospital setting to a more community-based approach to the delivery of our health services. Inpatient hospitalisation is required for some medical conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">However, community health care is appropriate for numerous conditions and it offers many benefits. Patients who do not need intensive medical care can receive care in their own homes from registered nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers and allied professionals. Nurses perform tasks such as changing dressings, monitoring and administering medications, drawing blood samples for laboratory tests and educating patients and family members. Home health aides perform tasks such as assisting patients with personal hygiene, preparing meals and helping patients eat, checking vital signs and performing light housekeeping tasks, allowing patients to remain in their own homes with their families while receiving the help that they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162"> If nothing else in this report was implemented, a properly resourced and efficient primary care structure throughout this country could transform our system for the better. It would mean elderly residents in nursing homes would not longer have to be admitted through accident and emergency departments to get intravenous antibiotics. It would mean elderly and ill people in our community having the most basic of treatments in, or close to, their homes. It would mean general practitioners having access to diagnostics and a range of services currently only provided in a hospital setting. If I could distil our report down into one sentence it would be: there are a large number of patients admitted to our acute hospitals who do not need to be there. Their needs can, and should be, met in the community. I thank the Minister, Deputy Harris, for his positive comments and his clear understanding of the report and the health care needs of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163"> The implementation of the report will require an injection of funds both in capital costs and ongoing expenditure into the future. The report requires significant expenditure annually and I look forward to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's costing of the proposals.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1164">I thank Deputy Naughton for sharing time. This is an important report and I was happy to be a member of the committee. A tedious process had to be gone through but everybody agreed there was a serious need to overhaul the delivery, manner and methodology of our health services. Many experts gave opinions during the committee's hearings and I acknowledge their work and the work of the chairman, Deputy Shortall. She stayed with it and it would have been easy to give up and walk away. The views of the witnesses were hugely important because, in many cases, they presented the views of the people who had direct access to the requirement for the health services in one way or another. It is always important to take account of their views.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165"> I agree with the report in general, while acknowledging it will be expensive to implement. However, it is important that the building blocks put in place to address this issue complement one other. We cannot afford to have an intervention that goes in a particular direction only to find that it does not work two or three years down the road meaning we have to go in another direction. That is how the health service has operated for several years. There are many deficiencies and I am a great believer in the notion that these can be identified mathematically in every area and remedied rather than using a broad-brush approach to secure as much funding as possible and throwing it at the system. That does not work. The report has highlighted the need to identify those deficiencies and to address them in a methodical and complementary way. The Minister may well have said initially that the report will be expensive to implement and we will not be able to do it all in one day. It will take a number of years but the critical issue is that whatever happens should remain in place for the duration and additional funding and operational changes should complement those interventions in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166"> It is about time we stopped kidding ourselves about where the deficiencies are and so on. They need to be identified. For example, we need to work out simply why there are waiting lists. This question was posed many times during the hearings. Various reasons were put forward, including nursing and consultant shortages and accommodation and capacity issues, as well as the ageing population, allegedly. At the same time, I note we have a relatively young population in comparison with other European countries. We have a much better youth profile than most of them. I do not buy into the notion that our ageing population is a serious issue coming down the tracks. While we have to address it, we do not have to do so to the extent that has been posited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167"> The committee discussed the dual system at length because it has dual costs and expenses. Ultimately, the public and private systems weaken each other and we would be better off with one or the other. The report recognises the purpose of the exercise is to provide a public health service that is accessible, dependable, modern, effective and efficient. If we do that, we will have done a great job. In addition, it must be recognised the current costs and the capital costs must go together. They are expensive and will require embellishment as time goes by. Deputy Kelleher mentioned the costs are as good as can be expected at this stage. No matter what one does, there will always be factors - events, as a famous man once said - which will affect the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> The public will buy into something they believe is worth buying into. They will support something they believe will happen and to which they contribute through direct and indirect taxation. They will support it in the clear knowledge that by doing so, they will support their own interests. The private health system must be acknowledged and it does some good work. However, that cannot be done at the expense of the public system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169"> We must come to a juncture. It is somewhat like the housing issue in that we can spend as long as we like playing around with it on a day-by-day and year-by-year basis in a minuscule way but at the end of the day, we will all be dead before it will be addressed. It is important to identify the starting point and the initial shock that has to be experienced to clear the waiting lists and get the system moving. That is possible and that is provided for in the report, which is good. When we get to that stage, this report will have done a major service to the people of the country and the health services, in particular. By supporting the report and making it work, all political interests will have done a major service to society, to themselves and to the future development of the health services. We discussed the cost of medicines, hospital costs and so on but when people realise we are serious about we are doing, they will also make a contribution in every way through the different portfolios, which will be meaningful, effective and beneficial to all.</p>

          <p eId="para_1170">I wish to share time with Deputy Crowe. I welcome the opportunity to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the committee members and to thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, the Trinity College team, the committee secretariat and all the witnesses, stakeholders and groups who gave evidence to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">Of course, we must not forget the key driver in all of this, Deputy Róisín Shortall. It has been an amazing experience for a newly elected Deputy to be on such an intense committee. The Committee on the Future of Healthcare was unique. It was the first time we saw those of all political parties and of none coming together to set out a strategic plan and a vision so we can possibly have one of the best health services, and one which is not based on how much money anyone has in their pocket.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172"> Several speakers mentioned accountability and responsibility. Deputy Shortall may have needed medical care at one stage as she was probably black and blue from listening to me mentioning accountability and responsibility, given it came up so many times. It is one of the things that has to be addressed within the whole system. It has always been one of my gripes and I want to put on record that it still is. Every time I hear an unnamed spokesperson for the HSE say that it cannot find someone who is responsible for something, it makes me certain that this area needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173"> With Sláintecare, we will have a single-tier health service which will be based on a person's need, not on the ability to pay. This is something Sinn Féin has been calling for for a very long time. Like every plan, not everything in it is perfect but there are massive benefits. One of the important points is the removal of inpatient charges in public hospitals in the first year. Anything that improves out-of-pocket expenses for people is positive because these expenses are a fear. In the same way, it is due to fear that private health insurance is taken out by the majority of people who use it. I spoke to a gentleman in Midleton last week who, when we were discussing the overall health system, said he would pay €100 more a week if he was guaranteed a proper health service. That is a testament to the people out there. I admired the man for that - I wish I could afford €100 a week, but that is a different story. The dental treatment scheme, which provided a vital service but which was abolished a number of years ago, will be reinstated in the first year of the report. There are knock-on effects from that, for example, with regard to heart defects and so on. These are minor changes that make a huge difference to the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174"> I could speak about many other reductions in charges. One Deputy said things could have been done better in regard to the reduction in prescription charges for medical card holders, but again it is a step in the right direction to reduce it from €2.50 to €1 by the third year. If we could get it all for free, we certainly would, but some things are not possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175"> Another issue we touched on is the proposed expansion of primary care and the shift to community-based treatment, which is the bread and butter of the whole plan. I could talk about this for months but I am conscious I am sharing time with Deputy Crowe. Nonetheless, I want to touch on an issue which is very close to my heart. Strong proposals have been made in regard to mental health. Some €120 million would be required to finally deliver the promises in A Vision for Change and that would be accounted for over five years, and we can see the benefit of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176"> This health care plan is nothing only benefit after benefit. I want to finish with a quote from Nye Bevan that is close to my heart. He said, "No society can legitimately call itself civilised if a sick person is denied medical aid because of lack of means". I want everybody to take that on board. This is what it is all about. This is for our children and grandchildren. Each and every one of us, across the political sphere, can be extremely proud of this achievement.</p>

          <p eId="para_1177">Like others, I commend the members of the committee. It is unprecedented what they have done here, with broad political support. Some speakers said we need to take politics out of it. I have a different view in that I think politics is what is going to drive it. I listened to my colleague talk about her father telling her that everything in life is about politics, and that is the direction he gave. Deputy McGuinness spoke about the former Minister, Mary Harney's time and suggested that if things had been done differently then, and different decisions had been made, the situation might be different now. I would argue that it was when Mary Harney was in charge that the privatisation route was taken and many of these policies were put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178"> Some Members spoke about the starting point. If there is a delay in regard to the Sláintecare report and the proposals within it that will kill the report. I listened to Deputy Durkan pointing to interventions that will not work and suggesting we have to take this very slowly. As with all these things, the first question that strikes me is what are interventions that will not work in regard to this report. That is the big question. If people want to delay it, what are the concerns they have with it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1179"> Every day on my way here I pass by the hospice in Harold's Cross. I have known a number of people who have died in the hospice. There is something special about it - the care that is delivered by the staff, the empathy, the understanding, and so on. Only for good fortune, I could have ended up there myself. I have been in the hospital system and I am still in the hospital system, so I have seen where it has worked and where it has not worked. As a public representative, I am conscious of the many successful cases that go through the system, and we need to talk that up, given there is huge delivery for people every day. However, I am also conscious that we get those cases where the system has failed people. My colleague talked about mental health and it is on that area I want to concentrate in the speaking time I have left.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180"> I was at a board meeting of a project in my area last week. Six people connected with that project had committed suicide. A woman on the board said that for one of the groups she was involved in, she was aware of nine individuals associated with the project who had committed suicide. That is in the Tallaght area. I am conscious that families are probably listening to this debate who are still hurting. The norm is that men take their own lives but, in these cases, it was mostly women. There is a huge problem there. It is about delivering care. In some cases, people go to accident and emergency or to their doctors, but the system is broken. Collectively, we all accept there is a crisis out there and that we need to do things differently. This is one area we need to concentrate on, and I know different approaches have been suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181"> We need 24-7 care. Although the Government is talking in terms of seven-day care, it is not between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. that these things happen; it is normally at weekends and so on. Many of us have got that call. I have been in that situation where I got a call from a family to say, "My father is coming around to the house. Has he arrived?", but the father had committed suicide. I am touched by that. I want to do things differently. I want to work with people. That is what we are trying to do in this plan but we need to start doing things differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> I would like to talk for longer about what is going on in my constituency. I was at a primary care launch where people were talking about the difficulty of going to the local hospital. We were talking in a hall in an area where 6,000 people lived with no doctor based in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">Again, this goes back to what we are doing right and what we are doing wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184"> I wanted to talk about disability, as the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is here, and I wanted to talk about senior citizens, but I do not have time to do so. There will be time in future. I commend the committee on all the work it has done. We can fix the system. The message we need to send out to people is that while the system may fail some individuals, it is working well for the vast majority of people. However, we can do a lot better.</p>

          <p eId="para_1185">I compliment all the members of the committee. I was not on the committee, but it is an honour to have an opportunity to speak this evening. Deputy Shortall did a phenomenal job in pulling all of these different personalities together for the past 11 months, starting with four hours twice a week and moving up to 12 hours a week. I thank my colleagues, Deputies Kelleher, Brown and Brassil because it was a huge commitment. Members from all parties and none made this commitment for the past 11 months in the best interests of all the people whom we in these Houses represent and I thank them all very much.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186"> I will continue in the same vein as Deputy Crowe. As Deputy McGuinness said earlier, there is a great opportunity here and the report provides the foundations and building blocks for the future. Everybody has contributed to it and everybody has hit on every aspect that comes through their own doors, be it personal or from constituents. There are certain wins for the Government in the report. We spoke about dental care and I looked at the costing. In the first year it would cost €17 million. However, it is off the pitch and we have moved on. The Government would show that it is really committed by hearing what is being said. Actions speak louder than words and this is what we are looking for. Regardless of whether we leave politics out of it, actions speak at the end of the day and this is how we know the Government is taking it very seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187"> The report is aspirational because what it recommends would be very expensive. When Deputy Shortall spoke, I thought she was costing us €1 billion a minute but, to be quite honest, it is a pathway to the future and the recovery of the health boards. I had an experience during the week, which I will share with the House later. We need to bring accountability and traceability into it. We need to remove certain layers of bureaucracy from the health service and bring it back to change managers, who have to be business managers. They have to be able to walk in and state what resources are there, what actions are being taken and what is being delivered, because it is the only way this will be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188"> During the week, I was fortunate enough to get my hands on an intensive home care package. Such packages are like hen's teeth. It is the first time there has been one in Portumna, Woodford, Killimor, Mullagh or Eyrecourt, all of which comprise a large area in east Galway. The intensive home care package is for a person with dementia, and it means that person will leave hospital care with exactly what it says on the tin. The doctors had stated that on his release the gentleman would need 28 hours home care. Previous to this, he had been receiving ten hours. He was told the 28 hours could not be obtained because of the waiting list for intensive home care packages. I compliment Senator Colette Kelleher and Deputy Butler on their assistance. They helped me put the case together and they worked with the family. The person has obtained the 28 hours, and will receive speech and language therapy and nursing care hours. For his family members it means their father, who is in his early 60s, has been returned to his home. This is the wraparound service we speak about. I am sharing a success story because sometimes we speak about all the negativity in the health service. This is a situation which has worked very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189"> This home care package is one of the 500 such packages but, to date, fewer than 300 have been allocated. Last year, we did not spend enough on them because only 110 of the number allocated were drawn down. We need to use what is allocated. Last year, 500 packages were allocated and 500 should have been used. There is a commitment to 500 this year and they need to be used. Dementia is a growing problem in the State. In 20 years' time, we will have 110,000 people with dementia. If we do not start building on home care packages year on year, which is recommended in the report, we will not address the problem. This is just one aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190"> I come from a rural community in east Galway and the most important things for me, as is the case for all communities, are primary care and GPs. GPs deliver 25 million hours a year in services and consultations. They are a breed that will die unless we do something to support them. We are exporting our GPs abroad. The GP contract is a fundamental part of what needs to be addressed in the report. We need to encourage more GPs into the service. Gone are the days when a GP would work 24 hours a day seven days a week, morning, noon and night. That service is not there any longer. GPs want a work-life balance and well-being for themselves and their families. They want the GP contract reviewed. When the GP contract is being reviewed we need to look at putting in place primary care centres in tandem. If we do not have primary care centres dotted throughout the entire country, our acute hospitals will be in crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191"> We need to start with where a problem originates. The report would deliver all of that to which I refer because it looks at every aspect, including where it starts, which is in the community. It starts with a person's first visit to the GP. We could halt it straight away by building up and providing the required wraparound service to communities. We can put in place wellness centres and diagnostics in our GP practices. We can then bring the role of pharmacies into communities. This is what we need to look at and this is the value of the report. It is a fantastic pathway and mapping system but, with no disrespect to anybody, it does not contain anything of which we were not previously aware. We have articulated - in a huge document - the requirements of what is needed but we have also shown examples of where we can have quick wins. We can also see what is needed when we look at communities and the geography of areas. In my community and, I am sure, in many others, it is GPs and primary care services that are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> Earlier, we spoke about mental health and CAMHS. At present, 5,200 children in Ireland are waiting for access to social care workers. That is unforgivable. Of those 5,200 children, 1,520 are level 3 and level 4. Level 3 and level 4 children are classed as being at risk. A child at level 4 will be monitored because he or she will have suicidal tendencies. This is where early intervention is needed and we need to recruit the requisite staff at a rate of knots. If we cannot recruit through the public sector, we need to look at what other services are out there. We need to look at organisations such as Sugru, a not-for-profit group which provides these services. It can provide counselling and a wraparound service to a family and a child. This is what we need to look at. It is not just about the individual as we also need to look at what support we can give to families. With regard to the 1,520 children at level 3 and level 4, we must consider advocacy groups such as EPIC and YAP, which have social workers. These are advocate groups that have social workers who can provide the service. The committee's report tells us what we need but it also tells us that we can look outside the box and start linking matters. Until such time as we start to join the dots, the system will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> I conclude by saying well done and thanking the committee for the opportunity. The report will be a talking point for years to come. However, I do not wish to see it remain on a shelf as happened with A Vision for Change. A Vision for Change would have been a fantastic document if it had been implemented. Regrettably, it never reached implementation stage. We picked parts from it. The Government must set a monitoring gauge as to what it will do on this report on an annual basis. It should clearly state to everybody, "We have taken this from the report and over the ten years your vision should be delivered".</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2017-06-22T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1194">I thank the secretariat, the Trinity College team, the chairman, Deputy Shortall, and all my colleagues on the committee. There was an arduous 11 months of work on this report. I voted for the report in the committee despite the fact I believe it does not go far enough. Other Deputies think it goes too far. I will continue to support it and I will fight for its implementation in full. Like other Deputies, I do not wish to see the report left to gather dust because the political will to implement it does not exist. I do not wish to see it cherry-picked and turned into another set of so-called reforms of our health services. In fact, it would add to the existing mess of an unfit-for-purpose system if it were cherry-picked. This report comprises a set of moving cogs and if one part is put in place the other part must be set alongside it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> Our health service is a broken system. Other Deputies have mentioned various areas but I have had to represent people who are dealing with the urology department in St. James's Hospital. An 84 year old woman told me that she had been referred by her GP to the urology department and she received a letter saying that she would have her appointment in four years' time. She asked me if the department was waiting for her to die rather than serve her illness. I followed it up with a parliamentary question and discovered that there is only one consultant in the urology department. The other one left a year and a half ago. There are approximately 1,300 people waiting for outpatient appointments in that department in St. James's Hospital. That is an outrage. It shows the stark reality of what is happening in many hospitals throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196"> I support this report for one simple reason. Its main recommendation of a single-tier universal health service paid for by general taxation would, if implemented, represent a huge step forward in health care and in the provision of public services generally not only for patients but also for staff, doctors, nurses, GPs and community services. It is long past time that we dismantled the expensive and unfit-for-purpose jumble of private and public bodies, State bodies, charities, religious bodies and non-governmental organisations that we have inherited since the Victorians and established health care as a citizen's right, not an act of charity. This report is moving towards that. It is progressive in that way. I welcome the objective in the report to separate the public and private systems. This is a fundamental step towards a single-tier universal service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> A crucial part of the report is the implementation office and bringing in a person to drive the report's recommendations. If that does not happen, there will be a problem. The report requests that this be examined in July. It will be a first step to see the Minister for Health doing that. It will send a message to the health service that he is serious about the report. Then it will be necessary to go to the hospitals to explain what it is about and what we are trying to do, and to go to schools to explain to young people why we want them to go into training and to college so they can work in our hospitals and in our general practitioner and primary services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> However, a major failing of the report, and it was a bugbear for myself and other Deputies, is the issue of sections 38 and 39 bodies. Section 38 bodies are 100% funded by the State, so they should be in full public ownership and management. It is unacceptable that the new maternity hospital, to be built by the State at a cost of €300 million, whose 4,000 staff are paid for by taxpayers and which will be 100% funded by the State when it is up and running, would be under the ownership and management of a religious charity trust. This question has been raised in the Dáil by Deputy Shortall and others over the last week or so. The Minister must address it. It should be under the auspices of the public service and the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199"> St. John of God is another section 38 institution. It provides services for disabled people and people with autism. We saw the horrendous situation where the chief executive officers in that institution were receiving money under the table and having their pensions propped up while services in the institution were affected by austerity. I have a copy of a letter from the mother of a child in St. John of God which she sent to the board of St. John of God when she heard and saw what had happened there. She says:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1200">It is with great sadness and anger that we wish to inform you of our decision to withdraw our monthly donation to St John of God.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1201">Our youngest son, Joseph, has been a pupil in Islandbridge for the past 3 years. Due to budget constraints, Joseph has never been seen by a therapist (speech or OT) since he joined the school. Joseph is 16 and his fine motor skills are such that he cannot hold a pen and write. He cannot read either. The teachers are doing everything they can to help Joseph develop and learn but the school lacks funds and access to therapists is operated on a priority basis. Joseph is not considered a priority and we would agree with this judgment. However, while we agree that Joseph may not need urgent access to therapists, we believe he needs help and could achieve much more if granted access to regular therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">The letter concludes:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1203">We all make good and bad decisions. Most of us hope that the bad ones have limited implications for others. Most of us hope that the bad decisions will not break the trust, love and support we receive from those around us. Others have no such concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">The families whose children are attending St. John of God have been absolutely devastated by what has happened while the services they need so badly are not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205"> Nursing homes and home helps are big issues as well, but we could not deal with everything in the report. These areas should be examined. We have been told that reviews in these areas are taking place. I hope we will be able to feed into that over the next period of time.</p>
