            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)  (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_2">I would like to clarify the statistics for burglaries and aggravated burglary.  The most up-to-date figures from the Central Statistics Office, which has the statutory responsibility for the production of crime statistics, are for 2011.  The published figures indicate that recorded burglary and related offences increased by 7.9% last year.  However, the figure for aggravated burglary, which is a subset of the overall burglary figure, shows no increase during that 12-month period.  It is important to acknowledge that the latest crime statistics show a decrease in most types of crime during 2011, including homicide, assault, criminal damage and drug and public order offences.  Taken together, this overall decrease represents a substantial achievement for law enforcement and crime prevention in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3">I share the Deputy's concern at the incidence of burglaries and other property crimes.  Nevertheless, I am encouraged by the fact that An Garda Síochána is responding effectively.  The Deputy will be aware, in particular, of the recent announcement by the Garda Commissioner of a range of measures aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries.  These measures are encompassed in Operation Fiacla, which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the courts.  Specific burglary-related initiatives are being implemented in each Garda region in support of Operation Fiacla.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">In respect of the situation in commuter counties, the available statistics indicate that the incidence of burglary is greatest in the Dublin metropolitan region and that commuter counties in the east and midlands generally have a higher incidence than other counties.  This type of information is available to gardaí on a real-time basis and feeds into Operation Fiacla and other targeted policing operations, including the identification of crime trends, hot spots and the design of appropriate responses and deployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">In addition to the concerted law enforcement efforts being pursued by An Garda Síochána, crime prevention is a key component in tackling burglary.  In this regard, the Garda national crime prevention unit and crime prevention officers at divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary and property crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">I am conscious of the deep distress which burglary can cause to householders, and the broader impact it can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities, and, therefore, I welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner is deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted and strategic approach to confronting those who are engaging in this form of criminality.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_8">I refer to Operation Fiacla, which the Minister says concentrates on mobile gangs.  Are resources or particular attention being directed towards local criminals?  I am particularly concerned at the increase in the commuter belt.  In Meath, there were 112 burglaries in 2011, an increase of 40% on 2010, while in Kildare there were 1,687, an increase of 26%.  Burglaries increased in 20 of the 28 Garda divisions in 2011.  Mobile gangs are playing a part and perhaps the Minister can give me an idea of the kind of resources being invested in Operation Fiacla.  Are specific initiatives been taken to deal with locally-based criminals responsible for a significant part of these figures?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_3" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality__Deputy_Alan_Shatter">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_9">I assure the Deputy that adequate resources are available to the Garda Síochána.  What is happening is a targeted operation identifying criminal gangs engaged in burglary, who are using our very good road network to gain access to other parts of the country from Dublin.  Deputy Calleary is correct in making reference to the increases in Meath and Kildare, the commuter areas to which I was referring.  The Garda Síochána has identified certain individuals engaged in this activity.  A recent operation resulted in a substantial number of arrests.  I am sure Deputy Calleary understands if I do not go into further detail about the operation or make references to the individuals arrested but, arising from the operation, I expect prosecutions.  At the end of the year, the targeted approach adopted by the Garda Síochána in Operation Fiacla will prove to be effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">The Garda Commissioner is very aware of this problem but it is for him to make operational decisions as to where resources should be directed.  I am aware that he believes this targeted operation aimed at identifiable individuals can be very successful and I have the greatest confidence that it will be.  However, this does not mean the Garda Síochána is not keeping a watchful eye on local individuals engaged in criminality in the counties referred to by the Deputy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_11">On the issue of aggravated burglaries I join with the Minister in paying tribute to the Garda Síochána for the general decrease in levels of most crimes last year as shown in the statistics.  However, the number of aggravated burglaries is exactly the same in 2011 as it was in 2010, at 333 instances, approximately six a week.  We all agree this is too many and people are suffering.  Will Operation Fiacla include any focus on aggravated burglaries?  Is it proposed to provide any extra resources in an effort to reduce this figure, in line with many of the other crime statistics?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_5" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality__Deputy_Alan_Shatter">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_12">The Deputy is correct in saying that aggravated burglaries in 2011 amounted to 333, the same figure as in 2010.  The number was higher in 2009 at 368.  The crime of burglary, whether ordinary or aggravated, forms part of the focus of this operation.  Like Deputy Calleary, I am aware that for any individual whose home is burglarised it is an extremely traumatic event.  One burglary is one burglary too many.  There is no ideal number.  The current Garda operation is directed at focusing on individuals known to be engaged in gangs and who concentrate on different parts of the country.  On occasions a series of burglaries are committed within a particular area by one group of individuals.  I hope that by the end of this year - I am conscious I am making myself a hostage to fortune in this regard - the success of this operation in 2012 will result in 2013 in a reduction in the number of burglaries.  I join with the Deputy in congratulating the Garda Síochána on its outstanding success in 2011 in reducing crime across a broad range of areas.</p>

          <heading>Prisoner Releases</heading>
          <question by="#JonathanOBrien" to="#Minister_for_Justice" eId="pq_2">
            <p eId="para_13">71<b>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</b> asked the <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b> if he plans to expand the functions of and adequately resource the Probation Service in view of proposed early release schemes in the Irish Prison Service strategic plan. [22993/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality__Deputy_Alan_Shatter">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_14">The Irish Prison Service strategic plan contains a number of key objectives for the next three years, one of which includes the expansion of a pilot community return project which commenced last October in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall project review group.  This community return programme is an incentivised scheme run in conjunction with the probation service which provides for earned temporary release under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service.  I can assure the Deputy that the probation service has sufficient resources available it to support the scheme at present.  It has been able to manage and resource the scheme since its commencement last October and I am fully committed to ensuring this will continue.  As it is, the probation service has responsibility for the supervision and management of community service orders in accordance with the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2011.  This work, <i>inter alia</i>, involves providing assessment reports to the courts and managing the completion of the orders by offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">A value for money audit of the community service scheme which was carried out in 2007 to 2008 and published in October 2009, found that there was capacity from within existing resources to provide supervision services to three times as many offenders as were under their supervision at the time of the audit.  I might also add that the service has been working to prioritise its workload and has been allocating resources to maximise its efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services including community sanctions, as an effective alternative to custody.  This also includes working with high risk sex offenders and young people and those for whom the service has a legislative mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">I am pleased to say that sanction was recently obtained to fill the vacant director post in the probation service which will be advertised in the coming weeks.  The service will continue to have my full support in making greater use of community service to the benefit of prisoners and communities as an alternative to imprisonment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
            <p eId="para_17">I thank the Minister for his reply and welcome the scheme which, as he said, comes on foot of the pilot project.  I think only four individuals ended up returning to prison under the pilot project, yet some of the commentary surrounding the recent announcement was unfortunate.  I do not know if it was something that fell through the cracks but some hysteria was created around it, which was completely unwarranted.  The clarification provided during the Topical Issues debate allayed many of the fears people had.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">When I asked the Minister last year about the probation services, he said he had secured sanction from the Department of Finance to hire eight additional probation officers.  Are those additional staff now in place and, if not, when does the Minister expect them to be in place?</p>
            <p eId="para_19">The Minister said he is satisfied the probation service has the resources and staffing to deal with the scheme, but will he continue to review it?  If so, how often will those reviews take place?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality__Deputy_Alan_Shatter">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_20">I can personally assure the Deputy that we will keep the staffing position under continual review.  I do not have an immediate answer as to whether the ten posts have been filled.  I will be happy to communicate with the Deputy in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">I thank the Deputy for his comments on the business strategy we have put in place.  It will be very important as we go forward over the next three years.  This particular proposal was one half of the strategy.  The House has previously discussed the pilot programme that was taking place and while we will have a full report following the review, the programme has proved to be successful.  We have now exceeded 85 on the programme and I am advised that more than 130 have been assessed as appropriate for it.  Some have completed the programme in the intervening period, so the figure is not 130 at the one time.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">The programme is continuing.  As was stated when we announced it, it was anticipated that at any one time there would be no more than 150 on the programme, and in any one year there would be no more than 400.  Whether there are 400 participants does not simply depend on the capacity of the probation service to supervise the numbers, which I am advised should not be a difficulty, but also on whether appropriate prisoners are available to participate in the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">There was a lot of hysteria attached to the announcement.  It was portrayed in some tabloid papers as if we were about to release 1,200 prisoners into the community, as opposed to approximately 1,200 over a three-year period.  All of them would have to have served a minimum of 50% of their sentences before qualifying to be assessed for the purpose of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">I see the programme going forward and as I told Deputy Calleary last week, when the formal review of the pilot is complete I will happily share that information with the Deputies.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
            <p eId="para_25">One of the criteria within the strategy for earning temporary release concerned education and training.  What type of resources will be needed to ensure that prisoners can avail of additional education and training in order to earn temporary release?  Will the Department be examining that matter over a three-year period or will it be done annually?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_10" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality__Deputy_Alan_Shatter">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_26">The strategy was only announced last week and we are now in the implementation phase.  The pilot projects are such that in the context of community release additional conditions can be attached.  For example, they may involve an individual having to attend meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or some other group dealing with drug issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">As the strategy details, we hope to expand and improve the overall educational facilities within our prison service.  That is now part of the work that is being put in place with regard to implementing the strategy over the three-year period.</p>

          <question by="#JohnHalligan" to="#Minister_for_Justice" eId="pq_3">
            <p eId="para_28">72<b>Deputy John Halligan</b> asked the <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b> if he will clarify the way the series of measures announced in June 2011, which were aimed at providing for the speedier processing of citizenship applications by bringing about a reduction in the average processing timescale and also by dealing with the backlog of applications that had accumulated have actually impacted on the current processing timescales of these applications; the amount of this backlog that has been cleared; the number of intern positions that were made available under the internship programme; the current average processing timescale; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_11" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality__Deputy_Alan_Shatter">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_29">When I first came into office just over a year ago one of my first objectives was to address the length of time taken to process applications for naturalisation and to significantly reduce the number of cases on hand.   At  that time there were over 22,000 applications on hand and applications were taking an average time of over two years to process, and many were waiting three to four years.  I regarded this as unacceptable.  In June 2011, I announced a series of measures to address this issue including improved application forms, which are currently available online with an associated online residence checker, re-engineering of processes that were a barrier to achieving maximum efficiency plus streamlined and accelerated procedures for certain types of application.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">Through these and other measures enormous progress has been made, notwithstanding a substantial increase in the volume of valid applications received in 2011, during which a total of 18,500 valid applications were received compared to 12,500 in 2010.  In the period 9 March 2011 to 8 March this year, a total of 17,500 valid applications were determined.  By contrast, in the whole of 2010, decisions were reached in just under 7,800 cases.  So far this year I have made decisions on some 9,200 applications and I expect to have made a decision on a further 3,500 applications by the end of May and on approximately 12,000 applications between June and the year end.  Thus, this year will see approximately 24,000 applications for citizenship dealt with, which would represent a more than threefold increase in the number of applications dealt with over 2010 levels.  I think the House would agree that by any standards of reasonable measurement this represents a major achievement.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">I also undertook to get to the stage by the second quarter of this year that, in the generality of cases - that is, around 70% - persons applying for a certificate of naturalisation will be given a decision on their application within six months.  In this regard, a major effort has and continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process applications.  It is expected that the six month timeframe for the generality of new applications received from this month onwards will be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_33">Under the new JobBridge programme announced by the Government a total of 16 individuals have been engaged by the citizenship division of my Department to date.  The primary purpose of the scheme is to provide work experience for those involved and to improve their prospects of getting back into the workforce.  I am advised that the scheme is extremely successful and mutually beneficial in addressing the backlog and enabling the individuals in question to gain good experience in the workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">Last summer, I also decided to introduce citizenship ceremonies for the first time since the foundation of the State.  This allows candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion.  To date, 47 such ceremonies have been held at which almost 11,000 candidates have become Irish citizens under the new procedures.  These ceremonies are an unqualified success.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">The nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process.  It is a statutory requirement that, <i>inter alia</i>, applicants for naturalisation be of good character.  In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  The primary aim over the past year has been to reduce the large volume of cases on hand as swiftly as possible and this has been achieved in the generality of cases.  I am also confident that significant inroads will also be made with the remaining cases by year end.  In such a fast moving environment where large volumes of cases are processed quickly, the calculation of averages for processing times has little meaning and the priority of the immigration service has been to deal with the cases on hand rather than divert resources to other activities.</p>

I accept that citizenship is a serious issue but having dealt with the local police force from where the person concerned has come, Interpol, if necessary, local communities and so on, I have often wondered why it took such a long time to process an application for citizenship.  I wish to ask the Minister two questions which I do not believe he answered.  Has the backlog of applications been dealt with?  I accept the Minister's stance, that increasingly more people are coming into this country and submitting applications for citizenship.  How many people have been employed to deal with the backlog and with the current number of applications?</p>

            <p eId="para_39">We are still addressing some parts of the backlog.  The nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases take longer than others to process.  A substantial number of cases that had accumulated have now been dealt with.  There are some cases that give rise to particular security issues that have to be addressed and because of the nature of those cases or the countries of origin of individuals, it can take longer to have those applications processed than I wish were the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">I know there are some cases on which the Deputy made representations and in which he expressed interest.  I believe I am right in saying that, from having a look at them, most of them are applications that were made from September 2011 onwards.  The position is that a substantial amount of the backlog has been dealt with and we are shortly going to be in an position where in the average case that gives rise to no particular major issues of security it will be determined within six months of the application being made.  Some applications made some years ago had not been processed or dealt with when I came in to office.   It is likely it could well take another three to four months to resolve and make decisions on this special group of cases.  By the time we get to the end of this year unless something exceptionally unusual or difficult occurs the vast majority of applicants will find if they apply and properly fill in the forms a decision will be made within six months of receipt of the application.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">73<b>Deputy Dara Calleary</b> asked the <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b> if he will consider the introduction of specific legislative provisions to ensure that the manslaughter of a member of An Garda Síochána, or any member of the security forces or emergency personnel, whilst in the course of duty attracts a specific mandatory sentence; the work he has done on this matter since taking up office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_43">The Deputy is rightly concerned about attacks on the members of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and emergency personnel in the course of their work.  I share that concern and I want to make it clear that I utterly condemn any such attacks.  I will have no hesitation of any nature in taking whatever action, including legislative reform, that might be necessary to protect gardaí, Defence Force personnel and other emergency workers against criminal attack.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">There are a number of important provisions already in law which seek to ensure that gardaí and other relevant personnel are protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">Where a person is convicted of the murder of a member of an Garda Síochána acting in the course of his or her duty under section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990 the court is required by section 4 of that Act to specify 40 years as the minimum period of imprisonment to be served by the convicted person.  Where the offence is one of attempted murder under section 3 the minimum term of imprisonment to be served is 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">Section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provides for the offence of assault of a member of an Garda Síochána, a prison officer, a member of the Defence Forces or certain emergency and medical personnel.  The penalty for the offence is a maximum of seven years imprisonment.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">The maximum penalty for manslaughter is life imprisonment in accordance with section 5 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">The position on mandatory sentences is that the Law Reform Commission was asked by the previous Attorney General to look at the issue of such sentencing.  This was done at the instigation of the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The commission recently published a consultation document on mandatory sentences and invited submissions from interested parties.  One of the preliminary recommendations of the consultation paper is against the extension of the presumptive minimum mandatory sentence regime that currently applies to certain offences such as drug trafficking.  Obviously the commission will have to consider any submissions made to it on this subject before making a final recommendation.  I would not like to prejudge the outcome of its deliberations.  I look forward to receiving and examining the recommendations of the commission in its final report on this subject.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">Since we last had Question Time the incident with regard to the transfer of the killer of Garda Gary McLoughlin occurred and I compliment the Minister on how he responded to it very quickly and commissioned a report.  Mr. Michael Donnellan of the Irish Prison Service came before the committee.  However, it brings into focus the issue of the original sentence in the case and in the case of the killer of the late Garda Robbie McCallion.  These gardaí were killed on duty while protecting their communities but because of the charges brought in one case the judge had to direct the jury it could not take into account the fact it involved a serving garda.  It is a huge problem and disappointment for their families and colleagues that although the gardaí were doing their job protecting communities, and would otherwise not have been in the position they were on those evenings, no special focus was given to the individuals who killed them.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">I am conscious of the work of the Law Reform Commission and the Minister's personal commitment about this but we must send out a message.  The Minister stated the sentence for the murder of a garda is 40 years.  I might be young but I can remember a time when it was a capital offence.  These two guys are perceived as having got away relatively lightly and we also had the issue of the transfer of Martin McDermott.  This is very difficult for the families of the gardaí, both of which I have spoken to, and for their colleagues.  I am sure the Minister agrees the Oireachtas must send out a very strong statement about protecting not only gardaí but security forces and emergency personnel.  I hope the Minister acts on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">I share the Deputy's concern.  It is important that we provide maximum protection to members of the force.  Should a member of the force die or be seriously injured in the course of carrying out their duties there should be appropriate legal mechanisms to bring people before the courts and sentence them.  On the issue of manslaughter, it is open to the courts to impose a life sentence.  As the Deputy is aware, the courts must independently determine what is the appropriate sentence in an individual case, based on the background circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">I await with interest the recommendations from the Law Reform Commission.  I assume the final report will address issues relating to members of An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and other emergency personnel who suffer injury during the course of their duties in circumstances in which individuals are engaged in criminality, but I do not wish to prejudge its outcome.  It is worth noting that at the recent Garda Representative Association, GRA, conference there was a call for the imposition of a five year sentence on those individuals who might injure a garda in the course of carrying out their duties.  It appears the fact that the law already provides for the possibility of a seven year sentence to be imposed by the courts if a garda is injured in the course of their duty was missed by those who made that call.  There is an already existing offence of assault on a member of An Garda Síochána which, in appropriate circumstances, can result in the courts imposing a seven year sentence.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">74<b>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</b> asked the <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b> his plans to ensure there are dedicated specialised officers for complainants in sexual violence and abuse cases in view of the recent rise in sexual offences. [22994/12]</p>

            <p eId="para_54">The Deputy may have in mind the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures for 2010 which recorded a substantial increase.  However, the CSO has cautioned that care should be taken in the interpretation of these statistics as the increase in that year was largely due to a review of all cases involving sexual offences reported to the Garda.  The CSO indicates that the number of sexual offences recorded fell by 13.5% during 2011.  The review of cases was undertaken in the context of the introduction of the Garda Síochána policy on the investigation of sexual crime, crimes against children and child welfare, which was introduced in April 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">While the management of investigations and police resources is a matter for the Garda authorities, I can inform the Deputy that the aim of this comprehensive policy is to combine professionalism with sensitivity and compassion in the investigation of sexual crimes.  The policy results from a review of Garda work practices and methodologies for the investigation of sexual abuse cases and sets out detailed standards, procedures and practices to be followed in all such cases.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as part of initial training all members of An Garda Síochána receive sufficient training to prepare them for the investigation of complaints of sexual violence, with appropriate training in interview techniques being provided to all members.  In addition, a sexual crime management unit has been established, which assists gardaí in the investigation of such crime, promotes best investigative practice and monitors a sample of investigations to ensure they are receiving appropriate attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">In the specific context of crimes against children the Garda Commissioner has established a strategic committee within An Garda Síochána, chaired by the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services, to liaise with the Health Service Executive, HSE's, national director of children and family services.  Furthermore, a countrywide network of interview suites has been put in place for use when interviewing children under 14 years of age against whom a sexual and-or violent offence is alleged to have been committed.  The interview process is a joint Garda-HSE one.  Gardaí and social workers have undergone joint training, organised by the Garda authorities, in the specialised interviewing skills necessary for interviewing such victims and there is an ongoing close working relationship between the Garda authorities and the HSE on child protection matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_57">I am aware that the figures for 2010 are skewed somewhat because of the historical cases being investigated by the Garda.  However, in 2006 there were approximately 1,400 reports of sexual assault.  That figure rose to just under 2,500 in 2010.  There was a decrease last year of approximately 13%, but given that the figure was particularly high in 2010, that decrease must be considered with some caution.  I tabled this question because of the ongoing closure of some Garda stations.  There there will be further such closures this year.  My concern is that people in rural areas who are the victims of sexual assault will find it more difficult to report such cases.  For instance, if they are obliged to travel further, will provision be made to ensure a female Garda will be on duty at all times within the Garda station to which they will travel?  I acknowledge this will be difficult to do, given the breakdown of the force but this must be considered in light of the closures that are taking place.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">In response to the Deputy, it might be of interest to note the sexual crime management unit, which operates within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, is the unit with national responsibility for the monitoring of the implementation of Garda policies in respect of sexual crimes.  This management unit is responsible for reviewing selected sexual crime investigations to ensure a consistent high standard of investigation throughout the State.  The unit, which comprises 23 personnel, is headed by a detective superintendent and includes a detective inspector, four detective sergeants, 14 detective gardaí and three support staff.  Additionally, in each Garda division, a Garda inspector has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the Garda Síochána policy to ensure the proper investigation of such crimes and uniform implementation of policy at district and divisional level.  Further monitoring mechanisms are in place for local and senior Garda management to ensure such investigations are conducted professionally and expeditiously, with weekly reports produced by the PULSE IT system on the status of all investigations of sexual crime and child welfare incidents coming to the attention of the Garda Síochána, which assists the Garda management in ensuring the investigation of such crimes is conducted professionally and in a timely manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">That said, the system now in place also ensures that in no part of the country are there any gaps in the context of necessary expertise required to investigate such crimes or in dealings with the victims of such crimes.  Moreover, no recent changes that have been made, the Deputy made reference to the closure of stations, in any way substantially have an impact on the system that has been put in place in the context of implementing the Garda policy in this regard.</p>

In addition, there now is close liaison between the Garda Síochána and the HSE in dealing with crimes of sexual violence.

If I may raise an issue for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle, given the manner in which replies are given in this format, I note Members do not have access to the aforementioned table.  Perhaps, with his Dáil reform hat on, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle might look into this matter.  However, the key message is five people have not been replaced since 2010.  I will give the Minister an example of the impact this is having.  One of those not replaced is in Tipperary.  I have been contacted by a group in Tipperary and by Councillor Siobhán Ambrose on this matter.  When the assistance of a crime prevention officer is needed in Tipperary the appointed officer in Waterford is called in.  This situation has been ongoing since December 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">Given the Minister's earlier response in regard to burglary statistics, it is a matter of priority that there be a crime prevention officer in every county to drive home the message of burglary prevention.  I am not sure what extra salary or allowances a crime prevention officer receives.  However, five counties have been without a crime prevention officer since December 2010.  While I understand every garda is involved in crime prevention work and that all gardaí are currently under huge pressure, the crime prevention officer has a specific role and mandate with which people and communities can identify.  I ask that the Minister strongly suggest to Garda management that these vacancies be filled as a matter of urgency.</p>

It is not for me to second guess operational decisions made by the Garda Commissioner.  The Deputy is correct that no crime prevention officer has been formally appointed in Tipperary following a retirement in December 2010.  Deployment of members of the force is ultimately a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am happy to bring the concerns expressed by the Deputy on this issue to his attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">76<b>Deputy Barry Cowen</b> asked the <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b> further to his comments at the AGSI conference, when he intends to publish the list of garda stations he intends to propose for closure in 2013; the number of stations the Garda Commissioner proposed for closure in 2012 versus the amount that have actually been closed; the projected savings in 2012 from the stations that have been closed; if the new garda roster changes will impact on the proposed number of station closures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_29" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality__Deputy_Alan_Shatter">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_100">Under the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner must, before November each year, submit a policing plan for the following year to the Minister.  The Commissioner must include in that plan any proposal to either open or close a Garda station.  It will, therefore, be towards the end of this year before the Policing Plan for 2013 is received, approved and published.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">Members will be aware that the Garda Commissioner proposed the closure of 39 Garda stations in his Policing Plan 2012, many of which were only open for limited periods, eight of which were non-operational, some for many years, and one of which had been non-operational since 1985.  Almost all of the closures have taken place and the process will be completed by end June this year.  In commenting on these proposals in the policing plan the Garda Commissioner said, "These decisions were only made after careful analysis and research and I am confident that this action will result in a more efficient delivery of policing services".</p>
            <p eId="para_102">It is not practical to give a precise figure for the savings resulting from the closure of Garda stations.  Savings on heating and lighting bills would be minor and would vary from station to station and savings resulting from avoidance of repair bills would vary depending on the condition of stations and would be difficult to calculate.  The key point is that the closures are not about minor savings but the more effective deployment of gardaí on operational duties.  The issue is whether for any given Garda force strength we want more gardaí in stations or more gardaí on operational duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">Critics of these closures are in effect arguing that we should not close even one of the 703 garda stations that have been, more or less, in place since the foundation of the State, despite the revolution that has taken place in transport, communications and technology since then.  Not only do they not accept these realities or the professional judgment of the Garda Commissioner about how best to deploy gardaí but they ignore the international evidence.  For example, Scotland, with a population of 5.2 million people - a directly comparable jurisdiction in many ways - has only 306 stations, which is less than half the 703 garda stations we had at the beginning of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">I fully support the Garda Commissioner in his efforts to deploy gardaí more effectively so as to enhance the policing service.  In that context, it is worth noting that new garda rosters were introduced last week on a pilot basis.  These new rosters, which are separate and distinct from the issue of rationalising the station network, have been developed following detailed consultations between Garda management and the Garda representative associations under the Croke Park agreement.  They are designed to maximise the deployment of gardaí at times of peak demand, while at the same time improving the work-life balance of members.  This is another example of improved efficiency and effectiveness in the Garda Síochána which we should all support.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">I have no difficulty with non-operational stations being officially closed.  However, while two of the four stations closed in my county were non-operational two others were operational in busy communities, one of which the Government and previous Administration invested in by way of a major tourism initiative and which is drawing in 50,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">Last week the Garda Commissioner said Garda station closures will affect rural areas but they also affect metropolitan areas.  Two stations have been closed on the north side of this city and people will be affected.  We are all for more gardaí on the street but we will not be able to measure that until the end of this year.  The reason we keep asking the Minister is that it was not the Garda Commissioner who went to the AGSI conference and announced more closures; it was the Minister.  He is becoming a bit of a cheerleader for closing these stations but when the political heat is turned on, it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Will the Minister clarify that the Garda Commissioner presents him with the list and that he makes the call on it?</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_31" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality__Deputy_Alan_Shatter">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_108">The Deputy is, of course, right in saying the Garda Commissioner presents me with a policing plan and that it is for me to approve it.  I rely on the Garda Commissioner's expertise in making operational judgments in these matters.  To come back to what I said earlier, we had 703 Garda stations at the beginning of this year.  A comparable jurisdiction, Scotland, with a higher population, has 360 police stations.  In 2000, there were in the region of 160 police stations in Northern Ireland but today, it has 80 and it is reviewing the numbers there with a projected possible number of stations by 2014-2015 of somewhere between 45 to 50.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">It is not in the interests of the community for members of the Garda force to sit in stations; it about them being engaged in front line policing for which they are trained.  If the Garda Commissioner judges that members of the force can better fulfil the public obligations and duties of the force by being engaged in front line policing rather than sitting behind desks in buildings, I will fully support him in those decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">The Deputy is right that I said at the GRA conference that I anticipated there would be further station closures.  Based on the implementation of all the closures taking place, we will be left with 664 stations which is practically double the current number in Scotland.  I anticipate it is likely in the policing plan we will receive at the end of the year that there will be a proposal for more stations closures to ensure resources are used more effectively and to ensure the skills of front line, well-trained police officers are used to protect the community rather than have them simply sitting in stations which have no recognised operational value in the context of the Garda Commissioner's view.  When it comes to how many may be closed or what the position will be in 2013, I will substantially rely on the Commissioner's expertise in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">I think everyone forgets that currently we have approximately 2,000 civilians working within the Garda force.  We also have 935 members of the Garda Reserve, which did not exist some years ago.  As Deputy O'Brien knows, because of current economic circumstances, we are not in a position to expand employment in these areas.  However, they are backups which the gardaí would not have had available to them a decade ago at those levels and it is easy to ignore them.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">In regard to the Garda rosters, I very much welcome the fact the new rosters have come into force.  I thank the representative organisations for their co-operation in the discussions that have taken place to bring the Garda rosters into force.  It is early days but I am advised that the roster system is working extremely well and that it is having the benefit that members of the force are now available on days of the week when the most need arises and that there is a new focus in the manner in which policing can take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">I think they are also more user-friendly for members of the force.  I was fortunate this week to have had conversations with a couple of members of the force who told me how beneficial they found the rosters.  I did not go looking for the conversations, but the members spoke to me about the new hours and how those impact on their lives.  It has been a successful start to the new rostering system.  The roster is to the benefit of the community, ensures that we use our resources more wisely and in a more targeted way and will provide for a better work-life experience for members of An Garda Síochána.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">A detailed manual on Garda policy and procedures in respect of the use of incapacitant spray has been developed by the Garda Commissioner and is published on the Garda website.  The manual sets out the detailed considerations that must always be taken into account by a member of the Garda Síochána before using incapacitant spray.  Any use of such a spray, as with any use of force in general, must be in accordance with law, in particular the law on the use of force set out in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  In effect, the use of such sprays must be necessary and must be reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">Garda members are trained in the lawful use of incapacitant spray and, as the manual makes clear, are individually responsible and answerable for their actions in its use.  It is also the case that every incident where incapacitant spray is deployed is notified to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which can investigate any question of misuse.  Comprehensive policy and procedures in respect of the use of incapacitant spray and appropriate safeguards to ensure compliance with those standards have been put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_119">I thank the Minister for his response.  I recognise the fact that we must ensure that the Garda Síochána can conduct its work in as safe a manner as possible, but the use of this spray was only sanctioned by one of the Minister's predecessors in 2008, prior to which gardaí were able to conduct their work adequately.  Is access to this type of facility adding to good policing?  I have concerns.  According to a response to my colleague, Deputy Seán Kenny, rolling out this facility has cost approximately €350,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">We must remember that gardaí have a duty of care towards citizens who are engaging in legitimate political demonstrations and activities.  I am sceptical about whether the access to or use of pepper spray, as it is colloquially known, assists good policing and community relations.  One of our great strengths is that the Garda is a civilian police force.  Facilities such as this need to be used with extreme caution, particularly given the fact that political activity will hopefully increase in the months and years ahead.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_121">I agree with the Deputy that such sprays must be used only in appropriate circumstances, as prescribed by the guidelines.  I do not see why any increase in, as the Deputy described it, political activity should result in the use of such sprays.  I am conscious that some of those who purport to be engaging in political activity resort to violence and abuse and disregard requests from the Garda Síochána to conduct themselves in a peaceful manner.  There are individuals engaged in protest who seek to intimidate innocent persons going about their business.  It is the job of the Garda Síochána to maintain law and order.  I would be the first to defend any individual's right in this State to engage in peaceful protest on any issue, but I will not defend individuals who resort to violence or attack members of the Garda or the general community.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">Members of the Garda Síochána have received appropriate training in the use of this spray.  The Garda website outlines the details of the procedures applicable to its use.  If it is used, a report is made to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, even in the absence of an individual making a complaint.  If it is ever suggested that the spray is used in circumstances that are inappropriate, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is in existence to investigate any complaint that may be received.</p>

            <p eId="para_123">I thank the Minister.  Good policing is about taking the heat out of potentially tense situations.  This forms part of the Garda's training process.  However, I would question whether having access to pepper spray assists that process.  I hope it will be kept under ongoing review.  Gardaí did not have access to pepper spray until 2008, yet I am sure the Minister would agree that the Garda Síochána was policing situations well prior to that time, including large events.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">I draw the Minister's attention to cases of people being unhappy with policing, for example, at Rossport in County Mayo where citizens were engaging in political activity.  Issues needed to be investigated.  It is in the interests of good policing to monitor these situations closely.  The less that facilities such as this spray are used, the better.  Pepper spray has an effect on the person on whom it is used.  The Minister must be vigilant in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_125">Of course, the Deputy is ignoring the fact that, for many years, members of the Garda Síochána had the use of batons to protect themselves.  Some people would be of the view that the use of pepper spray by a member of the force under attack is better than using a baton, in that the spray does not do any permanent damage or serious injury to a member of the community who is attacking a garda.  Pepper spray is an alternative mechanism available to a member of the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">If individuals are engaged in peaceful protest, they do not attack members of the Garda.  If individuals do not attack members of the general community who are not engaged in whatever protest is taking place, there is no particular reason that batons or pepper spray would ever be used.  However, it is important that members of the force have at their disposal the means to protect themselves when under attack.  We have in this country some individuals who engage in protests, intend to incite violence and are themselves violent and have no sense of the fundamental rights of ordinary individuals going about their business.  It is important that the Garda have available to it whatever is necessary to protect its members in those circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">There are some individuals who would like to see anarchy on our streets.  It is the job of the Garda Síochána to maintain law and order and to protect the wider community.  I will support it in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">The Deputy can be assured that the Irish Prison Service is conscious of the harmful, potentially devastating, consequences of crime on victims.  The service acknowledges that the impact of crime on victims varies in nature and force and the service seeks to take account of their experiences and needs.  Where victims make their views known to the service, they are always taken into consideration when making sentence management decisions, such as granting temporary release.  While it is, of course, appropriate that the sensitivities and concerns of victims of crime should be carefully considered, a balance must also be struck with other sometimes conflicting factors, such as the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">When victims of crime request it, the Prison Service victim liaison officer will enter into direct contact with them to inform them of any significant development in the management of the perpetrator's sentence as well as any impending release.  Such significant developments could include temporary releases, parole board hearings, prison transfers and expected release dates.  The victim liaison officer will also provide victims with general information on the prison system, such as the prison regime, remission on sentences and our system of parole, including the operation of the Parole Board.  This is, however, a voluntary service and it is for the victim or an immediate family member in the case of a person who has died as a result of a crime to chose if he or she wishes to obtain information about a prisoner.  I should also say that, for very understandable reasons, many victims do not want any further contact after the court process is finished.</p>

            <p eId="para_134">Victims or immediate family members may register for the service by writing to the victim liaison officer at Prison Service headquarters in Longford.  As part of the redevelopment of the Irish Prison Service website, a facility to allow victims to register online is also being developed and will be available in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">Finally, there is a commitment in the programme for Government regarding the introduction of a Bill to detail in law the protections available to victims of crime.  Developments in the European Union may result in a victims of crime measure that will apply across all member states.  If such a measure is directly applicable we will not be obliged to publish our own legislation.  It is likely that legislation to go hand in hand with this measure will be produced and that it will address issues relating to victims in the context of prescribing their rights and entitlements in respect of the information which should be made available to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">When Michael Donnellan appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the Loughan House issue, he also spoke about the process whereby victims can opt in to be kept informed about developments.  We suggested that the process should involve an opt-out facility because, first, not many people are aware of the service and, second, victims may not want to pursue this route in the aftermath of a crime or court case and as time goes on they will forget about it or it will not remain a priority.  If they are required to opt out from being kept informed, however, they would have to think about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">I am thinking in particular of the new pilot scheme.  Were victims' families informed that the 130 prisoners on the pilot scheme were in a community or providing a service?</p>

            <p eId="para_138">The Deputy can take it for granted that I will make it a priority.  He may be aware that I published the Victims' Rights Bill 2002, which the then Fianna Fáil Government voted down.  When I published an updated version of the Bill in 2008 to take account of legal developments in the intervening period, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, went to war with it on the basis that it reflected successful provisions that were already in existence in New Zealand, even though I had previously briefed him that it did reflect some provisions that were already successfully operating in New Zealand.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">I have for many years been committed to the enactment of victims' rights legislation.  The Department had begun work on this issue when the European Union proposal was published.  We are waiting to see how that proposal develops.  It is likely to be discussed at a meeting of European Ministers for Justice, if not in June then certainly next September, as progress is made.  It is not yet clear whether domestic legislation will be needed if it is enacted across Europe or if it will simply be directly applicable.  It may be the case that we will want domestic add-ons that Europe does not require but which would be to the benefit of victims.  That is an issue we will address if need be.  It will be a priority during the Irish Presidency.</p>

            <p eId="para_141">They would only have been kept informed during the pilot project if they opted in and, I assume, the convicted person was engaged in community service in their local community.  I can seek further information for the Deputy in so far as it is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">On the question of opt-in or opt-out, the balance of convenience suggests an opt-in provision for a range of reasons.  A substantial amount of the crime that goes through the District Court is of a minor nature.  Individuals would not necessarily want to receive phone calls a few months afterwards to give them minor pieces of information about the offenders.  They want to get on with their lives.  Such a provision would also become very resource intensive if, in the context of every conviction of every individual, it was assumed that victims who did not even look for information or did not want it should be given minor pieces of information.  There is an advantage in having an opt-in provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">However, for certain crimes, such as the one which gave rise to the tragic death of Garda McLoughlin, we are looking at putting in place a provision whereby the survivors of any person who lost his or her life in similar circumstances would automatically be informed when an event occurs which could result in someone being released, for example, to perform community service in a local community or go to an open prison near where the family concerned resides.  The balance of advantage in a broad range of crimes supports an opt-in provision but it is important that victims are made aware of the fact that they can opt in and that the facility is available.  We are investigating what steps may be taken to ensure there is sufficiently wide knowledge of this.  I have some concern that not all victims are aware of the capacity to opt in to receive information.</p>

[22646/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_47" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality__Deputy_Alan_Shatter">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_145">I presume this question was not tabled from a European perspective.  The public consultation process elicited a broad range of views on the display and sale of alcohol in supermarkets, convenience stores and similar mixed trading outlets.  Looking to the future, there appear to be three main options.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">The first option is continuation of the existing voluntary code of practice.  The current voluntary code of practice was agreed by the previous Government.  A new body, Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland Limited or RRAI, was established by the mixed trading sector to oversee its implementation and Mr. Padraic White was appointed as its independent chairperson.  Mr. White's compliance report for 2011 shows levels of compliance which are broadly similar to those in previous years, with 95% for supermarkets and 79% for convenience stores.  While the RRAI code has improved conditions for the display and sale of alcohol products in many mixed trading outlets, public health bodies and other licensed trade bodies have called in their submissions for commencement of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">The second option is to commence section 9 of the 2008 Act.  Section 9 requires that the display and sale of alcohol is confined to an area that is separated</p>
            <p eId="para_148">from the rest of the premises by a wall or similar barrier; access to this part can only be gained from the rest of the premises through a door, gate, turnstile or similar means of access; and the only place that customers can pay for alcohol is at a counter or point of sale within this separated part of the premises.  The only permitted alternative is to confine the display and sale of alcohol other than wine to a part of the premises to which the public does not have access, such as an area behind a counter.  Implementation of section 9 would require alterations in the design and layout of premises.  While large supermarkets could undoubtedly accommodate themselves to the new requirements without undue difficulty, small and medium sized outlets would inevitably encounter practical difficulties and face higher adaptation costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">The third alternative is a statutory code of practice under section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2011, which we enacted last summer.  Section 17 of the 2011 Act provides for statutory codes of practice.  A breach of such a code will not of itself render a licensee liable to any civil or criminal proceedings but it provides a ground on which an objection may be lodged in the District Court to renewal of the licensee's licence.  Where an objection is lodged, the licensee will be faced with the inconvenience and cost of District Court proceedings prior to renewal of the licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">In conclusion, I can state that I am not in favour of retaining the current RRAI voluntary Code. The choice therefore lies between section 9 of the 2008 Act or a statutory code under section 17 of the 2011 Act.  I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for proposals regarding future arrangements in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_152">I commend Mr. White on the detailed report he has produced for RRAI.  I agree with the Minister regarding section 9 of the 2008 Act and its impact on small and medium enterprises.  However, certain companies can afford the changes required under the section and these companies are probably the cause of problems in this area.  Has consideration been given to the segregation of section 9 according to size of retail premises?</p>
            <p eId="para_153">Has the Minister entered discussions with the Minister for Health or the Chair of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in regard to the work that the committee and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, have been doing in the area of alcohol?</p>

            <p eId="para_154">The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, and I have held discussions on how we should proceed with regard to this area.  While I join the Deputy in praising Mr. White for the work he is doing, I am not in favour of retaining the current voluntary code.  We need to do better than that.  The choice therefore lies between section 9 or some variant of it, as the Deputy is suggesting, or the statutory code under section 17 of the 2011 Act.  I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for proposals regarding future arrangements in the coming weeks.  They are the subject of internal discussions as to how best to proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">I am aware of two particular issues we must address.  We must try to ensure that we do what is necessary to "de-normalise", if I could put it that way, the purchase of alcohol by young people.  We must bring to an end some of the commercial inducements in place that encourage people to purchase and perhaps drink more alcohol than is wise.  For example, there are offers to pay for six cans of beer and get another six for free and other inducements.  On the other side of the coin, I am also aware that in what is currently a difficult business environment for SMEs, some mixed stores are dependent on alcohol sales and other sales to maintain a reasonable livelihood.  Alcohol is purchased as a normal item by many individuals in the community.  Many of those stores would not have the financial capacity to restructure in a manner that section 9 envisages.  If they had to obtain loans for such restructuring, it would put them under some difficulty.  There are balances we need to maintain and we are giving consideration to that in the current deliberations.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">Before the referendum date was set, I said we would favour it not being held in the immediate aftermath of the French presidential election because it had the potential to cause uncertainty.  This has happened to a certain degree and needs to be addressed.  I ask the Taoiseach to give the House some clarity on the situation.  It is fair to say that Mr. Hollande favours balanced budgets and fiscal rules but also wants to see a growth agenda.  That is a welcome opinion and we in Ireland should welcome a stronger growth agenda across Europe.  We have consistently called for that over the past 15 months.  I believe the Taoiseach will agree that it need not have any implications for the stability treaty.  However, it requires countries such as Ireland to speak up and back him on a far more ambitious agenda than we have had to date from the European leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">A special meeting of EU leaders is scheduled in two weeks' time.  Between now and then I ask the Taoiseach to indicate to the House whether he will be lobbying for specific new growth measures in addition to the fiscal treaty.  In particular will he support the call for a broadening of the mandate of the European Central Bank, the creation of infrastructure bonds via the European Investment Bank and the creation of euro bonds themselves?  Are there specific issues relating to the growth agenda on which he will engage with other European leaders?  Can the Taoiseach confirm that Mr. Hollande favours fiscal rules and balanced budgets?  He is very clear that he does not want to change the key element of the establishment of a permanent funding mechanism for countries in need of support - the European Stability Mechanism.  It has been suggested this morning that negotiations might begin to add to the treaty some specifics on the concept of growth.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">The decision to be made on 31 May is a decision by the Irish people for Ireland and its future.  The people are being asked for their permission to ratify the treaty signed on 2 March.  I congratulate Mr. François Hollande on his election as President of France.  I have noted his comments on growth, balanced budgets, the need for an ESM and also the need for a more concentrated focus on a growth agenda for Europe, which is in everybody's interest.  I welcome his statement from the point of view that Ireland and other countries have been talking about this agenda for some months.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I spoke to President Van Rompuy on Sunday and urged him to hold a summit meeting on a growth agenda.  On 23 May, after the French President has been ratified, the meeting will take place and the Heads of Government will look at the areas for growth and investment as part of that agenda and, I would assume, come back at the June meeting with specific proposals, including some of those the Deputy mentioned.  This is clearly in Ireland's interest.  In saying that we support a growth agenda, we do so in principle but there are issues that are clearly not in Ireland's interests, including changes to corporation tax rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">For the period ahead, the campaign here will focus on the positive reasons that Ireland should vote for this treaty, including continued access to investors' decisions to invest in Ireland and the lists of job announcements.  The access to the permanent mechanism of the ESM is the insurance policy or the back-stop that countries will look for and this will also put good housekeeping rules in order here so our country does not end up in serious difficulties again.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">I have congratulated Francois Hollande.  I expect to speak to him this week and clearly as far as his comments have been made to date about additional measures in terms of growth and investment, these are to be supported.  The more that European economies can grow and prosper, the better it is for our country.  Clearly, it should be said that we must appreciate the difficulties and the challenges that people have faced up to in this country and that is paying dividends in the recognition that Ireland has moved considerably from where it was, having been linked with other countries just a short time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Over the next week, I assume the question of the agenda of the meeting of 23 May will be clarified.  I will be happy to share that with the House and take proposals from Members in respect of their views about issues that should be discussed for investment and for a growth agenda.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_171">We would appreciate some specifics on the growth agenda.  It is all well to talk about it but we need specific proposals on it and Ireland should be tabling some measures because an opportunity exists now, particularly in terms of something over and above the fiscal treaty.  We have consistently argued the fiscal treaty is an essential step for Ireland's recovery but that it needs much more, particularly from the European Central Bank and other measures.  The Tánaiste is in Paris and if he gets to meet Mr. Hollande, he might convey to him that reality does not necessarily change after elections, as we know here and elsewhere.  The French may get to realise that sooner rather than later.  It is important that Europe holds its nerve and keeps on a credible pathway out of this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">In that context, the Greek elections, if anything, are more serious in terms of their potential implications for the euro itself.  Has there been any contact across Europe following those elections on the Greek bailout programme and the serious situation it faces in terms of funding requirements?  It will need a major tranche of funding shortly and the implications of a potential default would be widespread for the entire eurozone area.  As a Government and a country, we must keep a watchful eye on that.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that across Europe, the full implications of what may happen in Greece in the coming months are fully taken on board and the necessary contingency plans are made.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_173">The Greek situation shows what happens where there is a complete failure of confidence for investment in an economy like Greece.  The process must take place; Mr Samaras was unable to form a government, and it has now passed to the next largest party and, beyond that, a judge might be appointed to run the country for a period while the possibility of further elections looms.  The question of the Greek bailout that has been approved and voted for will come into focus depending on how that process goes.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">As far as the agenda for growth items, the Deputy mentioned euro bonds, a sufficiently high firewall, the future role of the ECB, the capacity of the European Investment Bank to fund projects that are sustainable and worthwhile and the issue of Structural Funds that remain unspent in some countries.  In Greece, €16 billion was allocated but it cannot be spent because there is no back-up from the Greek economy.  Other countries, however, including this country, have plenty of projects that are sustainable and that could ahead.  These issues must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I noted an interesting speech by the German Minister for Finance, Mr. Wolfgang Schäuble, where he talked about increasing rates of pay for German workers, an indication of a country in surplus that wants to spend and therefore stimulate the country while other countries are trying to deal with deficits.  These are indications of attitudes emerging.  I look forward to the meeting on 23 May, where we can have a strong discussion about a European summit on growth and investment.  I will be happy to inform other Deputies that the Government will consider a list of potential issues we will see as providing a stimulus and an opportunity for Europe and for Ireland.  Our question is to be answered on 31 May, the question of Ireland's future.  A "Yes" vote will guarantee confidence and a future while a "No" vote will create confusion and uncertainty and an instinct this is not the right thing to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">I would also like to congratulate Francois Hollande.  The message is not who was elected but that citizens spoke and in France and Greece, and in local elections in Italy, Germany and Britain, they rejected austerity.  This referendum on 31 May allows Irish citizens - the Taoiseach did not want a referendum - an opportunity to join the growing Europe-wide movement to see investment in jobs and growth.  A strong "No" vote will see this goes beyond rhetoric.  Austerity is not working.  We have had five austerity budgets under Fianna Fáil and the current Government, with the social consequences for citizens becoming worse and worse, with half a million unemployed and tens of thousands emigrating, families unable to pay bills and poverty increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The Taoiseach will recall that before every EU summit, Sinn Féin urged him to ensure growth and jobs were at the heart of any agreement.  The Taoiseach rejected this sensible approach and repeatedly refused to seek a write-down of the private banking debt.  Now with the tide of popular opinion demanding jobs and growth across the EU, this Government has suddenly discovered a rhetorical sense of these policies.  Citizens will not be fooled by this or by lip-service to it.  Will the Taoiseach take this opportunity to set the record straight and admit austerity does not work and that we need to get people back to work?</p>

          <p eId="para_195">I thank the Taoiseach for that rather disingenuous answer.  As he knows, we do not have a cohort at the back.  We have a duly mandated team of Seanadóirí and Teachtaí Dála anseo.  With a mind to the awful social consequences, unlike the Government, we have put forward thoughtful costed propositions as to how we can grow our way out of the difficulties and get our people back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Last week, Mario Draghi spelled out his vision for the austerity treaty, describing it as "a fiscal union in which the national Governments will have to accept a delegation of fiscal authority and sovereignty to a central authority".  Tá sé soléir go n-aontaíonn an Taoiseach leis an méid seo.  Cén fáth?  An gcuimhníonn sé an sean-dán? "Mór mo ghlóir/ Mé a rug Cú Chulainn cróga/ Mór mo náire/ Mo chlann féin a dhíol a máthair."  What will this mean?  The Taoiseach clearly agrees with the delegation, as Mr. Draghi calls it, of fiscal sovereignty to a central authority.  This will mean a delegation of fiscal authority, putting in place the setting of taxes over sovereign states in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Why should Irish citizens vote for a treaty that means handing over what is left of our economic decision-making?  The Taoiseach rightly criticised the Fianna Fáil Government when it handed over sovereignty to the EU and the IMF.  Indeed, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, described the 2011 budget as a "puppet budget from a puppet Government".  Cad í an difríocht anois?  Why does the Taoiseach support the abandonment of economic sovereignty?  Why does he believe that tax measures, public spending targets or welfare rates should be set in Brussels or Berlin rather than here in the Oireachtas?</p>

          <p eId="para_219">It would appear that indigenous home-grown job creation plans are being relegated to the subs' bench in favour of high-optic photo-calls of international announcements.  Although all Members welcome the recent jobs announcements by SAP, Apple and other foreign direct investors, I have concerns as to the backbone of the job creation portfolio of this Government because it seems, in part, to be selective and it does not put the shoulder to the wheel when it comes to supporting ground-up solutions.  The focus is entirely on foreign direct investment, ignoring the potential of the domestic economy and the urgency for same to be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Speaking in a Dáil debate last month, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, stated: "Supporting balanced regional development and creating jobs in rural locations is a priority."  However, to take one case in point, the Western Development Commission has published a report, Creative Sector in the Western Region - Future Growth Trajectories.  This reports warrants real attention in an economy that is looking for answers as it outlines the possibility of creating 20,000 jobs over the coming ten years within the creative industries area.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Has a single Department read the report?  Has any Department spoken to the statutory agency that wrote it?  The answer is a clear "No".  Across the seven counties, Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Leitrim, Roscommon, Clare and Sligo, this sector reported total sales in 2010 of €206 million, with exports close to €57 million annually.  The potential 20,000 jobs are not getting there fast enough to stop the tide of emigration.  Seeing the destruction of families and communities in my county, Donegal, is very painful.  The very fabric of our social capital is being torn apart.  Emigration is keeping the live register figures for County Donegal-----</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_226">The line of investment into the country from outside is a signal of confidence in our people and in our country on the part of decision-makers abroad.  I am sure the Deputy heard the chief executive of the Industrial Development Authority talking this morning about the great clusters of world leaders in industry now in the country, be they in software, IT or whatever.  The reason they are here is their belief and confidence in our workforce, the ease of doing business here, the productivity, the targets set and the capacity of the Irish workforce to measure up to whatever the challenge may be.  That is evident throughout the country.  The next wave of investment will come from small and medium enterprises in order to deal with the demands and requirements of many of these companies.  That is why the focus of the Government has been to strengthen the business model for small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises.  It is why the jobs action plan was published in February, with 270 proposals.  The first quarterly report showed a significant fulfilment of the proposals.  It is why the Government published legislation dealing with the partial loan credit guarantee scheme so that small companies can access credit from the banks, each of which has guaranteed over €3 billion of new lending this year.  It is why the Government wants to move on with the micro-finance agency, which can leverage €100 million for very small operators.  Following the decisions on VAT and PRSI, particularly in the hospitality sector, 11,000 new jobs have been created in the food and agriculture sector.  There was no increase in income tax and taxes on jobs so that we can unleash the potential of small business operators.  That will apply in Donegal as well as Wexford and County Louth as well as County Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I do not accept the premise of Deputy Pringle that the Government is not focusing on the sector.  It is, which is why JobBridge and Pathways to Work have brought about significant improvements in well-qualified people taking up employment through JobBridge.  The Pathways to Work scheme is proving exceptionally beneficial for those who unfortunately found themselves out of work.  The change is coming in the Department of Social Protection, where people who lose a job will be offered opportunities for retraining, upskilling and a change of direction in their career.  I recently visited the Google headquarters and spoke to some of the 1,000 engineers there.  The average length of time people have a job in a company like that is four years following which they change direction.  We must deal with the future which being created.  The emphasis of Government will be to continue to roll out its jobs action programme for those companies so that the news can be, from Dunlewey to Bundoran, that new places are being opened and that two or three new people are being recruited on a regular basis.  I understand the scale of emigration and what it means but it is important not to lose hope and confidence.  Government decisions in this area help the environment.  From my perspective, I want to be able to prove by 2016 that we are the best small country in the world in which to do business.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_228">Those are fine words but they do not mean much on the ground when over 1,200 small businesses across the country have failed in the past two years.  We should be building our indigenous sector to stand up and service itself and the country rather than serving the foreign direct investors already here.  The report from the Western Development Commission clearly sets out how it can be done.  I call on the Taoiseach not to tie himself to the rhetoric but to support industries and allow them to develop jobs.  Jobs in small businesses across the country will keep things going.  The rhetoric of the Taoiseach is very different to the experience of most people across the country who comprise the economy on which people depend day-to-day for their survival and to stem the tide of emigration.  I ask the Taoiseach to look at the Western Development Commission report, see its value and ensure that its recommendations are implemented so that we can have a domestic industry that can stand on its own, not just to service foreign direct investment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_105">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_229">The Western Development Commission has produced some fine reports.  I read the reports and I meet the commission on a reasonably regular basis to hear its views and about its capacity to co-ordinate the effort between agencies, Departments and businesses.  I had the privilege of visiting China recently to meet elements of the political process and the business world.  Some 90 companies from Ireland were there and each of them signed contracts, which are collectively worth €35 million.  Some of them are spread across the west and in niche areas.  Enormous potential exists in that area.  Companies from Ireland employ over 100,000 people across 50 states in the US.  These are not phantom companies, they involve men and women producing goods that are exported and employ people in other countries.  That is why the confidence of the fiscal stability treaty will mean that where Europe focuses on the growth agenda, it will help many small companies, including those in County Donegal, to export to larger markets where the products will be bought.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The Western Development Commission report is valuable, as are all the reports, but the focus and the emphasis of the Government is to open the doors for small businesses to have access to credit so that they can make cashflow projections.  In the past, if a company sought extra money from the bank, money was thrown at the company if it had property.  That is no longer the case and cashflow projections are required now.  There must be compatibility in that the business must be sustainable in its potential.  I do not accept the premise of Deputy Pringle and, while I would like more people to be employed today, the emphasis of the Government and the Cabinet, through the action plan for jobs, is to stimulate the economy and prove that we can create an environment and a sense of confidence where employers and those with initiative will take on new people and rise to the challenge of the potential for producing goods that can be sold on the export market.  This will generate income for the country.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_250">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 19, inclusive, together.  I met Prime Minister Cameron in London on 12 March, which was the first time in many years a Taoiseach visited Britain during St. Patrick's week.  The key purpose of our meeting was to discuss the development of British-Irish relations.  Following the meeting, we signed and published a joint statement setting out our aims and plans for the next decade.  The statement recognises that the relationship between Ireland and Britain is now at a uniquely high level of co-operation.  It covers a range of areas of proposed co-operation including on energy policy, trade and business, and boosting competitiveness and productivity in order to accelerate our respective recoveries and lead to growth and job creation.  While business and official level links between Britain and Ireland are already strong, the Prime Minister and I also agreed on the merit of a joint study and evaluation of the economic relationship.  I intend that the next decade will see an intensive programme of work aimed at reinforcing the British-Irish relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_251">Our joint statement reaffirms the support of both Governments for the full implementation of the Good Friday and related agreements and to seeing Northern Ireland move from peace to reconciliation and prosperity.  We are determined to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland are never again blighted by violent conflict.  We remain committed co-guarantors of the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_252">In addition to our joint statement, we discussed a range of other issues over the course of our meeting, including the economy and Europe.  On Europe, we are both firm supporters of the Single Market and will continue to consult each other on key EU policy issues.  We discussed the most recent European Council and we strongly agree that growth and jobs should remain at the centre of the EU's agenda.  We briefly discussed the financial transaction tax idea and I repeated my view that it could only work if introduced on an across-the-board basis internationally.  Otherwise, it would create serious competitive distortions.</p>
            <p eId="para_253">I updated the Prime Minister on the stability treaty and on the forthcoming referendum.  I explained our position regarding our efforts to reduce the costs to the State as a result of promissory notes.  I was pleased by his comments in support of our continuing efforts in pursuit of our economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_254">During our meeting, I raised the Pat Finucane case again, as I had also done at our previous meeting.  We have a different opinion to that of the British Government and I support the Finucane family's quest for a full inquiry.  The Finucane family has been granted leave for a judicial review by the High Court in Belfast, which is due to take place this month.  We will see what emerges from that.</p>
            <p eId="para_255">In addition to a discussion on the Finucane case, I also raised the sensitive and difficult cases of the Ballymurphy families and the Dublin and Monaghan bombings with the Prime Minister.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_107">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_256">It seems to have become a consistent pattern of the past year that the Taoiseach tends to group questions on Northern Ireland with entirely unrelated questions.  For example, I suggest that questions on the investigation into the murder of Pat Finucane should not be grouped for reply with questions about United Kingdom policies on the stability treaty.  Even though parties in this House are committed to the holding of an inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, there does not seem to be any movement whatsoever on the part of the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.</p>
            <p eId="para_257">The Taoiseach in his reply stated there was a difference of opinion between our Government and the British Government.  I would suggest it is not a matter of opinion but rather a matter of an international agreement solemnly signed and agreed to by both Governments.  Will the Taoiseach agree that no one government has the right to unilaterally resile from an international agreement of that kind and that to do so is a serious matter?</p>
            <p eId="para_258">How does the Taoiseach propose to resolve the stalemate separate from judicial reviews as this is an international agreement which both sides signed?  Does he envisage any movement on the implementation of that agreement and of people honouring their word?</p>
            <p eId="para_259">As regards European matters, the position of the British Government has been to oppose important reforms.  It is argued it has moved from an old policy of opting out which characterised the approach of successive British Governments to European issues, towards a policy which is attempting to block issues.  I do not believe Europe can work if this sort of approach is maintained.  Did the Taoiseach address this issue with the British Prime Minister as regards the evolution of European policy and the role of the British Government, its contribution to the evolution of that policy and the best approach to be adopted?</p>
            <p eId="para_260">The UK Independence Party has been attempting again to interfere in Ireland's affairs in its support of the "No" side, as is to be expected.  The party also circulated leaflets to every house in the country during the second Lisbon treaty campaign.  On this occasion the party has been claiming that a financial transaction tax will be imposed on us.  I ask for the Taoiseach's views.  The factual position, as I understand, is that there is still a significant and resolute bloc in the Union which is opposed to a financial transaction tax and I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could confirm this.</p>
            <p eId="para_261">The Taoiseach referred in his reply to a brief discussion with the British Prime Minister and I am anxious to hear the views of the British Prime Minister on his Government's position on the financial transaction tax.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_262">I assure Deputy Martin I do not object to a change in how we deal with questions to the Taoiseach.  The questions asked whether the Finucane murder was raised with the British Prime Minister in meetings with him.  It is difficult to separate those questions from questions on the meetings, which is where the matter was raised.  If Deputy Martin considers it is more appropriate to raise this matter as a single Northern Ireland issue, I do not object, except to say that-----</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_263">They should be dealt with separately from questions on Europe.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_264">-----this matter was raised at meetings with the Prime Minister and this is the reason the questions were grouped.</p>
            <p eId="para_265">I answered this question at the press conference in Downing Street.  It is a difference of opinion about the fact that an international agreement exists.  The British Government has taken the view that a Queen's Counsel should be appointed to review the Finucane papers.  For my part and on behalf of the Irish Government, my view is the same as that held by my predecessors, that a full inquiry should be held and this was recommended by Mr. Justice Cory.  The agreement was that Mr. Justice Cory's recommendations would be adopted.  This is the reason the Smithwick tribunal was established in this jurisdiction.  It is a cause of regret to me that the British Government has not followed through in this regard and I believe it should do so.  I made that specific point with regard to the Finucane case because it was a specific recommendation of the Cory report.  There have been so many other claims landing on my desk about inquiries in other areas but this was part of an international agreement and Mr. Justice Cory made a specific recommendation.  The British Government took the decision to appoint a Queen's Counsel who will report later this month.  I have explained this to Geraldine Finucane and I have made the same point to political interests in the United States when I had the opportunity to raise it there.</p>
            <p eId="para_266">Deputy Martin is correct that the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, should stay out of Ireland's affairs.  The referendum on 31 May is for the Irish people to decide and the Irish people are well able to make up their minds without any interference from UKIP.  As to whether it is associated with the "No" campaign in a formal or informal way, I do not know.  However, I can inform the Deputy that there is a significant bloc at the level of European Heads of Government about a financial transaction tax and there will be complete opposition to such a tax from quite a number of countries.  I can confirm that this matter was raised in very trenchant terms at the last Council meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_267">I look forward to the meeting on 23 May which will be one of two European summits which will deal with the subjects of growth and investment.  When the parameters are discussed at the first meeting, the Heads of Government should then return with an agenda list of propositions which can be dealt with at the June meeting.  As President Barroso recently indicated, it will take some time to sort it out and there could be a significant movement by the end of the year which will be followed through.  The political will is there to drive it.</p>
            <p eId="para_268">I refer to matters such as the Single Market or the digital market which is supposed to be introduced by 2014.  That is not long away but there needs to be a major lift in the political driving of these agendas which will have such a significant impact on the economies.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_111">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_269">I refer to the Taoiseach's discussions with the British Prime Minister.  He referred to a joint study on the economic relationship and on helping Northern Ireland to return to prosperity.  Did the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister discuss a recent alarming and depressing report which indicated that one in every two children born and reared in west Belfast will experience poverty?  There seems to be a sense that the dividend from the peace process has not reached vulnerable communities in Northern Ireland on both sides of the political divide.  This is an issue of concern which should demand the attention of both Governments.  It was a shocking statistic published in a recent report on the economic and employment situation and the general poverty in west Belfast and its results are very bleak for children born and reared in west Belfast.  I await the Taoiseach's comments and I ask if the two Governments have any agenda to deal with this issue which is experienced by a number of communities across the North.</p>
            <p eId="para_270">I refer to the issue of the promissory notes.  The Taoiseach stated that he had a brief discussion with the Prime Minister about them.  Did the Taoiseach attempt to enlist the support of the Prime Minister for a write-down or a restructuring of them?  Did the Taoiseach seek his support for Ireland's position on this important issue?  I remind the Taoiseach of the famous commitment of not another red cent to the banks and burning bondholders.  That position was moved rather adroitly by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on the very day the bonds were to be paid when the issue became one of promissory notes.  By the time of the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, the issue was again dealt with in another manner or rather, the can has been kicked down the road and the matter has been postponed.</p>
            <p eId="para_271">In his replies to the House on these issues for the past nine to 12 months, the Taoiseach has kept this issue at a technical level and this has been his stock reply.  There has been no sense that a fundamental issue to do with the promissory notes has been dealt with at a senior political level between the Government and other Heads of Government.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline the nature of his conversation with the British Prime Minister on that issue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_112">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_272">Officials on both sides have been working on the joint studies programme.  The question of poverty, unemployment and the future of Northern Ireland's economy was discussed.</p>
            <p eId="para_273">One of the conclusions was that the Prime Minister and I agreed there should be a series of visits to various locations in Northern Ireland, both by the Prime Minister and myself as Taoiseach, in regard to community development.  The latter is so important given that the political peace is very stable but clearly there are threats there from some dissident groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_274">I made the point that work is ongoing in regard to the proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate in Northern Ireland, and the implications of that.  I discussed the question of elements of a shared economy which were raised at the British-Irish Council and the Cross-Border Parliamentary Council.  In addition, the question of investment into Northern Ireland arose.  When I was in China, I mentioned to the Chinese leaders that a visit would follow from the First Minister and Deputy First Minister with a view to making a case for investment in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_275">When I was in the United States I also raised the question of continued investment in community development.  In particular, where difficulties arise for young people - particularly young men - they should be encouraged and supported with employment opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_276">The promissory note question was raised in this House on so many occasions that it became important to inform the Prime Minister of what the Government's strategy was.  As Deputy Martin is aware, a payment in excess of €3 billion was dealt with by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  I explained to the Prime Minister the strategy involved of a re-engineering of the moneys that were borrowed for recapitalisation of the banks which, when added on to the national debt, created difficulties for us.  He fully understood that.  Britain was first out of the blocks when Ireland had a problem in respect of its loan.</p>
            <p eId="para_277">It might be preferable to keep this thing at a leaders' level in respect of the facility that might be extended to Ireland and the beneficial consequences of that for us.  However, Deputies on all sides of the House have a right to ask questions about these matters and as the date was coming up shortly after the Ard-Fheis it had to be dealt with, and it was.  Clearly, the bigger portion of that problem is still under negotiation and will be the subject of considerable discussion in the time ahead.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
            <p eId="para_280">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  I welcome the fact the Taoiseach has raised some of these high-profile cases of injustice in a very public way, including the Pat Finucane case, the Ballymurphy case, and the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I believe, however, that the Taoiseach's meeting with the British Prime Minister on 12 March was a missed opportunity to fundamentally rebalance the relationship between Ireland and Britain, and between the British and Irish Governments.</p>
            <p eId="para_281">For a long time, the British Government has been able to dictate the pace on relationships between this island and Britain, but that needs to change.  I accept it when the Taoiseach says he is disappointed by the British attitude, for example, on the Pat Finucane case.  At the meeting he attended, however, both Governments recommitted to the Good Friday Agreement and related agreements, yet the British Government is in complete and total breach of one of those agreements.  What are our diplomatic services doing about this?  What are we doing through the Department of Foreign Affairs?  What work is going on behind the scenes to try to show the British Government that this is not just a matter of the Taoiseach releasing a press statement or going public about his feelings?</p>
            <p eId="para_282">As regards the Ballymurphy case, the Taoiseach will know that those people have been fighting a campaign for the last 40 years.  He met them and had his photograph taken with them at an awards ceremony in Belfast, but there was not time for a meeting.  When I asked him if he would have a meeting with them he said he would, but that he would wait until he went to Belfast.</p>
            <p eId="para_283">The British Secretary of State and the British Government have been most unco-operative with these families.  I have accompanied these families to meetings with successive British Secretaries of State and, by the way, it is an open and shut case.  These were innocent civilians who were neighbours of mine.  Some of them were friends of mine.  They were shot by members of the parachute regiment who then went on to do what they did on Bloody Sunday.  They then came back to Belfast and did the same in Springhill, on the Shankill Road and in Ardoyne.</p>
            <p eId="para_284">These families are willing to travel to Dublin if the Taoiseach can give them an hour of his time.  It would be a good act of solidarity and an important part of bringing a renewed focus to their campaign.  I can tell the Taoiseach categorically that the British Government has no intention, at this time, of doing what those families are asking.</p>
            <p eId="para_285">It is almost a year since there was a big focus on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, yet no progress has been made.  I have consistently raised the issue of funding for the Justice for the Forgotten organisation.  The campaign group survived on funding it used to get from the Remembrance Commission because its funding from the Department of Justice was withdrawn in July 2009.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Good Friday Agreement made representations to the Taoiseach's office to have that funding restored, but it was not.  We are talking about approximately €17,000 at a maximum to keep this campaign group going.  It has had to move out of its offices and is currently working out of a portakabin.  How seriously is the Government taking this unresolved issue, if that is the case?</p>
            <p eId="para_286">I have met with that group probably more than anybody else here, but certainly as often.  The British Government - whether it is Tory or Labour - is consistent in promoting the Union, although Labour may have a more benign view of all of this.  However, we need to have an Irish Government which just as strongly, diplomatically and positively promotes the whole issue of Irish unity and the people of this island getting rid of partition, though having a cordial union between the people of the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_287">I am proud to have represented West Belfast for a long time.  People are suffering from the legacy of partition, which will take a long time to undo under the current configuration despite the good work being done by the Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_288">I therefore look to the Taoiseach to give the lead.  When he goes to the North, he has seen that he is very welcome in Unionist as well as Nationalist neighbourhoods.  People are glad to see him and they were glad to see other taoisigh.  A time of change is coming and the Government needs to set the pace of that change, as opposed to letting mandarins in Whitehall do it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_116">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_289">I thank Deputy Adams for that.  On the last occasion I had to visit Belfast, I met communities on either side of the divide.  I was appreciative of the valiant efforts they are making in respect of young people - young boys and girls - to give them an understanding that they have a life to live and that differences can all be accommodated.</p>
            <p eId="para_290">As I said to Deputy Martin, I have a clear view of support for an inquiry in the Finucane case because of the decision of Judge Cory.  I met with the Ballymurphy families at the presentation of awards in the Europa Hotel.  I spoke to Geraldine Finucane there.  I understand that the Ballymurphy families have been seeking an independent, international investigation into the Ballymurphy situation.  I also understand that the Secretary of State, Owen Paterson, has recently advised them that the British Government does not intend to hold an inquiry into this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_291">In regard to meeting the Ballymurphy families, I do not have any difficulty with this.  My preference would be to meet them in Belfast and perhaps the next time I can get a chance to go up there, hopefully in June, I might be able to accommodate that.  The Deputy will realise I am somewhat tied up for this month with the referendum issues and matters in respect of Europe but I do not have any difficulty in meeting the Ballymurphy families and I told them that.</p>
            <p eId="para_292">The matter of Justice for the Forgotten has been raised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Deputy will be aware that Justice for the Forgotten received funding from the State over the years of about €2.3 million, which now operates under the auspices of PEACE III programme out of The Pat Finucane Centre.  I also understand the organisation is looking for additional funding to run an office in Dublin.  As we are standing here there is not any line of a Vote in my Department that can accommodate this.  While it is difficult to see where this can be accommodated, I want the Deputy to know I am exploring it on the basis of the relatively small amount that is involved.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_117">
            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
            <p eId="para_293">I thank the Taoiseach for that response.  Justice for the Forgotten, to whom I spoke this morning, is unable to get EU funding, unless it shifts its office up to the Border, to north Louth or south Armagh, and that is not feasible.  I know people from all sides suffered in the course of the conflict but we must remind ourselves that this Oireachtas sought an inquiry and was critical of the lack of co-operation from the British given that there is a very strong belief that this bombing in the town of Monaghan and here in the city of Dublin was conducted with the collusion, support, assistance and direction of agents of the British Government.  That is a huge issue to have been allowed to fester as long as it has festered.  I asked the Taoiseach what the Government has done on this issue in terms of the diplomatic services of the Department of Foreign Affairs and so on in trying to get the British to change their mind on their position because otherwise the Taoiseach looks as if he is totally impotent.  Effectively, he stands up and says "I disagree, I want this to happen" but it does not happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_294">Similarly in terms of funding for Justice for the Forgotten, it shows where the Government's heart is - with such a small amount of money being involved.  I welcome what I consider to be a positive statement from the Taoiseach on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_295">Again we see where the Government's heart is on another issue.  I know the Taoiseach is extremely busy but why should we quibble over location?  If these families are prepared to come from Ballymurphy to Dublin, then he should invite them down - let them see that the Government cares.  Of course if the Taoiseach is going to be in Belfast before that can happen, that is a different matter.  The fact that meeting has not yet taken place is not helpful to the campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_296">At the nub of what I am trying to say in terms of all of this is that we all know the vexed relationship between these two islands and we know we are all in a far better place thanks to the work of many very good people but we need to keep moving it forward.  If the Taoiseach were to reflect on what I said earlier, it strikes me that we should not let the British Government set the pace of developing a new relationship.  I was in the North at the weekend.  This is the fifth year of the Executive.  The is the first time since the partition of the island that we have had five years of relative governance; I know it is a unique form of governance and we would want to see it go much deeper and to have more authority on this island.  I am a united islander, as I hope the Taoiseach is, but we will not get that unless we have a strategy and we press it and part of pressing it is that the people in the North from each persuasion need to know there is an Irish Government that cares about them and that on issues of justice, no matter who the perpetrator is, the Government will stand fair and square.  Just because it happens to be a British Government, that should not in any way bring about any hesitation on the Taoiseach's part.  It needs a strategy, a programme and a way of persuading.  I cannot see how Mr. Cameron could not be persuaded, if he was getting good advice.  As I have said here previously in terms of the Saville inquiry, Tony Blair took away a report for a weekend and that changed his mind on Bloody Sunday.  He would tell the Taoiseach that if the Taoiseach were talking to him.  The Irish Government played a key role with people in Derry in putting together that report.  I do not see why the same thing cannot be done in terms of the three outstanding issues.  The Irish Government should compile a detailed report, use the expertise that is there, gather up all the evidence and the information that is possible and then present it to the senior people on the British side so that when the Taoiseach engages with the British Prime Minister it is not a matter of a sort of anaemic statement being made to the effect that "we are committed to the Good Friday Agreement and all the related agreements" but that the Taoiseach can put the proof of that into being by that sort of strategic programmatic approach which the Government can take and the Civil Service has the ability to do given the political direction to do it.</p>

            <p eId="para_297">From my personal perspective, I would prefer to meet the Ballymurphy families on their home ground.  While one may take on too many meetings what I would like to do is to go to Belfast in June and, as part of whatever I do in Northern Ireland, arrange a meeting with the Ballymurphy families and hear what it is that they have to say.</p>
            <p eId="para_298">I did not rely upon diplomatic services or just correspondence in respect of the Pat Finucane case, I raised it directly where it should be raised, in 10 Downing Street face to face with the British Prime Minister.  I said the position from our perspective was the Cory decision and recommendation was that there should be an independent inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  That arose out of an international agreement at Weston Park.  The Government of the Republic and the Dáil set up the Smithwick inquiry following the same recommendation.  While the British Government has set itself and its face on the de Silva inquiry I have no idea what might emerge from that.  As I said to the Deputy, my preference, as I said to the Prime Minister face to face, is that a public inquiry should take place as was recommended.  I also said that to Geraldine Finuance when I met her both in Belfast and in the United States where I raised the matter of the public inquiry being conducted in respect of the death of her husband when I met her in Washington.  It is not just a case as the Deputy said of anaemic statements; this is a case where we speak on behalf of the Government in respect of a international agreement, as Deputy Martin pointed out, and that should be honoured.  That is my view and I communicated that directly to the British Prime Minister.  I am not sure what advice he has available to him or the nature of the advice that was given to him about the appointment of a queen's counsel to look at the Finucane papers.  He extended the courtesy to me of informing me that the announcement would be made.  I am not sure whether there was an assumption that would have been acceptable to the Finucane family at the time of his announcement but clearly it was not, which very clearly leads to the understanding that everybody had that these were two specific instances, two specific recommendations from Judge Cory, and the agreement of both Governments was whatever his recommendation would be it would be followed through and, as I said, I am disappointed that did not happen.  For my part, I will continue to raise it where it should be raised with the Prime Minister when I have occasion to meet him.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_306">In the Taoiseach's misrepresentation of our position on the €10 billion in taxes, he fails to add on who would pay those taxes and we argue very clearly that the very wealthy in our society and the sectors of our society in possession of considerable amounts of money should be taxed in a progressive and fair way to prevent cuts and austerity being imposed on working people and the more vulnerable sectors of our society.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach constantly claims, there are huge amounts of money at the top of our society which if taxed fairly and progressively could offset the need for brutal attacks and austerity being imposed on working people and the less well-off who have borne the brunt of the austerity agenda pursued by the Government and the masters in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_307">One area we have highlighted is precisely the financial transaction tax.  I find absolutely extraordinary the Taoiseach's trenchant opposition to even a small bit of extra taxation being imposed on the financial sector.  It shows the quite perverse economics being pursued by the Government that it is okay to cut fuel allowance for pensioners, domiciliary care allowance for families with disability and child benefit, and to attack lone parents, but we cannot touch the enormous wealth in the hands of speculators and bankers.  Even a tiny increase in tax is unthinkable as far as the Government is concerned and it is absolutely perverse.</p>
            <p eId="para_308">Let me remind the Taoiseach, when he considers the matter of whether we should support the financial transaction tax, that it was the speculators and bankers who caused the current economic crisis in this country and Europe.  Surely it would be fair and sensible to support imposing some extra taxation on this sector to offset the need to attack working people and the less well off and to regulate to some extent the casino capitalism that has been at the heart of wrecking our economy and the wider European economy.  Will the Taoiseach please tell me what is fair or rational about his position of opposing the financial transaction tax and standing alone with David Cameron in his opposition to it, particularly when there is now a sea change throughout Europe whereby people are demanding a fair way of dealing with the economic crisis stating clearly that continued austerity and cuts being imposed on the least well off sectors of our society is failing disastrously and we need a new direction if we are to get ourselves out of the current economic crisis?</p>
            <p eId="para_309">My next question is on the fiscal treaty and the Taoiseach's discussions with David Cameron and his views on this given what has happened.  I have very serious differences at almost every level with the politics of Prime Minister Cameron, but at least the British Prime Minister had the sense not to sign up to the fiscal treaty.  Now he is being joined by forces throughout Europe in France, Holland, Greece, Spain and Portugal with huge movements on the street saying enough and that this is madness.  The austerity approach is a disastrous failure and is making the situation worse not better and we must abandon this approach in favour of promoting jobs and growth and not continuing down a disastrous road of institutionalised austerity as proposed in the fiscal treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_310">David Cameron had enough sense to recognise how stupid it was to put this level of control over economic policy into the hands of the EU Commission and the European Central Bank, and how detrimental it could be to the British economy and to British citizens to be locked into this type of policy in perpetuity as the treaty proposes.  Now people and political leaders throughout Europe are coming to the realisation that the treaty and the approach contained in it of austerity for years to come is a failure and must be abandoned.  Why does the Taoiseach continue down this road?  Did he speak to David Cameron and ask him why he chose not to support the fiscal treaty?  Will he speak to the political parties which won the day in France and Greece and to the burgeoning movement of opposition to the insane logic of the fiscal treaty throughout Europe and ask them why they have a radically different approach from the one that seems to be favoured by him and Angela Merkel?</p>

Unless it applies internationally we will not support it.  I spoke to Prime Minister Cameron about the question of support for the fiscal treaty.  I sat beside him at the meeting which went on all night.  He gave his reasons for not being able to support it, which had nothing to do with what Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about.</p>

            <p eId="para_315">Deputy Boyd Barrett speaks about winning the day in other countries.  What people do in Greece, France or the regional elections in Germany or anywhere else is their business and I do not speak for them and neither does Deputy Boyd Barrett.  One can comment on the outcome.  The Deputy recognises of course that the problem will not go away and must be dealt with.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's proposition, about which he has been speaking for some time, is to tax the wealthy out of existence which means what he wants to do is introduce a measure to close a deficit of €10 billion in one year which, as I stated to Deputy Adams, would give a lethal injection to the Irish economy and kill off any potential investment which would lead to jobs and opportunities throughout the country.  I do not accept the Deputy's proposition.</p>
            <p eId="para_316">Nor do I say he is a man of straight answers, because in this House I asked him for straight answers about his conduct and that of his colleagues in Galway at the Labour Party convention.  Of course he did not see anything, hear anything or know anything, yet he gives straight answers.  St. Michael's College did not teach him that I am sure, so I do not know where he is headed in this regard.  I reject his proposition completely.  If he wants to spell out to the nation during the course of the next three weeks where he proposes to get the €10 billion he speaks about I would like to hear it.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's colleague in the corner wants to raise €400 million from legalising cannabis while he wants to tax everybody out of existence at 75% or 80% on €100,000 which would drive every investor out of the country and prevent anyone else from coming in here.  His proposition for a "No" vote based on his proposition and that of his colleagues in UKIP and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group would be catastrophic for Ireland.</p>

He thinks that denouncing as a fantasy alternative ways of financing this society that are fairer and more progressive is an adequate explanation.  It is not.  People want fairness in how this issue is dealt with.  The figures were provided in the United Left Alliance's pre-budget submission, in which we outlined where we would get €10 billion.  Instead of attacking vulnerable sectors of our society and working people who spend their money in the economy and help to keep it going, we clearly set out how we should tax those with obscene amounts of wealth, who are hoarding it in banks and are not spending it in the economy.  Taxing them would not do any damage to our economy.  What is damaging our economy is attacking low and middle income earners, allowing the decimation of our small and medium enterprise sector through excessive rates and rents and slashing the income of people who buy in the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_330">On this fiscal treaty, the Taoiseach did not tell us what reasons Prime Minister David Cameron gave for not supporting the treaty.

It means that opportunity for our young people can be grown by decisive action at Government level here and as part of the European growth agenda.  Deputy Boyd Barrett will be aware that President Van Rompuy has called a European growth summit for 23 May.  I have dealt with some of the issues Deputy Martin raised which will be central to that agenda and which will have an impact on the European Union, the Single Market and the potential for industries here to create further jobs in the export market.

He does not mention the fact that the consumer index of confidence is up for the fourth month, that growth has returned to the Irish economy, albeit on a small scale, for the first time in a number of years or the fact that employment has stabilised and that there are signs of confidence among businesses that matters will improve.  They can only improve if we keep our confidence level high and prove it by decisiveness on the part of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_338">In this case, there is a decision to be made by the Irish people.  It has nothing to do with Greece, France or the regional elections in Germany.  This is a decision for the Irish people and we are well able to make that decision.  I am asking the people to decide very positively that they know where our future lies, that is, in being a strong partner with Europe and having access to all that goes with that.  A "Yes" vote guarantees that confidence and that future.  A "No" vote will lead us down the road of lack of confidence, strangling investment and the austerity I am quite sure the Deputy would love to see abound in this country.  We will change that.  With the help and support of the people we will set out a platform for growth, opportunity and investment not for anybody here, but for the next generation.  That is important.  This is about the bigger picture.  What Deputy Boyd Barrett is painting is a society of conflict and aggression.  That is not what is needed in Ireland.  The Irish people will make their decision on 31 May and I expect it to be overwhelmingly positive.</p>

            <p eId="para_339">The Irish financial services sector employs approximately 30,000 people in this country, particularly in Dublin.  We do not control the world and one of our first priorities must be to protect employment in the financial services sector, but that is dependent on what happens at international level.  In the context of the recent strategy that was published and, indeed, some discussions that were held at Farmleigh, a transaction tax that was unilaterally imposed in a number of eurozone countries and not in the rest or that would not be uniformly applied across the globe would put the financial services sector at a disadvantage and could result in the loss of some of the thousands of jobs currently located in the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that this is the broad approach that has been adopted with regard to a transaction tax?</p>
            <p eId="para_340">Second, with regard to the Ballymurphy issue, I met with the Ballymurphy relatives in Ballymurphy when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  While it is important to meet them, it is important to do more than that.  Obviously I believe the Taoiseach should meet with the relatives but some work should be done in advance of such meetings to try to identify the precise nature of an inquiry.  One could hold many different types of inquiry.  This issue has not really moved forward over a number of years.  It is important not to give people false hope, but to define the issues and perhaps get some type of an initial scoping inquiry together.  There must be a common approach agreed by all, particularly the relatives, as to what is the first step to take in moving this agenda forward.  One meeting after another does not necessarily move it forward, unless we can put some shape or flesh on the bone in terms of how best to proceed given the difficulties that surround us.  We have just discussed the logjam with the Finucane case, which I consider unacceptable.  The Ballymurphy issue deserves investigation.  It was an appalling event and demands a response.  Members must try to put on their thinking caps as to the type of response that could be developed to succeed in achieving progress beyond simply meeting people.  I share this thought with the Taoiseach and ask him to comment on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_341">As for the promissory note issue, I note in his reply that the Taoiseach stated he informed the British Prime Minister and explained to him the Government's proposals on re-engineering the promissory note.  It appears that with all the political discourse on this issue and between the various claims and counter-claims, something is missing in this regard.  In the current context, an opportunity should be seized to have a serious political discussion with a view to getting a resolution of this issue, rather than having it kicked down the road at each key milestone associated with the promissory note, elements of which are unacceptable.  It was agreed in advance of the creation of the European financial stability facility, EFSF, when the previous Government was obliged to agree certain issues with the European Central Bank.  While this was agreed in advance of any European facility, I note we have moved a long way from that position in respect of the EFSF and now potentially the European Stability Mechanism, as well as the call of other countries, including France, that bank debt should be dealt with through the European institutions and not necessarily by the taxpayers of member states.  I believe Ireland is owed one in respect of resolution of this issue and given present circumstances, there is a need to raise this matter at a political level in a much more substantive way than has been the case to date.  More than simply informing and explaining, so doing should entail actually enlisting the support of other Heads of State to move institutions across Europe on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_342">On the last matter, Deputy Martin is aware of the position in so far as Britain is concerned.  I thought it important to apprise the Prime Minister of the position in so far as Ireland and its negotiations were concerned.  Clearly, the question of the dates that are set for the recurrence of the payments is an issue.  Suffice it to say, however, the Government is well aware of the scale of the negotiations that must be carried out regarding the other €27 billion involved in this issue.  As I stated to Deputy Martin, I already have made plain the Government seeks a lower interest rate over a longer period, which would allow it to deal with its deficit and would make it easier for the State to pay its debts.</p>
            <p eId="para_343">It is true the IFSC is an important element of the economy with more than 30,000 people employed.  The report I launched last year, which was prepared by the industry itself, indicated the creation of up to 10,000 jobs within five years, some of which would deal with new financial products, such as green finance or the fast-growing Islamic finance sector and so on.  As Deputy Martin has pointed out, one would place significant elements of this industry at serious competitive disadvantage were a transaction tax applicable here and not in London.  For this reason, the Government has made clear its position in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_344">In respect of the Ballymurphy case, I note that 40 years have elapsed and  questions have been raised over the years in this regard.  There is merit in the Deputy's suggestion that perhaps some preparatory work should be done here.  The request from the Ballymurphy families to the British Government was for an independent international inquiry into the circumstances of the Ballymurphy incident.  However, the Secretary of State, Mr. Paterson, has informed the families it is not the intention of the British Government to carry out or initiate such an inquiry and I take note of that point.  Obviously, I will fix an appropriate time to meet the Ballymurphy families when I next go to Belfast.  I thank the Deputy for the suggestion.</p>

            <p eId="para_347">Tá fhios agam agus deanfaidh mé mo dhícheall.  I acknowledge the Taoiseach has raised the issues of Ballymurphy, Pat Finucane and the Dublin-Monaghan bombings with the British Prime Minister, which I appreciate and for which I thank him.  However, it has not worked and we are no further on in respect of the aforementioned campaigns.  As for the Ballymurphy case, the British Secretary of State did get in touch recently with the relatives regarding Ballymurphy but rejected the notion of an international inquiry.  The families do not seek an international inquiry, because they are conscious of the associated costs, but seek an independent international investigation.  In the case of Pat Finucane, the British Government concedes there was collusion, with the person who supplied the information, the person who supplied the gun and the person who carried out the shooting all being agents of the British Crown.  I will not rehearse the argument again concerning the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Consequently, the reason I gave the example of the report given to Tony Blair when he was Prime Minister is the Government here has enough information.  The Taoiseach might know more about these issues than does Mr. Cameron.  He simply may not know and I commend an approach in which the Taoiseach meets Mr. Cameron again on foot of the latter having received from the Government the detailed reports on all these issues that are available.  Teachta Martin is correct that he attended Ballymurphy and walked part of the site there.  Was that three years ago?</p>

Were the Taoiseach to adopt the approach of getting from his key civil servants the information in the Government's possession and presenting it to the British Prime Minister, he would have the capacity to persuade him and in so doing bring a huge amount of healing to people who have had a severe injustice perpetrated on them just up the road in west Belfast.</p>

In his response, does the Taoiseach seriously suggest there simply will be no taxes imposed on the bankers, speculators and so on, whose casino and gambling activities caused the crisis in the first place, but they all will be imposed on working people and the least well-off?

            <p eId="para_354">On the point made by Deputy Adams, I am unsure whether there is much of a difference between an international investigation and an international inquiry.  Once one starts an investigation, it turns into an inquiry.  I am unsure of the reasons behind the decision of the Secretary of State to inform the families this was not the case and nor am I aware of the extent of the file that exists on the Ballymurphy circumstances in Departments here.  Perhaps there may be some additional information the Deputy may have from personal experience of this over the years.  However, I will examine this point.</p>

            <p eId="para_360">I have made this point to the Deputy many times already but the Government did not cut primary social protection rates.  It has removed 330,000 people from the universal social charge obligations.  Moreover, another 30,000 people benefited from the reversal of the minimum wage rate on foot of negotiations with the troika and a range of exemptions are in place in this regard.  However, the answer is employment and this is the reason the Government is focused on the action plan for jobs and on opening up such opportunities, providing retraining, upskilling and a change of direction, as well as on the JobBridge and Pathways to Work programmes and so on, for as many people as possible.  As I pointed out earlier, 11,000 additional jobs have resulted in the food and hospitality sector because of the change in the PRSI rate for lower-paid workers, as well as the reduction in the VAT rate in the hospitality sector.</p>

Like everyone else, I, too, am concerned about child protection.  As Deputy Martin will be aware, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is doing a great deal of work on the mandatory requirement to report, the incorporation into legislation of the children first guidelines and on the proposed referendum on children's rights.  My preference would be to hold this referendum in the autumn.  However, the Bill is not yet ready owing to the complexity of work involved.  I will keep the House updated on this matter.  I do not believe it would be possible to hold the referendum on children's rights alongside another referendum.  It should be held on its own.

            <from>Deputy Seán Kyne</from>
            <p eId="para_412">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for the Topical Issue Debate and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who will take it.  Next week is the closing date for the single payment forms and there is a certain amount of anxiety in my area of west Galway, in particular in Connemara, in regard to the changes in the stocking rate eligibility for the disadvantaged areas scheme, that is, the increase from 0.15 to 0.3 livestock units per hectare.  I have explained to many people at IFA meetings and elsewhere that there is an appeals mechanism and that for areas of Connemara and for farmers in Connermara who are farming commage land, SAC or other designated land and, indeed, environmentally sensitive land that a lower stocking rate will be allowed, that is, lower than the 0.3 livestock units per hectare.  Will the Minister of State provide that reassurance to farmers in Connemara that this appeals mechanism is there?</p>
            <p eId="para_413">In terms of a time line, I am concerned that applications from farmers caught between the 0.15 and 0.3 livestock units per hectare will be left and that it will be Christmas before they receive payments.  They need to be fast-tracked in some way over the summer to ensure these delays do not take place in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_414">Last Thursday my constituency colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, made comments that what should have happened to save money was that certain dairy farmers should have been excluded from eligibility for the disadvantaged areas scheme.  He said large dairy farmers but he did not specify what he meant by "large".  There are no dairy farmers in Connemara but there are many in east Galway and the eastern part of west Galway in good farming areas such as Athenry, Carnmore, Oranmore, Turloughmore and Claregalway.  I am hugely concerned that this is Deputy Ó Cuív's view.  Dairy farmers should be reassured that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and this Government will protect those farmers in terms of receiving their disadvantaged areas scheme payments.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#" eId="spk_203">
            <from>Deputy Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine ( Shane McEntee)</from>
            <p eId="para_415">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and if there is any question I cannot answer, I will come back to him.  The changes to the rules governing the 2012 disadvantaged areas scheme have recently been published by my Department.  I can also confirm that booklets outlining the terms and conditions of the 2012 scheme are being issued to all farmers with DAS-designated land.  However, as these proposals have yet to be approved by the EU Commission, they may be subject to change.  That said, however, it should be appreciated that should this prove to be the case, the changes will not impose any additional obligations on farmers in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_416">In so far as the specific issue of the stocking rates and the appeals mechanism, as mentioned by the Deputy, is concerned, I can confirm that the requirements under the 2012 scheme are as follows.  In the first instance, an applicant is required to have met a stocking density in 2011, for three consecutive months, of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare.  Thereafter, while the minimum stocking density remains at 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare for 2012, the applicant must meet the minimum stocking requirement for six consecutive months during the scheme year.  In addition, the applicant is also required to meet an annual stocking density average of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare, which will be calculated over the 12 months of the scheme year.</p>
            <p eId="para_417">However, specific provision is being made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011 where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to a lower stocking requirement of an agri-environmental measure such as a commonage framework de-stocking plan, the rural environmental protection scheme or the agri-environment options scheme.  All applicants whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011 will be written to formally by my Department and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.  The principles of <i>force majeure</i>-exceptional circumstances will be provided for in the process.  Provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.  This process will be commenced as soon as the EU Commission makes a formal decision on the proposed changes to Ireland’s rural development programme, including the disadvantaged areas scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_418">An increasing number of applicants under the scheme have discontinued cattle or sheep farming, but have continued to benefit from aid under the scheme by grazing some horses on their land.  It is proposed that horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation on the basis that these applicants' contribution to the rural economy is minimal.  However, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy.  My officials have engaged with horse industry representatives and have agreed on criteria that will mean that those equine breeding enterprises, irrespective of their size, that are making a valuable contribution to the local economy will continue to receive support.</p>
            <p eId="para_419">It is widely recognised that the disadvantaged areas scheme is an important one, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland's total land area.  From an economic perspective, the scheme is particularly significant and contributes to the support of in excess of 100,000 farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet, cold climate conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_420">The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 scheme will be reduced from €220 million to €190 million.  To achieve this €30 million saving, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the scheme's eligibility criteria for 2012.  The savings will be achieved without the need to reduce the existing rates of aid and, in addition, there will also be no reduction in the maximum area payable, that is, 34 hectares.</p>
            <p eId="para_421">The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the payments under the scheme are focused on farmers who farm exclusively in disadvantaged areas, make a significant contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and contribute to the enhancement of the environment.  My firm intention is that the aid should be focused on those farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in less favourable areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_422">I thank the Minister of State for his comments and I welcome the decision not to reduce the rate of payment or the qualifying hectares for the scheme.  In 2009, the last Government reduced payments to all farmers under the disadvantaged areas scheme and many farmers in Connemara with large hectarages of poor quality land endured reductions of more than €1,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_423">I also welcome the Minister of State's remark that farmers will be written to formally by his Department and given an opportunity to apply for derogations on the grounds that their participation in one of the measures in question resulted in lowering their stocking rates.  It is important that this be done as soon as possible.  The sooner they are written to and told that they can apply for derogations because of restrictions under commonage framework plans or the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, or because they farm in sensitive areas, the sooner they can submit their responses and the more likely it is that their payments will issue in the autumn without delay and in time with payments to other farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_424">I have little to say in response.  The Minister and I are committed to encouraging and paying farmers to farm.  The stocking rate will make a difference to the amount of stock that farmers can carry and to the environment itself.  That there are few animals in some of the areas to which the Deputy referred has caused problems, for example, forestry and gorse fires.  The proposed changes will help.  In terms of the CAP proposals, we want to get our way, look after farmers who want to farm and protect those in less advantaged areas.</p>

          <speech by="#RobertDowds" eId="spk_206">
            <from>Deputy Robert Dowds</from>
            <p eId="para_425">In one of my first contributions in the Dáil, I asked the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to investigate the possibility of banning the sale of drinks in glass containers from off-licences.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, agreed to consider the suggestion.  Unfortunately, he discovered that an EU directive prevented him from implementing it.  I am now approaching the problem from a different direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_426">Would it be possible to introduce a system - in the case of glass, reintroduce a system - of providing refunds?  If people bought bottles of beer, they could return them once they were empty and receive refunds.  In some countries on the Continent, for example, Germany, the practice is to return plastic bottles.  The plastic used there is much stronger than the type we use, making it possible to clean and reuse them without breaking them down.  It should be possible to do the same in Ireland.  Would it be possible to provide refunds in respect of aluminium cans?  Doing so might be more problematic, but I would be interested in the Minister of State's response.</p>
            <p eId="para_427">I am not trying to pretend that this would be the entire solution to our litter problem.  In these difficult economic times, however, it would encourage people who discard these receptacles in public places not to do so.  It would also encourage people to collect receptacles.  Perhaps this is just a straw in the wind.  I was asked to raise the issue a couple of weeks ago by the local Clondalkin Tidy Towns committee.  In Clondalkin and the neighbouring areas of Palmerstown and Lucan, there are growing numbers of groups that are trying to set up tidy district committees with some considerable success.  There is a long tradition of this in rural areas and villages, but it is more difficult to organise in a city.  A measure along the lines of what I have proposed would help the committees.  People would become less likely to discard their rubbish and, if they did, others who collected it would receive payment.  I thank everyone who gets involved in tidy district initiatives in such a selfless way.</p>
            <p eId="para_428">My suggestion would have a number of advantages for my community and the country generally.  It would help to tidy up the country and would constitute a green move, in that glass, plastic and aluminium could be more effectively recycled.  It would help to boost tourism, given the fact that litter and dirt are the most persistent causes of complaints among tourists.  Life would be much easier for sports people and everyone who uses open public areas.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_429">I thank Deputy Dowds for raising this issue.  The 2010 national litter pollution monitoring system report indicated that glass and plastic containers accounted for 2.86% of the country's national litter composition.  Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on packaging and packaging waste, termed the packaging directive, classifies items such as bottles, drink cans and plastic containers as packaging.  The packaging directive is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products that they have placed on the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_430">Under the directive, Ireland's requirement to achieve a 60% recovery rate for packaging waste in 2011 has already been exceeded and, in 2010, a recovery rate of 74% was achieved.  The material-specific recycling targets of 60% for glass, 50% for metals and 22.5% for plastics had also been achieved by 2010, with recycling rates of 78%, 63% and 39%, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_431">I fully recognise that, despite progress on recycling, we need to continue to improve our performance, which is the Deputy's point.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to drive a waste reduction programme as part of the overall policy in the area of sustainable waste management.  One of the possible elements of this waste reduction strategy, which is contained in the programme, is the introduction of a levy on packaging.  In 2011 my Department commenced a process of consultation with industry, other stakeholders and the public on the possibility of introducing a levy on packaging.  The main issues examined in this initial consultation were as follows - the overall views of stakeholders on a packaging levy; how a packaging levy might be operated; international experiences of similar levies; and how a packaging levy might be structured in order to contribute to a reduction in packaging waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_432">While submissions acknowledged the achievements Ireland has made in recycling packaging, there is recognition that aspects of the current system need to be reviewed, as is best practice for all long-standing agreements, to ensure that the structure remains as efficient as possible and continues to deliver the best possible results for Ireland in terms of packaging recycling and recovery performance.  To this end, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has determined that the issue should be given further consideration in the context of a review of the producer responsibility initiative model to inform the policy development process which is now under way and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.  It may be useful to include the Deputy's views in the review and I would be happy to pass his comments to the Minister.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RobertDowds" eId="spk_208">
            <from>Deputy Robert Dowds</from>
            <p eId="para_433">I am glad that progress has been made in dealing with packaging waste but problems remain.  The angle from which I approach the issue is my concern about waste in public areas such as football pitches, where broken glass can cause problems for players.  It is appalling that people who give up their time to train soccer teams must carefully walk the pitch before a match starts to clear it of glass.  I would welcome any initiative that tries to put an end to that problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_434">I do not dispute the impressive figures on waste reduction but I urge the Minister of State and the Minister to consider a refund system that would encourage people to recycle glass and plastic bottles.  It could become an effective means of reusing material.  People are more open to this idea than they were during the boom years of the Celtic tiger, when they did not care about small amounts of money.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State is prepared to take account of my suggestions in the review and I would like them to be part of the mix.</p>

            <p eId="para_435">The concept of a deposit and refund system can certainly be included In the review.  Everybody would agree it is dreadful that people have to ensure the grounds used for sporting or community events, or for children's play, are clear of broken glass bottles and other litter.  We want to do all we can in this regard and if a deposit and refund scheme can be shown to be effective in reducing the amount of material thrown away rather than recycled, it would make a positive impact.  If the Deputy wishes to submit his views in more detail I am sure they will be considered in the review.</p>

            <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy</from>
            <p eId="para_436">There have been numerous discussions around commemoration ceremonies in recent times.  I welcome the opportunity to raise the role of women and the contribution they made to Irish society in our turbulent past.  I am sad to note there is scant acknowledgement of those brave and patriotic women who, alongside their men, fought for Irish freedom in different ways, some as pacifists and others as militants.  Even in a recent supplement on the Home Rule Bill in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the 13 contributors and staff writers, all of whom were male, made little reference to the role played by women.  None of the articles was dedicated to this subject.</p>
            <p eId="para_437">I wish to focus on the events of 1912, when votes for women became entangled with the Irish Home Rule Bill introduced in Westminster.  Irish and English feminists came to the issue from differing perspectives.  Most women and men in Ireland were Nationalists who wanted home rule.  Most Irish feminists wanted votes for women in an Irish Parliament of one kind or another.  However, Irish Unionist women and men did not support home rule and both Unionists and English feminists wanted the vote in the UK Parliament.</p>
            <p eId="para_438">What outraged feminists here and in England was the attitude taken by the Prime Minister, Herbert Henry Asquith, and the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, John Redmond.  I do not blame them.  In a conversation with Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, the deputy leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, John Dillon, stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_439">Women's suffrage will, I believe, be the ruin of our Western civilisation.  It will destroy the home, challenging the headship of man, laid down by God.  It may come in your time - I hope not in mine.</p>
            <p eId="para_440">It is no wonder they were cross.</p>
            <p eId="para_441">A mass meeting was held in June 1912 at which 19 women's organisations were represented.  Patience finally ran out and some of the members of the Irish Women's Franchise League smashed windows at the GPO, Dublin Castle and the Custom House.  Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and Margaret Cousins were sent to jail and Mary Leigh and Gladys Evans, who were members of an English organisation, the Women's Social and Political Union, were sentenced to five years imprisonment for disrupting the Prime Minister and went on hunger strike in Mountjoy Prison.  Forcible feeding was practised in England at the time and there was considerable debate on the issue.  Augustine Birrell, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_442">Personally I am dead against forcible feeding which always ends with the release of the prisoner long before her time. I want to keep these ladies under lock and key for five years and I am quite willing to feed them with Priest's Champagne and Michaelmas Geese all the time if it can be done ... but these wretched hags ... are obstinate to the point of death.</p>
            <p eId="para_443">No fewer than 36 women were imprisoned during this campaign and many of them went on hunger strike for political status.  We should not forget these wonderful women and what they achieved.  Margaret Cousins put it well when she stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_444">I am not a criminal but a political prisoner - my motives were neither criminal nor personal - being wholly associated with the agitation to obtain Votes for Women.  I shall fight in every way in my power against being branded a criminal.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht  (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_446">I thank Deputy Corcoran Kennedy for raising this subject and commend her academic and professional treatment of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_447">The introduction of the third Home Rule Bill to Parliament at Westminster on 11 April 1912 was a pivotal moment in our history.  This Bill is the point of departure for the centenary commemorative programme which will take place over the coming decade and which will centre on the proclamation of the Irish Republic at Easter 1916.  With the introduction of the Home Rule Bill, a series of events gathered pace that culminated in the establishment of this State.  It was a period of profound change for Ireland, Britain, Europe and the wider world.  States and societies were transformed and the outcomes have shaped the world we know today.</p>
            <p eId="para_448">It is my intention that the commemorative programme will address the key political events and, most important, provide a comprehensive presentation of the economic, social and cultural issues of the period.  It is appropriate that we keep these events in mind as their centenaries approach.  A centenary anniversary is of special significance.  It is perhaps the earliest opportunity for a generation without direct contact with the period to assess the historic events and their consequences.  A more balanced and informed understanding can be achieved than is possible in the aftermath of such profound changes.  It can also be expected that a better understanding of the issues and circumstances will be assisted by the release of records and the progress of research over the years.  I believe that this may particularly be the case with regard to the roles and contributions of women in the revolutionary period.  With some distinguished exceptions, the role of women has not always been fully recognised over this period.  I hope that this may be redressed in the commemorative programme.  With this in mind, in discussions with colleagues with regard to the composition of the expert advisory group emphasis was placed on the need for particular consideration to be given to women's history, experience and contribution throughout the period.</p>
            <p eId="para_449">The initial events of the official commemorative programme this year related to Carson and Redmond and were arranged around the anniversary of the Home Rule Bill.  In these presentations, it was noted that the Home Rule debate was not insulated from the other issues of the day.  This perception was particularly reflected in the photograph presented in March to the First Minister of Northern Ireland following the Carson lecture in Dublin.  The photograph shows Sir Edward Carson being confronted by suffragette protestors at Iveagh House in 1912 while he was campaigning to resist the Home Rule Bill.  The suffragettes were very prominent in political demonstrations of the time and were doubtless also involved in the hostile reception given to Winston Churchill in Belfast that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_450">It is not unique to Ireland that the pages of history are dominated by the political and military headlines that define a period.  The progress of society in the same period in matters of employment, migration, health and education does not often provide the equivalent moments and anniversaries that facilitate commemoration.  Nonetheless, these issues are of fundamental importance, essential to an informed understanding of the period.</p>
            <p eId="para_451">The transformation of society by the Reform Acts of the 19th century, incrementally extending the franchise for men, brought a consciousness of future possibilities for all.  It has been suggested that the Representation of the People Act 1832, which specified that only "male persons" were to vote, was the first explicit statutory bar to women's suffrage and itself a trigger to campaigning for equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_452">New Zealand was the first nation in the world to achieve universal suffrage in 1893 and Australia followed in 1902.  The campaign for reform in Britain and Ireland reflected this growing consciousness of the times.  The Women's Social and Political Union was founded in Manchester in 1903 by six women, including Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, who soon emerged as the group's leaders.</p>
            <p eId="para_453">The Irish Women's Franchise League was founded in 1908 by Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington.  Members pursued their campaign through civil disobedience, demonstration and protest - commonly including, as the Deputy mentioned, window breaking.  Arrests and imprisonment resulted in hunger strike, for which the authorities introduced release under the Prisoner's (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act, followed in due course by re-arrest.  The campaign for voting rights brought interaction with the other issues of the day and during the 1913 lockout suffragists worked in Liberty Hall, providing food for the families of the strikers.</p>
            <p eId="para_454">As with the Home Rule Bill, the progress of the campaign for voting equality was overtaken by the coming of the Great War.  However, the experience of the war - both the horrors for men fighting at the front and the experience of the women mobilised to sustain industry and output at home - ensured that the future would be different from the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_455">The Representation of the People Act 1918 extended the franchise to men over 21 and women over 30 with certain conditions.  With this restriction women accounted for approximately 43% of the electorate and would otherwise have been in the majority owing to the loss of men in the war.  Following the passing of the Representation of the People Act, the Eligibility of Women Act was passed, allowing women to be elected into Parliament.  The first election held under the new system was the 1918 general election.  Polling took place in December 1918.  Several women stood for election.  However, only one, Constance Markievicz, was elected for the constituency of Dublin St. Patrick's.</p>
            <p eId="para_456">Perhaps the final vindication of the suffragette campaign came with the provision of the 1922 Irish Free State Constitution which, in theory at least, removed the limitations on Irish women's access to the full rights of citizenship.  It was to the detriment of our society that this provision of the 1922 Constitution was the last real advancement of the rights of women for the following half century.</p>
            <p eId="para_457">Mindful of their campaign sustained to 1918, I am confident that the campaign for women's voting rights and the activities of the suffragettes in Ireland will be a consistent consideration in the commemorative programme.  The events planned for later this year focus on the signing of the Ulster Covenant and the associated Declaration which was signed by a 250,000 women.  As the commemorative programme continues, I would be very pleased to see initiatives that bring attention to the suffragettes' campaign and the other activities of women in this historic decade.</p>

            <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy</from>
            <p eId="para_458">I thank the Minister for his response.  We need to increase awareness and highlight the role of women in Irish history, including the impact and contribution they made to the political, academic, economic, social and cultural life of the country.  From the Minister's response it is clear that this is the year for us to take the opportunity to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_459">I wish to acknowledge the input of my friend, Margaret Hogan, an historian from Birr, County Offaly, who gave me some material on this and enabled me to give an accurate account of what happened at that time.  I will be parochial to relate an interesting story.  Some of the prisoners were moved from Dublin to take the political heat from them.  They were moved to Tullamore, County Offaly.  It was reported that in 1913 the Tullamore Urban Council passed a resolution demanding political treatment for Irish suffragette prisoners.</p>

            <p eId="para_460">The Deputy will have an ideal opportunity to do something in June to mark that occasion.  I am chairman of the decade of commemorations committee and I would be delighted to do something through the committee with the Deputy.  If she can suggest an event and a location we can certainly do that following her initiative today in raining the matter in the House.  I am sure the committed would be delighted to accommodate her.</p>
            <p eId="para_461">Women's rights and the suffragette movement were specifically mentioned when we were appointing the academic advisory group.  We added a number of experts to the advisory committee, including one in particular who has a special interest in the area of women's rights and the suffragette movement to cover precisely the issue the Deputy has highlighted.  I can talk to the Deputy about organising an event to coincide with the anniversary of what happened in June 1912.</p>

          <heading>Community Employment Schemes</heading>
          <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_214">
            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
            <p eId="para_462">I welcome the opportunity to raise the impact the cutbacks in community employment schemes will have on child-care provision services, particularly for those in receipt of the one-parent family payment who are working on community employment schemes.  There are 1,288 community child-care facilities, many of them heavily subsidised and many operating in very socially and economically disadvantaged areas.  Approximately 20% of the 8,200 employees in these facilities are community employment workers.  This means that approximately 2,000 people who are involved in community child-care facilities are community employment scheme workers.  Approximately 70% of those people are lone parents.  It is important to consider any change the Government makes in this area because it will have a disproportionate impact on lone parents working on community employment schemes, which have been cut as a result of the recent changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_463">In the budget in December, and in the Social Welfare Bill that was then introduced by the Minister for Social Protection, changes to the community employment scheme for lone parents make it less attractive for single parents to stay on community employment schemes.  Until recently, lone parents participating in community employment schemes could keep their one parent family payment, as well as receiving the community employment payment of €208 per week.  Since January, they must give up one of these payments.  Since then, we have seen people whose terms have ended on community employment schemes leaving those schemes and very few lone parents are now applying to start the schemes.  As a result, many schemes are now finding it difficult to recruit people to work in child care facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_464">It is the norm for the majority of one parent families to have some part-time work and such a person can earn up to €146 per week and retain the entire allowance or earn up to €450 per week while still keeping a small part of the one parent family payment.  A person earning €146 can keep the full payment of €188 per week.  I cannot understand why of all employees, the only group to which the rule does not apply is to those on community employment.  A person on community employment who earns more than €200 per week loses the entire entitlement to the one parent family payment.  If that person was working in a shop next door to the community employment scheme, or even working in a child care facility but employed directly by the facility, she could earn more than €200 per week while keeping most of the one parent family payment.  If she happens to be on a community employment scheme, however, she will see her income cut.  It is discrimination, singling out the one parent family parent who is participating in the community employment scheme.  It is also having a detrimental impact on child care facilities around the country.  What has the Minister against one parent families and the community employment schemes?  The Minister is singling out those in receipt of the payment and on a community employment scheme for the biggest cut in income that does not apply to any other category of employment.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht  (Deputy Dinny McGinley)</from>
            <p eId="para_465">Tugaim buíochas don Teachta as an cheist seo a thógáil ag an am seo.</p>
            <p eId="para_466">There are currently 23,300 community employment places of which 2,200 places are ring-fenced for the delivery of child care services.  Over the years community employment has become a valuable resource in the provision of a range of services to communities, including child care services.  The total community employment expenditure on child care amounted to €29.4 million in 2011.  There has been no reduction in the number of community employment places dedicated to supporting child care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_467">The overall trend in demand for community employment places has not declined in recent months.  All participants on community employment receive at least €20 per week in excess of their original social welfare payment.  There are a large number of social welfare recipient categories eligible for community employment, for example, persons on jobseeker's allowance, as well as lone parents and community employment participation by lone parents is not restricted to child care projects.  Notwithstanding this, the participation of lone parents on community employment make a valuable contribution to child care provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_468">The Department is working closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in relation to strengthening child care provision at community level.  Child care support provided under community employment fully supports the Early Childhood Care and Education Framework.  While there is some indication that participation rates by lone parents have declined somewhat between January and March on community employment, it is too soon to say if this trend will continue.  The Department will be monitoring participation rates of all the cohorts on community employment to identify any impacts of the removal of double payments to lone parents and people with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_469">The one parent family payment is one of the range of social assistance payments available to people on limited means.  In the past in Ireland, income support for people of working age, including the one parent family payment, has been passive in nature, with little systematic engagement by the State with the customer.  This passive income support to people of working age is not now considered to be in the best interests of the recipient, of their children or of society.</p>
            <p eId="para_470">Lone parent families continue to experience higher rates of consistent poverty in comparison to the population generally.  EU-SILC figures published in November 2011 show that in 2010 9.3% of lone parents in Ireland were experiencing consistent poverty, compared to 7% of two-parent households and to 6.2% of the population as a whole.  This indicates that the long-term income support that the one parent family payment scheme provided up to 2011, until children were aged 18, or 22 if in full-time education, to lone parents without any requirement for them to engage in employment, education or training was not effective in addressing the poverty and social exclusion experienced by some of these families.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">The Department of Social Protection considers that the best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment.  Work, and especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of young children.  However, supporting parents to participate in the labour market, once their children have reached an appropriate age, will improve both their own economic situation and the social well-being of themselves and of their families.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
            <p eId="para_472">I also wanted to point out the benefits of people participating in this scheme.  Until now, they were able to get FETAC qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_473">I note the Minister of State mentioned there are indications that participation rates by lone parents declined between January and March.  The change was introduced in January and it had an immediate effect, which has continued for the subsequent three months for which there are figures.  The decline is continuing still.  Logic dictates that if we cut the payments of people on these schemes, fewer people will offer to go forward.   The Minister of State's script also pointed out that the level of consistent poverty among lone parents is 9.3% compared to 6.2% in the population as a whole.  Consistent poverty, in other words, is 50% higher among lone parents.  The Minister's response is to help them out of poverty by cutting their payments.  I do not understand that logic.  Perhaps I am stupid but I do not get how the Minister can say a group has the highest level of consistent poverty and to help that group, she will cut their payments.  The Minister of State claimed this will improve their financial independence.  It will remove their dependence on the State but the Minister seems to think there is a pot of gold there for them to earn money somewhere else, allowing them to be financially independent.</p>
            <p eId="para_474">Two reviews of community employment are under way.  Has the Minister considered as part of those reviews the impact of cut-backs on the one parent family payment recipients?  Will they cover the impact of the cuts to child care schemes?  Will the Minister of State consider the value of the training offered by these schemes until now?</p>
            <p eId="para_475">The training and materials allocations have been cut while the reviews are under way.  The schemes are now holding back from allowing people to go on training courses because they do not know what the budget will be for the rest of the year.  Effectively, at local level within many of the schemes, approval to take up a training scheme or training day or week has been suspended because this review is continuing.  I ask that it be concluded, the results published and the funding restored to the training and materials budget as urgently as possible.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_476">I stated in my original reply that there are, nationally, 23,300 community employment schemes of which 2,200 are specifically ring-fenced for the delivery of child care services.  I understand that, as of April, there were 1,792 participants in ring-fenced child care places in community employment schemes.  That is a significant number.  I also stated there was some indication that participation rates for lone parents declined somewhat between January and March.  We cannot be more specific than that at present but the situation is being monitored.  Within the resources available, the Government places a high premium on the provision of child care places, given that 2,200 are already ring-fenced.  The situation will be monitored as the year progresses.</p>

        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Minister for Education and Skills  (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_478">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Almost three years ago, this House passed a unanimous motion following the publication of the Ryan report, sincerely apologising to the victims of childhood abuse for the failure to intervene, detect their pain and come to their rescue.  It accepted all the recommendations of the Ryan report and supported their full implementation, recognising that the victims of these appalling abuses must be consulted on the forms of support they need and that supporting the victims and survivors must be the priority for all concerned.  The House called on the congregations to commit to making further substantial contributions by way of reparation, including towards a trust to be set up and managed by the State for the support of victims and for other education and welfare purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The primary aim of the Bill now before the House is to establish the residential institutions statutory fund which was proposed in the motion adopted after the publication of the Ryan report.  The statutory fund is a significant additional response to address the horrendous abuse of children that took place in residential institutions under the supervision of the State and run, in the main, by religious congregations.  It will fund the provision of counselling, health, education, housing and other services for victims of abuse in residential institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The publication of the Ryan report, with its catalogue of systemic abuse, shocked a nation that thought it was beyond being shocked.  The litany and scale of the abuse recounted by anguished voices caused us, as a people, to be ashamed and to apologise to those whose childhoods were stolen and who, in many instances, could not live full lives as adults.  The commission's conclusions were unequivocal and damning, detailing the failures of those who managed the institutions and the failure of the State to protect its vulnerable children.  Its report justified the decision to establish the residential institutions redress board to compensate survivors outside the court system.  The report's findings are an indictment of us all and it is our duty to ensure that the lessons of the past are learned and that such abuse is never repeated.  The scourge of abuse and the failure to deal with it promptly and adequately continues to afflict us in a variety of settings.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The Government is committed to fully implementing the Ryan report's recommendations.  Significant progress has been achieved and is detailed in the progress reports on 99 individual actions.  For example, the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been established and will be complemented by the new Child and Family Support Agency.  The new Children First national guidance was published last year; the heads of the Bill to put Children First on a statutory basis have been published recently along with the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012, and preparations for the children's rights referendum are on target.  Together these initiatives will help protect our children and ensure that the horrendous abuses suffered by so many are a thing of the past.  We all have a duty to protect children and to act when we know that children are at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">A comprehensive response has been put in place to address the abuse suffered by so many in residential institutions.  The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse afforded those who wanted an opportunity to tell their story to do so.  The Residential Institutions Redress Board provided financial awards.  While the board continues to process the remaining applications received, it is likely that some 15,000 former residents will receive awards.  The national counselling service and the family tracing service provided by Barnardos are other important elements of the State's response.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">As recommended in the Ryan report, the provision of a memorial to survivors is being pursued and I understand that the selection committee expects to announce the competition winner in June.  As I stated in the House during the debate three years ago, I believe the memorial should be a place of solace and reflection as well a significant reference back to a very different Ireland to which we must never return.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Many former residents continue to suffer the effects of the abuse they suffered as innocent children, even though this abuse may have taken place many years ago.  The establishment of the statutory fundis a further important element in the State's response.  While the redress schemedeals with the financial compensation for victims of institutional abuse, the statutory fundwill focus on meeting the ongoing needs of victims by funding the provision of a range of services.  This fund will be financed from the contributions offered by the congregations.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">As Deputies will be aware, the Government believes that the cost of the response to residential institutional abuse, now estimated to exceed €1.36 billion, should be shared on a 50:50 basis, between the State and those who were responsible for the management of institutions.  Under the 2002indemnity agreement,the 18 congregations contributed €128 million, in cash, property and counselling services.  Following the publication of the Ryan report, this House called on the congregations to provide further substantial contributions by way of reparation.  In their responses, the congregations offered cash of some €110 million and offered to transfer properties,mainly in the health and education sectors and which they valued at €235.5 million,to various State agencies and voluntary organisations.  With a 50:50 sharing requiring a contribution of €680 million, the congregations' offers fell short by some €200 million, even had all properties been acceptable and their values confirmed.  The Government identified 12 property offers, valued at some €60 million, to be of potential immediate benefit to the State and the transfer of these properties is being pursued.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">This House will be aware both of my disappointment at the offers made to date and that I continue to pursue the 50:50 division with the management bodies involved.  I have proposed the transfer of the ownership of the school infrastructure they possess, at no cost to the State, as one mechanism to allow those involved the opportunity to shoulder their share of the costs.  I reiterate in the House what I have stated many times outside it, namely, the schools that would be transferred into the ownership of the State would continue in their own ethos until the operators of the schools decide otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I renew the call I have made to congregations to deal with the issue of contributions in a generous and open manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I have made clear to them that I have no wish to bankrupt them and I acknowledge the important, positive role they have played in the development of Irish life and society, particularly in the area of education.  I also recognise the aging nature of those teaching communities.  That should not mean, however, that they do not have to face up to their responsibilities for their congregations' involvement in abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Returning to the statutory fund, which will be funded from the cash contributions received of up to €110 million, contributions of €21.05 million have been received and are held in an interest bearing account in the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Bill confirms the charitable status of these contributions and will facilitate the congregations' contributions.  While I expect that most congregations will forward their contributions on the establishment of the fund, I am engaging with some to clarify the exact timing of their contribution and expect to be in a position to confirm the position to the House as the Bill proceeds.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The Bill provides that former residents who received awards from the redress board or who received an award or settlement in court proceedings and who would otherwise have received an award from the redress board will be eligible to apply for assistance from the fund.  It is expected that some 15,000 former residents, whether living in Ireland or abroad, will successfully complete the redress process and be eligible to apply for services they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I am aware of demands to widen eligibility to include all former residents of scheduled institutions and to include relatives of former residents.  If eligibility were significantly widened to include, for example, all former residents of scheduled institutions, the amounts available to fund services for individuals could be greatly reduced and the effectiveness of the statutory fund would be put at risk.  Having regard to the maximum funds available, €110 million, and the potential pool of 15,000 applicants, our approach is correct.  The question of reviewing the eligibility under the statutory fund could, however, be considered following the establishment of the fund in the event of applications not resulting in a significant expenditure of the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Part 2 deals with the establishment of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, which will operate the fund.  I will appoint the board, which will comprise nine members, four of whom will be former residents of scheduled institutions.  The other members must include people who have knowledge of, and expertise on, the keeping of financial accounts and disbursement of funds, the management and administration of an organisation, or the provision of an approved service.  I intend to seek expressions of interest from suitably qualified and experienced persons for positions on the board and will ensure that the board is gender balanced, in so far as practical.  There is no provision for the payment of remuneration to members of the board although reasonable expenses may be approved.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The board will serve a maximum term or four years and individual members can be re-appointed but may not serve more than two consecutive terms.  As set out in section 7, the board will, in a manner that promotes the principles of equity, consistency and transparency, use the resources available to it to make arrangements for the provision of approved services to support the needs of former residents, and pay grants to former residents in order that they may avail of approved services.  The classes of services from which the board can determine the approved services to be provided are set out in section 8 and comprise mental health, counselling and psychological support services; health and personal social services; educational services; and housing support services, including adaptation or improvement of real property but not including financial aid for the purchase, mortgage or charge of real property.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Many of these services are already publicly available and eligible former residents may have an existing entitlement to receive them, whether living here or in other jurisdictions.  If a publicly funded service is already available, there is no need for the fund to be used.  If, however, there are restrictions on the availability of public services, for example where there are lengthy waiting lists or limits on grants, the fund may arrange for services to be provided.  The board will be conscious of the need to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of the resources available to it.  It will provide information regarding its functions and will evaluate the effectiveness of approved services.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Section 9 provides that the board will set out the criteria by reference to which it will make decisions on applications to it.  In determining criteria, the board will take account of the individual circumstances, including personal and financial circumstances, of eligible former residents.  It will also assess the likely effects of the provision of the service on the health and general well-being, personal and social development, educational development or the living conditions of former residents.  The board can apply financial limits to services or grants provided.  It can specify minimum standards to be met by service providers and the supporting evidence to be provided by applicants.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The board can also determine criteria for exceptional cases where the standard criteria may be disregarded in order to address cases of hardship.  All criteria determined by the board must be freely available.  In response to applications made to it by eligible former residents, the board may make an arrangement with a person, whether or not the person is resident in the State, for the provision of an approved service to support the needs of a former resident; and pay a grant to a former resident, to assist them to avail of an approved service.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The board will set out the procedures to be followed when making applications, when considering applications and when communicating with applicants of decisions.  Decisions on individual applications will be made by the chief executive or delegated staff member of the board.  An independent appeals process is provided for in sections 21<i> </i>and 22.  The appeals officer will be appointed by the Minister and the right of a person, including the board, to appeal a decision to the High Court on a point of law is provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The normal provisions relating to the conditions of employment for the staff of the board and the appeals officer are set out in the Bill and the chief executive is accountable to the board and can be called before the Committee of Public Accounts or Oireachtas committees.  Standard accounting and reporting arrangements will apply to the board.  As the administration costs of the board will be met from the investment account, every effort is being made to minimise the administration overhead.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Section 24 provides that the residential institutions redress board will furnish the board with the name, address and date of birth of recipients of awards.  The board can only use this information to determine if a person is eligible to make an application to the board.  This is a critically important feature of the Bill as it means that eligible persons will not be required to submit proofs of residency and abuse in an institution.  This measure reflects the wishes of many former residents to have an easy to use application process.  They do not have to go through the journey again.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The unauthorised disclosure of confidential information relating to a former resident is prohibited and constitutes an offence.  Similarly, the making of a false statement or provision of false information to avail of a grant or service is an offence.  Section 25 provides that public authorities will co-ordinate their activities with those of the board.  Provision is made that when requested to do so by the board, a public authority will nominate liaison officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Part 3 deals with financial matters.  An investment account will be established by the National Treasury Management Agency from which the board will be funded.  The contributions already received, together with any accrued interest, will be transferred to this account as well as further contributions received lodged thereto, up to a maximum of €110 million, excluding any associated interest.  The agency will advance to the board the sums needed to meet its expenditure and the expenses associated with the appeals process.  Any costs incurred by the agency will be met out of the investment account.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Standard provisions regarding accounts and audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General are provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Part 4 dissolves the Education Finance Board and transfers its functions to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board in relation to the moneys remaining from the €12.7 million contribution provided by the congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement.  The Education Finance Board advised me late last year that it expected its funds would be fully allocated on applications received by the end of November, 2011.  It publicised that it was not therefore in a position to process any applications received after that date and it continues to process its backlog of applications.  The current staff of the Education Finance Board will transfer to become employees of the new board.  The statutory fund will prepare final reports and accounts of the Education Finance Board which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The Bill does not include provisions in respect of the winding-up of the new statutory fund board.  While it is envisaged that the board will be dissolved when the moneys at its disposal are expended, the precise timing cannot be predicted and accordingly it would be preferable to introduce amending primary legislation to dissolve the board in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Part 5 deals with two issues.  Section 42 addresses the charitable status of contributions by charities which administered ran scheduled institutions.  It allows those charities to make cash contributions either to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund or as contributions towards the costs of the response to residential abuse and to transfer property to the Minister.  Such contributions and transfers are charitable gifts and as Minster, I can receive same, with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and may direct that properties be transferred to other Ministers, to the HSE or to a VEC.  The charities require the approval of the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland to sell properties and to use the proceeds to make contributions or to transfer properties.  The Commissioners are empowered to authorise property transfers as contributions towards the costs of redress.  They are also empowered to authorise the sale of properties to realise cash contributions towards the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund or as contributions towards the costs of the response to residential institutional abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">As Deputies will be aware, it is intended that cash contributions, in addition to those for the statutory fund, towards the costs of the response will be used for the national children's hospital.  I am satisfied that the provisions of this section will facilitate the making of contributions and the transfer of properties by congregations.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Section 43 amends the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 to allow the redress board to strike out applications and requests to accept late applications where directions of the board are not complied with.  The board is required to give at least 28 days notice of its intention to strike out such applications or requests.  Provision is also made to allow an applicant appeal to the review committee a decision of the board to strike out an application under section 13.  These provisions will allow the redress board to finalise cases currently on hand and it will assist in the planning for the winding-up of the board.  Every effort has been made to design an accessible scheme while operating in an efficient and effective manner.  This Bill is an important initiative to support victims of residential institutional abuse and I commend it to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I welcome the introduction of this Bill, the importance of which has been outlined in detail by the Minister.  The Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill 2012, provides for the establishment of a statutory fund to support the survivors of residential institutional child abuse, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board.  As the Minister said, this initiative follows on from the unanimous motion of this House approximately two years ago, following publication of the Ryan report.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">It is proposed that the board will oversee applications for assistance and make arrangements for the provision of approved services or grants to former residents.  The fund will be entirely financed by contributions from the religious congregations.  Eligibility for assistance from the fund is confined to those who received an award from the Residential Institutions Redress Board or who received an equivalent court settlement.  As outlined by the Minister, the Bill also provides for the dissolution of the Education Finance Board and the transfer of its functions to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">However, I have some difficulties with some provisions of the Bill as currently proposed and to which I will refer in detail on Committee Stage, notwithstanding my overall welcome for it.  This legislation is a further and necessary element in a number of State response initiatives to the very serious issues of abuse in residential institutions.  It provides for the establishment of a fund to support the victims of abuse in residential institutions.  As has been indicated for some time, the fund is to be financed by contributions agreed with the religious congregations.  Supporting the education, health and welfare needs of the survivors of residential child abuse is the remit of the fund and it will provide very important services.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">In May 1999, the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, on behalf of the State, stated that the Government wished to make a sincere and long-overdue apology to the victims of child abuse.  He stated at that time that too many children had been denied the love, care and security to which they were entitled.  He also said that abuse had ruined their childhood and had been an ever-present part of their adult lives.  He emphasised that the Government believed they had been gravely wronged and that the State must do all it could to overcome the lasting effects of their ordeals.  During a debate in the House last July, in which we discussed the legislation regarding the Residential Institutions Redress Board, the view was expressed that those statements by the Taoiseach on the part of the Irish State, were long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Significant work was carried out by the Residential Redress Board.  The provision in the original Act to enable the board to accept late applications was clearly a good and prudent one.  Years after the original deadline, a substantial number of applications were submitted and approved.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The Bill setting up that board was published by the then Department of Education and Science in June 2001, two years after the then Taoiseach apologised to victims of physical and sexual abuse in reformatories and industrial schools for which the State had responsibility.  Its purpose was to provide fair and reasonable financial awards to victims of institutional child abuse.  That apology on May 9 1999 followed the broadcast of a television series dealing with these important and very distressing issues.  So many innocent people were admitted to dark and grey institutions and many suffered for years.  The compulsory admission of so many people to those institutions was absolutely shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">At that time, a constituent of mine, whom I have known for more than 20 years, a man who has become a friend of mine, spoke to me and outlined his experiences as a former resident of an institution in our capital city.  He recalled the horrors to which he was also subjected when he was employed by private employers at Easter, Christmas and during the summertime.  Not alone was that young man abused in the institution, but sadly abuse was also perpetrated in the private sector and in the community by heartless and terrible employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">In the meantime the Ryan and Murphy reports also revealed the horror of child abuse.  Last year in this House, when we discussed the Residential Institutions Redress (Amendment) Bill 2011, I expressed my concern about the cut-off date of 16 September 2011.  During debates on Second, Committee and Report Stages, I requested the Minister and Minister of State to provide some mechanism within the legislation that would enable the acceptance of a genuine application post-16 September 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">On this side of the House we urged the Minister and his Department to ensure that the decision to have a close-off date should be publicised as much as possible.  We urged that the various voluntary organisations and sporting organisations, particularly those working in the Irish Community abroad, should be encouraged to do their level best to ensure that people would know of that particular close-off date.  We requested the best possible and appropriate information campaign.  I spoke to some of the advocacy groups working abroad and they are still concerned that some potential applicants will not have an opportunity to apply for the assistance that was available under the redress board.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">None of us in this House would like to see any individual deprived of his or her rights.  During the discussion on the Residential Institutions Redress (Amendment) Bill 2011, I asked if it would be possible for the Government to incorporate in the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill the residual functions of the redress board.  That would enable the work of the redress board to be activated again should applications that meet the criteria applied by the redress board arise.  A small number of eminent people could constitute that board and eliminate unnecessary costs, while dealing with genuine applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">To my knowledge, when statutory agencies previously ceased to exist, residual functions were transferred back to the parent Government Department and, when necessary, the legislation could be invoked to deal with issues arising.  When so much good work has been done under the auspices of the redress board, it would be unfortunate and regrettable if any individual, or a small number of people, were deprived of their right to avail of the support that was there under the redress scheme.  Such a measure as I have mentioned could be incorporated in this particular legislation.  Hopefully, it would not need to be activated at any time but it would be a safeguard to ensure that nobody, through illness or some other situation, who is not in a position to be advised or to know of the existence of the scheme, would be left out.  It would be a source of disappointment to all of us if in a number of months time or later, some people became aware of the scheme, would meet with the relevant criteria, but were not able to avail of those supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">As each year passes there is, by definition, a smaller and smaller cohort of potential applicants.  This is a cause of concern to some of the advocacy groups in Britain, in particular, and further afield.  I am familiar with one particular advocacy group in London with which I have met to discuss this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">On Committee Stage I would like to have this proposal revisited.  Perhaps at the conclusion of this debate the Minister might be able to update us on the best advices available to his Department in relation to potential applicants having missed last September's deadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I wish to put on the record of the House a communication I received from an advocacy group that does its work in a diligent, thorough and committed manner.  I quote from the document, as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_523">Eligibility to receive assistance from the fund is being confined to those who received an award from the redress board or those who received awards pursuant to court actions, and who would otherwise have received awards from the board.  However, this definition will exclude many of these who have suffered most from institutional abuse.  Just over 1,000 individuals presented evidence to the CICA - less than 1% of the estimated number of children to have been admitted to residential institutions between 1936 and 1970.  There is strong evidence of high levels of institutional abuse among people who are homeless, in places of detention and in mental health services, and who were therefore not in a position to make claims.  Therefore people who have not come to terms with their abuse, have not heard of the redress initiative and/or are so damaged that they did not have the financial or psychological resources to attend, will be unable to receive assistance from the fund.  In other words, some of those who have suffered most and are most in need of help will be unable to benefit from a scheme designed to help survivors, because of Government legislation.  The State will have failed them not once, but twice.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The advocacy group went on to suggest some amendments that I can submit to the House for consideration on Committee Stage.  What has been clearly emphasised to me through these representative groups is that we need to amend the definition to ensure that the most marginalised survivors of institutional abuse will not be left behind in some instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I welcome the Government's commitment to put the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis.  All State agencies must work together with clarity in following and implementing the guidelines.  There must be consistency and uniformity across the State and the guidelines must be implemented throughout the country in the best interests of all children.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">In April 2010, the then Government announced proposals to use €110 million of the offers of contributions to be made by the religious congregations to establish this fund.  A wide-ranging consultation process was undertaken with survivor groups and congregations with views on the scope of the fund widely sought.  Understandably, a diverse range of proposals were put forward by the different groups.  In recent months, together with other Members of the Oireachtas, I have received numerous representations and proposals from different groups and many individuals in regard to the disbursement of this funding, the type of service to be provided and the mechanism for providing such necessary services.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Through parliamentary questions in this House on a number of occasions I requested the Minister to ensure that the various proposals and submissions made by different group be given the detailed consideration and analysis to ensure that the best possible proposals are adopted and put to use in the best interests of those who are entitled to such support and assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">We need to ensure that the maximum level of funding is put into the delivery of services to these individuals and that whatever costs are incurred in rolling out the programmes are minimised and kept to the lowest possible level.  We want to see effective and beneficial supports in place for those former residents.  The costs of providing some architecture of delivery must be minimised.  I hope the structures outlined in the legislation will not be over-bureaucratic or costly.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Over the past decade and more, many individuals and groups have worked very hard in dealing with difficult situations in being effective advocates for so many individuals who suffered so much.  I compliment those individuals and those groups on what is, understandably, a difficult situation.  They have been consistent and diligent in their representations.  I want to place on the record of the House my admiration for the huge amount of work they have put in over the past decade and longer.  I have been familiar with their work over the past 12 months since becoming my party's spokesperson on education and skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I wish to refer a few issues to the Minister to which he might respond when replying to the debate.  The Minister stated that €21 million of the €110 million that would be made available through the fund, and which represents that cash portion of the offers made by the religious congregations, is already in the Central Bank.  I presume he is satisfied that the remaining commitment will be honoured in a timely manner.  I hope he will able to provide clarity as to when it is expected those contributions will be made.  The commitment has been made and it must be honoured.  A further question I had regarding charitable status has been answered by the Minister in his script in regard to the transfer of property.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The Minister said he will not be opening up eligibility to all former residents of institutions as the amount available would be greatly reduced along with the effectiveness of the fund if that were to be the case.  It is only open to those who applied for compensation through the redress board.  I have already outlined, at some length, my concern about some individuals, who met the criteria to have been given support by the redress board, who may be excluded.  Am I correct in thinking that people who went before the Ryan commission are also excluded?  I may not be clear on that but we may get confirmation at the end of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The Minister stated in a reply to a parliamentary question that he would consider reviewing who is eligible to apply for assistance following the establishment of the statutory fund in the event that applications to the fund not resulting in a significant expenditure of the fund.  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions during recent months encouraging and urging the early publication of this legislation.  The Minister in a reply to a recent parliamentary question stated, "I would suggest that the issue of who is eligible to apply for assistance could be reviewed following the establishment of the statutory fund in the event of the applications to the fund not resulting in a significant expenditure of the fund".</p>
          <p eId="para_533">A further issue that keeps cropping up is that of the residents of the Magdalene Laundries and the difficulties they endured.  Two or three further issues have also been brought to my attention.  When the redress board was established I understood a firm commitment was given by the Government that there would be no means testing of the provision of services or means testing or taxation of the awards that were given.  That has been honoured to date but there is a change in the legislation in regard to means testing of the provision of services.  My reading of the provision in that respect may be incorrect and I hope it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">On the issue of the national memorial, to which the Minister also referred, I understand a number of the representatives groups met Mr. Benton and the OPW at the time and they put a number of issues to the OPW regarding the timing of the provision of the memorial when all the other issues have been dealt with.  That was my understanding in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">On the issue of data and documentation held by the redress board, the Minister has rightly stated that the application process will be as practicable and as least bureaucratic as is possible in respect of the transfer of the basic amount of essential data.  There is also the question of the storage of the documentation, which is absolutely confidential, on which the redress board worked.  The Minister might give us some indication at the end of the Second Stage debate as to the long-term plans for ensuring the absolute confidentiality of the data that has been collected.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I wish to briefly mention one or two further issues.  On the children's rights referendum, when I was Minister of State with responsibility for Children I brought a proposal to Government in late 2007 or early 2008 to establish the all-party Oireachtas committee.  Excellent work was done by all the participants of all parties on that legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_547">It was changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">It is important to  say at the outset that the State and the Government continue to fail the women and children of the Magdalene Laundries and Bethany Home.  It is to the great shame of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party that they have done nothing to right the wrong perpetrated against these women and children despite having been so critical of the previous Government's inaction when in opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The current Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said in 2010 that former residents of the Magdalene Laundries and Bethany Home must be included in the redress scheme.  She went on to criticise the then Minister for Education and Skills for failing to allow these institutions to be included in the list of qualifying institutions for redress.  She went on to say that for her, and I quote, it "was becoming clearer and clearer that these institutions were, to all intents and purposes places of detention, and that as such, "residents" were effectively sentenced by servants of the state, to periods of confinement therein".  The Labour Party Minister of State, when in opposition at the time, concluded her outrage with a demand for Government to do the right thing.  She was correct to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">If we go further back to 2005, the Minister's party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sulliven, rightly described the scandal surrounding Bethany Home as a matter of national importance.  In the same year the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, called on the Government to include Bethany Home in the redress scheme.  All three of those Labour Party Deputies are now Ministers of State - they are part and parcel of this Government.  During their years on the opposition benches they all shouted loudly against the decision by the Fianna Fáil led Government to exclude the Magdalene Laundries and Bethany Home from the redress scheme.  They were right to do so, but I have to ask where are they today?  What is the point of being in Government if one does not act against the very injustices that so exercised one when in opposition?</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Just yesterday the Justice for Magdalenes group released new evidence of 38 women and children having been committed to the Magdalene Laundries by the State.  In one case, a girl - a child - of just 14 years of age was sent to High Park for two years in 1930 for perjury.  As recently as 1983 an unnamed girl - a child - of 15 years of age was committed to the Good Shepherd Convent in Cork for theft.  I could go on.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Over the last week criticism has been correctly levelled at the Roman Catholic Church by people on Government and Opposition benches.  It is important in the course of this debate to remind ourselves that the State equally has a case to answer.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, said when in opposition that there was irrefutable evidence that the State was, as he put it, "directly complicit" in the confinement of these women and children.  The evidence is there - we all know this - and it should not be the case that groups like Justice for Magdalenes or Bethany Home survivor, Derek Leinster, have to keep fighting this fight.  Religious orders fundamentally abused their position within Irish society but the State was culpable too.  Both must step up, accept responsibility and provide survivors and their families with the redress, supports and services that they now need.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The Bill legislates for the provision of support to people who suffered the most grievous abuse within State and church-run institutions.  These institutions, instead of providing a safe haven and secure environment for children and young people, were often places where the most sadistic cruelty was inflicted.  The legacy of the religious orders in these institutions is one of sexual, physical and mental abuse.  The State compounded the pain and damage to our most vulnerable children by its decision to turn a blind eye to what was happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">There are differing views on what are the best ways to compensate and support victims of church and State institutional abuse.  Each opinion must be listened to and considered.  The State must be humble in its response.  It failed these people before and it cannot do so again.  The Government needs to do much more than provide a sympathetic ear for those who have raised concerns about aspects of the Bill.  Everything possible must be done to ensure the victims of abuse receive just recompense.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">It seems wrong to have to reduce this debate so quickly to pennies and pence.  I do not know that any of us can put a price on assisting survivors and their families to put their lives back together.  Last week, a gentleman on the radio spoke about the need to move on.  He spoke of wanting to apologise to his former partners for the difficulties in their relationships due to the abuse perpetrated against him as a child while in State care.  My heart broke for this man.  How can we put a price on giving him whatever support or redress he needs to move on?</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The cost of redress is expected to reach €1.36 billion, and the religious orders need to pay up.  Holding back on these moneys is creating additional hurt among victims and this is a situation the Government must address firmly and clearly.  I have very serious concerns about the fund's eligibility criteria, which is to be confined to those who received an award from the redress board or compensation following a court decision or settlement.  Those who have not received redress to date will be blocked from accessing the fund and as a consequence the State will have failed them yet again.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">It is important to note that 40% of the applications made to the redress scheme were by former residents living outside the State.  The implications of the abuse they suffered impacted on their education, leaving many illiterate and some destitute.  Far too often we hear of now elderly former residents of these institutions who have struggled to integrate themselves into their communities and now live a life of poverty, some in Britain or the US.  All they want in life is to return home to Ireland to live out what remains of their lives.  However, no provision has been made for them.  In this context we are concerned about the Government's intention to end funding outreach services once the statutory fund is established.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this.  Medical insurance is a real problem for survivors living in the US and Canada, as are nursing and residential care.  In what way does the Government and the State intend to support their needs?  Consideration must also be given to the views of some former residents who believe the distribution of the available money should be paid directly to survivors in lump sums.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Campaigner Paddy Doyle has noted the vast majority of former residents posting comments on his website are opposed to the statutory fund.  Unlike the redress scheme, which provided financial compensation, the new fund will provide for a range of services instead.  When we consider how the State failed survivors as children it is understandable they would now not trust the Government to decide on their behalf what their wants and needs are.  It cannot go unsaid that the redress scheme itself was for many a truly awful experience.  Sean Leonard of Justice and Healing for Institutional Abuse has noted the legal fraternity made a fortune out of the redress scheme.  He states survivors were poorly treated when interacting with Departments.  We must learn from this.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">There has been, rightly, collective outrage against Cardinal Seán Brady's failure to tell parents that their children were being abused by, or in danger of being abused by, Fr. Brendan Smyth.  Many of us have read with horror the questioning by the church that survivor Brendan Boland had to endure at just 14 years of age.  For many the redress board process was an equally cold and harsh experience.  Lessons must be learned from this.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Councillor Sally Mulready, chair of the London Irish Women's Survivors Support Group has said applicants to the redress board who were rejected on the grounds of being late should not be excluded and I agree with her.  We have been told the funds supports will include access to counselling services, health care provision, housing needs and education.  We need to ensure these services and supports will be adequately resourced and delivered.  The Minister has also said the fund will promote understanding of the effects of abuse on former residents among service providers and will evaluate the effectiveness of the approved services in meeting the needs of former residents.  In all honesty I question the capacity of the Government to deliver on this commitment, and I feel very sure that many survivors equally question it.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Child victims of sexual abuse whose cases have been taken up by the State can wait several months before even the most basic counselling services are provided.  Often their families receive no counselling whatsoever.  Last month the HSE revealed that approximately 178,000 people are on outpatient waiting lists to be seen by a consultant after referral by a GP.  Tens of thousands of citizens have been waiting years for housing and may never in their lifetime move off the housing waiting list.    The Government plans to cut a further 37,000 public sector jobs, so how can we guarantee and reassure victims and survivors that their needs will be met?</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Christine Buckley of the Aislinn Centre has noted enhanced access to counselling services and education have greatly reduced recidivism but so much more is needed.  Access is important but, in equal measure, so also is the time involved in accessing the supports and services.  In many instances we are dealing with very elderly people who require urgent assistance.  There is the reasonably held view that many of these services are already available to people as a matter of right, meaning the benefits of the statutory fund will be minimal.  This is a point that should be made.  Paddy Doyle, whom I mentioned earlier, has also noted that as survivors get older, their needs change, particularly when their levels of mental health and mobility deteriorate.  As a result, some survivors will have greater needs than others yet it is unclear how the board will deal with these changing needs and, in some cases, imbalances.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The fund should have provision to pay for the education requirements of children whose parents were the victims of abuse.  This can be an important step in breaking the cycle of inter-generation hardship that can be directly attributed to institutionalised abuse.  John Kelly of the Irish branch of Survivors of Child Abuse, SOCA, has suggested the introduction of a universal card scheme whereby each survivor would get credits and these could be conferred to a family member.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The legislation must also examine how the awarding of assistance will affect residents of the Six Counties and Britain whose benefits are means tested and must be protected.  Children of survivors will be excluded from accessing services as provided for in the Bill.  This is a mistake.  Full access to education and counselling are critical components to breaking a cycle that began with the State's failure to protect our vulnerable children.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">A former resident of an industrial school in County Kerry wrote last month in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> of wanting to give her children what she had been denied, an education.  This woman’s right to education was denied by the State.  Her father was also a survivor of an industrial school and both her parents were illiterate.  She described how her son has achieved 11 honours in his junior certificate - a bright lad - but now she worries that the family will not be in a financial position to send him to college.  Perhaps, in an even worse indictment against this Government, the young lad is considering leaving school so he can help support his family, as his mother’s community employment Scheme will end in November and the family’s income will be reduced.  The letter concluded by saying that education is the passport to ensuring that the family’s cycle of deprivation and social welfare dependency does not continue.  This is a position of common sense and dignity, and I urge the Government to adopt it and listen to the words and needs of this woman.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Speaking in the Dáil in 2009, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, said: "No words of mine or of anybody else in the House can undo the damage, harm or hurt caused to and which continues for those people.  However, the actions that we take can make some redress to them, their children and their children's children".  He went on to charge the then Fianna Fáil Government for having "let free the horrendous record of the Department of Education and Science that continues to the present day".  He put it to the Minister that there was a continuing culture of deferment and obedience to the Roman Catholic Church and its religious orders in the then Department of Education and Science that had frustrated getting answers to the most simple questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">I believe the Minister spoke with integrity on that occasion.  Now, he is in charge and is making the decisions.  He cannot afford to get it wrong.  Of all the matters raised in the course of this debate and on Committee Stage, the issues of eligibility and ensuring the State, in the most fulsome way, recognises the damage done to victims and survivors and compensates them in the fullest way must be clearly guaranteed and underwritten in the legislation.  I do not believe that is yet the case.  The issue of means testing the provision of services to any of the victims or survivors must be clarified.  Survivors must have the comfort of knowing that they will have access to properly resourced services, with no impediment put in their way by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Now that he is in the Government, does the Minister have the same courage he displayed when he was in the Opposition?  I hope he does.  The victims, survivors, their families and their communities need a full resolution from the Minister.  That is the least all of us owe them.  I commend them for their efforts.  I hope the Minister has listened to our words and that we can constructively fashion the legislation to meet all those needs.</p>

        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_232">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_569">First, I offer my heartfelt sympathy and support to the survivors of abuse in institutions in this State.  Some are in the Visitors Gallery this evening, and I salute their courage and determination.  Only for them this issue would never have reached the light of day.  Only for the survivors, their families, friends and campaigners the cosy cartel of church and State would have continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Citizens of this State have been done a service by those who have campaigned for justice and compensation for the survivors of abuse in institutions.  For too long their voices went unheard.  In fact, for decades they were simply silenced by the crozier and by those in positions of power.  Unfortunately, some of those people sat in the seats we sit in today.  They chose not to see, hear or do anything to address the massive abuse that was taking place in institutions in this State.  Over the years and after many column inches, documentaries and reports, a Bill is finally before the House.  Unfortunately, however, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill has serious shortcomings.  Many people had great hopes that the new Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party would listen and act in the survivors' best interests, but that does not appear to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Having met with some of the survivors' campaigning groups I agree with their analysis that this Bill must be amended if it is to meet the need of survivors and their families.  There are a number of key issues.  First, the compensation available must be expanded to include children and grandchildren of survivors, for many of them have suffered because of the abuse visited upon their fathers, mothers and grandparents.  They have had to live with and endure pain and suffering for crimes committed against their loved ones and they deserve adequate compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Second, survivors who have not received compensation from the current redress  board must be covered by this Bill.  People who did not put their case before the current redress board suffered no less than those who did.  Many did not put their cases forward for genuine, personal reasons.  In some cases it caused too much pain; in others they simply did not want their families to know about the pain and suffering they had gone through.  Some were resident outside this jurisdiction at the time.  These are all sound, genuine reasons and the Minster must amend the Bill to take account of them.  If the Bill excludes one person, it is fundamentally flawed and must be amended.  The Bill must be as inclusive and humane as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Third, in the case of survivors who have passed away, their next of kin must be allowed to apply for compensation for the reasons I have just outlined.  The abuse that was suffered did not simply end once somebody was buried.  Abuse of this nature can affect families for generations if it is not addressed properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Another serious concern is the length of time it will take to administer the fund.  Many people eligible for this fund are already in their latter years.  The fund must be distributed with minimum bureaucracy.  A time frame must be agreed to ensure applications are processed with ease and speed and the compensation is distributed as quickly as possible.  The fear for many is that the bureaucracy surrounding the fund will become more important than the survivors.  That cannot be allowed happen.  There should be no gravy trains for the lawyers or administrators of the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Finally, it is my understanding that of the €110 million being made available only €17 million is available in cash.  The rest is in the form of land and buildings.  If this is a fact, I urge the Government to front-load the remaining €93 million into the fund so the full compensation is available.  In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, to redraft the Bill to make it more inclusive, robust and accessible for the people it is meant to support.</p>

          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_576">I now call on Deputy Joan Collins, who is sharing time with Deputies John Halligan, Richard Boyd Barrett and Seamus Healy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_577">The first time I had an opportunity to speak about survivors of clerical sexual abuse was a number of months ago, on the closing date for people to access the redress board.  I opposed that for all the reasons outlined in the Dáil tonight.  It must be seriously re-examined to see how the date can be extended to accommodate people who, for reasons we do not understand but which they understand, cannot or will not or find it impossible to come forward.  Their genuine fear of coming forward should be taken into account.  That should be the first port of call in the discussion on the Bill that has been introduced by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">On first reading through the Bill, I thought it appeared to be quite reasonable.  I noted how it provided for four survivors on the board of nine members, which also included the chief executive officer and chairperson, as well as having accountability linked in with it.  I also noted the provision for an appeals process and so on.  However, on reading through it a second time and examining it in greater detail, I noted how the staff of the Education Finance Board is to move over to the new residential institutions statutory fund and will be paid therefrom.  Moreover, their pensions will be paid from the €110 million allocated to that fund.  In addition, board members will receive expenses, to which they are entitled, but I note they also will be drawn from the fund, as will the salary and pension of the chief executive officer.  Similarly, the appeals officer will be paid from the fund, as will the staff he or she takes on.  Finally, any committees that are established will have their expenses and allowances paid for from out of the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I then read through the Bill a third time, to better grasp its impact.  The point that has been made forcefully to me by various groups is this fund has the potential to become a bureaucratic quango.  Moreover, it does not address the needs of the survivors.  As the legislation will allow the board to give money to the Minister for the appeals officer, wages, expenses and so on, what proportion of these costs will be taken out of the €110 million?  I believe that 99% of the fund must be given to survivors, which is the purpose of setting up the fund, not to create a position whereby money must be drawn out of the amount allocated to the fund to pay people.  This point will be important and the legislation must be amended to effect this change.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">However, this can only be done in the context of the necessity to reconsider the Bill in its entirety.  The point has been made to me by survivors that their experience of the Education Finance Board was it was extremely difficult for families and individuals to gain access to the fund.  They were obliged to go through hoops to gain access to it by filling out application forms, proving identities, etc.  For example, one of my constituents is pursuing a VEC course comprising four modules.  She started off with two modules and has submitted applications for funding in this regard but has received no response.  Moreover, I read in the Bill that it will be closed from November and I am unsure how this will link in with the new board that is being established.  In addition, I refer to the experiences recounted by people from organisations such as Survivors of Child Abuse, SOCA, regarding efforts their families had made to gain access to funding from the Education Finance Board.  It took nearly 18 months for their families to try to access it and they gave up.  They simply stopped as it was not worth their while.  They walked away, stating that getting such funding was too difficult.  I am particularly fearful in respect of this Bill that people will encounter similar difficulties in respect of the applications and hoops through which they must jump to get access to its provisions pertaining to health, housing, education, etc. and amendments must be made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">In addition, I note that unlike the Education Finance Board provisions, families are being excluded from access to the new fund.  This also is a matter of concern among the survivors of abuse because, as has been observed in this Chamber, many of the aforementioned survivors are extremely elderly.  I spoke to one such survivor today, who left Daingean in 1967 and who now is 61 years old and who probably is one of the youngest survivors.  The survivors' groups seek a time limit as to when this money will be spent, as it should not be available for ten years.  The Education Finance Board had access to €12.7 million and took ten years to distribute that amount.  The sum of €100 million is being provided for under this Bill and the question arises as to how to disburse it.  A time limit must be imposed to avoid timeframes of 12, 13 or 15 years, by which time those who need it most will not be able to avail properly of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I also wish to raise the question of the bureaucracy this legislation will entail.  Would it be possible to put in place a system similar to the HAA positive action medical cards provided to hepatitis C sufferers to provide access to health services?  People should be considered according to the quantum of money they received from the redress board and an appropriate percentage could be given to them.  I note all the names, addresses and contact numbers are available and a card could be used to allocate medical care, health, housing applications or whatever.  Credits on such a card could be used by survivors for to access such funds for housing, were they in need of an extension or if they needed to build a flat or toilet downstairs in their houses.  I propose a mechanism whereby people receive funds directly and rapidly to be used for their best benefit.  Such amendments must be considered, rather than people being obliged to apply, make applications and so on, in what can be extremely difficult and bureaucratic procedures, to gain access to redress from that perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I will conclude by noting many people had thought this issue was behind us and which they would not be obliged to consider again.  However, there has been another outbreak on foot of Cardinal Brady not handing over the names or telling the families of the young boys who were being sexually abused by Brendan Smith all those years ago.  Memorials are good and I acknowledge a number of people seek the creation of a memorial in recognition of what happened.  However, unless the institutions are brought to account and to book in respect of their past and present by recognising what happened and then taking responsibility for it, there still is a long way to go to address these issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnHalligan" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Deputy John Halligan</from>
          <p eId="para_584">First, I remind Members that a recent Amnesty International report described the violations against children that have taken place in this country as some of the greatest human rights violations in the history of this State, which satisfy the definitions of torture, slavery and cruel and inhumane treatment as laid down under international law.  At the outset, I welcome any move the State makes to acknowledge and face up to the terrible suffering and trauma endured by so many at the hands of church officials.  For instance, the provision of counselling and education could be of great help and comfort and the tracing service provided by Barnardos has made a real difference to many people.  However, like many other Members, I am concerned the Minister has not adequately ironed out all of the concerns of the representative groups prior to bringing forward this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">This new fund will replace the Education Finance Board, which was founded at the time of the 2002 agreement.  A number of survivors who have been in contact with me - I note some from my constituency are present today - are concerned that the framework will not cater adequately for the needs of children and grandchildren who have been availing of assistance through the education system.  This is a source of great worry for many people and must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">In addition, research by the National Suicide Research Foundation has noted that interaction with family members is a key factor in ensuring survivors do not commit suicide, which is a huge issue for many of those who have been affected by such horrendous crimes..  Moreover, front line workers will confirm the great significance of the inter-generational effect institutional abuse has had on many families in Ireland.  Consequently, it is deeply regrettable that the Government has decided to remove family members from access to the education fund and this decision should be reviewed.  It is a poor decision to make because many family members who were not directly affected by abuse are now affected because of what has happened.  Last year, just under 22% of the applicants in receipt of grants were former residents and almost 74% were relatives, of whom 47.6% were children and a further 26.2% were grandchildren of former residents.  The previous arrangement allowed these victims to at least provide their children or grandchildren with what they themselves were denied, namely, an education of choice.  The Government should reconsider this provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">In addition, there has been significant recent media attention on the massive shortfall in the compensation fund since the 2009 Ryan report revealed the shocking extent of decades-long sexual, physical and psychological abuse of the most vulnerable in institutions.  It is scandalous that the church still is not shouldering its share of the costs of responding to the horrendous wrongs suffered by these children.  While I compliment the Tánaiste on his decision to close the Vatican embassy, it is regrettable it was closed for cost cutting reasons.  As I stated previously when the Tánaiste announced the closure of this embassy, it should have been closed and the Papal Nuncio sent packing because of the Vatican's interference in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">It adds insult to injury to those affected by institutional abuse that under one fifth of the promised amount, €21.05 million, has been received to date.  A number of congregations previously advised that they would make their contributions once they had sight of the proposals for the fund.  Have further moneys been forthcoming since this Bill was published?  Is the €21 million paid thus far sufficient to enable establishment of the fund and to commence its work of supporting survivors?  Will the Government be making an annual supplement to the fund to ensure its longevity for as long as the survivors need it?  It is important that there is continuous funding available to the families and survivors for the remainder of their lives.  The Government needs to put some thought into this.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The deferential treatment shown by members of the Garda Síochána to priests and bishops accused of abuse in Irish institutions is one of the most shameful incidents of criminality in the history of our State.  Every file referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions alleging abuse by clergy and the religious needs be reopened and re-examined to ensure no incident of clerical child abuse goes unaddressed.  The Government should prior to the passage of this Bill give a commitment that this will be done.  State reluctance to prosecute those who turned a blind eye to abuse is one of the reasons child abuse remains a serious threat in this country, despite over a decade of inquires and reports revealing the suffering of tens of thousands of children at the hands of church and State.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I congratulate all those people around the country who have spoken out about the horrendous affects of abuse on their lives.  It is traumatic for these people to have to speak about what happened to them and they should be treated with compassion and dignity by the Government, as promised by both parties prior to taking up office.  There should be no arguing or haggling over funds.  The congregations should be called to account to pay over every cent they promised.  Also, the Government should over the next couple of months publicly call to account the congregations refusing to adhere to what they promised to do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_236">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_591">As stated by other speakers, the scandal of thousands of children being abused in church-run institutions, which children the State failed for decades to protect, is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, shames of this State's relatively short history.  Many heinous crimes were perpetrated against thousands of children.  We must, in trying to deal with this issue, ensure we do everything in our power to provide whatever redress, support and compensation we can to those people whose lives were ruined.  Nothing we or this Bill can do can ever fully compensate people for the suffering they endured.  In so far as we have a duty and obligation to help victims of abuse and their families to cope for the rest of their lives with the consequences of the crimes committed against them, we must ensure we do so as well as we possibly can.  It is of the utmost importance that nothing we do results in further stress, difficulty, anxiety, humiliation or suffering for people who have already suffered far too much.  We must in the first instance listen to their view on how we can address the issues affecting them.  Whatever we then put in place must result in no further trauma, suffering or stress for them and their families.  It is vital we get this right.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The church, whose role in visiting this suffering on so many people, must end its shameful foot-dragging and instinct for self-preservation and self-protection whether of the institution of the church or of particular individuals within it who believe their self-preservation is of greater priority than are the victims of this terrible abuse, their concerns and needs.  In this regard, it is disgraceful that the church has still not put up all of the money to meet its obligations on this matter.  As far as I am concerned, the State has a responsibility to force it to do so and to seize its assets if required.  Whatever needs to be done should be done to ensure the church comes up with the funds and supports required.  The institution and individuals within it matter not a whit compared to our obligation to the victims of child abuse.  To my mind it is equally shameful - this is out of our power - that Cardinal Brady, given his failure to discharge his responsibility to the victims of Fr. Brendan Smyth, will not resign.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">In so far as we in this House have the authority to do something for the victims, we must ensure we get this right and, critically, with an ear to what the victims and their families say they need.  I do not pretend to be an expert on this issue.  I met this morning, as I have done on other occasions, with two victims representing other victims who have major concerns about this Bill.  When I asked them at the end of the meeting if they believed this Bill as currently drafted should be scrapped, they said it should because it does not deal as it should with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">As regards eligibility, there should be no question of limiting eligibility to those given awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  Anyone who was a victim or resident in one of the relevant institutions should be eligible to access this fund and services provided therefrom.  As stated by Deputy Joan Collins, the victims' organisations raised with us their fear that significant resources that should be going to help victims will be squandered on administration, salaries, expenses and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">That must not happen.  They propose a much simpler system where we do not need large boards, a large staff and so on and that we just give the money directly to the people who are eligible for it in the form of some sort of universal credit card, as Deputy Collins said.  We could work out the proportion of the available fund to be given to each individual on the basis of much of the information we already have from awards given by the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  This could be done and it would save on the necessity for administration and would not waste funds which should be going to the victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">They also expressed deep concern that we are just talking about transferring over the administration and infrastructure from the Education Finance Board because they reported real problems with, as has been described, people spending months trying to gain access to this fund but giving up such was the onerous nature of the process and the difficulty of making an application with all the documentation, proof and so on that they had to provide.  People literally gave up.  That cannot happen.  What they propose is a much simpler system where we simply give them the resources in the form of a universal credit card, so we do not have to deal with all of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The key point for them is that the State already has most of the information it needs to adequately disburse the resources, supports and funds via the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the awards.  Anybody who came in after that could be looked at.  They also stressed the need for it to be independent.  In so far as any administration of this is required, it must be completely independent but there is a problem if the Minister is appointing the chief executive.  There may be a conflict or a tension in regard to a Government which has concerns about cutting back on services while at the same time having an influence on a board whose priority should be not a concern about the Government's concerns about services but about what the victims and their families need and providing for that.  It should be separate from the Government and the Minister and completely independent and funding should be provided in a much more simplified form and in a much more direct way than this Bill proposes.</p>

          <p eId="para_598">I commend the survivors of child abuse, many of whom are in the Visitors Gallery, and in particular those who spoke out.  But for that, we still might not be aware of the horrendous situation.  It may not have come to light were it not for those people who were courageous enough to speak out at a cost to themselves.  They were criticised as being dishonest and as having an agenda against the church, the State, or both.  They are very important people and I commend them on speaking out and making this horrendous situation known to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The Ryan report detailed the huge failures of the State to protect its children and the scandal of the congregations which managed the institutions.  We now know that at least 15,000 children were abused in those institutions and it is something we must sort out once and for all.  I welcome the creation of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Family Support Agency and the publication of the Children First guidelines and the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012.  I am disappointed we have not had a children's rights referendum.  It is urgent and necessary and I hope it will take place before the end of this year.  There is an indisputable case for the inclusion of the Magdalene laundries and the Bethany Home in the institutions covered and I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to include them.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">I understand the cost to the State will be €1.36 billion overall and I support the proposal that it be shared 50:50 by the congregations and the State.  I note the church is still short approximately €200 million in this regard and I support the Minister's proposal that school infrastructure be transferred at no cost to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">A number of issues have arisen in regard to the Bill.  We have heard what many of the survivors have said from other Deputies but there is a widespread belief among the survivors that the €110 million, which has been painfully recovered from the orders and the congregations concerned, should be distributed to the victims through an adjustment mechanism by the Residential Institutions Redress Board before it is dissolved.  There is concern about the age profile of many of the survivors.  There is no doubt the age profile is the high 60s, 70s and even 80s and individuals of that age require different supports from younger people.  The question of universal care has been mentioned, which I support.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">There is a huge concern among the survivors about the cost of this new board, the chief executive officer, the staff and legal advisers.  They believe those costs should be borne by the Minister's Department and not the fund.  That turned up in the previous legislation in 2005.  Section 11(4) of the legislation is silent on who pays.  The Minister makes the appointments and sets the conditions and the expenses referred to are paid from the Minister's Department and not from the fund.  This is currently the case with the Education Finance Board but was not for the first three years of its operation because the 2005 Act was also silent on this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">There is considerable worry about possible means testing.  Section 9 seems to suggest there will be means testing.  It states that the board, in determining  criteria under section 1, shall have regard to the need to take account of the individual circumstances, including personal and financial circumstances of former residents.  That is a worry and I urge the Minister to withdraw that section.  The question of eligibility is another worry for survivors.  The situation should be open-ended with applications being accepted whenever they are submitted.  The question of children and grandchildren should be considered in regard to the eligibility criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I commend the Sunlight Housing Foundation which is run by volunteers, many of whom are survivors.  It has already housed ten persons in Midleton and there are 14 more on a waiting list.  There is no public funding for this facility and I urge the Minister to meet the board of the foundation with a view to providing funding for it.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_607">notes the grave injustice that is the current assessment, review and appeals system for domiciliary care allowance (DCA) which has, since its transfer to the Department of Social Protection in 2009, seen:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_608">-- a continuous escalation in application refusals based on desk assessments carried out by administrators and medical assessors neither of which are required to be qualified specialists in the relevant area of disability;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_609">-- an upsurge in reviews of DCA recipient eligibility which often result in extortionate costs to parents who must, at short notice, obtain expert medical evidence to support the defence of their much needed claim (evidence for which they are often forced to pay private sector experts given the unavailability of public sector options within the short timeframes set out by the Department of Social Protection for such reviews);</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_610">-- the development of a staggering 38 week wait period for those seeking an oral appeal of an unsuccessful application or a finding of ineligibility upon review;</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_612">-- the unnecessary imposition of an additional emotional burden upon families as a result of being forced to embark upon a lengthy and costly appeal process which, in 52% of cases, upholds the original claim for DCA and proves the injustice of the initial refusal;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_613">-- a persistent failure to inform families of the specific reasons a child does not qualify for DCA, thereby preventing parents from appealing a decision on specific grounds rather than causing a lengthy and costly review of the entire process; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_614">-- the placing of formal or informal restrictions upon Health Service Executive (HSE) experts precluding them from recommending the provision of a DCA to an individual on the basis of a diagnosis they have made;</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_616">-- the emergence of a backdoor approach to denying additional supports such as carer's allowance, the respite care grant, the household benefits package and sibling supports as a result of a finding of ineligibility for DCA; and</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_620">-- insisting that medical assessors are competent to assess the medical information submitted and are on the relevant specialist medical register (e.g. paediatrics or child psychiatry), remove the "Guide to the Normal Age of Attainment of Certain Activities" currently in use by medical assessors (as compiled by the Office for Population Censuses and Surveys study on Disability in Childhood in the United Kingdom) and ensure that all decisions on DCA applications and existing claims are made by child protection or disability social workers;</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_630">I thank the Technical Group for agreeing to table this Private Members' motion, which we have worked on together.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The domiciliary care allowance was never an automatic award.  As we often hear from parents, many people found out about it by accident.  A person must apply for it.  To qualify for the monthly payment of €309, the person caring for a child, usually the mother, had to prove the child had a disability and needs substantially in excess of those of a child of a similar age.  The payment was in recognition of the fact the child needed assistance to deal with many of the activities of daily living.  Proof was usually in the form of expert opinions or, in some cases, the HSE reviewers actually seeing the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Until 2009, the allowance was processed by the HSE.  However, new applications from that year were made to the Department of Social Protection.  In recent months, parents have been telling us how much they dread the postman arriving with the letter that tells them the domiciliary care allowance is to be reviewed.  This is particularly so if a parent's child is on the autism spectrum.  There is mounting evidence that children with autism or other intellectual disabilities are being targeted.  I acknowledge that those affected are not exclusively in those categories, but they seem to comprise a disproportionate number.  That a Department named "Social Protection" is doing this is cynical.  It is certainly not offering protection to the most vulnerable group of children and parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The process appears to be flawed, in that it follows a medical model when it should be a more holistic one.  There is also a social aspect to this matter.  We are seeking a short-term solution to the current crisis in which many families find themselves as well as a more inclusive system, one that adopts a social model as opposed to a medical model purely.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">There are always choices to be made in politics.  I doubt that the top 10% of earners would feel good if they knew that their incomes were being protected at the expense of vulnerable children.  Top earners increased their incomes by 8% last year according to the CSO.  An additional tax on high earners could have been imposed without any loss in their living standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The Minister for Social Protection needed to find savings of €680 million in her budget.  The main objective was to protect the headline rate of social welfare recipients.  To those who are not dependent on social welfare, this translated into no cuts in social welfare, yet this cannot be achieved because the money needed to come from somewhere.  The Government repeatedly made the point that there were to be no tax increases or reductions in headline rates of social welfare.  The sin of omission was in not specifying how the savings would be achieved.  The changes to the domiciliary care allowance, cuts in the number of people who qualify for carer's allowances, etc. have become evident.  Although the Government claimed it was seeking to protect the most vulnerable, it was more concerned with merely giving that impression.  Some families are being hurt badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The domiciliary care and carer's allowances are not being cut.  Rather, they are being eliminated as payments.  We have seen a continuous escalation in application refusals based on desk assessments carried out by administrators and medical assessors, none of whom is required to be a qualified specialist in the relevant areas of disability.  One parent to whom I spoke last week was refused recently following a departmental review.  She told me her six year old son was not toilet trained, attended a special school, was a danger to himself and a flight risk, could not feed or dress himself and could not tie his shoe laces.  The list went on.  He was turned down.  Obviously, he was regarded as having no more need for care than an average six year old.  Clearly, this is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">No matter how bad a situation is, parents always hope that matters will improve for their children.  However, many tell us that the process is cruel.  Many complain about the short turnaround time for reviews.  Often, they must obtain medical evidence from private sector sources because it is not available from public sector professionals within the allocated timeframe.  In one case, a mother recently told me that it cost €1,000.  Someone else told me their professional fees ran to €1,300.  If these people did not have the accompanying proof, they would lose their allowances.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Not only is it a costly process for families, it is emotionally hurtful to read about what their children will not be able to do or what challenges they will face.  The blackest picture must be painted.  We all remember the effort made and the change in people's attitudes during the Special Olympics, where the focus was on the child's ability rather than disability.  This review process turns that attitude in reverse and it is taking a toll on many families.  One woman described the loneliness of life with her autistic son as he progressed through school.  Her days have closed in around her and her circle of friends has, for the most part, dwindled away, unable to meet for coffee or chats even for half an hour.  People do not understand and eventually give up trying.  On 1 March, the woman's domiciliary care allowance review was submitted and a cloud of panic descended on her household.  That cloud has not since lifted and may not until the review has been completed.  According to her, the reality of life without it is too great a burden to bear.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The domiciliary care payment is often used to procure therapies that should be available through the public system.  As most of us know, however, availability can depend on one's address because of the lopsided and incomplete distribution of health care professionals.  One father told me of his five year old son Conor, who has an autism spectrum disorder.  Since it is a neurological condition, it cannot be determined by a medical test.  Conor has significant issues with communication and is still non-verbal.  He needs occupational therapy to satisfy his sensory needs.  As the occupational therapy service provided by the HSE is inadequate, Conor attends a private therapist at significant cost to the family.  The domiciliary care allowance payment helps to fund these interventions.  Were it removed, it would result in the stunting of Conor's development and place his family under tremendous stress and anxiety.  These are real children.  They are not just statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Once a person appeals the refusal of the domiciliary care payment, the appeal can take approximately nine months or longer to be decided.  Not only is the €309 monthly payment discontinued, but the associated carer's allowance is removed from those who qualify for this means tested payment.  If proof is needed of the unfairness of the process, it can be seen in the level of success on appeal, with more than 50% of those who appeal being successful.  Appeals are made more difficult because of the lack of information.  If people are to appeal successfully, they need to know the basis for their refusal.  Families are struggling with everyday challenges, including inadequate public services.  This additional burden is not fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">In many cases, a parent must leave work to care for his or her disabled child.  In some cases, the carer's allowance is used to pay mortgages.  For many families it is difficult enough to struggle with the emotional fall-out of having a child with special needs, without the further cruelty of adding to their financial burdens.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Many parents believe the current treatment of the domiciliary care allowance is a backdoor approach to denying the carer's allowance, the annual respite grant, the home care package and the disability payment for the child when he or she becomes eligible for it.  The transfer of the payment to the Department of Social Protection has changed the application process from being a health centred support to a soft target for cuts.  Some of those who originally welcomed the move in the belief that it would be considered in a wider context now believe it should be moved back to the Department of Health so that decisions can be made by those who have expertise in the field, including child protection and disability social workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Reviews must allow sufficient time for those who care for the child to commission expert reports through the assessment of needs procedure under the Disability Act 2005.  Restrictions placed on HSE experts should be lifted.  I understand they have been instructed not to recommend in their reports the payment of domiciliary or carer's allowance.  That instruction needs to be reversed.  The general details of decisions on social welfare appeals ought to be published, while ensuring the anonymity of those concerned, to satisfy the guarantee under Article 34.1 of the Constitution that justice shall be administered in public.  We need to see the number and basis of appeals.  There is a need to introduce a streamlined and human rights-focused domiciliary care allowance system which is administered in a way that understands the uphill struggle of everyday life for those seeking the allowance and does not exhaust their precious time and resources in a lengthy application, review and appeals process.  We must prioritise the delivery of all necessary resources, supports and funds to children with special needs in order to facilitate them in attaining their full potential as equal citizens of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">We all understand that the economy is in a weak state and that we need to prioritise our expenditure.  However, vulnerable people seem to be first in the firing line when it comes to cuts.  We are not seeking  to end the review process for domiciliary care allowance.  We are seeking an end to a dishonest process that is targeting vulnerable children who deserve our protection.  This is a flawed process which needs to change if we are to get good outcomes.  Our motion does not reject the need for reviews but the system has to be coherent and fair.  The parents of these children are in the age cohort which has been hardest hit by the economic collapse.  Their hopes and aspirations for better lives for themselves and their children have been dealt a harsh blow from an economic point of view but their hopes have been further eroded by the extra burden of caring for a child with special needs.  They need and deserve the support of a caring society.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">We were told this afternoon that an official from the Department of Social Protection asked while conducting a review whether a particular child with autism had gotten better.  This type of question is hurtful to people who are struggling with the everyday challenge of caring for these children.  Too many of us are hearing the same stories.  This system is flawed and cruel.  There is an urgent need to change it.</p>

          <p eId="para_647">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for moving the motion on behalf of the Technical Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Some of the most common queries raised at my constituency office are from parents who are applying for the domiciliary care allowance.  They have spent the duration of their children's lives in a struggle to get services for their children and in many cases they have had to struggle to arrange diagnoses so that they can finally prove their children have problems which the system failed or refused to recognise.  It is vital that the system recognises these children and their families quickly.  It is disheartening to see the level of upset which these families experience in their constant fight to get services and entitlements.  No family would chose to have a child with special needs but they should not be forced to struggle against the social welfare, health and education system to provide a decent quality of life for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">A couple of weeks ago the Taoiseach stated to the House that children with autism can go to university and lead full lives.  That rings hollow to the families who are struggling with a lack of services or a refusal to recognise their children's needs.   The system should be reformed to ensure that families receive a fair hearing.  It should not be assumed that they are trying to defraud the State or get a benefit to which they are not entitled.  It should be assumed from the start that they need assistance and support from the Department of Social Protection.  Such an assumption would completely change the atmosphere in which these families currently struggle.  The Minister for Social Protection should change the system to ensure that families receive the support and protection they need from her Department rather than constantly struggling against the barriers it erects in their way.  They should not have to incur expenses in getting expert opinion when their domiciliary care allowances come up for renewal but should instead be provided as a matter of right with reports from the health care providers who are already dealing with their children.  That a departmental official could ask whether a child still has autism betrays a lack of understanding for what families are going through.  The Department needs to recognise that.  Families should not have to wait weeks or months for their appeals to be processed.  I have attended oral hearings with families.  It is heart-rending to observe the upset that parents experience in trying to justify their application for support.  In fairness to the inspectors, many of them are similarly upset because they cannot understand how the Department can make these decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Something must have gone badly wrong with the administrative system if more than 52% of appeals are successful.  Unfortunately, the system appears to be designed to minimise the amount of money paid to families by making them struggle through bureaucratic procedures.  The Minister needs to review the operation of the domiciliary care allowance.  If it was transferred back to the Department of Health, there might be greater empathy with applicants.    As part of that review, the application forms must also be reviewed.  In many cases applicants do not understand the amount of information they need to give and the forms do not facilitate that.  If at the start they were aware of the amount of information needed, they might be able to short-circuit the process and speed up decision-making.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">These parents and children struggle throughout their lives and the system should be able to accommodate them in recognising that children have lifelong disorders and disabilities which are not there to be reviewed.  If only parents thought that in two years' time their children would be better and would not need this anymore, they would hand back the domiciliary care allowance in the morning.  The system needs to recognise that.  When the Minister is carrying out the review I call on her to ensure the system becomes a caring system and not a blockage system.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_652">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important debate on the domiciliary care allowance and the urgent need to refocus on the children with disabilities and their families.  I commend my colleagues in the Technical Group on tabling this motion and I urge all Deputies in the House to consider seriously our proposals.  I urge the Government to listen to the families who need the domiciliary care allowance.  Treating families in this way is not acceptable.  Terms such as "inclusion" and "protecting the vulnerable" are empty and hollow words unless these children are treated in a fair and respectful way.  I caution the Government that it could be in breach of the Disability Act, which has clear guidelines.  I urge the Government to deal with this issue from a human rights point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The motion highlights that vulnerable families have encountered significant problems in accessing and retaining this vital support since the role of administering the domiciliary care allowance was transferred from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection in 2009.  While welcoming the original motivation for transferring this function, which was to ensure consistency and transparency in the way in which applicants from throughout the country were assessed through the institution of a centralised application facility, the lack of appropriate expertise in the field of behavioural and physical disability among deciding officers is causing a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The decision to schedule time for the discussion of this very emotive topic was made by the Technical Group in response to the ongoing and escalating appeals among constituents and representative organisations of children with special needs to pursue the Government with the aim of addressing the worrying escalation in application refusals, rulings of ineligibility for the allowance among those who have come to depend on the payment, and the excessive length of time to hear and adjudicate on appeals.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Representatives from Inclusion Ireland, Down's Syndrome Ireland and the Special Needs Parents Association came to Leinster House today to meet Members from the Technical Group.  I thank the parents for making their submissions today and we all listened closely to their stories.  A number of parents contacted me directly and I wish to quote a father's view as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_656">My son has an autism spectrum disorder which is a neurological condition and as such cannot be determined by a medical test.  This is why I feel the importance of medical eligibility for DCA is so unfair.  His diagnosis affects him, and others around him, in a more social way.  He has significant issues with communication and at 5 years of age is still non verbal.  Along with picture exchange systems, visual schedules and physical prompts he uses Lamh, which is a simplified version of ISL to communicate his needs and desires.  This means that not everyone knows how to communicate with my child.  As a result, he becomes very frustrated and starts to self harm by banging his head on the nearest object, be it a cushion or a wall, so he needs constant supervision as he has a very high pain threshold and wouldn't stop banging his head.  [This is the reality for a parent of a child with special needs.]</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_657">We are currently under review for this payment, and our file was received by the Department of Social Protection's medical assessors on the 20th of March.  I was informed by the Department that it takes 10/12 weeks to get a decision made by the medical assessors which means we must wait another 5 weeks for a decision from them, then our file will be returned to the department.  I don't know how much longer it will be with the deciding officer there before a final decision is made.  Which brings me to my first point, why does it take so long for this process to reach a conclusion?  It is stressful enough being the parent of a child with special needs without having to worry about where the money is going to come from for next week's OT session, or how am I going to pay for the tax on the car to keep it on the road so that I can bring my child to school?</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I also have a letter from a mother of a child with a disability as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_659">The Government have let me down so badly at a time when I really desperately need help.  All they have done is added to the stress.  I think about the DCA every day.  I do not know how long I will have to wait to see if the boy's got it.  If he doesn't, I can't get carers allowance and we will not survive financially.  Every day is a struggle for us.  It's like living in a battle zone, you can never truly relax.  I am so ashamed of this country and the way they treat children with disability, the most vulnerable group in society.  I am heart sick of having to fight for everything.  This is not the way it should be in a civilised society.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">Each year 2,500 children are not being assessed by the HSE within the legal time limits.  I ask the Minister to consider the wording of tonight's motion.  I urge her to listen to the parents and families.  I urge all Deputies to support the motion and give all parents of children with a disability an allowance that supports their needs in a compassionate and common-sense way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_661">The budget saw the Government's attempt to cut disability benefit.  It also cut the jobseeker's benefit for those aged from 18 to 21 from €188 to €100.  We now have the threat to take PA hours away from those with disability and we have had cuts in the one-parent family allowance.  These are some of the meanest cuts a government has ever made.  However, this must be one of the most vicious attempts to cut from families the lifeline of access to the care and money they need to raise their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">A number of Deputies have read letters received from parents of children with disabilities and I have one I wish to read into the record as follows.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_663">My son has been diagnosed with Asperger's, Dyspraxia, Sensory Processing Disorder and ADHD.  He was refused DCA on lack of medical evidence.  I am trying to lodge an appeal but does anyone know what the rate of success of these appeals are?  I just feel like I am going around in circles - from trying to get a diagnosis to trying to get him extra help in school.  I had to go private for everything.  Any advice what to put in an appeal?</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_664">We had the same problem nearly 2 years ago with our eldest [son].  He was diagnosed with autism and trying to get anything from the state was an uphill battle.  They don't give anything out on the first application.  Everything must be appealed and re-reviewed.  In our 2nd attempt for the DCA we got a letter of support from his teacher, speech &amp; language therapist, GP and the Brothers of Charity (who diagnosed him initially).  All the letters told how bad autism affected him, his sibling and us and how the allowance would benefit us (parents) because of the extra outgoings.  The letters told the truth, all be it a darker picture of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">In today's briefing all the parents made the same point in saying that everything is a battle in trying to get support for their children.  They report not being listened to by health professionals when problems first appear at a young age; having to fight for an SNA in school; being refused DCA on first application;  having to get costly professional reports for appeals; and having won an appeal then being faced with a review.  There is a widespread suspicion among parents that the 50% refusal rate for first applications, of which 50% are overturned on appeal, and the increase in reviews reflect an attitude in the Department of cutting costs and making savings rather than assisting in a sensitive way to ensure that children with special needs and their families are given the support they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The term "special needs" may be politically correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">It can give the impression to many people that we are talking about children who might need a little extra attention to help them keep up in school.  The reality is very different when dealing with Asperger's syndrome, autism or attention deficit disorder and often children can suffer from a combination of these illnesses.  Organisations representing children and parents, such as Down Syndrome Ireland, Irish Autism Action and the Special Needs Carers Association, are demanding a full review of the whole system.  There is a problem with the use of ICD-10 diagnostic codes.  While accepting they can be useful for research into statistics, for which there is not even a proper basis in Ireland, their use in determining eligibility for allowances is a major problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">There is a serious problem if 52% of refusals are overturned on appeal.  This causes huge stress and costs for parents.  With only 21 days to get professional assessments, reports and advice, people are forced to go to private professionals, with the ensuing costs, because of waiting times for appointments in the public health service.  Where public health professionals are involved, there is a considerable cost to the HSE.  Another problem with the high level of refusals is that the domiciliary care allowance is a gateway to other benefits such as the carer's allowance, the family home benefits package and others.  A refusal of the DCA is a back door to the refusal of these other benefits, which are very much needed by families to support their children in their illnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Time after time, Government Deputies have raised the issue of the problems surrounding the domiciliary care allowance.  There must be a proper review of it.  Even if the Minister does not want to listen to our motion, and thinks the Government knows better, at least she should call a conference of the parents and ask them what they need and what processes should be put in place.  There should be a special unit parents could go to as soon as a child is found out to have an illness, where they can be informed what medical advice they need, what forms they need, what processes are necessary and what timeframe is involved.  There should also be a time limit on this; we put in seven weeks to hear and adjudicate on summary and oral appeals.  These processes must be put in place to support families.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_670">I support this motion and commend the Technical Group on introducing it.  The first thing we must realise is that life for families where there is one or more children with special needs is a daily struggle.  All of us in this House see parents on a daily basis who explain exactly what life is like for them.  It is a struggle and as parents get older they worry how the children will be cared for after their deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Parents have told us today how they must fight for everything.  On many occasions, they are not listened to, particularly early on, and if there had been an early diagnosis there would be a better outcome.  Unfortunately, it is often much too late when the diagnosis is made.  There are waiting lists for speech therapy and psychological assessments of up to two years.  Suddenly the child is five or six, or even in some cases ten or 11, before the diagnosis is made and a person can start to look for the support services.  That is a huge problem for parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Families in this situation should be supported and should not have to worry about the domiciliary care allowance.  As others have said, the loss of the €309 per month domiciliary care allowance leads to the loss of the carer's allowance, as much as €204 per week, and the household benefits package.  Those are significant losses.  The vast majority, if not all, of these parents will not be working.  They will be at home looking after the child.  In the event of the domiciliary care allowance being lost, it does not mean the person can go to work.  They must stay at home to look after the children but without the assistance of the domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance to allow them to avail of support services.  The Department should, as called for in the motion, review the scheme and ensure a reasonable timeframe is put in place.  We have asked for a period of seven weeks, a reasonable timeframe for a decision on these applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">This is only the tip of the iceberg in the social welfare area.  Headline rates have not been changed, which was built up as a huge commitment by the Labour Party in particular before the last election, but that has acted as a smoke screen for dismantling other social welfare services and benefits, services that have been hard won by generations of workers and their unions.  There have been cuts in jobseeker's allowance, reductions in the time period for jobseeker's allowance, reduction in the time period for illness benefit, increases in the pension age, increases in the number of contributions for widow's and State pensions, the abolition of the half rate illness benefit, the abolition of the half rate jobseeker's benefit, cuts in the fuel allowance, cuts in heating benefits and they go on and on.  I believe the instruction has gone out, be it written, verbal or even unspoken, from the Department that the criteria for all these schemes might not have changed on paper but there is a new strictness in their implementation.  That is a scandal and it should be overturned.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_674">I am delighted to speak on the motion this evening and compliment my colleagues in the Technical Group on tabling it and doing so much research.  It is easy to do the research because we all hear stories in our offices from families, parents, single parents and guardians of children with special needs having had their allowances savagely cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">My late brother was a paediatrician in south Tipperary and specialised in many of these areas.  His main findings were that these people, parents and children, just needed someone to listen to them and support them.  That is the problem they have now.  The sweeping changes and long delays with reviews lead them to have to battle the system.  It is bad enough for the parents who have discovered the child they love has special needs without having to fight the State at every turn.  The Minister is a compassionate woman and understands this area so I beg her to please look at the sensitivities in this motion and take this area away from the cuts because this is one section of society that needs support and nurturing.  We are lucky to have parents caring for their children in the home.  What would it cost to keep them in State care?</p>
          <p eId="para_676">There is a trick of the light in the Department of Social Protection.  It is maintaining headline rates while introducing sweeping cuts.  The forms for this allowance are cold and insensitive, and must be filled out with different reports from different medical practitioners, sometimes at enormous cost.  We all welcomed the change from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection but we must learn from our mistakes.  A mistake has been made here because at least in the HSE medically competent people were available, although they are available to the Department.  The timeframe must be reduced to seven weeks because it is too unwieldy and cumbersome and places too much pressure on families.  Everything is a constant battle.  They have enough of a battle within their own four walls to maintain some level of dignity for their child and themselves so why must they fight the State?</p>
          <p eId="para_677">It was a mistake to remove the scheme.  We learn by our mistakes and the man or woman who never made a mistake never made anything.  The Minister should hand the scheme back to the HSE, much as we might criticise that organisation.  This system of rigorous tests and appeals and oral hearings did not obtain at the time anyway, when it was removed.  Parents are at their wits' end.  They want to care for their child and do not want to fight the State, day in, day out.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">As others have observed, this savage cut is a gateway to other cuts.  We have heard of Charlie McCreevy and his dirty dozen, fadó fadó.  This cut supersedes all other cuts.  The removal of this grant aid will become a gateway to all the cuts that were mentioned, such as carer's allowance, half-carer's allowance, and many others.  This gate must be closed and sealed.  We must do this compassionately and in the interests of the children.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_687">from the Department of Social Protection;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_688">recognises the vital role played by spending on social welfare in enabling people to live with dignity and the importance of the DCA in supporting families with children who need substantial levels of care and attention;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_689">notes that the DCA is now a statutory scheme as provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008. The medical criteria set out in the legislation requires that the child has a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention substantially in excess of the care and attention normally required by a child of the same age and the disability is such that the child is likely to require full-time care and attention for at least 12 months;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_690">acknowledges that the Department of Social Protection has in place an equitable standardised application and assessment process whereby all cases are examined and dealt with on an individual basis;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_691">notes that the application process operated by the Department involves the submission of a detailed statement by the parent or guardian of the child, as well as a detailed statement by the child's own general practitioner and any other relevant evidence from qualified experts who have examined the child. This evidence is then assessed by designated Departmental Medical Assessors who have received training in the area of child disability;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_692">notes that the DCA supports 24,000 families and some 26,000 children at a cost of €100 million per annum. This along with the Respite Care Grant payment amounting to €45 million in 2011, represents an increase in spending of some €7 million over 2010;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_693">further recognises that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_694">— against the backdrop of significant reductions in expenditure on social protection that there have been no cuts in the level of spending on the DCA and that this scheme has been specifically protected from cuts by this Government and that it continues to be paid at the monthly rate of €309.50;</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_697">— all social welfare schemes have set conditions and that the receipt of DCA is a prerequisite for the receipt of Carer's Allowance, Respite Care Grant and the Household Benefits package where this is claimed in respect of care given to a child under 16 years old;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_698">acknowledges the considerable steps that have been taken to improve communication with parents and notes the improvements that have been made in this regard resulting in:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_699">— parents now being informed by the Department of Social Protection of the review date that will apply in their case when their claim is initially awarded; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_700">— parents also being afforded 60 days in which to obtain and return evidence following notification of review. This will address parent's concerns on the time frame allowed and will provide them with additional time to gather supporting documentation or medical reports they may wish to submit in advance of the review date;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_701">acknowledges the significant steps that have been made to speed up the appeal process for all social welfare appeals and notes that the success rate on DCA appeals, at 46%, is broadly in line with that on other social welfare schemes;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_702">affirms that copies of documents are made available to parents on request within a reasonable timeframe;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_703">and further notes that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_704">— the Minister for Social Protection has instructed the Department of Social Protection to liaise with other relevant Departments, namely the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, who have a role in providing supports and services to map the availability of services and to examine the scope for greater linkage and consistency in the assessment for such supports and services;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_705">— the Government has established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to examine and make recommendations on a number of issues around the operation and interaction of the tax and social protection system to address how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes and that the Group is currently examining the area of disability;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_706">— the Department of Social Protection will urgently undertake a policy review of the DCA in order to clarify its objectives, consider whether legislative change is required, and consider whether the current administrative and medical processes need further refinement in view of the outcome of this; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_707">— as part of this review, the Department will consider the question of the duration of review periods for the DCA, based on the medical condition of the children involved, whilst taking account of other priority demands on the medical resources of the Department."</p>
          <p eId="para_708">I appreciate the contributions of all the Deputies who are concerned about this issue.  The State pays the domiciliary care allowance, or DCA, to parents or guardians in recognition of what everybody who is a parent would acknowledge to be the absolutely heroic and selfless role parents play in raising children who experience some form of disability.  As parents, that has been the experience of all of us, among people we know or from our relatives who have children with special needs.  There is no disagreement in any part of the House in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">I offer a brief overview of the scheme, its role and purpose.  The domiciliary care allowance scheme represents a very important support to parents and guardians who live with and care for children with a disability.  DCA was originally introduced in the early 1970s in recognition of the extra care and attention provided by parents of children with a severe disability, who are cared for in their own home - hence the name.  Responsibility for the administration of the scheme remained with the health boards or the HSE until April 2009 although it had been planned to move it much earlier.  When it transferred to the Department of Social Protection it was put on a statutory footing.  It is important to remember that before this happened the way the scheme was administered varied from area to area throughout the country.  The change was made following a review which happened during the Government of Fianna Fáil.  The Department of Social Protection is the right home for the scheme given its role in providing income support.  The community welfare service was also transferred to the Department following the same review.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment to the parent or guardian of a child who requires care and attention and-or supervision that is substantially in excess what another child of the same age would receive.  The allowance is paid at the rate of €309.50 per month.  This rate has been specifically protected by this Government from a reduction of any kind, against the backdrop of significant reductions in expenditure generally.  The  Department now pays DCA for 26,000 children.  That is a net increase of 3,000 children since the Department took over responsibility for the scheme from the HSE in April 2009.  Given their notion that the number of children being awarded the DCA has somehow or other been cut or reduced, I put it to Deputies that the figures are entirely different.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Spending on the scheme, and on the respite care grant which is automatically paid to all recipient parents, has increased from €138 million to €145 million between 2010 and 2011.  Total expenditure on both payments in 2012 is expected to be in the region of €146 million.  I emphasise there have been no cuts to this scheme, neither in the amount nor in the number of children and parents being awarded the DCA, which has gone up by many thousands.  During the period from 1 April 2009 to 31 December 2011, a total of 13,552 applications were received from parents or guardians of children with a disability, with 6,298 children being awarded the allowance, amounting to 46% of all claims processed.  I will go through the figures again for the Deputies.  There are now 26,000 children in 24,000 families who are in receipt of this very important allowance.  However, 6,298, or a quarter, of those have been awarded the allowance since it was transferred to the Department.  Therefore, the suggestion that somehow or other officials or doctors in the Department of Social Protection are hostile in any way to the parents of children with a disability and are refusing to award the payments to parents is simply wrong.  It may be that not everybody who has applied has received the award.  I noted carefully that the Deputies who spoke on this almost invariably referenced the issue of children who are on the autism spectrum.  I notice they did not mention any other area of disability, whether in respect of either a physical or an intellectual disability.  Statements have been made in the House to the effect that there is an effort to stop people entering the scheme but, in fairness to the staff of the Department of Social Protection, the figures do not bear this out.  On the contrary they show an increase.</p>

          <p eId="para_715">Parents who receive domiciliary care allowance also qualify for carer's allowance and household benefits, subject to fulfilling certain criteria.  Some 40% of those on the scheme receive these payments.  Those who receive the carer's allowance and household benefits package, in addition to the DCA and respite care grant, receive a total of €16,742 per annum from the Department.  It is a very significant and important expenditure and the Department has been very happy to administer it.  Many thousands of additional awards have been made since the Department took over the scheme.  It is necessary for Deputies to be fair to some of the staff of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">I reiterate, the number of claims in payment has increased steadily over the years, from 11,000 in 2001 to over 23,000 in early 2009 at around the time the Department of Social Protection took over the administration of the scheme.  Now the figure is 26,000 children.  When they are aged 16 years children leave the scheme and many go on to receive disability benefit.  The number, therefore, is a net 3,000 but an additional 6,000 children were awarded the grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">In 2009, the average number of applications received under the scheme was 92 per week.  This compares with 105 per week in 2010, 106 per week in 2011 and 83 per week to date in 2012. This year, it is expected that applications will average out at about 100 per week.  More generally, it is also worth pointing out that the Department makes an extensive range of payments to support families with children.  In 2011, some €2.08 billion was paid out in respect of 1.13 million children on child benefit. In addition, qualified child increases were also paid to people on social welfare payments in respect of some 495,000 children, with 369,000 at the full rate and 126,000 at the half rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">I refer to the qualifying conditions for the scheme, or how applications are assessed and reviews conducted.  To qualify for the domiciliary care allowance, the child must be under 16 years of age and have a disability requiring care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  The care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time.  Eligibility for the domiciliary care allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition but on the degree of extra care and attention the child needs.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.  No specific condition or disability rules a child in or out of qualifying for the allowance.  Applications for children with autism and other intellectual disabilities are treated in exactly the same manner as applications for children with other types of disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">To apply for the scheme, parents or guardians submit their detailed statement as well as a statement by the child's general practitioner and any other relevant evidence from qualified experts who have seen the child.  Parents and guardians choose the GPs and specialists.  it is important that the child is treated by his or her doctor or specialist.  It would be very strange to do otherwise.  Following this, the Department's medical assessor reviews the history of the case, considers all medical reports received and considers the description of the care and attention required by the child, as set out by the parent or guardian.  Overall, the award and refusal rates have remained broadly the same over the three-year period in which the Department has been processing claims, with 46% of claims being awarded and 54% refused the allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The review interval recommended by the medical assessor will vary from 12 months in cases where the child's disability is likely to improve significantly because the child is undergoing treatment, to a five or ten-year review date if the child's condition is likely to remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.  If a child has a lifelong disability that is unlikely to improve by any significant degree, the Department does not review the case.  Reviews form an integral part of all social welfare schemes and are necessary to ensure payments continue to be made only to those who meet the qualifying conditions.  We are required to ensure that by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This may be different if it was in the HSE, as some Deputies suggests, but moving this scheme to the Department of Social Protection was generally welcomed as a positive move because it is an income support measure and concerns the care and attention required rather than the medical condition.  Cases are reviewed based on either a scheduled review on the recommendation of the medical assessor or on information received about a change of circumstances, which potentially affects the continued entitlement of a case already in payment.  Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of the medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child's disability and how care needs may change over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Where claims are reviewed, parents or guardians are asked to provide relevant, up-to-date medical evidence and details of the additional care needs of their child.  I extended the time allowed for the return of the review form and up-to-date medical evidence from 21 days, as it was under the previous Minister, to 60 days.  That addressed the concern of parents who found the shorter timeframe caused difficulty.  When the claim is initially awarded, parents are now advised when it will be reviewed.  The Department gets in contact with parents three months in advance of the review date to provide a five-month period in which to put together a statement or claim.  The information provided by the parent or guardian for review is assessed by a medical assessor and a decision is made based on the medical opinion provided.  Where payment is stopped as a result of a review, the parent or guardian is invited to submit any further information to be considered and the information is further examined.  The parent or guardian may also appeal the decision directly to the social welfare appeals office.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Positive changes were made to the scheme on its transfer to the Department in 2009.  It now operates on a statutory basis with the primary legislation provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008.  Prior to the transfer, the eligibility criteria for the scheme was set out by way of a circular from the then Department of Health and Children.  The medical criteria - as set out in that circular - stated that children "who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age may qualify for DCA".  The operation of the scheme on a statutory basis ensures consistency of approach to all claims.  It would be a retrograde step for the scheme to return to its previous operational basis.  Another significant improvement is that eligibility to the allowance is no longer subject to a means test as was the case under the HSE.  I ask Deputies to think about that.  The numbers of children awarded benefit under the scheme since its transfer to the Department of Social Protection speak for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The medical criteria, as set out in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008, is almost identical, requiring that "the child has a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention substantially in excess of the care and attention normally required by a child of the same age".  However, prior to taking over responsibility for the scheme in 2009, the then Minister convened an expert medical group to draw up a set of consistent and objective guidelines for use in determining the medical eligibility of children for the scheme.  The group was chaired by the Department's chief medical advisor and comprised senior medical personnel from the HSE and eminent professionals in the areas of physical disabilities that affect children and experts in child psychiatry and psychology.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The group considered that the most appropriate way for the Department to conduct assessments for medical eligibility was by assessing evidence submitted by the parent or guardian rather than by individual examination by the Department's medical assessors, who are not involved in the ongoing treatment of the child.  The experts in the area recommended this system of assessment.  Departmental medical assessors received special training in human disability evaluation.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">I listened with great attention to a number of Deputies.  Every Deputy referred to the shortage of services.  Traditionally, income support has been assessed and delivered separately to services.  Deputies referred to the importance of speech and language therapy to some children with autism and autism spectrum difficulties.  During the years of a lot of money in this country, there was much emphasis on paying income in cash directly.  Perhaps the emphasis in those years should have been on developing and employing speech therapists.  It is of great importance to the children about which Deputies spoke.  An integrated assessment of need would take account of the need for various health, personal care and educational services and the need, if any, for income support.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Deputies referred to the assessment of need under the Disability Act.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, who will be speaking in this debate tomorrow night, is making progress with regard to the assessment of needs of those with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The advisory group on tax and social welfare is currently examining a number of the issues relating to the operation of the disability allowance and the age threshold.  I said before in the House that in my view the parents should be paid the allowance for anyone under 18 years.  This is my personal view.  I also asked my officials to liaise with their colleagues in the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the Department of Education and Skills, who have a role in providing supports and services to children with disabilities in order to map the availability of services and to ascertain if an opportunity exists for greater connection and consistency in the assessment for such supports and services.  It is an issue of income but also it is an issue of services.  The Department of Social Protection does not provide services, rather it provides income support.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The Department is also undertaking an urgent review of the allowance policy.  I am undertaking this review in order to clarify its objectives, to consider whether legislative change is required and to consider whether the current administrative and medical processes need further refinement in light of the review.  As part of this review, the question of the duration of review periods for the allowance will be considered, based on the medical condition of the children involved, while taking account of other priority demands on the medical resources of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I am aware of the heroic efforts of parents to support their children.  I wish to assure the House that I am well aware of the vital role played by the income supports paid by the Department of Social Protection in enabling people to live with dignity and to support their children.  The Department does not directly supply services and for many of the parents the services are a critical issue for aiding the progress of their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">Many of the matters raised in the motion are within the remit of the HSE and the services it provides.  I wish to assure the House that the staff of my Department, which works on this scheme, understand the concerns of parents and the pressures they feel in dealing with the challenges in their lives.  All claims are dealt with in a professional manner and all cases are dealt with on an individual basis and decided on merit, according to the eligibility criteria set out in the scheme.  There have been no cutbacks in this area.  There have been no policy of cutbacks initiatives by staff on their own behest or at the behest of anyone else.  The fact that more than 6,000 extra children have been awarded the domiciliary care allowance should be acknowledged, considering the comments about the staff and officials in my Department.  There have been no instructions issued by anyone in Government to cut back in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_732">The budget was difficult but because of the state of the economy difficult decisions were made with regard to social welfare.  Specifically, the domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance were protected.  I said this at the time of the budget because I regarded it as very important to protect those payments.  One quarter of the number of children now in receipt of the payment have been awarded it by my Department.  I can understand the Deputies' concern about individual cases but to say there is an agenda being pursued by staff in the Department or by medical assessors to deprive parents of children of the domiciliary allowance is simply not borne out by the fact of the numbers.</p>

          <from>Deputy Colm Keaveney</from>
          <p eId="para_734">Domiciliary care allowance is payable in respect of children under 16 years of age who have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and-or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be given by another person effectively full-time.  In that respect, I salute those carers for their dedication and their commitment to domiciliary care.  That care is offered to the child so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Eligibility for the domiciliary care allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted and no specific condition or disability qualifies or disqualifies a child from qualifying for the allowance.  Applications for children with autism and other intellectual disabilities are processed in exactly the same manner as applications for children with other types of disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The Department's target is to process domiciliary care allowance claims within seven  weeks.  Currently, the average time period to process a domiciliary care allowance application is eight weeks.  We agree with the principles set out in the motion and as outlined by Deputy Joan Collins with regard to the processing of claims.  During the first quarter of 2012, the average waiting time for appeals dealt with by summary decisions was 22.4 weeks and 40.9 weeks for those that required an oral hearing.  The comparable times for 2011 were 25 weeks and 52.5 week,s respectively.  There have been no cuts made to the scheme in recent budgets and the rate of payment remains at €309.50 per month, as reaffirmed by the Minister in her contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Prior to April 2009, the domiciliary care allowance scheme was administered by the Health Service Executive.  Since it transferred to the Department of Social Protection, the scheme has been placed on a statutory basis, as provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008.  This is to be welcomed.  The medical criteria as set out in the legislation requires that in order to qualify for the allowance, the child must be in need of care and attention and-or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  Prior to taking responsibility for the scheme, the Department convened an expert medical group to draw up a set of consistent and objective guidelines for use in determining the medical eligibility of children for the scheme.  The group was chaired by the Department's chief medical advisor and comprised of senior medical personnel from the HSE, as well as eminent professionals.  The group considered the most appropriate methods for conducting the assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I refer to the statistics associated with the scheme.  The domiciliary care allowance is paid to over 24,000 parents or guardians in respect of 26,000 children at a cost of approximately €100 million in 2011 and with the accompanying respite care grant costing a further €45 million.  The number of claims has increased steadily over the course of the years, with 11,000 in 2011, 23,000 in 2009 and 26,000 in 2012, an increase of 3,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">A review policy is an integral part of all social welfare schemes and is necessary to ensure payments continue to be made only to those customers who meet the qualifying conditions.  In circumstances where a child has a lifelong disability that is unlikely to improve to any significant degree, I welcome the fact that the Minister has confirmed that a "do not review again" status may be used on that file by the medical assessor.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Service users or clients who are reviewed are asked to provide relevant up-to-date medical evidence and details of the additional care needs of their child.  They are now afforded a 60-day reference period in which to return this information to the Department.  I am glad to say that where payment is stopped as a result of the review, the family is invited to submit further information in order to secure a payment.  Up to now, service users or customers were requested to return medical review forms and supporting information within 21 days.  I welcome the Minister's confirmation that the reference period will now be 60 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Following a review of the current 21-day timeframe, that extension will provide an adequate opportunity for families to provide supporting evidence with regard to processing the claim.  I am delighted that the Minister intends to undertake a policy review of the allowance over the course of the next nine months.  It gives the Department an opportunity to clarify the objectives of the policy, to consider what legislative change is required and also consider what refinement of current administrative and medical processes is needed in the context of the existing system.  As part of this review, the question of the duration of review periods for the allowance must be actively considered, based on the medical condition of the children involved, while taking account of other priority demands on the medical resources required to underpin adequate and acceptable care for that child.  The primary objective has to be the care of those children and the support of their families.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_256">
          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_742">I wish to respond initially to what the Minister had to say about the 3,000 extra claimants' cases since 2009.  We acknowledge that but we dispute the review initiated last year by the Department on her instructions.  The statistics emanating from that review do not lie.  The real stories emanating from that review form the basis of tonight's motion.  The Minister spoke about a review of the whole DCA structure, which is supposed to pacify us and those whom we represent.  I have no doubt that Members on the Government benches have also been inundated by representations from families who have been affected by this review.  I hope the Government side will take cognisance of those statistics and what constituents are saying throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">A fortnight ago, many families from across the country protested both here in Dublin and in Cork city against what we would term one of the most underhand and vicious cuts implemented by the Government.  They were protesting on behalf of the most vulnerable children in society, many of whom are unable to speak for themselves.  The covert cutbacks to a payment that these children are utterly reliant upon exposes the cold strategy of the Government to mask its own failures with a devastating series of below-the-radar cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I welcome the Technical Group's motion as an opportunity for us to raise the plight of the families who gathered here two weeks ago, many of whom are in the Gallery this evening.  Their profound difficulties with the escalating series of cuts, straining their already stretched resources and undermining their ability to care for severely disabled children, is the human side of insidious cutbacks.  For parents of children with special needs, and severely autistic children, the DCA is used for vital services such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapy and other special needs therapies.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">These types of key treatments are absolutely essential if these children are to be in a position to get the most out of their lives.  At €309.50 per month, the payment represents the difference between making ends meet and things falling apart for families trying to provide a good upbringing for their vulnerable children.  Given the severe financial pressure that these families are now under, this motion is a timely chance for the Government to reflect on its policy.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I am calling on the Government to completely reverse its policy on the domiciliary care allowance review process.  I ask the Minister to note that we are here to discuss the review process.  Deputy Micheál Martin recently pressed the Taoiseach on this issue at Leaders' questions.  He outlined the grim nature of the cuts that have been insidiously introduced.  Almost 50% of children with autism and special needs have had their payments taken from them.  He cited a letter sent by the Department to the parents of one autistic child with serious challenges.  The quotation from that letter is indicative of many similar letters sent to such parents, carers and guardians.  It stated: "The needs of your child are no different than that of any six year old."</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The increasingly draconian restrictions on the domiciliary care allowance are further compounded by hits to the family income supplement and carer's allowance.  Families who face major challenges in raising their special needs children must now face further hurdles put in their way by the Government.  The DCA is now paid to 26,000 children across 24,000 families, with spending on the scheme and the respite care grant, which is automatically paid to all recipients, reaching €145 million in 2011.  This money is an integral part of the budget of the families of those 26,000 children who need this payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">The Department of Social Protection took over responsibility for the scheme from the Health Service Executive in April 2009.  Under this Government, and especially since last year, I make no apologies for saying that it has ramped up efforts to reduce payments under the DCA.  The Government review announced over a year ago has prompted a drastic cutback in the DCA.  Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required that parents provide.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis, but the Government is utilising that very process to reduce the number of recipients and lower spending.  For example, this January, following a review of their claims, 57 claimants were notified that they no longer qualified for the payment.  A savings figure of €326,239 relating to these 57 DCA claims and associated respite care grants has been recorded.  This figure will further increase when the savings figure relating to any associated carers allowance is finalised.  It is this money that these families need to pay for the therapies and services that are integral to ensuring these children have the opportunity to get the most out of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The Government reviewed 402 cases last year and cut the domiciliary care allowance for almost half the children involved.  The families of 193 of these children were suddenly told that they will no longer receive the payment.  Most of these are children with autism over the age of four.  The Minister said that Opposition speakers were only representative of children with autism.  We are not, but the figures do not lie.  These statistics emanate from last year's reviews.  These are children with profound learning and intellectual challenges.  The DCA was used by their families as a payment to fund vital services.  The process did not include any face-to-face assessment of the children affected, so officials had no first-hand knowledge of the care they required.  The review also ignored medical evidence of the children's conditions, and the evidence from parents about the level of care and attention the children need.  People are justifiably wondering how the decisions on cuts were made.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The difficulties do not stop at the subtle elimination of the DCA for hundreds of families.  Appealing the decision takes weeks, and many more weeks than the period suggested by the Government spokesperson earlier in this debate.  According to information from the Department, based on figures for the first quarter of 2012, the average waiting time for appeals dealt with by summary decisions was 22.4 weeks, and 40.9 weeks for those that required an oral hearing.  Families unfairly hit by an inadequate review process are left for months with no recourse and grave uncertainty about their financial future.  In short, the reviews put in place by the Government lack transparency, appear to have taken no face to face assessment of the child in question and have all the appearances of the worst aspects of bureaucracy.  Most pointedly, they have hit vulnerable, autistic children the hardest.  I emphasise that the statistics that emanate from those reviews point to those facts.  A review process that leaves hundreds of vulnerable families who use a payment to provide a better quality of life for their children bereft of support is a flawed review system.  The Government must change this compromised review service - not carry out a review that will take another eight months and that will be similar to other reviews called for by this Minister for reviews in the Department of Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">The steady reduction in the domiciliary care allowance reflects a broader approach by the Government towards covert cuts.  It has made hay out of defending headline efforts such as not reducing social welfare rates but in truth the axe has fallen hard on those least able to bear it.  The Government policy is to bring cuts in through the back door on the parts of society least able to shout about it, least able to have the massive unions behind them or to have the sort of lobby groups that are needed in order to grab the Government's attention.  Behind a slick spin operation the Government has systematically introduced a raft of cutbacks that place a hefty burden upon the shoulders of those struggling to make ends meet and that make a complete mockery of claims that it defends the most vulnerable in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">In areas such as fuel allowance, family income supplement, community employment schemes, jobseeker's benefit, child benefit and farm assist the Government has slashed with nothing but newspaper headlines in mind rather than the actual impact the cuts will have on the most vulnerable sections of our society.  Only a strong public backlash against the callous cuts to the disability allowance forced it to backtrack earlier this year following the budget.  Further public dismay at the inevitable impact of community employment schemes cuts prompted another pause by the Minister which is quickly becoming her trademark, as I said earlier in regard to the reviews of several of the entitlements within her remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">In reality while the slow, covert cuts to domiciliary care allowance have taken time to work their way through the system they are having a devastating impact upon hard pressed families.  In a similar vein, carer's allowance is now calculated as income for the purposes of the family income supplement.  This will have a major impact on hundreds of families across the country who rely on family income supplement to make ends meet and they will find themselves now ineligible.  The devastating impact of these measures across various exposed sections of Irish society show up the fiction of the Government's social protection policy.  Last month's calculated effort to deflect attention away from a cut to the one parent family allowance is part of this policy of spin.  The Government strategy is to appear to be avoiding cuts while in fact bringing them in covertly.  The recent Social Welfare and Pensions Bill is a testament to that strategy but its impact upon ordinary families and its potential in condemning a generation of one parent families to the poverty trap will be felt for many years to come.  The insidious nature of the cuts, shrouded by Government spin belies the devastating impact they will have.  The domiciliary carers allowance cuts are a strong example of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">We must highlight that this Government cannot hide from the facts.  The Government has abandoned the progressive budgetary strategy developed over the past few years and pursued a regressive policy.  The ESRI has studied in detail the impact of the budgets over these past most difficult, financially challenging years.   It found that budget 2012 imposed greater percentage losses on those with low incomes.  Callan, Keane, Savage and Walshe, as detailed in the ESRI special articles, concluded that budget 2012 involved greater proportionate losses for those on low incomes, reductions of about 2% to 2.5% for those with the lowest incomes, as against losses of approximately 0.75% for those on the highest incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The regressive policy by the Government is a stark contrast, believe or not, to the budgetary policy pursued under Fianna Fáil.  The paper I mentioned found that since October 2008 losses imposed by tax <i> </i>and welfare policies have been greatest for those on highest incomes, with a lesser impact on middle income groups and the least impact on those with low incomes, as compared to budget 2012.  It found the same pattern prevailed in public sector pay cuts, with the higher paid bearing the brunt. </p>
          <p eId="para_755">The Government has failed miserably to emulate this tough but fair approach.  Instead it has relied upon spin to mask its covert, insidious cuts that have had a regressive impact upon Irish society placing the burden of fiscal adjustment upon those least able to bear it.  Those families affected by the underhand cuts to the domiciliary care allowance know all too well what is a regressive policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">I would like to take this opportunity to once more call upon the Government to change the policy in regard to the review the Minister initiated last year.  The impact upon ordinary families who are trying to make the most of life for their children is too deep.  The review process is too flawed and utterly impersonal.  The effect on vulnerable children is and will be too devastating.  Tonight's motion is a chance for the Minister to come out from behind the wall of spin, acknowledge a mistake and change course.  We acknowledge and do not dispute the fact that more cases have come on stream since responsibility for this measure moved to the Minister's Department in 2009.  We acknowledge that there have been 3,000 new cases and we welcome that-----</p>

They are the reason we, members of the Minister's party and Government backbenchers are receiving representations throughout the country.  They know too well the effect that this review and the impersonal nature of the review process that is in place is having on these families who have children with special needs and especially on those who have autistic children.  I do not say that lightly.  As I said before the Minister re-entered the Chamber, that is as a result of the statistics that emanate from those reviews.  Fianna Fáil will support this motion and stand beside the most vulnerable members of this society.</p>

        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_759">I welcome the opportunity to speak on such an emotive and personal issue this evening.  We in Sinn Féin warmly welcome the spirit of this motion but we have concerns regarding some of the proposals that are being put forward.   We do not agree with the recommendation from the Technical Group that the domiciliary care allowance should be transferred from the Department of Social Protection back to the Department of Health; this in our view would not benefit these families in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, in fact we would view this as a counter-productive measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Logic would have it that all income support should be placed under the one roof.  It is evident that it is at the administration level that changes need to occur.  This motion also proposes that all domiciliary care allowance should be made by child protection or disability social workers. This in our view is extremely impractical; due to financial cutbacks we have a severe shortage of both social workers and disability workers.  If anything we should be attempting to lighten their load as they are currently severely overworked.  What we need are better guidelines and training for deciding officers</p>
          <p eId="para_761">According to recent figures from the Department of Social Protection, nearly two out of every three applications for domiciliary care allowance are refused.  This stands as a huge 62% refusal rate, which represents a trebling of the refusal rate for children with intellectual disabilities and autism since 2009 when the administration of this scheme was taken over by the Department of Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">These decisions are coming at a time when families across Ireland are struggling to cope.  There is a number of psychological, speech and language, occupational therapy and paediatrician reports outlining the need for extra care for these children and their families, yet these reports are continuously overruled.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Many of these parents cannot work outside of the home and this allowance is their only income in some instances.  Like many of my colleagues I have had many parents through my clinics majorly concerned at the thought of losing their vital allowance.  For example, just last month <i> </i>a mother of three young girls came to my clinic. Two were autistic. The mother proceeded to tell me that she only receives domiciliary care allowance for one but it is probably only a matter of time before she will get a review.  This woman has just been refused domiciliary care allowance for her youngest daughter, yet she has same diagnosis as her sister.  The family now awaits a review for the other daughter who is in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and is in great fear of losing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">Figures from the Department of Social Protection show that domiciliary care allowance is paid to more than 24,000 parents or guardians in respect of 26,000 children.  In 2011, 403 reviews were carried out, 187 families were found to be no longer eligible and 52 cases have yet to be finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The combined number of people who appealed review and first time application decisions last year was 2,420, and while 1,259, or 52%, of these appeals were successful, 48% were not.  In the past six months 213 domiciliary care allowance recipients have been found on review to be no longer eligible for the payment.  This enormous hike in refusal rates illustrates the severe lack of understanding in the Department of Social Protection about these families who desperately need this allowance.  This lack of understanding is also reflected in the flawed application process which places more pressure on families applying for a welfare payment, putting them through the stressful ordeal of appeals and oral hearings, not to mention the expense of this extended process on the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Parents are not given sufficient notice of the review to gather the supporting documentation from consultants and therapists which is necessary to re-establish eligibility successfully.  My colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, has made several recommendations to the Department on areas of improvement, specifically that parents should be granted a period of six months to prepare for the review.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">While I welcome the motion, I have concerns about some aspects of the proposals.  That said, the huge rise in refusal figures is of great concern, as refusal has a dramatic effect on the daily lives of families throughout Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_769">I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that the total amount provided from the Garda Vote in 2011 to the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors was as set out in the table which I am circulating with this answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">As the Deputy will see, the total funding provided in 2011 to the GRA was just under €228,000, and to the AGSI was just over €179,000, making a grand total of around €407,000.  The funding covered the salaries of members seconded to work for the Associations, as well as subventions for the accommodation and communication costs of the Associations.  The salary component of this funding, at around €103,000 for the GRA and around €117,000 for the AGSI, is in respect of 2 members at Garda rank seconded to the GRA and 2 members at Sergeant rank seconded to the AGSI, and is calculated by reference to each member's position on the relevant pay scale:</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_791">I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 106 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">I have no plans to introduce legislation to create a position of Prisoner Ombudsman, although as the Deputy will be aware from the situation in Northern Ireland that a statutory basis is not a prerequisite for the operation of such an office.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">The primary purpose of an ombudsman is to investigate complaints and make non-binding recommendations.  In the current circumstances it is difficult to see how one could justify diverting resources to establish a new office of Prisoner Ombudsman.  While no detailed cost analysis has been carried out, I note that the budget of the Northern Ireland Prisoner Ombudsman for the year 2011-2012 was  £646,000 (approximately €800,000) dealing with complaints from a prison population which is less than half of ours.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">My interest is not so much in the form but in the substance of how we ensure prisoners are properly and fairly treated.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">In addition to the oversight provided by the courts, the Inspector of Prisons and regular visits by the Council of Europe Committee on the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, we have internal procedures for addressing prisoner complaints.  An independent element is provided for by the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act 1925 which requires a visiting committee to be constituted for every prison in the State and one of the statutory duties of such committees is to hear any complaints which may be made to them by a prisoner.  Under new legislation to be prepared, I intend to make Visiting Committees more effective while they continue their role.  The arrangements for membership of the Committees will be changed and a link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons who also makes announced and unannounced visits to prisons during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">Notwithstanding the above, I am not satisfied that the existing Prison Service procedures are sufficiently robust and independent of the local staff to meet best practice. The Office of the Inspector of Prisons is a statutory independent office and I have asked the Inspector of Prisons to give consideration to this matter and to advise me as to the most appropriate approach to be taken in an Irish context so as to ensure compliance with best international practice.  The Inspector recently provided me with his report which is currently being considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_798">The new Garda rosters — the first in 40 years- were introduced nationwide on a pilot basis last Monday, 30th April.  It is a very significant organisational change in the Garda Síochána, one that will not only enhance the policing service throughout the country, but also have a positive impact on the working lives of members of the Garda Síochána and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">I would like to place on the record of the House my appreciation for the work done by Garda management, and indeed the Garda Associations, in developing this new roster. This is a hugely important milestone in the Croke Park process of reform. The new rosters will make more efficient use of resources right across the organisation. They are designed to provide a better match between the availability of Garda members on duty and fluctuating demand for policing services.  The new rosters will also respect the EU Working Time Directive and safeguard the health and welfare of members, giving a better work-life balance to members of the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">It is expected that the rosters will be cost-neutral.  Their objective is to maximise the efficient and effective deployment of Garda members at a time of reduced numbers in the Force, and it is that reduction in numbers which will deliver significant savings.</p>

        <b> Deputy Michael Moynihan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b>
         if he will outline on a county basis, the number of court cases in each court district that are currently being heard and have not been adjourned; the number that have been adjourned and the main reason for their adjournment; the number that have a hearing date set; the number that are awaiting a hearing date; and the way the Court Service intends to tackle backlogs in specific areas. 
        [22635/12]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_263">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_802">As the Deputy will be aware, under the Courts Service Act 1998, the management and administration of the courts is a matter for the Courts Service while the allocation of the business of the courts, scheduling of cases and management of lists are matters for the Judiciary and in particular the Presidents of the courts.  The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that, while currently statistics are not maintained on the number of adjournments, the Service works closely with the Judiciary to ensure that all cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.  I am circulating with this reply a tabular statement detailing the District Court backlogs around the country for December 2009, 2010 and 2011 and the Deputy will note that, generally, backlogs have not deteriorated.  The usual practice is that Court Presidents assign additional judges to assist where backlogs have arisen.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, until recently there were up to eight vacancies on the District Court and seven on the Circuit Court which prevented some additional sittings.  The Government has moved quickly to fill those key judicial posts and in the meantime I understand that priority was given to criminal sittings.  Moreover, the Courts Service has lost over 120 posts through retirements over the past two years yet I am informed that no Circuit or District Court sittings have been cancelled due to lack of staffing resources.  The Service continues, to the extent possible, to fill key front line posts by lateral transfers, increased flexibility in the use of staff resources, restructuring and redeployment where permissible. Detailed contingency plans are in place for Dublin, where there are high volume courts, to try to ensure that court sitting levels are maintained at 2011 levels notwithstanding decreased resources. A general contingency plan is also in place for provincial locations which can be tailored to circumstances in individual offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">As the Deputy has observed adjournments can give rise to delay.  The conduct of a case is a matter for the presiding judge but it is, however, important to understand that a judge may grant an adjournment for a wide variety of reasons, for example, where a case or a previous case takes longer than anticipated; unavailability of key participants — whether that is the judge who has seisin of the case, the legal practitioners or witness; or the case is not able to proceed due to the parties not being ready or due to issues around availability of evidence or disclosure.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">One reason for adjournments has been the requirement in some cases to seek a probation report which traditionally resulted in cases being adjourned to allow an assessment to be carried out.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this is being addressed through new work practices.  Since 2011, the Probation Service provides ‘same day' assessment reports as an option available to judges where Community Service orders are under consideration.  I understand this arrangement is working well in the majority of cases and by the end of 2011, almost a third of all Community Service assessments carried out by the Probation Service were completed on the same day.  A similar pilot arrangement in respect of pre-sanction reports has recently commenced in the District Courts in the Criminal Courts of Justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">I should add that an Expert Group has been considering, in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights, how delays might be remedied and I look forward to considering their report in the coming weeks.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b>
         the number of migrant women with dependant immigration status who are experiencing domestic violence who have requested independent status during each of the past four years; the number of these requests which have been granted by the Irish Naturalisation Immigration Service during each of those years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1505">It is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy as records on applications and decisions in relation to a change to a person's immigration status in the State are not broken down in this manner. It would require that every such application (some thousands in the period concerned) be examined to determine if domestic violence was a ground or was disclosed as a ground for the application and a factor in any decision to grant the application; the Deputy will appreciate that this would require an excessive amount of time and resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">However, I have been advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the experience in recent years has been that a relatively small number of non-EEA nationals apply to change their status on this basis. My officials have indicated that in total the number is likely to be no more than a dozen a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">INIS operates a flexible, pragmatic and humane approach to the status of non-EEA nationals (both men and women) who are in situations of domestic violence.  Any person in such a situation can approach INIS either directly or through an Garda Síochána or a non-governmental organisation and their case will be examined with sensitivity.  All cases are addressed on a individual basis and independent status is granted where the known circumstances of the case warrant it.  In considering the circumstances of each such application every effort is made to ensure that the most appropriate permission to remain in the State is granted consistent to overall public policy, the requirement to ensure that the integrity of the immigration system is upheld and, of course, to address the particular issues of the applicant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">I would point out that not every victim of domestic violence will require a new residence permission.  It is possible that a victim might be resident with their own independent status.  However, to date where applications were made and the persons concerned were able to substantiate their claim with appropriate reports, an immigration status was granted which allowed them access to the labour force and to apply for State aid where required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1509">This system works and I understand that organisations working with victims of domestic violence have publically acknowledged that cases are dealt with sensitively and compassionately. I have also asked INIS to keep the matter under review so to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of victims in the context of overall immigration public policy as well as policy on tackling domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">I would add that the primary concern for victims of domestic violence, whether they are Irish citizens or foreign nationals is their physical safety.  The concern is a primary focus of Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.</p>

            <p eId="para_1512">As I said earlier, the Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan contains a number of key objectives for the next three years one of which includes the expansion of a pilot community return project which commenced last October in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">This Community Return programme is an incentivised scheme run in conjunction with the Probation Service which provides for earned temporary release under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service.  I am satisfied that both Services have sufficient resources to support the scheme at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">The Probation Service has been able to manage and resource the scheme since its commencement last October and I am fully committed to ensuring this will continue.   As it is, the Probation Service has responsibility for the supervision and management of Community Service Orders in accordance with the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983 as amended by the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2011.  This work, <i>inter alia</i>, involves providing assessment reports to the Courts and managing the completion of the Orders by offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">I am also pleased to say that sanction was recently obtained to fill the vacant Probation Service Director post which will be advertised in the coming weeks.  In addition, a new  Interagency Unit involving staff from the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service is being established to develop and co-ordinate arrangements for the national roll out of this project. Dedicated resources from within both agencies will be assigned to the Unit with a view to creating an enhanced dynamic of interagency co-operation and maximising efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">The Irish Prison Service and Probation Service will also develop joint funding arrangements in order to maximize the availability of structured programmes in the community, providing reparation to society and assisting prisoners in their rehabilitation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1518">I published the Report into the escape by the prisoner referred to on the 28th March 2012.  As I stated then, the decision to send this prisoner to Loughan House was wrong.  At the time, I instructed the Director General of the Irish Prison Service to take all necessary steps to ensure that a mistake of this nature does not reoccur.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">I have since been assured by the Director General that measures have been taken to provide additional oversight in the decision making processes in order to ensure that such a decision cannot be made again in the future.  Where consideration is being given to the transfer of a prisoner serving a sentence for a homicide related offence to an open centre, the decision must now be made by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">All decision making staff and prison governors have been reminded of the need to take appropriate account of all the criteria to be applied to such decision making, in a balanced and considered manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">Regarding the incident to which the Deputy refers which occurred on 24 April 2012, 3 prisoners absconded from Loughan House and were pursued by prison staff. The 3 prisoners were subsequently apprehended by the Garda and were returned to custody within a number of hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">The prisoners in question had been transferred to Loughan House as part of their sentence management and all of them met the criteria for transfer to an open centre.  As the prisoners absconded from custody, they have now been returned to closed prisons for the duration of their sentences and will not be considered for any concessions for the remainder of their sentences including transfer to open centres or temporary release.</p>

            <p eId="para_1524">Work on the details of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010, which has been restored by the Government to the Dáil Order Paper, has been ongoing at my Department.  This has been necessary to take account of current Government policy which is committed, under the Programme for National Recovery, to "introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems, which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way". In the course of that work it has become clear that as well as a number of  amendments to address some outstanding policy matters a large number of technical amendments to the Bill will be necessary. As I outlined to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence on 7th March during our discussion of migration-related EU funding programmes, it is already anticipated that there would be several hundred such amendments to be dealt with and we have been considering how best to progress them including in co-operation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">At the Joint Committee I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced one. This would incorporate the anticipated amendments and address key outstanding issues several of which have been of previous concern to Members. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and I very much appreciate the constructive and business-like stance they have thus taken notwithstanding the protracted history of this piece of legislation.  It remains my objective under this new approach and mindful of the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring the new Bill to Government for approval and publication later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1527">The average number of prisoners in custody in Ireland has risen in the last 5 years, from 3,321 during 2007 to 4,389 during 2011, an increase of over 32%. Likewise the total number of committals to prison has also risen sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,318 in 2011 — an increase of over 45%. During the same period the number of prisoners on temporary release also rose from 210 on 30 November, 2007 to 811 on 30 November, 2011.  Rising prisoner numbers have placed enormous strain on the prison system across the board from accommodation to the provision of services including work training/education, health care and drug treatment services. During this period, as a result of the increase in the prison population, a number of prisons are operating well in excess of their stated bed capacities.  There does appear, however, to be a stabilising or levelling off in the increase in prisoner numbers being committed annually with 2011 recording only a 0.8% increase on the previous year. This compares to increases of 13.6%, 13.8% and 11.4% respectively year on year for 2008, 2009 and 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">As outlined in the recently published Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan it is intended to align the capacity of our prisons in line with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons by 2014 in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system. In 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 priority will be given to reducing the chronic overcrowding in Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick Prisons and the Dóchas Centre.  Significant investment has taken place in our prison estate in recent years with in excess of 900 new prison spaces having been constructed and brought into use since 2007. A new accommodation block at the Midlands prison which will provide a potential 300 additional spaces as well as additional work training and education facilities is due to become operational in late 2012.  Furthermore, in conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has commenced the roll out of the Community Return Programme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service.  In addition, the Fines Act 2010 includes a number of provisions designed to minimise the level of fine default and where it does occur, to ensure, as far as possible, that fine defaulters are not committed to prison.</p>

OP-CAT provides for a system of inspections of places of detention at UN level, and at national level by what the optional protocol refers to as National Preventative Mechanisms. The Deputy will be aware that a number of bodies in this jurisdiction already have responsibility for inspecting places of detention.  The Government has approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to enable ratification of OP-CAT. The Bill will make provision for the designation of National Preventative Mechanisms. Subject to competing legislative priorities, it is expected that the General Scheme will be published in mid 2012.   When work on preparation of the General Scheme has been completed, I will be seeking Government approval for its publication to facilitate a consultation process in advance of drafting and publication of the Bill.  Arrangements will be made to ratify the optional protocol as soon as possible after the necessary legislation has been enacted.</p>

In addition I am advised by the Garda authorities that information regarding the number of occasions where a fault has been reported in respect of a Garda vehicle is not readily available and that it could only be compiled through the use of significant resources which are required for other purposes.

            <p eId="para_1534">I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that a review of the prisoner gratuity payments and allowances system has been completed. The review covered all aspects of the current scheme including the daily allowance and approved work allowance.  On foot of this review it is proposed that three different levels of daily gratuity be introduced, with the rates being paid dependent on behaviour and level of engagement in structured activities and sentence plans. Under the proposal prisoners who are well behaved and engage actively with services should not see any substantive reduction in their gratuity payments.  It is also proposed to regularise the payment of working gratuities across the prison estate and only activities where prisoners provide services which would otherwise result in a cost to the prison service, such as catering and laundry, would qualify for the payment.  It is envisaged that the new scheme will result in an overall cost saving to the State.  I expect that the new scheme will be finalised shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1536">Deputy Broughan asked a similar question in May 2011 about the establishment of a Garda Authority and my views have not changed on this matter. I have no plans to introduce a Garda Authority and there is no such commitment in the Programme for Government.  The Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes clear that the Garda Commissioner is accountable to my Department and to me as Minister for the performance of his functions and those of the Force, and of course I am politically answerable in the House in respect of these matters.  The 2005 Act also made the Commissioner the Accounting Officer for the Garda Síochána, and liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in that capacity.  In addition, the 2005 Act established the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which is empowered to carry out independent investigations into Garda conduct, as well as the Garda Inspectorate, which provides expert advice on achieving the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Force.  The accountability of the Garda Síochána has, through these measures, been significantly strengthened.  I might also make the point that any comparison with accountability arrangements in other jurisdictions, should take into account the fact that the Garda Síochána is rare among police forces in combining security and intelligence functions with policing duties, and should look at the totality of arrangements in those jurisdictions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1540">The searching of persons in Garda custody is governed by  the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations 1987 and 2006, Statutory Instrument 119/1987 which states as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">Regulation 17(1) A member conducting a search of a person in custody shall ensure, so far as practicable, that the person understands the reason for the search and that it is conducted with due respect for the person being searched.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">(2) A person in custody shall not be searched by a person (other than a doctor) of the opposite sex.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">(3) Where a search of a person involves removal of clothing, other than headgear or a coat, jacket, glove or similar article of clothing, no person of the opposite sex shall be present unless either that person is a doctor or the member in charge considers that the presence of that person is necessary by reason of the violent conduct of the person to be searched.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">(4) A search of a person in custody involving removal of underclothing shall, where practicable, be carried out by a doctor.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">(5) Where clothing or footwear of a  person is retained, replacements of a reasonable standard shall be provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">(6) A record shall be made of a search of a person in custody including the name of the person conducting the search and the names of those present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">(7) Particulars of any property taken from or handed over by a person in custody shall be recorded. The person shall be asked to sign the record of such property as being correct. If he refused to do so, the refusal shall be recorded at the time of refusal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">Under section 7(4) of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 members of the Garda Síochána are liable to disciplinary proceedings for failing to observe any provision of the Regulations. Information regarding the number of searches involving the removal of clothing that have taken place in Bellmullet Garda Station during each of the past 24 months and the average number of such searches per garda station conducted during each of the past 24 months, broken down by gender, is not readily available and would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to attempt to extrapolate this information.</p>

            <p eId="para_1551">As the Deputy will be aware, on 30 April, 2012, the opening hours of 10 Garda Stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R.) were reduced from being open on a 24 hour basis to being open to the public between the hours of 7.00 a.m. and 9.00 p.m. only. It is important to remember that while the Garda stations in question will have reduced opening hours to the public, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis. It must be stressed that the key objective of the station closures is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure modest cash savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation. The reduction in the opening hours of Donnybrook and other Garda stations means that Gardaí who heretofore were required to operate at public counters are now available for operational policing. The allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. The priority is, and will remain, that an effective and professional policing service is provided to every part of the community, both rural and urban.</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">There are 171 Gardaí assigned to the Donnybrook District itself. There are also 57 Garda Reserves and 33 Civilians attached to the D.M.R. South Central in which Donnybrook Garda is located. These resources are augmented, when appropriate, by Gardaí from national units such as the Garda National Drug Unit and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1557">The Charities Act 2009 provides for an integrated system of mandatory registration and proportionate regulation and supervision of the charities sector in Ireland.  The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  A number of sections have already been commenced.  Those sections that require charities to provide financial information to a new Charities Regulatory Authority, which will in turn make such information available to the public, have not yet been commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act 2009 had to be examined in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure, which took place last year.  Arising from this review, I took the view that it was not possible to proceed with the full implementation of the Act at this time given the likely scale of the financial and staffing resources implied, and that this should be deferred.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">In light of this decision, my Department is currently examining how the transparency and accountability of the charities sector may be further enhanced and supported, pending full implementation of the Charities Act 2009. One initiative which my Department has supported has been development by the charities sector itself of a set of voluntary Codes of Practice for fundraising, of which openness is a core principle. I encourage all charities to sign up to and adhere to these Codes. With regard to relevant existing statutory requirements for financial reporting by charities, I would remind the Deputy that those charities that are companies limited by guarantee are subject to the provisions of company law and are therefore generally required to provide information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts, which can be accessed by the public.</p>

Section 11(1)(e) of the Ombudsman for Children's Act 2002 provides that the Ombudsman shall not investigate any action taken by a public body where the action was taken in the administration of the law relating to, <i>inter alia</i>, asylum.  I should say that, while the Office currently does not have the power to investigate asylum related matters, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), including RIA, has administrative arrangements in place with the Office to assist and provide information and help resolve any matters brought to its attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">The question of extending the remit of the Ombudsman for Children is a matter for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the first instance. I am not aware of any proposal by it to expand the remit of the Ombudsman along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  This response should note that RIA takes its child protection role seriously. Responsibility for Child and Family Services is assigned to a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, whose role is to manage, deliver, co-ordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system and to act as a conduit between RIA and the HSE. In the discharge of its role, that unit is in regular contact with the HSE which of course has statutory functions in this area.</p>

The development of the annual policing plan is governed by section 22(1) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005.

            <p eId="para_1567">Although drafted by the previous Government, the focus of the National Women's Strategy 2007-2016 is closely linked to the goals of this Government and to EU gender equality policy.  It is intended that the first draft of the Internal Review of the Strategy will be presented to the Strategy's Monitoring Committee at a meeting in June 2012. The report may be edited following discussion in that forum. If necessary, the final Report will be submitted to Government and, subject to the Government's approval, it will be published at the earliest opportunity thereafter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1569">As I have previously stated in my responses to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 485 and 521 of Tuesday, 14 February 2012, 543 of Tuesday 28 February 2012, and 74 of Tuesday, 13 March, the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence is a detailed Convention with a very broad scope across a number of policy areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, an executive office within my Department, actively contributed to all stages of the drafting process in relation to the Convention.  That process took place over a period of almost two years.  I am informed that 19 Council of Europe member states have signed the Convention and one has ratified it. It has not yet entered into force as this requires at least ten member states to ratify it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">In view of the complexity and scope of the Convention, and before embarking on the process of formal circulation of a Memo for Government for approval to sign the Convention, Cosc circulated all relevant Departments and State Bodies seeking observations on the final text of the Convention and Explanatory Memorandum.  Cosc is finalising its consideration of the issues raised in their responses which need to be addressed by Ireland prior to signature. The matter will then be submitted for decision as to the Government position on the issue of signature.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1573">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their application for protection is being processed.  The Eyre Powell asylum seeker accommodation centre in Newbridge, Co. Kildare, which has a capacity to accommodate 90 residents, is one of 38 centres throughout the State which are managed by private companies under contract to RIA. These contracts set out in detail the services to be provided to residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">On 10 April, 2012, a detailed written complaint listing 12 areas of concern, signed by a number of residents, was sent to the manager of the Eyre Powell centre through the local Newbridge Asylum Seekers Support Group.  The concerns revolved around food, hygiene and attitude of management towards residents.  The complaint was simultaneously copied to, <i>inter alia</i>, the media, local TDs, various official bodies and other NGOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">I am advised by the RIA that two visits to the centre by senior RIA officials took place on Thursday 19 April and Friday 27 April.  During these visits, discussions took place with residents about the complaints raised.  A meeting also took place between the residents and centre management on Saturday, 21 April, 2012.  Both residents and the local support group have acknowledged the efforts already made by RIA and centre management to address the points of complaint.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">Generally, it must be acknowledged that problems can and do arise in any accommodation system, noting that in the direct provision system there are over 5,200 persons residing in RIA centres throughout the State.  It is therefore incumbent on all concerned to ensure that the various processes in place to head off such problems, or deal with them when they arise, are fully utilised.  From the perspective of the residents themselves, the principal protection is the house rules and procedures for asylum seekers living in direct provision asylum accommodation centres.  These rules set out the entitlements and obligations placed on centre management and residents and, in the event that these aren't being met, a complaints procedures to be invoked by either party.  The thrust of the complaints procedure contained therein is that issues which arise are best resolved quickly, locally and informally without the need to proceed formally.  In the main, this is how issues should be and are resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">Over and above the House Rules themselves, the interests of asylum seekers are protected through regular "clinics" in centres where residents can speak directly to RIA Headquarters staff without local centre management being present. Further, unannounced inspections take place in centres, by RIA staff and by a contracted independent company, to ensure that centres are adhering to their contractual obligations. Also, issues of concern are also brought to the attention of RIA by representatives of statutory or voluntary agencies working with asylum seekers.  In the case of Eyre Powell, I am informed that the centre had been inspected three times in 2011 (twice by RIA and once by the independent inspection body) and there had been three "RIA clinics" held in 2011 as well.  The centre has also been inspected once this year by the independent inspection body.  Many of the issues raised in the written complaint of 10 April, 2012 had not featured in these inspections or clinics.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">RIA is working through the list of complaints made by residents in this case, and will also take into account issues raised at the meeting  between residents and management on 21 April.  Further, the RIA examination will address how the interaction of the complaints, inspections and clinic systems worked in this instance.  This is a work in progress involving residents, centre management and RIA and RIA has committed itself to responding in writing to the residents in relation to all the issues raised as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1582">The new three year strategic plan includes concrete and practical, if ambitious, targets.  Its key objectives include delivering reform and implementing change in accordance with the Croke Park Public Service Agreement and the Integrated Reform Plan for the Justice Sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">The 2012 current operational budget for the Prison Service is €293.7m.  Approximately 80% of this budget is required for payroll costs. The balance is used to fund services for prisoners, maintenance of infrastructure (estate and IT systems), compensation and administrative costs.  Since 2009, the Prison Service budget has faced increasing pressure.  Recognising this economic environment, decisive action was taken by Prison Service management to reduce, as far as possible, discretionary spend, implement cost cutting measures and deliver efficiencies.  Elements of the new strategy together with the Transformation Process under the Public Service Agreement are specifically designed to continue this process of change. The Transformation Process involves a detailed review of all tasks and an assessment of the appropriate management structures and staffing levels. Transformation also provides the Prison Service with the opportunity to refocus on prisoner progression and prisoner programmes.  Through engagement with other statutory agencies and the community and voluntary sector, the Prison Service will lead the way in ensuring a more efficient use of scarce resources and develop synergies which will provide more comprehensive and effective sentence management programmes for prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">The Deputy may also wish to note that I have allocated €132.5m from the Justice Capital Envelope 2012 to 2016 to the Prison Service Building Programme.  As I announced last November, the Prison Service has been allocated a capital envelope of €24.1m for 2012.  This will be spent on the completion of the new prison wing in the Midlands Prison and the provision of in cell sanitation in the B and C wings in Mountjoy.  Work has recently commenced on the B wing and it is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1586">The Community Return Programme is an incentivised scheme introduced in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group which provides for earned temporary release under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service.  The scheme, which was introduced on a pilot basis last October, is applicable to suitably assessed prisoners who are serving sentences of more than one and less than eight years. Those participating are granted renewable temporary release having served at, or after, the 50% stage of their sentence with a condition of their release to undertake supervised community service.  The following factors are taken into account in considering the suitability of a prisoner for temporary release to participate in the scheme:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1587">the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by theperson relates;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1588">the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1589">the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1590">the person's previous criminal record;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1591">the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1592">the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1593">the extent of the prisoner's engagement with therapeutic services while in custody and the likelihood of period of temporary release enhancing his/her reintegration prospects; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1594">conduct while in custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_1595">As announced at the launch of its new three year strategic plan, the Prison Service, in conjunction with the Probation Service, intends to increase the number of prisoners benefitting from this structured form of release over the course of the next three years.  The Prison Service will work towards the placement of 400 prisoners per annum serving sentences of 1 to 8 years.  It is envisaged that there would be no more than 150 prisoners participating in this scheme at any one time and all prisoners will be carefully assessed before being approved for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1596">I can assure the Deputy that public safety is paramount when considering any application for temporary release.  Given the factors that will be taken into account as outlined, prisoners who have been convicted of serious offences involving violence or those convicted of serious sexual offences would not meet the criteria to be granted early release under the terms of the scheme. This is but one element of the strategy which provides for a structured form of release leading to improved resettlement and reintegration opportunities for prisoners along with providing for work to the benefit of communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1600">The position in relation to proposed amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Bill remains as indicated in my closing statement for Second Stage of the Bill on 23 February 2012. In that statement I responded to a series of key issues that had arisen in the discussion of the Bill. At the same time I outlined my intentions in relation to those issues and the potential for constructive amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. I also indicated that I would make my proposed amendments to the Bill available to Deputies sufficiently in advance of Committee Stage to facilitate their due consideration and this will be done in due course. On the 14th of April I delivered a statement on the Bill and its programme of reform at the annual conference of the Law Society of Ireland which again outlined the scope of the amendments to the Bill that are under consideration — the full text is available on the Department website, <i>www.justice.ie</i>, for ease of reference.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">The situation in relation to a Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 also remains as stated at the closing of Second Stage. Although a preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis had been in preparation for the Bill, because of the prescribed time-frame under the EU-IMF-ECB Programme, it did not prove possible to complete it for issue when the Bill was published. The development of that Regulatory Impact Analysis is further advanced and will continue against the backdrop of the amendments to the Bill that are being prepared for Committee Stage and the analysis will be made available to Members for timely consideration. Deputies will be aware that the relevant Guidelines specifically allow for a Regulatory Impact Analysis to follow a Bill in such exceptional circumstances as applied in this instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">Work on the details of the proposed amendments to the Bill and on the Regulatory Impact Analysis is ongoing at my Department including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel and they will, as I have explained, be made available in advance of Committee Stage.

The Bill will also fulfil the relevant commitment in the Programme for Government.  The Bill will provide for a new framework for settlement of debt and for personal insolvency.

            <p eId="para_1610">Critical to the operation of the new debt settlement processes will be the establishment of an Insolvency Service.

            <p eId="para_1619">As already announced in the Public Service Reform Plan published by the Government on 17 November 2011, the Government has decided to rationalise the industrial relations/employee rights institutions into a single agency. Under this plan the Equality Tribunal will form part of a new Workplace Relations body. Detailed consideration of the practical arrangements to give effect to this decision is being progressed by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Further information in this regard will be communicated as soon as he is in a position to announce details.</p>

            <p eId="para_1622">As the Deputy is aware there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population in Ireland over recent years.  The problem of prison overcrowding therefore remains a challenging issue which unfortunately cannot be resolved overnight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623">Given the current number of prisoners in the system — 4,401 on 3rd May 2012 — the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners.  Single cell occupancy across the system would result in a bed capacity of less than 3,000 and would not be possible to achieve without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered to represent a threat to public safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">As the Deputy is aware, on the 30th April I launched the Irish Prison Service 3-Year Strategic Plan for the period 2012-2015. In accordance with this Strategy, it is the intention of the Irish Prison Service, over the coming three years, to seek to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">The Inspector of Prisons recommended capacity for individual prisons is based on single cell occupancy in cells of 7 m2 with in cell sanitation and an additional 4 m2 for each additional prisoner  — for example double cell occupancy in an 11 m2  cell, triple cell occupancy in a 15 m2  cell.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">It is also the intention of the Irish Prison Service, during the lifetime of the Strategy, to provide in cell sanitation in all remaining areas of the prison estate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1628">The emergence in recent years of criminal gangs has had significant implications for the management of Irish prisons.  Prison management must ensure that the various factions are kept apart and as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates or criminal activities outside the prisons. Gang members are being managed on a daily basis through segregation and separation throughout the prison system.  Membership /allegiance to these criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">I am aware of the difficulties for everyone involved and appreciate the efforts made by prison management and staff to deal with this issue on a daily basis within our prisons.   The Irish Prison Service is taking whatever steps are necessary to deal with this and has built up considerable experience in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">A number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons. For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group (OSG) have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison. These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">In addition, there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda Síochána to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal gangs.  Gardaí are also provided with reports detailing the release dates of this category of prisoner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">Furthermore, the Risk Management of Offenders Group within the Irish Prison Service meet on a regular basis to share intelligence and decide in a strategic and collaborative fashion on the placement of leading gang members across the prison estate, having regard to the associated protection issues involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1634">I wish to inform the Deputy that details of waiting times for non-prioritised matters at each of the Legal Aid Board's law centres as at 1 April 2012 are set out as follows.  Figures for 1 May 2012 are not available yet.  I acknowledge that waiting times have increased since the downturn in the economy and that there has been a very significant increase in demand for the Board's services.  The Board's grant-in-aid for 2012 in respect of general civil matters, which accounts for the vast majority of its funding, has effectively been maintained at its 2011 level.  I have also now incorporated the grant for asylum services into the grant-in-aid which should give the Board greater flexibility in using its resources.  A number of other measures have also either already been put in place or are in the process of being put in place and I believe that these will have a positive impact for persons seeking services from the Board.  Specific details are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1635">The Board has outsourced to private solicitors significantly more work in recent years than it did a number of years ago.  There is of course a budgetary constraint on what can be referred and it is not possible to accommodate all of the additional demand through private referral;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1636">As of 1 November 2011 the Board assumed responsibility for the Family Mediation Service (following the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011).  The Board is currently reviewing the operation of the State funded mediation service with a view to achieving synergies with its legal services and better options in terms of resolving family disputes;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1637">The arrangements on foot of which barristers are retained have been in place since 1998 and are currently under review.  There will be a level of restructuring of the current arrangements;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1638">The Board is working with individual law centres with a view to trying to deliver greater efficiencies in a number of its centres.  It is assisted in this regard by the preparation of a Value for Money Review Report prepared by my Department and the Department of Finance (now the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform);  and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1639">The Board has commenced a pilot "triage" service.  The objective of the pilot service is to ensure that every applicant for services sees a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of obtaining early legal advice.  While it is acknowledged that those seeking further services will experience a waiting period, it is anticipated that an early consultation will benefit the client in terms of signposting actions clients can take themselves as well as signposting other support services.   The pilot service has commenced in five of the Board's law centres — Sligo, Nenagh, Cavan, Wicklow and Athlone.  It is anticipated that the pilot service will commence in the remaining centres shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1705">In the course of previous contributions in this House I have made it clear that combating the activities of criminal gangs is a major Garda priority.  In that context the Deputy will recall that significant resources are being deployed against gangs by An Garda Síochána and this will continue to be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has recently announced the introduction of a wide range of measures aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries. This operation, Operation Fiacla, is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts. Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders. These initiatives will optimise the use of existing structures and local Garda management will ensure that all personnel are fully briefed on the initiative, with Divisional Crime Management Teams playing a key coordination and implementation role.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">An Garda Síochána also undertakes a range of activities designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations. This involves targeting serious criminals and organised criminal groups on a number of fronts, including through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">In addition, An Garda Síochána continues to develop and implement strategies targeting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methods to facilitate targeted operations to enable early intervention and prevention of organised crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">The Criminal Assets Bureau is being actively utilised in respect of assets accumulated by criminal gangs. In recent years the Bureau has targeted the proceeds of crime of more middle and lower ranking criminals. I am particularly focused on supporting the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau in targeting the proceeds of crime. The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to strengthen the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in relation to the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">In this regard an Expert Group has been established under the auspices of my Department to review the operation of the Proceeds of Crime legislation with a view to identifying possible improvements which would serve to enhance the powers of the Bureau.  When that work concludes I will bring forward my proposals.</p>

         his plans to reform the immigration system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_294">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1712">The Government's plans for the immigration system are outlined in the Programme for Government which commits to the introduction of comprehensive reforms to the immigration, residence and asylum systems including a statutory immigration appeals mechanism, which will articulate rights and obligations in a transparent manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 was restored to the Dáil Order paper and appropriate amendments to the Bill, including an appeals mechanism in respect of immigration related cases have been prepared by the Department.  It was my intention to bring forward amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  However, as recently announced, I have decided to republish the Bill later this year.  The republished legislation will take account of the Government's initiatives announced in the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">The Programme for Government also details commitments in key sectors which will be supported by specific immigration initiatives.  A great deal of progress has been made in relation to these objectives—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1715">The Irish Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme commenced on 1 July 2011 and was scheduled to run on a pilot basis until the end of October 2012 taking in the period of the London Olympics.  I was happy to announce in March of this year that I had secured Government agreement for the extension of this Programme for a further period of four years.  This initiative is a very positive step in encouraging visitors to Ireland and is an integral part of the Government's Jobs Initiative and is intended to promote tourism, particularly from emerging markets.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1716">On 24 January 2012, the Government approved two new schemes, proposed by myself, which are designed to stimulate investment and enterprise in Ireland by suitably qualified foreign nationals.  The Immigrant Investor Programme and the Start up Entrepreneur Programme were formally launched on 30 March and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service has been open to accept applications since 16 April.  The Programmes capitalise on the opportunities that exist for or immigration system to tap into the entrepreneurial capacity of current and future migrants and also to bring investment into Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">I am continuing to work with my officials on further reforms to policy and administration in the immigration area.  For example, a civilian Immigration Officer pilot project is underway at Dublin Airport, involving Department of Justice and Equality staff assigned to immigration control duties at the airport.  These staff members will work in association with Gardaí in performing this vital screening function. This project is set against a backdrop of reducing Garda numbers, continued commitment to the civilianisation of appropriate tasks, and the need to look afresh at how public services are delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">Other initiatives and reforms that are in train include the development of a comprehensive policy approach to family reunification or settlement and the completion of work on the development of an English language/civics test for naturalisation applicants.  The Deputy will also be aware of the commitment in the Programme for Government in relation to the potential transfer of responsibility for the Passport Office to my Department.</p>

         the way he intends to ensure that the main banks are compelled to engage meaningfully in the proposed Personal Insolvency Arrangement in the Personal Insolvency Bill as they currently have an effective veto over any proposals and there is no independent appeals system proposed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1720">The Personal Insolvency Bill, the Heads of which I published on 25 January, 2012, introduces a number of new non-judicial debt settlement systems. One of those systems — the Personal Insolvency Arrangement — provides for the agreed settlement of both secured and unsecured debt of €20,001 to €3 million with one or more creditors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">The detail of the proposed personal insolvency reform measures, including those applying to the voting thresholds in the Debt Settlement Arrangement and Personal Insolvency Arrangement systems, are still under consideration, and the final text of the Bill remains to be considered by Government. This consideration will also have regard to the submissions received during the public consultation process and the report of the hearings of the Oireachtas sub-committee in relation to the General Scheme of the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">The reforms contained in the Personal Insolvency Bill will be applicable to the generality of mortgage and personal debt situations and not just to situations where credit was extended by covered banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">Regarding the governance framework of the covered banks, while the Minister for Finance is a significant shareholder, those banks remain independent commercial entities and decisions on the handling of individual loans remain a matter for the Boards and management of the particular institutions. When the proposed new personal insolvency framework is in place it will remain a matter for the individual banks to make decisions on proposals to address unsustainable debt in individual non-judicial and judicial debt resolution cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">I understand, however, that the Central Bank is engaging with each regulated mortgage lender to require them to put in place mortgage arrears resolution strategies and implementation plans to ensure that they will provide appropriate, fair and sustainable solutions, such as those suggested in the "Keane Report" and/or other options for their mortgage customers experiencing mortgage difficulty. These initiatives will be available to all mortgage holders and not just to those with mortgages from banks where the Minister for Finance is a significant shareholder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">I can assure the Deputy that the Bill remains a legislative priority for the Government and the revised time frame for publication of the Bill is now the end of June next with the strong intention to commence Second stage in the Dáil prior to the Summer recess to facilitate early passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas in the Autumn session.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_296">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1727">I can advise the Deputy that there were 4,380 prisoners in custody on 2 May, 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">As the Deputy will be aware from my replies to previous parliamentary questions, the Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, health care, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">The Irish Prison Service has also introduced an Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) system which involves a new orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners and an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  The end result is a prisoner-centred multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">As regards the numbers involved, I can confirm that an average of 38% of the prison population attended educational classes in 2011.  The development of vocational training programmes in recent years means that there are now over 100 workshops capable of catering for in excess of 800 prisoners each day.  There was also a significant increase in the number of prisoners who participated in accredited vocational training course in 2011, when 1219 prisoners attended such courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">The Inspector of Prisons recommended in his 2010 Annual Report that an independent audit be commissioned by the Irish Prison Service examining the type of education being provided in prisons, the relevance of such education, the numbers being educated and the value for money being provided.  The reports for each of the 14 Prison Education Centres are being finalised and will be sent to the Department of Education and Skills and the Inspector of Prisons with a view to the early implementation of recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">The development of prisoner programmes also forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 which I launched last week.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1734">As the Deputy is aware, the Commissioner's Policing Plan for 2012, which I laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 5 December 2011, proposed the closure of 39 Garda Stations throughout the country, along with reduced public opening hours in 10 Garda Stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1941">As the Deputy is aware, the moratorium on Public Service recruitment continues to apply to An Garda Síochána. A s a result, no date has been fixed for future intakes into the Garda College or for the commencement of a recruitment competition. A decision on when recruitment will re-commence will take into account the rate of retirement in the Garda Síochána and Government targets for reductions in public service numbers.<b/>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1942">In addition to this, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers, and therefore establish when recruitment will recommence, is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force, and the House will be conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1943">At present, there are a small number of probationer gardaí together with over 400 Garda reserve members completing their training in the Garda College. The Garda College continues to organise and provide in-service training to a significant number of gardaí each year in a broad range of skills and expertise.</p>

            <p eId="para_1945">I do not have any plans for the construction of a custodial drug treatment centre.  However,  as outlined in the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 — 2015, Drug Free Units will be introduced in all closed prisons.  It is intended that each of those prisons will have a Drug Free Unit by the end of 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">Drug Free Units will accommodate and cater for the needs of both drug free prisoners and illicit drug free prisoners — including prisoners stable on methadone in an integrated setting.  Prisoners will be required to sign a contract outlining behavioural responsibilities prior to entry to these Units; they will be subject to voluntary toxicology screening on a random basis.  Criteria for admission and discharge to Drug Free Units have been agreed and will be applied across the prison estate.   Prisoners will have access to the new incentivised regime programme and will be expected to partake in training and educational programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">Prisoners will have the continued support of health care staff and in-reach services as required.  Merchants Quay Ireland who currently have a contract with the Irish Prison Service for the provision of addiction counselling services will continue to provide support for those in the Units.  It is my belief that  Drug Free Units will contribute to a safer environment for both staff and prisoners.</p>

        <b> Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</b>
         asked the

         his plans to introduce measures to reduce the number of burglaries in rural areas in view of the closure of some rural Garda stations. 
        [22675/12]

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_301">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_1949">I am, of course, concerned at the increase in number of burglaries in 2011, while noting that for most crime groups, including robbery, the most recent statistics indicate a decline in recorded crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">All crime trends are monitored closely by Garda management, with intelligence-led initiatives put in place to target burglary and other criminality.  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has recently announced the introduction of a wide range of measures as part of a new operation aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">These measures are encompassed in <i>Operation Fiacla</i>, which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts. Specific burglary related initiatives are being implemented in each Garda Region in support of <i>Operation Fiacla</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1952">In terms of prevention, the National Crime Prevention Unit (NCPU) and Crime Prevention Officers at divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary crime and the opportunity to commit burglary. These specially trained officers are skilled at identifying environmental design risks and advise on ways to reduce opportunities to commit burglary and other property crime. The NCPU has designed a number of crime prevention advice leaflets including advice on home security and burglary prevention through a step by step checklist. These leaflets and the checklist are available on the Garda website <i>www.garda.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">During 2012, the national ‘Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign' will continue to highlight key issues, in particular burglary prevention. The primary objective of this Garda Community Safety Campaign is to engage with, and raise awareness within communities of initiatives aimed at preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and promoting community safety. The first campaign was launched last week by the Garda Commissioner and the second will take place in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_1954">In so far as the closure of Garda stations is concerned, when preparing the Policing Plan for 2011 the Garda Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda Síochána's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda station in their area. It must be stressed that the key objective of the station closures is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure modest cash savings. In this context the Commissioner has concluded that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if a particular station no longer had to be staffed and maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_1955">I am conscious of the deep distress which burglary can cause to householders, and to the broader impact it can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities and therefore welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner is deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted and strategic approach to confronting those who are engaging in this form of criminality.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_1959">It is the Government's intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met. As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, are in the process of assisting the Committee to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government's Legislation Programme as announced on 11 January 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current Dáil session. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.</p>

         the justification for and operational details of the so called green diesel system; and if he will provide any analysis done by his Department on the viability of moving from this system to one offering rebates for agricultural fuel.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2092">EU Directive 2003/96, which lays down requirements for the taxation of energy products and electricity, permits diesel used for certain industrial and commercial purposes to be subjected to a lower rate of energy tax than that applied to auto-diesel. Those purposes include agricultural, horticultural and piscicultural works and in forestry, in stationary motors and in plant and machinery used in construction, civil engineering and public works. The Directive stipulates also that diesel used for certain other purposes, such as sea fisheries and commercial navigation, must be exempted from energy tax.   Where diesel is released for consumption subject to a lower rate of energy tax, or is exempted from that tax, the fuel concerned may not be used as auto-diesel and must be marked, in accordance with EU Directive 95/60 and its associated Decisions, to distinguish it from auto-diesel. The corresponding provisions of Irish law are contained in the Mineral Oil Tax Regulations 2001: a specified substance and a blue dye must be added to the fuel, and result in a green colouring.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">The laundering of marked fuel to remove the marker from it, and the subsequent sale of the laundered fuel as auto-diesel, is the principal form of criminality in the fuel market, and combating it is a key priority for the Revenue Commissioners. Extensive enforcement action has been taken against both fuel launderers and those selling laundered fuel, resulting in detection and seizure of laundries and closure of fuel stations. This important work will continue, and Revenue will be assisted in it by the legislative action which I took in the recent Finance Act to enhance the control and supervision of the supply chain for fuels. In addition, I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners are currently working in close cooperation with HMRC in the UK on obtaining a fuel marker that would be more resistant to laundering.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">The suggestion has been made that the present system of marking diesel for non-auto use should be replaced by one in which all diesel would be subject to the same rate of Mineral Oil Tax, with repayment arrangements for certain users. A system of that kind would, however, give rise to additional administrative work for the fuel users concerned, and for the Revenue Commissioners, who would have to deal with large numbers of claims from farmers, agricultural contractors, households which use marked fuel for heating and all other users of such fuel. It would also impose cash flow costs on users and could be open to fraud and abuse. The focus, therefore, is on strengthening the existing system for taxing diesel at differential rates, through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker, and continued robust enforcement action.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_314">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2097">I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 145 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">Private sector debt, in accordance with international standards, is defined as debt held by households and non-financial corporations (NFCs).  According to statistics provided by the Central Statistics Office, in the case of Ireland these figures stood at €194,219 million for households and €347,002 million for NFCs at end 2010.  Collectively these figures equate to a private sector debt to GDP ratio of 346%.  This figure is similar to that provided by EUROSTAT (341%) and the McKinsey Global Institute publication from January 2012 (318%).  The differences are explained by the difference in sources and accounting methods, as well as the date of compilation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">The Deputy is correct in pointing out that the McKinsey report also includes a figure of 259% of GDP for debt held in the financial sector, however, for the purpose of identifying the level of private sector debt it is not appropriate to include this figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">Firstly, the significant presence of foreign banks in the Irish Financial Services Centre inflates the overall size of the balance sheet of the financial sector. Secondly, the purpose of any banking system is to provide credit to firms and households for consumption and investment purposes. As such, the liabilities of the banking industry fund their assets — the primary component of which is loans — and these should closely mirror the liabilities of the private and, to an extent, the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">Similarly, it is also necessary to be aware of Ireland's position as a centre for international business when interpreting the figures for NFC debt.  I would draw the Deputies' attention to a recent presentation to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Statistics on the 7th of March 2012: <i>http://debates.oireachtas.ie/FIJ/2012/03/07/00003.asp</i> and <i>http://www.corkeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Non-Financial_debt_Finance-Committee_1.pdf</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_2102">In the presentation NFC debt is broken down according to funding sources.  Notably, a large portion of the debt examined is accessed through capital markets and international treasuries.  This indicates that a significant portion of NFC debt is composed of funding to large multinational corporations, while borrowing by indigenous Irish firms would be more commonly accessed through the domestic banking system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">It is important to note that there is currently no published series that would enable closer examination of this trend, and that the contents of the above presentation can be used purely for indicative purposes, and are not intended to be official statistics.  I can inform the Deputies the Central Bank of Ireland and Central Statistics Office are currently in discussions with the Department of Finance to increase the level of surveillance in this regard, with a view to providing a more detailed breakdown of the influence of multinationals on the levels of Irish private sector debt.  For these reasons I am not currently able to provide an accurate projection of private sector debt over the next five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2104">I can inform the Deputies that Irish households are currently in a process of private deleveraging, with debt repayments outstripping the draw-down of new loans over the last two years as private household debt contracts to more sustainable levels.  While a necessary precursor for more sustainable growth in the future, it is clear that deleveraging on the part of firms and households is weighing on business investment and consumer spending.  As discussed in the 2012 Stability Programme Update, it is expected to remain a feature of the Irish economy for the immediate future.  In recognition of this, since coming into office, the Government has brought forward a number of measures to support the domestic economy and job creation, including the Jobs Initiative, lending targets for banks and the Action Plan on Jobs.  I am confident that these measures will help underpin a stabilisation in the medium term, followed by a gradual pick-up over the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_2112">The capital structure of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is set out in the ESM Treaty which was signed by Euro Area Member States on 2 February 2012. To obtain the highest possible credit rating, the capital structure of the ESM will have a total subscribed capital of €700bn. Of this amount, €80bn will be in the form of paid-in capital by the Euro Area Member States, paid in five equal instalments from July 2012. The balance of €620bn will be callable capital. The contribution key for each Member State is set out in Annexe 1 to the draft Treaty and is based on the ECB capital contribution key. For Ireland the key is 1.592% of the total paid and committed capital.   Ireland's share of the €80bn in paid-in capital, based on our contribution key, will be just above €1.27bn paid in five equal instalments of €254m. Unlike the EFSF, there is no "stepping out facility" in the ESM when members enter a programme of support. Therefore, Ireland will have to pay its share of the paid-in capital. The ESM is being established as an International Financial Institution and on that basis Ireland's contribution will be treated as a financial transaction. This means that while it will impact on Ireland's Exchequer Borrowing Requirement, it will not impact on its General Government Deficit. Ireland's share of the €620bn callable capital is based on the same key, i.e. 1.592% of €620bn making the callable capital €9.87bn.</p>
            <p eId="para_2113">Following decision of the Eurogroup on 30 March 2012, the paid-in capital will be made available more quickly than initially foreseen in the original ESM Treaty. Two tranches of capital will be paid in 2012, a first one in July, a second one by October. Another two tranches will be paid in 2013 and a final tranche in the first half of 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_2174">In 2010 the State made out promissory notes to Anglo Irish Bank, INBS and EBS. These notes effectively promise to pay €30.85 billion to these institutions over a number of years. Under Eurostat rules, Ireland was required to count the original note as deficit and debt impacting in 2010. Ireland's deficit and debt therefore increased by €30.85 billion in 2010 as a direct result of the promissory note agreement. As a consequence of this ruling the annual payments of principal, whether paid in cash or any other means, do not increase the debt and deficit as this amount has already been taken into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_2175">The interest due on the promissory note however does increase both deficit and debt. For this reason, the previous Government requested an ‘interest holiday' in 2011 and 2012. For these two years a zero rate of interest applies on the Anglo and INBS promissory notes. This means that for 2011 and 2012 there was no additional impact from the interest on the Promissory Notes on the General Government deficit. The impact on 2013 is almost €1.9 billion, or 1.1% of GDP, with a declining impact in later years as shown in Table 1 below.</p>
            <p eId="para_2176">The impact on the debt is different from the impact on the deficit. This is because interest falls due on 31st March each year and debt is measured at face value, whereas deficit is accrued to the calendar year. This difference is further complicated by the interest holiday. Table 1 shows the impact on the general government deficit and general government debt of the promissory note interest for 2010 to 2015.</p>

Based on the nominal amount of the bond of €3.46 billion, this equates to €187 million in a full year and around €140 million in 2012 because the bond was issued at the start of April and interest is only being accrued for the remainder of 2012.  The second, technical adjustment, relates to the difference between the nominal issuance of €3.46 billion and its market value at the date of issue of €3.06 billion.  The rationale for the technical adjustment is that the difference between the nominal and market value has to be accounted for over the remaining term of the bond in the general government deficit.  Under ESA95 accounting rules, this difference is classified as interest and accrued over the lifetime of the bond.</p>
            <p eId="para_2203">Based on the remaining bond term of just under 13 years, the annual accrual in a full year is €30.8 million (€400 million divided by 13).  In respect of the calendar year 2012, as the bond was issued at the start of April 2012, the accrual amount for three quarters of 2012 is estimated to be around €23m.</p>

The new deduction will be in addition to the existing deduction for carbon tax included in the cost of farm diesel used in the course of the farming trade.

However, while the installation of a wind turbine may be the construction of a structure, such a structure is not "designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business".  It is designed rather to generate electricity for wherever required. Consequently, no VAT incurred on the purchase of a wind turbine in 2010 can be refunded under the Order.  As I outlined in Budget 2012, I will be amending the VAT Refund Order to provide that flat-rate farmers may claim a refund on wind turbines purchased from 1 January 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_2253">Changes to the School Transport Schemes, including the "Closed School Rule (CSR)", were announced in Budget 2011 and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the Scheme.  The Deputy will be aware that from September 2011, the distance criterion of 3.2 kilometres was applied nationally to all pupils travelling under the primary school transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR.  The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date.  This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012, to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.  Existing eligible pupils, who are availing of school transport services, will retain their eligibility for the duration of their primary education cycle provided there is no change in their current circumstances.  Pupils who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis subject to a number of terms and conditions.  It is worth noting that the charge for primary school pupils availing of transport on a concessionary basis will be reduced to €100 per annum from September 2012; this is the same charge that applies to eligible pupils.</p>

The Deputy will be aware that, in the context of the necessary but difficult expenditure reduction measures announced in Budget 2012, new students entering postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will not be entitled to maintenance payments under the Student Grant Scheme. However, those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the Student Grant Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2256">In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a €2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees. My Department estimates that this will help an additional 4,000 postgraduate students. There will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold. The income threshold for this level of grant is currently being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2257">In relation to the way that these financial supports may be accessed, all new student grant applications from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will be dealt with by the new single grant awarding authority, Student Universal Support Ireland (a division of City of Dublin VEC). Students will be able to access the online application facility through <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i> to have their eligibility for a grant assessed. In the case of the renewal of applications for existing grant-holders, students should continue to apply to their local authority or Vocational Education Committee in the area where they live.</p>

The document, "Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment" contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent.  Education partners and interested parties were invited to submit their views and the Department is currently co-ordinating their submissions. The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2266">As a result of Budget 2012, Circular 70/2011 provides that teachers who had been engaged in a public sector teaching post on or before 4 December 2011 are eligible to retain the qualification allowances they were entitled to be in receipt of on that date. Such teachers will not be paid any additional allowance where they acquire any further qualification on or after 5 December 2011. The position of teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses will be considered in the context of the public service-wide review of allowances being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_2267">Teachers who were appointed to teaching for the first time on or after 5 December 2011 but before 1 February 2012 are eligible for allowances on the basis of their qualifications at entry to the profession up to a maximum of the allowance which had been applicable to an honours primary degree.  Pending the outcome of the review of allowances, they are not payable to new beneficiaries from 1 February 2012. The only exceptions to this prohibition are principal and deputy principal allowances and, for a limited period of time, the assistant principal allowance.  These decisions were taken due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances. These provisions are outlined in Circular 70/2011 and Circular 3/2012.  These measures are concerned with the sustainability of the public service pay bill and in particular the need to find payroll savings in the education vote. Without immediate action, this upward pressure would have cancelled out the savings made elsewhere in the education system and would bring about even harsher adjustments to schools and services. I am not in a position to comment further until the outcome of the review is known.</p>

            <p eId="para_2278">The Deputy will be aware that under the Education Act 1998, legally, all schools are managed by school Boards of Management, on behalf of the school patrons or trustees, and it is the Board of Management that employs the teachers at the school. Accordingly, whereas I provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor the Department have legal powers to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regards to individual complaint cases, or to investigate individual complaints except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2279">In dealing with parental complaints, my Department's role is to clarify for parents how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities. The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies. Where a parent feels that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2280">The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative effect on a child. The office can be contacted at Ombudsman for Children's Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin1, (Ph) 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 8656800, E-mail <i>oco@oco.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2281">My Department funds a number of bodies that support our education system across all sectors. Their degree of autonomy is dependent on the legislative framework underpinning their establishment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2288">The school referred to by the Deputy is a small school in the Gaeltacht.  As part of the new staffing arrangements my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small primary schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure.  Such schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.</p>
            <p eId="para_2289">The school submitted an appeal to the Staffing Appeals Board.   All appeals submitted to the Primary Staffing Appeal Board were considered in accordance with the published appeals criteria that is set out in my Department's Staffing Circular 0007/2012.  This was done at its meeting on 18th and 19th April.  The appeal by the school was unsuccessful on the basis that the school did not meet the published appeal criteria. The Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. However, the Appeal Board will review this decision in September if the school's actual enrolment in September 2012 increases to the required level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2290">A total of 367 schools submitted appeals to the April meeting of the Appeals Board. 205 schools had their appeals upheld by the Staffing Appeals Board. A summary outcome of the appeals is now published on my Department's website. Individual schools have been notified of the outcome of their appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2291">The next meeting of Staffing Appeals Board is due to be held on 14 June 2012. The latest date for other schools to submit appeals is 1 June 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2292">The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_2335">The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools are published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">The staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. A key part of the reforms of the allocation process was to facilitate a long overdue updating of the GAM (learning support) allocation for all schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">The staffing arrangements include provision for an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the Department's Staffing Circular 0007/2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">The Primary Staffing Appeals Board met on 18th and 19th April. A total of 367 schools submitted appeals to the Appeals Board. These appeals were considered in accordance with the appeals criteria set out in Department Staffing Circular 0007/2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">205 schools had their appeals upheld by the Staffing Appeals Board. A summary outcome of the appeals is now published on my Department's website. Individual schools have been notified of the outcome of their appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2340">The next meeting of Staffing Appeals Board is due to be held on 14 June 2012. The latest date for other schools to submit appeals is 1 June 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2341">The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_2347">I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 181 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">My Department does not hold information centrally on purchased prefabs previous to 2008.  Since 2008 14 mainstream prefabs classrooms have been purchased by schools in Co Kerry.  For the Deputy's information, I am supplying two tables relating to rented prefabs in schools in Co. Kerry.  Table 1 provides details of schools currently renting prefabs.  Table 2 provides details of schools that have been selected for consideration under the Department's rented prefab replacement imitative.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">The criteria used by my Department to select schools for consideration were:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2350">Prefabs must be rented for a minimum period and be required for the long term  i.e. any major project for the school is unlikely to be completed in the short to medium term or if it is, construction of the new classrooms will not hinder the extension and will reduce the scope of works required.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2351">School site must be sufficiently large to accommodate construction of permanent build while continuing to use rented prefabs and that site must not be rented.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2352">Permanent accommodation should be stand alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_2353">The average rental cost for one mainstream classroom unit currently stands at c. €14k per annum with site works costing an average €22,000.  The cost of site works will vary from school to school, depending on site conditions at each school.  Responsibility for maintenance of rented prefab and ensuring that rented accommodation meets the requirements of health and safety standards lies with the prefab provider and the Board of Management in the case of purchased prefabs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">In relation to the provision of additional accommodation generally a change in policy implemented by my Department is to provide devolved grant aid for the purchase (rather than rental) of additional accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years.  Furthermore, since July 2008, it is also policy to offer schools being approved for devolved grant aid for additional accommodation the option to use their capital grant aid to build a permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab.  An amount of €100,000.00 (inclusive of VAT and Fees) per mainstream classroom is provided under this Scheme.</p>

This was in addition to the 2012 programme in which 56 school building projects were announced to go to construction in 2012.  Of these 8 are being delivered under Public Private Partnership and hence do not progress through stage 2(<i>b</i>) of architectural planning.  Of the other 48 projects, 40 have progressed past stage 2(<i>b</i>) of architectural planning. Seven of the remaining 8 projects have secured planning permission and are progressing towards completion of stage 2(<i>b</i>).  One project is completing stage 2(<i>a</i>) and will shortly commence stage 2(<i>b</i>).</p>
            <p eId="para_2453">There are currently 5 other projects which have completed stage 2(<i>b</i>).  One of these projects was included in the 5 year construction programme and is scheduled to commence construction in 2015/16.  Due to financial constraints and the need to prioritise projects which will meet the increasing demographic needs over the coming years, it was not possible to include the remaining 4 projects in the 5 year programme recently announced.  Information in respect of all projects on the school building programme is available on my Departments web-site and is updated on a regular basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2457">The NCSE will be notifying schools in due course of their allocation for the 2012/13 school year of resource hours for low incidence special needs.  The arrangements for how schools access these resource hours in teaching posts are set out in the Department Staffing Circular 0007/2012.  Under these arrangements a network of over 2,500 full-time resource posts has been put in place in close to 1,700 base schools throughout the country.  The list of these schools and the criteria used to select them is set out in the published Circular.  These resource posts are allocated on a permanent basis and the teachers in them will undertake NCSE approved (low incidence) resource hours in the base schools or in neighbouring schools.  Schools that are unable to access these hours will be allocated mainly temporary part-time posts. This approach builds on the interim arrangements that operated in 2011 but in a more structured and transparent manner.  The school referred to by the Deputy did not meet the criteria for a base school but it will be able to access its allocation of NCSE approved resource hours in accordance with the arrangements outlined above and set out in more detail in the Department Circular.</p>

        <b> Deputy Willie Penrose</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b>
         the context of the Department’s corridor study N4/M4 in 2004, which advised that a note be reserved for a second level school in this area (details supplied) in County Westmeath and in the further context in which this area had shown a 421% growth in the past 15 years and when all the primary schools within a five mile radius have maximum numbers which they can facilitate, if he will enter discussions with the local authority and the church authorities with a view to securing a suitable site which is now readily available in view of the fact that these bodies have been seeking to meet officials to progress matters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2461">Among the recommendations of the study referred to by the Deputy, which was published in May 2005, it was recommended that a site be reserved in the area to cater for a second level school.  As the Deputy will be aware, in June 2011, I announced that 20 new post-primary schools are to be established up to 2017 across a number of locations to meet significantly increasing demographics in those areas.  This announcement did not include a proposal to establish a new post-primary school in the area referred to, as the demographics of the area did not support the need for a new second level school.  The Forward Planning Section of my Department will continue to analyse demographic trends to determine the level of additional school provision which will be required into the future.  Overall school requirements in the area referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered in this context.  As the Deputy may be aware Westmeath County Council has a site reserved for educational purposes in this area should the need arise in the future for the requirement of a post-primary school.</p>

            <p eId="para_2637">Flood alleviation measures for the Carnmore/Cashla area are part of the proposed Clare River (Claregalway) Flood Relief Scheme, which is currently at design stage.  Following a flood event on the Clare River in November 2011, it became apparent that ground water levels were rising at the Eastern end of the Carnmore/Cashla area, at a rate greater than had been considered in the preliminary design study of 2010.  Based on this additional information, the Office of Public Works asked the Consulting Engineers who are carrying out the detailed design of the Claregalway Scheme, to review the earlier proposals recommended for the Carnmore/Cashla area.  The review recommended that the proposed flood alleviation drain at Carnmore East be extended further eastwards, by 400 metres along the R339 road. An inlet structure would also be installed at this point to relieve the ground water levels as observed in the November 2011 flood event.  The revised proposal brings the cost estimate for the Carnmore East flood alleviation drain, to €530,000 from the earlier estimate of €440,000, an increase of €90,000.  These additional measures are considered necessary as they will ensure that the same level of protection is afforded to all the properties previously flooded, or at risk of flooding, in the Carnmore/Cashla area, including the R339.</p>
            <p eId="para_2638">As a result of the November 2009 flood event in the Carnmore/Cashla area, three houses were flooded, a further seven were at risk of flooding, two businesses were at risk of flooding and a further fourteen houses were cut-off by flood waters.  The R339 flooded to a level greater than one metre in places with three other local roads flooding for a period up to fourteen days.  The revised flood alleviation proposals, which include the extended flood alleviation drain at Carnmore East, form an intricate part of the proposed Clare River (Claregalway) Flood Relief Scheme and will ensure that the Carnmore/Cashla area, will have 1:100 year protection against all such future flood events.</p>

            <p eId="para_2640">The Ombudsman Act 1980 established the Office of the Ombudsman and provides that the Ombudsman can delegate authority to her officials to carry out functions on her behalf, that she may act entirely independently in the performance of her statutory functions, and that she may only be removed from Office by the President following resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Éireann calling for her removal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2641">I understand from the Office of the Ombudsman that this matter concerns a complaint considered by the Ombudsman against a Planning Authority in relation to its handling of pre-planning consultation meetings with the Complainant.  The Complainant was not satisfied with the response received from the Planning Authority and contacted the Ombudsman stating that he had suffered significant losses arising from maladministration on the part of the Planning Authority and asking to be compensated for these losses.  Following a lengthy and detailed examination of the complaint involving considerable engagement with the Complainant and his representatives, the Ombudsman concluded that the Planning Authority was not responsible through maladministration for the adverse effect as alleged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2642">The Complainant did not accept the findings of the Ombudsman's examination of his case and asked that she review her decision. The Office of the Ombudsman informed the Complainant of its appeals process. The Complainant was advised that the case would be re-examined by an officer not previously associated with the complaint and who was at a more senior level than the officer who had carried out the initial examination. Following a second detailed review of the case, which involved intensive engagement with the Complainant and his representatives, the Office of the Ombudsman concluded that there was no basis to overturn the original decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2643">The Complainant subsequently complained about the conduct of a number of named individuals in the Office of the Ombudsman as well as the Ombudsman herself and asked that the individuals be investigated.  The Office of the Ombudsman outlined to the Complainant its process for dealing with complaints against individual members of staff and also advised him that this process does not provide for a complaint about the Ombudsman herself. The Complainant's allegations against named members of staff are currently under consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2644">In view of the facts of the case and the statutory independence correctly bestowed upon the Ombudsman, it would be inappropriate for me to initiate an investigation into the conduct of the Ombudsman in this instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2744">Vodafone Ireland announced on 22 March that it had completed a review of the company's contracted mobile call-centre operations.

With effect from 8 May, 27 Vodafone roles and 290 Rigney Dolphin contract roles will transfer to Teleperformance.  The consultation process is a matter for the parties involved.  Rigney Dolphin will remain a provider to Vodafone for other purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2746">I have been assured by Vodafone Ireland that the transfer of service will observe the Transfer of Undertakings — Protection of Employees (European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003) Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2747">I recently met with Vodafone Ireland and the company has confirmed that it is likely that work will move to the Teleperformance site in Newry. I also met representatives of the workers, their Union and local public representatives. I understand this transfer process will be a matter for Teleperformance, although Vodafone will continue to participate in the consultation period.  I understand that Vodafone has agreed with Teleperformance that in the event of a move to Newry, all affected Vodafone and Rigney Dolphin employees will have the option to transfer to Newry when their role relocates.  Teleperformance have guaranteed that terms and conditions will carry forward to Newry for those who choose to move, and alternatives for those who choose not to transfer will be discussed through the consultation process.  While the situation that has arisen on this occasion is regrettable, it is nevertheless reflective of the competitive forces that affect the sector concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2748">In my meeting with Vodafone, the company made it clear that this decision has been taken for commercial reasons and they are not in a position to reverse it. The company have indicated that the work which they have on fixed line customer service is not under review and is performing well.</p>

The only payments made for participation on the Advisory Board are Travel and Subsistence payments in accordance with the Department of Finance rates for civil servants.

            <p eId="para_2801">I am taking it that this question refers to both the Labour Court case (details supplied) and also to the cases involving this company currently before the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT)</p>
            <p eId="para_2802">Cases, such as this, that have been referred to the Labour Court do not have an appeal route to the EAT. The Labour Court conducts hearings on trade disputes, as in this case, and issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled. The Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, and it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendation.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature and recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding. Neither the Labour Court, nor I, can compel a company to comply with such recommendations. Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) is an independent body under the aegis of my Department.  As an independent body, I have no role in the day-to-day operation of the EAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2803">I am advised however that, in respect of this company that the Tribunal will make arrangements to keep those cases of a similar date of lodgement and type for hearing together at the same Division of the EAT in Co. Offaly. It is anticipated that the unfair dismissal cases will be listed in the next available slot when the Tribunal is sitting in Co. Offaly. Having regard to the existing advance case list for the  Tribunal, this Division is  likely to be held in early September. I understand that there are also a number of appeals by the employer against the recommendation of the Rights Commissioner under the Payment of Wages and Terms of Employment (Information) Acts. These were submitted in February 2012 and they will be listed together for hearing. All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgement with the Tribunal. The current waiting time for a hearing outside Dublin is approx. 80 weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_2831">Carer's allowance is a means tested income support payment for people who are providing full time care and attention to a person in need of such care.  A person in receipt of carer's allowance can engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home for up to 15 hours per week and still qualify for the payment.  However, one of the main qualifying conditions for the payment of carer's allowance is that the person receiving care is medically assessed as needing care on a full-time basis. While carers may work or engage in training or education for up to fifteen hours per week, I have no plans for a further increase in the hours beyond this allowance. Any further expansion would necessarily dilute the very notion of ‘full time care and attention' and could directly impact on the person who needs that care.</p>

            <p eId="para_2843">Since the launch of the Strategic Management Initiative in February 1994, the provision of high quality customer service has been an essential element of the modern Public Service. <i>Delivering Better Government</i> published in May 1996, recommended the introduction of a Quality Service Initiative for the customers of the Civil Service and in 1997 the Quality Customer Service (QCS) Initiative was launched.</p>
            <p eId="para_2844">Since 1997, public service organisations have been producing Customer Action Plans to assist them in improving the way in which services are delivered to their customers.  In 2003, as part of a continuing drive to further promote Quality Customer Service, public service organisations began to adopt Customer Charters. Customer Action Plans and Customer Charters are produced as part of the same overall process and have separate but complimentary roles.</p>
            <p eId="para_2845">My Department is committed to ensuring that a customer service ethos is embedded in everything it does and is embraced by everyone in the organisation.  The overall aim is to provide people with the information, financial support and other services that they require in a timely and customer-friendly way.  My Department is determined to perform to best international standards; be responsive and innovative; provide value for money; and maintain the public service values of openness, responsiveness, professionalism and good governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2846">The Customer Charter sets out the standards of service that people can expect in their dealings with the Department.  This charter is displayed in all Department offices and on the website, <i>www.welfare.ie</i>.  The Customer Action Plan builds on the charter commitments and sets out a range of aims and actions to achieve them during the lifetime of the plan.  A new plan is being finalised at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_2847">I believe that it is important that the concept of the provision of high quality customer service to members of the public who access my Department's services continues to be a priority and I have no plans to issue an instruction along the lines outlined by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3128">The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  In the interests of fairness and equity applications are processed, as far as possible, in order of the date on which they were received in the Department.  A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to address the large increase in the claim-load and to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance and disability allowance schemes.  This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times.  This essential focus of certain staff resources will continue until the completion of the modernisation projects in June of this year when all existing carer's allowance claims and by the end of this year when all existing disability allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3129">Accurate processing time figures are not available at present as applications are still being processed on both the old and the new computer systems.  The average time taken to award an application for disability allowance in 2011 was 17 weeks.  There are approximately 6,300 new disability allowance applications registered and awaiting a decision.  The average time to award a carer's allowance application at present is estimated at approximately 28 weeks. There are approximately 7,800 new carer's allowance applications registered and awaiting a decision.  I acknowledge that this is unsatisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking all steps available to it to resolve the issue.  In addition to the deployment of new systems which should address service levels in the medium term, the Department is allocating additional resources in the form of overtime working to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  In addition, temporary staff have been assigned to the disability allowance scheme and approval has recently been given for the assignment of temporary staff for the carer's allowance scheme to expedite the reduction of the backlogs.  However, it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlogs are reduced to an acceptable level.  In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on an application, they may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.</p>

            <p eId="para_3131">Since 29 February 2012, one member of staff — the Chief Medical Adviser in my Department — has been retained on a temporary contract beyond retirement on a salary scale of €83,887.30-€102,152 per annum.  His salary is abated to take account of his pension rate of payment.  The decision to re-employ the Chief Medical Adviser was taken due to his specific skills and experience, the difficulty and long lead-in time for replacing such skills and the critical importance of ensuring continuity and a high level of service to customers of the Department.  The Pensions Board, which is under the aegis of my Department, has employed on temporary contracts two people who were previously employed by An Garda Síochána and who are in receipt of Garda pensions.  The salary scales for the two staff are €46,081-€58,294 and €65,185-€80,678.</p>

            <p eId="para_3135">A financial review of Community Employment (CE) Schemes is underway. This review process allows for schemes to engage with local officials in the finalisation of their respective budgets and for my Department to bring forward improvements to the overall operation of Community Employment which will improve the budgetary situation for schemes. All sponsors and projects have been met with and discussions have taken place with regard to the requirements of the schemes, including the above named projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3136">However due to the current economic circumstances, this Department has had to find significant savings in the Budget for 2012. The reduction to the grant for materials and training represents a reduction of 7.5% of the overall expenditure on Community Employment in 2011. The allowance grants for Supervisors are unchanged, as are the working hours for staff employed under Community Employment. There will be no decrease in the number of Community Employment places allocated in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3137">No final allocations of materials and training grants have been made pending completion of the review. The existing commitment in relation to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply.</p>

            <p eId="para_3193">The person concerned is in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance and has raised a number of general questions in relation to the role and operation of the scheme.  The following general information in relation to the scheme addresses the issues raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_3194">Domiciliary care allowance (DCA) can be paid in respect of children under 16 years of age who have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_3195">Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.  No specific condition or disability rules a child in — or out — of qualifying for the allowance.  There are no undue delays in the processing of DCA claims at present.  The Department aims to process DCA claims in 7 weeks, while currently it can take up to 8 weeks to process a claim due to the volume of work in the medical assessment area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3196">An Expert Medical Group was established in advance of the transfer to this Department in 2009, and recommended that the most appropriate way for the Department to conduct assessments for medical eligibility was by way of desk assessment of the evidence submitted by the claimant, as provided by themselves and the medical staff who regularly see the child.  It was considered that is was not necessary for the child to be physically examined by the Department's Medical Assessors as the diagnosis of the child's condition by their GP is accepted.  What is being assessed is the level of additional care and attention that the child requires as a result of that condition/disability and if this is substantially in excess of that required by a child of the same age without the condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_3197">A review policy in an integral part of all social welfare schemes and is necessary to ensure that payments continue to be made only to those customers who meet the qualifying conditions.  DCA cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that all the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Cases are reviewed based on either a scheduled review on the recommendation of the medical assessor when the claim is initially processed or on information received about a change of circumstances which potentially affects the continued entitlement of a case already in payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3198">Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of the medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child's disability and how their care needs may change over time.  In circumstances where a child has a lifelong disability that is unlikely to improve by any significant degree, a "do not review again" status may be used by the Medical Assessor.</p>
            <p eId="para_3199">Customers who are reviewed are asked to provide relevant up-to-date medical evidence and details of the additional care needs of their child and are now afforded 60 days in which to return this information to the Department.  This information is assessed by a medical advisor and a decision is made based on their medical opinion.  Where payment is stopped as a result of a review, the customer is invited to submit any further information they may wish to have considered and that information is further examined and/or they may appeal the decision directly to the Social Welfare Appeals office.</p>
            <p eId="para_3200">The effective and efficient operation of the scheme is monitored regularly and any improvements to the delivery of service that are identified are implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_3213">Under the Wildlife Acts, all wild birds and their nests and eggs are designated as being protected. In addition, the Acts make it an offence for a person to wilfully take or remove the eggs or nest of a wild bird (otherwise than in accordance with a licence issued by my Department), or to wilfully destroy, injure or mutilate the eggs or nest of a wild bird, or to wilfully disturb a wild bird on or near a nest containing eggs or unflown young.  In addition, the Wildlife Acts also afford extra protection to wild birds as they prohibit the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation growing on uncultivated land or in hedges or ditches during the nesting and breeding season for birds and wildlife, from 1 March to 31 August.  Hedgerows and scrub are important as wildlife habitats, particularly for nesting birds, and they need to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity.</p>

            <p eId="para_3250">One application from Meenacuing, Gweedore, County Donegal has been received under the Rural Broadband Scheme.  The Verification Phase of the Scheme is now underway.  The details of applicants have been passed to participating companies and the companies have responded to my Department indicating where they may be able to offer services.  Letters were sent to all applicants to let them know the position in relation to their application during February and March and a total of 2011 applicants responded giving their consent to receive written offers of service from the participating companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3251">Data files with the details of applicants who have given their consent to be contacted by participating companies have been passed to the companies involved and letters with offers of service have been issued by most of the companies to applicants and any remaining offers will be issued shortly.  The application referred to in this reply is amongst these applications and will receive offers from a number of companies who are interested in providing a broadband service to the applicant.  The companies involved will be seeking to provide services to applicants over the period from the end of April until the end of July 2012.  Once this phase of the Scheme is completed, the companies will be returning data to my Department to inform us of the outcome.</p>

         further to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 130 of 19 April 2012 (details supplied) regarding the fish counter which was placed on the River Maine if he will explain the figures given; if he will further explain the numbers in relation to May and June 2011; and if he will have the matter investigated.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
            <p eId="para_3253">The figures given in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 130 are the actual figures recorded by the counter and are not adjusted for periods when the counter was not operational due to flood and storm damage — hence very low or zero number of fish recorded by the counter in July, August and November, 2011.  There are four channels in the fish counter in the river through which fish can pass and be counted.  Two of these have already been completely refurbished in 2012 and the other two will be completed before the end of the month of May weather permitting — this will enable a full count to be achieved in the river for the majority of the salmon run in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3254">River salmon tend to move upstream and later drop back only to again move upstream to spawn — hence in some months as many fish can go up as well as down relative to water conditions at the time — this was evident in May and June.</p>
            <p eId="para_3255">In calculating the runs of salmon in a river where certain months are missing — average figures from the same month from prior years are used, together with the expert knowledge of fisheries officers and scientists.  In the case of the River Maine, it was noted by experienced fishery officers that in the winter of 2011/2012 the number of spawning fish observed in the river was extremely disappointing.  This reflected the view that the run of salmon in the river in 2011 was down on previous years.  This was especially evident on the Brown Flesk, which has seen a drastic fall in redds (salmon spawning beds) from hundreds in previous years to 46 in the 09/10 winter season.  Due to high water levels in the winter of 2011/2012 the counting of redds was extremely difficult.  If the Deputy wishes, I can arrange for Inland Fisheries Ireland to meet him to discuss this matter further.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_3305">Ireland's telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the Commission for Communications Regulation's (ComReg) website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3306">The State is not a provider of services, except in instances of clear market failure such as in the cases of both the National and Rural Broadband Schemes.  Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid clearance to ensure no unacceptable level of market distortion takes place.  The general area of Derrygrath, Cahir, County Tipperary, is covered under the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  Broadband services under this Scheme are available since October 2010, from the NBS service provider, 3, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in all NBS designated areas, including Derrygrath.</p>
            <p eId="para_3307">In keeping with State Aid clearance for the Scheme, the broadband service contracted under the NBS is an affordable, scaleable product, which currently offers minimum speeds of 1.6 Mbps download and 1.2 Mbps upload subject to a maximum contention ratio.  As regards service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on 3, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.</p>
            <p eId="para_3308">Any residents in NBS areas, who wish to subscribe to the service, can contact 3 at 1800 944794, or can sign up online at <i>www.three.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3309">The combination of private investment and State interventions in broadband provision means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_3310">The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I convened last summer, has had an important role to play in this regard.  It comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The purpose of the Taskforce, among other things, was to assist in developing a roadmap for the development of next generation networks across Ireland.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Taskforce report was published last week.  The report notes that by 2015 over 50% of the population will have access to high speed broadband services with speeds in excess of 70 Mbps.  The report also highlights areas where Government and industry can work together to facilitate the roll out of high speed services across Ireland, and particularly in areas where the case for commercial investment is marginal.</p>

The purpose of this consultation is to provide further input to this important policy area.  Thereafter, it is my intention to bring proposals to Government for a National Broadband Plan for Ireland.  This plan will build on the recent excellent progress made and be informed by the findings of the Taskforce and subsequent consultations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3368">Since the announcement in December 2011 that NAMA would commit to providing up to 2,000 units for social housing by the end of 2012, my Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA have been working together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies towards achieving this target.</p>
            <p eId="para_3369">To date over 2,000 units have been examined with a view to determining their sustainability for social housing having regard to local demand, the nature of the accommodation and sustainable community principles.</p>
            <p eId="para_3370">Of the original number, 697 have been deemed unsuitable by housing authorities; however in some of these cases, a smaller number of units from the development concerned may be considered for leasing purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3371">A further 344 have been withdrawn, usually by property owners, as circumstances have changed.  In some cases the properties concerned have been let on the open market or sold and are no longer available as vacant units.</p>
            <p eId="para_3372">At present demand has been confirmed for over 1,000 available units and these are currently being processed.  Discussion and negotiation has commenced in respect of nearly 700 properties involving approved housing bodies, local authorities, the property owners, financial institutions, receivers and other relevant parties.  Inspection of properties, which takes place in all cases, is part of this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3373">The units being advanced through NAMA will in general be provided through the Social Housing Leasing Initiative under the standard terms and conditions that apply.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate the cost of leasing these properties.  Lease costs are determined by negotiation using a standard discounted market price which may vary to reflect the circumstances of a particular case and the terms of the contractual agreement.  I can say that the current average annual cost of units leased from the private or voluntary sector under the leasing scheme generally is approximately €7,400.</p>
            <p eId="para_3374">There are no units operational at this stage and it is not expected that units will be tenanted until the second half of the year.  NAMA continues to identify units for inclusion in the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3547">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge by 31 March 2012, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.</p>
            <p eId="para_3548">Revenues from the household charge are supporting the provision of essential local services. Internationally, local services are administered by local authorities and financed by local service charges. In Ireland, local authorities are responsible for, among other services, planning and development; fire and emergency services; roads; public parks; libraries; open spaces and leisure amenities; maintenance and cleaning of streets and street lighting. These services facilitate everyone.</p>
            <p eId="para_3549">Local authorities are permitted, under statute, to charge fees in relation to the services they provide.  In the case of the Mayo County Fire Service, it is understood that the call out charge in place reflects only a proportion of the overall cost of attendance at incidents.  The other costs of the Service, including fire prevention, inspections and emergency management are being met through a range of income sources, including commercial rates, Government grants and subsidies, the household charge and the charge on non-principal private residences.  Communities benefit from the entirety of these fire and emergency services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3550">In many cases the householder/premises owner may recoup charges for attendance of the fire brigade at incidents such as house fires, road traffic accidents, and hay barn fires from relevant insurance policies, including motor, home and farm policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3551">Most fire authorities operate waiver schemes in respect of call out charges. If there are cases of genuine hardship and inability to pay applicable charges, each case will be considered on its merits and a partial waiver or easy payment option may be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_3555">Funding of €314m is available under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 for allocation to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013.  There are 35 Local Action Groups contracted, on my Department's behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding. Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3556">Projects that request funding of €150,000 or more are required to seek final approval from my Department.  The project by Roscahill/Killannin Community Pavement Committee is one such project and approval was sought for a grant of €197,041.55.  The assessment of higher value projects (projects with a grant approval of €150,000 or more) usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local development company.  It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications, as was the case for this project.  It may also, in some instances, result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme. These assessments also consider whether the project as proposed addresses the needs of the local community in the best possible way.  A full and detailed assessment of all projects is vital.  LEADER activities are co-financed by the European Union at a rate of 85% and, accordingly, come within the remit of a strict regulatory regime which requires that each project must be compliant before any funding is awarded by the LEADER companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3557">My Department will continue to work with the relevant Local Development Company to make a full assessment of the eligibility of this project for grant aid of €197,041.55 and will inform the Local Action Group once all queries have been addressed satisfactorily.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_3573">The Deputy has raised a number of matters not all of which fall within my responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_3574">Under the Child Care Act 1991, responsibility for promoting the welfare of children lies with the Health Service Executive.  Responsibility for the investigation of any alleged criminal offence is a matter for the Garda Síochána.   In the context of the making of false allegations, it is an offence for a person to knowingly make a false report to the Gardaí concerning the commission of an offence (section 12, Criminal Law Act 1976).  The offence of perjury addresses the giving of false evidence on oath.  The perjured evidence must be material and the statement must have been made with knowledge or belief that it is not true.</p>
            <p eId="para_3575">It should be noted that under forthcoming legislation, it will be an offence for a person to delay reporting to the Gardaí a serious offence committed against a child.  The recently published Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012, requires a person who has information concerning the commission of an offence against a child to disclose, as soon as it is practicable, that information to a member of the Garda Síochána.  Failure to do so will be an offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3576">Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service. The Act provides that the Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics. I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that it does not compile statistics on allegations as such that are made in the course of any court proceedings. The Courts Service has advised that where an allegation arises in the course of a custody or access case, a court may direct the health authorities to undertake an investigation of the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3577">I wish to inform the Deputy that insofar as the Legal Aid Board and the issue of legal aid certificates are concerned, Regulation 9(3) of the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3578">
              <i>Subject to the provisions of paragraph (5), the Board or a certifying committee may at any time terminate a certificate from such date as it considers appropriate when satisfied that it is justified and in particular may do so— (c) on being satisfied by the report of the legally aided person’s solicitor that the certificate should be terminated, or (e) where it considers that the legally aided person is behaving unreasonably in connection with the conduct of the proceedings or that it is unreasonable in the particular circumstances of the case (including the cost of the proceedings) that the person should continue to receive legal aid.</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_3579">While the Board can use these provisions to terminate legal services if it is clear that allegations have been made maliciously, it has no data in relation to the number of cases in which legal aid was terminated on the basis of false allegations being made.  I have no plans at this time to amend civil legal aid legislation in the specific way outlined by the Deputy.</p>

This scheme is operated by the Property Registration Authority. Since it was introduced in 1978, over 80,000 applicants have availed of the scheme to acquire the freehold title to their property. In the case of property other than dwelling houses, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar.</p>

            <p eId="para_3595">I share the Deputy's concern at the incidence of burglaries and other property crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3596">Insofar as detection rates are concerned, the most recent CSO analysis shows a detection rate for burglary in the region of 25% for 2010.  It is important to note that detection rates do vary according to the nature of the crime and that this is in line with international experience.  Detection rates are often found to be lower for certain offences, such as burglaries and some other property crimes, as these generally only come to light after the event and after the offender has left the scene.  These offences are inherently more difficult to investigate than some others.  While our statistical system is not directly comparable with that of other countries, in the UK, for example, the difficulties presented in detecting burglaries are reflected in the fact that the sanction detection rate for burglaries in England and Wales in 2010/2011 was recorded as 13%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3597">Notwithstanding the investigative challenges faced, however, the Garda is responding effectively and the Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has recently announced the introduction of a wide range of measures aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_3598">These measures are encompassed in <i>Operation Fiacla</i>, which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts. Specific burglary related initiatives are being implemented in each Garda Region in support of <i>Operation Fiacla</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3599">I am conscious of the deep distress which burglary can cause to householders, and to the broader impact it can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities and therefore welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner is deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted and strategic approach to confronting those who are engaging in this form of criminality.</p>
            <p eId="para_3600">In relation to the particular statistics requested by the Deputy, the Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3606">I propose to take Questions Nos. 302 and 303 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3607">Over the course of the conflict in Northern Ireland a number of people were abducted and murdered by paramilitary groups, and then buried in secret locations.  They have become known as "the Disappeared".</p>
            <p eId="para_3608">The Irish and British Governments established the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains in 1999 as one of the actions taken in the context of the Peace Process to acknowledge and address the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of reconciliation.  The Commission's sole purpose is to facilitate the location of the remains of the Disappeared in order that they may be returned to their families to afford them some measure of closure to the tragedy they have had to endure.</p>
            <p eId="para_3609">To date the remains of seven of the persons on the Commission's list have been recovered with the Commission's involvement and this has brought some comfort to the families of those victims.  There are seven others whose remains have not yet been recovered and the Commission is continuing its work in respect of these cases.  The House will be aware that the Commission's investigation team is currently carrying out further excavation works with regard to one of these cases.  It is to be hoped that their searches will be successful on this occasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3610">In November last year, together with Northern Ireland Office Minister of State, Hugo Swire MP, I met with the two Commissioners, Mr. Frank Murray and Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, and with the Commission's investigators.  They updated us on their work and we assured them of the continuing, full support of both Governments for that work.  Officials in my Department and in the Northern Ireland Office maintain close and regular contact with the Commissioners and their investigation team.</p>
            <p eId="para_3611">The Commissioners have emphasised that their work is driven by information.  All information provided to the Commission is treated as strictly confidential and everyone can be assured that such information can only be used to locate and identify the remains.  It cannot be given to other agencies or used for prosecutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3612">I know the House will join me in calling on anybody who has any information that could help to locate those still missing to give that information to the Commission without delay.  The Commission has in place a confidential freephone number and PO box address through which information can be passed to it.  Information about the Commission and how to contact it are available on the Commission's website <i>www.iclvr.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3613">I would emphasise to the House that the Commission's sole purpose is humanitarian.  The families of the Disappeared want to have their loved ones' remains returned to them for a decent burial, to have a place to grieve and, in some measure at least, to have closure.  The Government remains committed to that aim and I call on all others to help bring it about.</p>

            <p eId="para_3635">The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment on a particular case in response to a Parliamentary Question. However, I can indicate the following by way of general information.</p>
            <p eId="para_3636">Under section 4 of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1986, as amended, renewal of a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor for premises which have been licensed in the immediately preceding year is generally automatic, subject to compliance with tax clearance requirements and payment of the relevant renewal fee (excise duty) to the Revenue Commissioners. The renewal fee varies according to the annual turnover arising from the sale of intoxicating liquor of the licensed premises concerned and ranges from €250 where turnover is less than €190,500 to €3,805 where turnover exceeds €1.27 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3637">Renewal of a licence is not, however, automatic where an objection to renewal has been lodged with the District Court on permitted grounds, e.g. the premises concerned have not been operated in a peaceable and orderly manner in the year ending on the expiry of the licence. In such cases, a District Court certificate must be presented to the Revenue Commissioners prior to renewal of the licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3638">Under section 2 of the Licensing (Ireland) Act 1902, as amended, where premises were not licensed during the preceding year but had been licensed at any time during the previous five years, a new licence may be issued by the Revenue Commissioners on foot of a certificate granted by the Circuit Court in respect of such premises without the need to extinguish another licence. This section does not apply where the licence lapsed due to a breach of licensing law or was extinguished.</p>

            <p eId="para_3647">The position in relation to this matter remains as indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 941 and 977 of 18th April 2012. I have also addressed this matter in the course of my speech about the modernisation and reform of the legal sector delivered at the Annual Conference of the Law Society on 14th April — the full text has been made available on my Department's website, <i>www.justice.ie</i>, for ease of reference. </p>
            <p eId="para_3648">As I have conveyed on such previous occasions, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority to be established under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 will be independent of the legal professions and of the Government in the performance of its functions. This will include new and independent procedures relating to allegations of professional misconduct by either solicitors or barristers. Such complaints will be dealt with under the auspices of the Authority's Complaints Committee and supported, where appropriate, by the work of the new and independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. Under the Bill, members of the public will no longer go to the Law Society or to the Bar Council and their respective disciplinary tribunals to deal with complaints, as happens at the moment, but will instead do so through the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3649">The Law Society has recently recognised that it would be "in the best interests of the public and the profession" if complaints about solicitors were no longer to be dealt with by the Society but by the new Regulatory Authority to be established under the Bill . The independence of the new Regulatory Authority and of its attendant complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal procedures is, therefore, fundamental to their success and to the avoidance of any perception that complaints about lawyers are being dealt with by lawyers themselves or by their representative bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3650">Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 the complaints systems currently operated by the legal professional bodies are to be replaced by new procedures the independence of which will have to be reflected in the relevant recruitment and appointment processes. In closing the Second Stage debate on the Bill I confirmed that I am considering possible Committee Stage amendments to create  appropriately independent procedures for the appointment of members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Complaints Committee and of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. Similarly, I expressed the view that staff appointments to the new Authority would be better made by the Authority itself under a public competition carried out by the Public Appointments Service. While the transition to a new and independent complaints procedure under the Bill will have an impact on staff currently involved in that area it will be open to such staff  — who would obviously possess the relevant skills and experience — to offer to apply for positions advertised by the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_3660">The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release are fully set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_3661">Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons. The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect. Each application is considered on its individual merits and evaluated using the following criteria as outlined in the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.: the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates; the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed; the period of the sentence served by the person; the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released; the person's previous criminal record; the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release; the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release; any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda Síochána, a Probation and Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release; the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release; the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release; and the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment.   Decisions are made at a senior level within the Irish Prison Service and by myself in respect of cases referred directly to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_3662">It is not possible to provide the Deputy with the breakdown of information requested as this would require the manual examination of records. Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and can not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources. However, it is anticipated that through the new Prison Information Management System (PIMS), which was introduced in March this year in the Prison Service, that I will be able to provide such data in the future.</p>

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.   On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p>

            <p eId="para_3670">As a guiding principle the Irish Prison Service attempts to place prisoners in the location nearest to their family home. This principle is of course subject to appropriate security considerations, operational and legislative requirements.

            <p eId="para_3673">I have studied the statistics on recorded crimes where the suspected offenders are on bail and I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail.  I share that concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_3674">A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_3675">Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</p>
            <p eId="para_3676">I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.</p>
            <p eId="para_3677">Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law. In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public. My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided. I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3678">I will bring proposals to Government on the matter in the near future.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_3680">The Deputy will appreciate that organised crime, by its very nature, is constantly evolving and diversifying in both its structures and activities so as to exploit opportunities for criminal gain.</p>
            <p eId="para_3681">Given this, membership of organised crime gangs tends to be fluid and offences committed by members of criminal gangs may or may not be connected with an individual's membership of such gangs. It is therefore not feasible to provide the Deputy with all of the information sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_3682">However, I can assure the Deputy that addressing such criminality remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and for An Garda Síochána and these priorities are clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2012 and in the <i>Programme for Government</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3683">An Garda Síochána will continue to vigorously monitor and tackle organised crime through undertaking a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3684">This involves targeting serious criminals and organised criminal groups on a number of fronts, including through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau. These units are also supported, as required, by the Security and Intelligence Section which assists with the provision of intelligence briefings and timely information.</p>
            <p eId="para_3685">Law enforcement efforts in this regard are underpinned by a comprehensive framework of criminal law measures. This framework includes the more recently enacted provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 in targeting organised crime, measures contained in the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 relating to evidence obtained by means of covert surveillance and the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 relating to the use of weapons.</p>
            <p eId="para_3686">Whilst this current framework is being actively used to tackle organised crime the overall legislative response is being kept under review. In this regard my Department is currently undertaking a specific review of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 to see if its provisions can be strengthened and the views of the Garda Commissioner have been sought in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_3687">Furthermore, an Expert Group also established under the auspices of my Department, is currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the Proceeds of Crime legislation with a view to identifying possible improvements which would serve to strengthen the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>

            <p eId="para_3712">The emergence in recent years of criminal gangs has had significant implications for the management of Irish prisons.  Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside continue inside of prison.  Prison management have to ensure that the various factions are kept apart and, as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates or criminal activities outside the prisons.  Gang members are being managed on a daily basis through segregation and separation throughout the prison system.  Membership/allegiance to these criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated.  Intelligence on the ground would suggest that at any given time between 30% and 40% of the prison population has links to a criminal gang.</p>
            <p eId="para_3713">A number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons.  For example, a number of serious criminal gang members awaiting trial or sentence are now segregated in a specific area of Cloverhill Prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_3714">The security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.  Core functions of this group include gathering and collating intelligence information on criminal gang members in Irish prisons, carrying out  intelligence led searches and preventing the flow of contraband (including mobile phones) into the prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_3715">I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that it is not possible to provide the number of prisoners in this category who are due to be released in the next 12 months without the manual examination of prisoner files.  Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3716">However, there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda Síochána to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal gangs.  Gardaí are also provided with reports detailing the release dates of this category of prisoner.</p>

            <p eId="para_3731">I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 333 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3732">The establishment of an effective discussion group model similar to that successfully employed in the dairy sector was a key recommendation of the report of the industry-led Beef 2020 Activation Group which was set up to advise on the implementation of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. The Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP) giving effect to this recommendation was devised following extensive consultation and in collaboration with industry stakeholders. During its development phase, the Department discussed the draft Programme with representatives of the Irish Farmers Association (IFA), Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA), The Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association (ICSA), Teagasc, Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF), the Irish Veterinary Union (IVU), the Agricultural Consultants Association (ACA) and Meat Industry Ireland (MII).</p>
            <p eId="para_3733">The purpose of the Programme is to address the significant challenges to farm-level profitability by providing a financial stimulus that will encourage participants, through the vehicle of discussion groups, to improve the technical efficiency of their beef enterprises, by focusing on the key profit drivers (such as breeding, animal health, financial and grassland management).</p>
            <p eId="para_3734">As part of the Programme, participants must be members of HerdPlus, a service provided by the ICBF which generates genetic evaluation and breeding performance data.  As the Deputy is aware, ICBF is an industry led co-operative which receives some support from my Department to assist it to maintain a national database of cattle breeding information which is of vital importance for the future development of the national beef herd. Information on HerdPlus may be obtained from ICBF.</p>
            <p eId="para_3735">I am convinced that this ongoing work will be of major importance in leading to the development of high-quality animals which are required for the future success of the Irish beef industry.</p>

During the course of an on farm inspection on 28 July 2011, areas which were in non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the scheme were noted and a penalty was applied in relation to non-compliance associated with the Conservation/Management practices pertaining to archaeological monuments in the agri-environmental plan of the person named.</p>

            <p eId="para_3764">It has been standard practice over many years for my Department to engage retired veterinary staff as Temporary Veterinary Inspectors on a contract for services basis for meat inspection duties.  Currently, some 59 retired veterinary staff are listed as Temporary Veterinary Inspectors on a contract for services basis and are available to be rostered for meat inspection duties as and when required at a cost to my Department of €688,736.35 in 2011 and €173,963.38 this year up to 27 April 2012.  None of these Temporary Veterinary Inspectors were re-engaged since 11 February 2012, nor is it intended to extend this list.</p>

            <p eId="para_3963">The Implementation plan, published in 2009 in response to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Ryan Implementation Plan), included a commitment to the establishment by the HSE in consultation with the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) of a national therapeutic and multidisciplinary care team for children in detention and special care. The specialist multidisciplinary team could also provide an in-reach service to boys aged 16 and 17 years who are detained in St Patrick's Institution.  It also states that the HSE will review need and establish resourced multidisciplinary assessment teams for children and young people at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_3964">The HSE has been fully funded for this service, as part of the funding provided in respect of the Ryan Implementation Plan. The HSE has committed in its National Service Plan for 2012 to completing the establishment of this team.  The recruitment of a national manager for this service is currently underway. Interviews for the post were held last week and it is expected that this post will be filled very soon.  Once the national manager is in place, the other posts for this service will be filled by appointing successful applicants who have been placed on panels for these positions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3965">Children who are detained in secure units need a specialist multidisciplinary team to provide assessment and intervention.  Many of these children and young people require therapeutic work to enable them to begin to deal with the impact of abuse and other traumatic events, including multiple placement breakdown and significant loss through separation or bereavement.  This key national service will ensure all children placed in secure care, whether on welfare or offending grounds, will have access to specialist clinical interventions in line with their assessed individual needs. The national service is an essential support towards meeting the needs of these most vulnerable children.</p>

            <p eId="para_3969">My Department is developing a new strategy for children and young people.  It will build on Our Children — Their Lives, Ireland's first children's strategy which was published in 2000 and it will cover the period from 2012 to 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_3970">The new Children and Young People's Policy Framework is being developed in a holistic way to comprehend the continuum of the lifecourse from infancy, through early and middle childhood, to adolescence through to early adulthood, in keeping with my Department's responsibilities for children and young people. I intend that it will be the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3971">The policy framework will allow an opportunity to address emerging issues affecting children and young people such as the impact of new technologies, media and consumerism. It also provides an important opportunity for cross departmental collaboration to promote the well being of children and young people and it will provide a fresh impetus to a whole-of-government approach on issues such as child poverty and  healthy lifestyles.</p>
            <p eId="para_3972">The high-level policy framework will also facilitate the preparation of a number of more detailed strategies including the first-ever National Early Years Strategy which will follow later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3973">I am keen to ensure that the new policy framework will be informed by the views of children themselves as well the experience and expertise of a wide range of stakeholders in matters of interest to children and young people. The new policy framework will be informed by the results of a consultation, which I launched in 2011, in which almost 67,000 children and young people throughout the country participated, as well as the advice of the National Children's Advisory Council which comprises representatives of a range of organisations, both statutory and non statutory that work with children and young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_3977">The Hague Convention  is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the inter-country adoption process. It sets out minimum standards regarding inter-country adoption and covers issues such as subsidiarity, consent and financial considerations.  It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of inter-country adoptions in those countries.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) performs the function of a Central Authority under the Adoption Act, 2010, in accordance with the Convention.  In choosing to deal primarily with Hague countries, the AAI has the mechanism to work collaboratively with equivalent structures in that country.  Each Central Authority has the responsibility to oversee standards in respect of those parts of the process taking place within their respective jurisdictions.  This mutual arrangement is designed to give the AAI, the Government and, most importantly, those involved in the adoption process assurance as to the standards being set and the oversight of the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3978">A limited number of adoptions from Russia are currently being processed under transitional arrangements as provided for in the Adoption Act, 2010.  Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2012, with the possibility of the Adoption Authority granting approval for an extension of up to one year.  Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  In the circumstances, adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bilateral agreement developed to the standards of the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_3979">An official delegation from Ireland recently visited Russia and held preliminary discussions regarding the potential for a bilateral agreement.  I have received an initial assessment from the Adoption Authority which will inform the next steps to be taken in relation to this matter.  My Department is in discussions with the Adoption Authority on this assessment and other issues which will influence any policy decisions to be taken in this regard.  I am aware of the need to bring clarity to the situation in respect of Russia and I hope to be in a position to do so shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3980">The immediate priority of the Adoption Authority is the development of administrative arrangements with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention.  Any future bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would also be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Convention.</p>

            <p eId="para_4039">The guidance is in line with the Disability Act and reflects guidance previously issued to health service staff in 2008 and 2009 outlining the respective responsibilities of health and education sector professionals in assessing the needs of children with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4040">Arrangements governing the identification of the educational needs of children, who apply for assessment under the   Disability Act, were agreed in 2009 between the HSE, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) as part of the overall cross sectoral approach adopted by the Departments of Health and Education and Skills.</p>

            <p eId="para_4102">The Home Help service is central to the wide range of community based services, provided by the Health Service Executive. These services support vulnerable older people to remain living at home and in their communities for as long as possible, in line with Government policy. While the HSE Service Plan for 2012 involves a reduction of  around 3.5% in Home Help hours nationally, from just over 11m hours in 2011 to a projected 10.7m hours this year, the corresponding reduction in the actual number of people receiving this service has been limited to just under 2% or, in other words, from some 51,000 recipients last year to 50,000 in 2012. This reflects an increased focus by the HSE on more personalised care for the most vulnerable older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_4103">In the context of Home Support provision overall, it should be noted that the number of Home Care Packages, which also contain a significant Home Help element, is being maintained this year at 2011 levels. This means that  packages will be provided to approximately 10,900 people at any one time, or some 15,000 people over the course of this year, and underpins the commitment of the Government to provide the best possible service to the most vulnerable older people, in the light of evolving services pressures and resource limitations. This will, of course, require regular monitoring of the service over the remainder of the year, in line with overall HSE budget parameters.</p>

That review concluded that DRL should not be made obligatory for the time being because the experience in other countries shows that mandatory DRL works best where all vehicles are fitted with dedicated DRL and where there has been intensive promotion and awareness campaigns prior to DRL being made mandatory.</p>
            <p eId="para_4131">The Road Safety Authority (RSA) encourages the use of (DRL) on a voluntary basis, in particular during the period of September to March and in wet or poor conditions at any time.  Earlier this year the RSA launched an awareness campaign promoting the use of DRL on national radio.</p>
            <p eId="para_4132">In Ireland most vehicles do not have dedicated DRL and the RSA analysis has shown that the costs of retrofitting DRL at the current time outweighs the benefits.  However, EC Directive 2008/89/EC requires dedicated DRL be standard on all new passenger cars and small vans from February 2011 onwards and on HGVs and buses from August 2012 onwards. Therefore, as the national fleet is renewed over time all vehicles will have DRL.</p>
            <p eId="para_4133">The RSA have recommended that the position be reviewed in around 3 years by which time vehicles on our roads with dedicated DRL will have become more prevalent.  In the meantime, the RSA will intensify the promotion of using DRL with a view to significantly increasing the use of DRL.</p>

            <p eId="para_4136">The event, a year-long programme of festivals, events and other gatherings, will be the biggest tourism initiative ever staged in Ireland.  The St. Patrick's day festivities in March were used for the overseas launch of "The Gathering Ireland 2013" while key international tourism industry partners were invited to become part of The Gathering Ireland 2013 at the recent Meitheal trade fair.</p>
            <p eId="para_4137">Tourism Ireland Limited will have specific responsibility for promoting "The Gathering Ireland 2013" in overseas markets.  The main marketing of the event will take place in the second half of the year.  The Irish tourism trade are also being briefed on progress on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4138">In terms of resources, a specific additional €5m allocation has been provided to Fáilte Ireland this year and is being ring-fenced for preparations for "The Gathering Ireland 2013".  This allocation will primarily be used for establishing the support structure and for marketing the event.  The securing of additional resources for the event will also be targeted through engaging potential partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_4139">The Gathering Project Team will provide practical support and advice to all groups planning to organise events in 2013.  It is not envisaged that direct funding will generally be provided except for major events and existing festivals.  Rather this is an opportunity for individuals and communities to play a direct part in national recovery by encouraging additional overseas visitors who will in turn generate much needed revenues and employment throughout Ireland.</p>

Since BXD is a priority project under this 5-year plan funding has been included in my Department’s capital allocation to cover the cost of commencing the main construction works in 2015 and pre-construction enabling works in 2013 and 2014.

         in view of the number of cities, towns and villages that are currently bypassed, if he will consider revising the traffic sign manual, to allow representatives of business and commercial interests to suggest and agree icons for those businesses and amenities that are currently not represented on signs with his Department and the National Roads Authority in order to encourage motorists to enter the settlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4530">The current edition of the Traffic Signs Manual (TSM) was last published in January 2011, and constitutes a Ministerial Direction to road authorities under section 95(16) of the Road Traffic Act 1961, and is available from my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_4531">The TSM stipulates the traffic signs to be used on Irish roads, their layout and symbols, the circumstances in which each sign should be used and the rules for positioning them.</p>
            <p eId="para_4532">Chapter 4, to which I would refer the Deputy, sets out the provisions which govern the use of information signs for tourist attractions, destinations and facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4533">It would be inappropriate for commercial or business logos to appear on traffic signs, as they have the potential to distract motorists from the essential safety message contained on the signs.  It is, of course, open to commercial enterprises to engage with their relevant planning authority and other interested parties about the possibility of erecting such information signs independent of traffic signs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4535">My Department has no contracts for the provision of services with the company named by the Deputy.
