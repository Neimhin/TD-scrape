          <question by="#WillieODea" to="#Social" eId="pq_1">
            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Willie O'Dea</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> if she will contact persons who have been refused domiciliary care allowance for the past two years in view of the decision of the High Court of 1 April 2014 that found serious flaws in her Department's handling of such applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  [17793/14]</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_1">
            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_2">This question arises out of the review conducted by the Department of eligibility for domiciliary care allowance and a decision by the High Court on 1 April which overruled a decision of the Department to refuse domiciliary care allowance.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">The domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is a monthly payment to the parent or guardian of a child with a disability so severe that the child requires care and attention and-or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age. This care and attention must be provided to allow the child to deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months. DCA is currently paid to more than 25,000 clients in respect of more than 27,000 children at a cost in excess of €140 million per year, including the cost of the associated respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The High Court ruling of 1 April, to which the Deputy referred, involved a challenge by a mother in regard to the process involved in determining eligibility on her claim for domiciliary care allowance. While the judge found in her favour and ordered that the individual claim be returned to the Department for a new decision, he put a stay on the order to 28 April, thus providing time to the Department to consider the detailed judgment, along with any implications it may have for decision making. Therefore, as the Deputy will appreciate, I am not in a position to comment further on what actions may be required as a result of this judgment. As this matter is still under consideration, it is not possible to say what contact, if any, will need to be made with customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> In May 2012, I initiated a review of the DCA, to which the Deputy referred, which specifically brought parents into the process and involved a very wide sampling of parents. More than 300 submissions were received at the time. As a consequence of that, the application form has been redesigned to allow the details of the child’s care needs to be more comprehensively documented by the parent or guardian. Also, an additional medical information form can be completed for children with pervasive developmental disorders, such as autism. This additional medical information, which will be supplied by the specialist attending the child, will ensure that the appropriate information is available to assist in the decision making process.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> It is hoped that having as much information as possible on the child’s care needs available at the initial assessment stage will allow the correct decision to be made at the earliest opportunity possible and reduce the need for further examination and for recourse to the appeals process.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_8"> The revised application-decision process will also include improved feedback in regard to the decision reasons at both application and appeal stages. Details on the new process along with revised guidelines covering the administrative changes are available on <i>www.welfare.ie</i> and have been notified to all CIB offices and to parent-guardian representative groups.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">This decision was on medical eligibility. The Minister will be aware that the High Court was scathing about what it referred to as the Department's disdainful mindset to the evidence of long-term experts, all of whom had seen the child in question, and condemned the fact that despite this evidence, the Department insisted on making its decision based on the desk top review done by its medical assessors.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> Is this not a problem which exists outside the domiciliary care allowance area? There are many social welfare payments which depend on one's medical condition, including invalidity pension, disability allowance and illness benefit. Does the same system not apply throughout the Department? We have come across numerous cases where people have applied for one of those medically-based entitlements and have submitted evidence of experts who have seen the patients but where the desk top review still triumphed at the end? Will the Minister accept that this is a problem which is not just confined to the domiciliary care allowance area?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_11">As the Deputy will recall, it is for that reason that after I became Minister - we have had a number of discussions on this - I set up the review group, which was chaired by Sylda Langford and included quite a number of parents and which involved carrying out a sampling exercise involving 1,000 parents. This included work on the domiciliary care allowance right down to redesigning the forms in a way that they would be much more parent-friendly.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> The Deputy should remember that up to 2009, domiciliary care allowance was paid by the HSE. It then transferred over to the Department. Since it transferred from the HSE, the number of applications and the number of successful claims for DCA have gone up enormously. In 2013, for instance, under the new system, the success rate in terms of people applying increased to 73%.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> One of the problems we have, which is why I drew attention to it in my reply, is incomplete medical evidence at the early stage of application. That is why we have provided, in particular for children with specific disorders, including children on the autism spectrum or the Asperger's spectrum, a specific form which would allow medical advisers as well as parents or guardians to put forward a much more detailed case than was the case in the past.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_14">I thank the Minister for answering a question I did not ask. I am aware of the review in regard to domiciliary care allowance but I asked her about other health-related entitlements where the decision on medical eligibility is taken in exactly the same flawed way which the High Court condemned in its decision on 1 April. As the Minister said, a review has taken place, parents are more involved in domiciliary care allowance, forms have been redesigned, etc. However, many people have been refused domiciliary care allowance under the old system. Does the Department intend to contact those people who have been refused under the old system in recent times and advise them that the whole system has changed, that there is now a new form and that they are entitled to apply again?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">As the Deputy knows, it has been made absolutely clear to parents - it is a unique feature of the Irish system in regard to this allowance and to other medically-based allowances paid in respect of disability or invalidity - that under our system, we allow people to submit fresh medical evidence for review purposes at any stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">We have discussed this before. If people immediately go to an appeal, the appeal process is statute based and inevitably takes more time. We have been reducing the times but the backlog I inherited, particularly from the Deputy's Government, was very significant.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">It is very significant now. It takes six months for appeals.</p>

            <p eId="para_18">That is a fact. The facts are there to show it. The actual rates for people getting this very important allowance for children and their parents have increased significantly. In 2013, the granting rate for this particular allowance went up to 73%.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> I do not have the statistics to hand for all of the other allowances because the Deputy did not ask about them in his question. If he cares to put a separate question on them, I would be happy to answer it separately.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">On the same matter, what specific steps will the Minister take to address the very serious shortcomings the High Court judge found in the case of a mother who challenged the refusal of her domiciliary care allowance, DCA? The judge referred to the disdain shown for her application. He also called into question the operating procedure of the deciding officers which he said was inappropriately fettered.</p>

            <p eId="para_22">Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is currently paid to over 25,000 clients, parents and guardians, in respect of over 27,000 children at a cost in excess of €140 million a year, when the cost of the respite care grant is included. In 2013, over 4,800 applications were received, with 3,227 claims awarded in the year, including those awarded on review and on appeal. The situation following the review has improved enormously, which people have acknowledged. As I already stated, the High Court ruling of 1 April, to which the Deputy refers, involved a challenge by a mother to the process involved in determining eligibility on her claim for DCA. As the Department is still considering the detailed judgment, I am not in a position to comment further on what actions may be required. However, I can confirm that the DCA eligibility review programme will not recommence until the implications of the judgment are clarified.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> The eligibility review process has been comprehensively redesigned as part of the scheme review undertaken in 2012 and while it has not yet recommenced, a lot of work has been undertaken to prepare for a recommencement of eligibility reviews. The scheme review was overseen by a working group comprising representatives of the Department, other relevant Departments and representatives of parents and guardians. It was chaired by the former Secretary General of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Ms Sylda Langford. On publication of the review report in April 2013, an implementation group was formed, involving representatives of parents and guardians to work on implementing the administrative recommendations. We have been working closely with representative groups, including parents and guardians.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_25"> When the review programme recommences, parents and guardians will be given three months' advance notice of their child’s review to enable them prepare documentation. When this time elapses, they will get a form to complete and have another two months to complete and return it to the Department. The newly introduced forms facilitate the provision of additional medical information, which will be supplied by the specialist attending the child and this will ensure that the appropriate information is available to assist in the decision-making process. </p>
            <p eId="para_26"> This, combined with the new information guidelines and claim process, as outlined in my earlier answer will ensure that the claim and review process will be fully transparent to parents and guardians and that better outcomes are achieved for the children concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">I accept some of the Minister's answer in respect of being hampered because the Department has not had time to fully assess this. Given that a working group has examined this issue, the Department must already have some of the answers. Does the Minister think that, as part of the process, she would produce guidelines and training sessions for the deciding officers covering the relative weight to be attached to medical evidence in the future? When the processes are reformed, will the Minister ask the Department to consider the cases that were refused in the past and encourage them to make fresh claims so that their medical evidence can be examined? Can the Minister confirm that the review of domiciliary care cases in payment, which have been suspended, will recommence next month? Some of the recommendations have been implemented. The form has been changed but there are other changes that should have been implemented, even in that case.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">I confirm the DCA eligibility review programme will not recommence until the implications of the judgment are clarified. The review is required under social welfare law by the Comptroller and Auditor General and by the Committee of Public Accounts. We must carry out regular reviews of all our schemes and everything in the Department. That is the context for the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> The review programme will not commence until we have clarified the understanding of the implications of the judgment. The difference, which we have worked on with parents and guardians, is that when the review programme recommences they will get three months advance notice of their child's review to enable them to prepare documentation or an opinion, or whatever is required for the review. When this time elapses, they will get a form to complete and will have another two months in which to complete and return it to the Department. This is being done to facilitate the provision of additional medical information which will, I assume, be supplied by the specialist who attends the child. This will ensure that, as far as possible, the appropriate information is available to assist in the decision-making process, as the Deputy asked.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">I welcome the changes in the form but, while it might not be in the Minister's gift, there is a waiting list for each and every specialist, unless the client has the money to purchase the services of a private specialist to fill in the forms. Most of the families applying for this do not have the money. That is why they want DCA, to have access to some of the specialists. What steps can be taken to help where the forms and a new system specify two months but in some cases parents wait six months or more to see a specialist consultant? In some parts of Dublin they must wait two years to see a speech and language therapist.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">The Comptroller and Auditor General has determined that social welfare payments are subject to review. The parents will be given three months' notice of the child's review to enable them to get the documentation together and apply for an appointment. When this time has elapsed, they will receive the forms from the Department and will have two months to complete them before getting an appointment. If they cannot get an appointment, they should tell us that and the review will be rescheduled. I give the Deputy an undertaking on that. He probably does not have any specific cases in mind because we suspended the review-----</p>

            <p eId="para_35">Will the Minister explain the rationale behind taxing income gain through the employment Tús programmes? I understand that income over €350 is taxed at 4%. I draw the Minister's attention to the details I have attached to my question.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">I gave the Minister an example of a chap who was taxed €15.70 on his €20 which meant he received 22 cent per hour for the 19.5 hours he worked on the Tús scheme. Surely the Minister would consider that an exploitation of workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">The Deputy's examples relates to an individual who worked 19.5 hours per week on Tús from October 2012 to October 2013. I understand he has a spouse and partner and for most of the year three qualifying children but subsequently two qualifying children. I presume one child reached the age of 18 and became an adult. He would have been paid a standard social welfare allowance of €422.20 per week consisting of a jobseeker's allowance of €188.00, a qualified adult payment of €124.80 and €89.40 in respect of three qualifying dependent children. That is without considering that the individual would have probably been entitled to a fuel allowance of €20 a week for six months of the year, back to school clothing and footwear allowances for the children going back to school and in addition a medical card. The individual had €422.20 a week in total. As Deputy Halligan correctly said, PRSI is chargeable from €352 per week. Employees who are liable for class A PRSI contributions who have an income of up to €352 per week do not pay anything. The rate of PRSI paid on amounts earned over €352 per week is 4%. It is not income tax; it is a social insurance contribution. As part of our fundamental social insurance system, that applies to people in private and public occupations around the country. It is what people in any job contribute. In return, the participants who pay it acquire very valuable social welfare and pension rights. I cannot accept Deputy Halligan's contention that this individual was not being paid significant amounts of money in terms of his family circumstances. It is a benefit for such people to participate in a Tús scheme, which are hugely popular around the country. I was in Waterford recently where people wanted more Tús places.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">The Minister missed the essential point. I am not attacking the Tús schemes. I have contacted the Department of Social Protection on the issue and it has acknowledged that one can be taxed and PRSI can be taken from the €20. Essentially, a person on a Tús scheme is on a social welfare payment. The Minister is asking such a person to work 19.5 hours for €20.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">Surely, common sense would make it clear that if we ask people to work on a Tús scheme - the Minister is correct that many people want to take up such schemes - we should leave them alone, irrespective of their social welfare income and allowances for dependent adults and children. The additional €20 paid on top of their social welfare income should be excluded from tax and PRSI. After all, the income is very low anyway for anyone on social welfare with children who gets an additional €20 on the Tús scheme. I did contact the Department of Social Protection and it has acknowledged that it is possible that once the additional €20 is paid through the Tús scheme on top of a moderate or very low income that one will be charged tax and PRSI. That is clear from the example I have given of the individual concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">When someone moves onto a Tús scheme he or she works 19.5 hours a week for their social welfare payment. In this case the social welfare payment was €422 plus a variety of other supports. If someone was working in a private business in Waterford earning €422 plus a medical card, fuel allowance and back to school clothing and footwear allowances they are expected to contribute a relatively small amount of PRSI, which is significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> In the long run, in terms of the social insurance system, the people who are on the lowest income benefit most because they qualify ultimately for a contributory pension when they retire. There is significant demand around the country for placements on the Tús programme. I hope the particular individual enjoyed and got value from the placement on Tús. The key issue is that for someone like the individual concerned who has been out of work for more than a year and in some cases out of work for many years, Tús is a significant help towards ultimately getting back to education in many cases or further training or employment.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Halligan<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_44">According to figures from the Department of Social Protection which I received during the week, men make up 74% of those who take up the Tús scheme and 65% of the total Tús cohort falls within the 25 to 49 age bracket. That age and gender profile would suggest that in a significant number of cases a Tús worker is also the main breadwinner in a family. That is the argument that is being made by many people on the Tús scheme to whom I have spoken in Waterford. The scheme is not the issue. Although I have difficulty with it but that is neither here nor there relative to the question I ask. The individual concerned has a family and is the main breadwinner. Surely someone on a social welfare payment who works 19.5 hours and is offered an additional €20 on top of his social welfare payment should not have to pay tax or PRSI. That is common sense. Otherwise, one is asking someone to work 19.5 hours for €20 for which one would take home 22 cent an hour.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">I am coming at the issue from a slightly different approach. A constituent of Deputy Halligan who has been unemployed for a long time, along with 7,500 people at any one time, essentially do a one-year community contribution because almost everyone who is on Tús is working and contributing something in his or her local community. That is one of the reasons the scheme is so popular. The individual is earning €422 in social welfare plus a medical card, a fuel allowance for six months of the year of €20 a week, and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for his children going back to school. Because the individual in question is employed for 19.5 hours, a small amount of PRSI is paid on the total package, which will build up the individual's entitlements in terms of social protection and ultimately and importantly result in a State retirement pension. If he was working in a private job and earning that money he would be paying the same amount in PRSI. I will talk to the Minister for Finance because he sets the rate of PRSI. Deputy Halligan might even raise the matter with the Minister for Finance when he gets an opportunity. The Tús scheme is very successful. I hope the man enjoyed his participation on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">There were 300,590 recipients of jobseeker’s allowance at the end of December last year. Up to 100,000 of those were working part time or signing for credits and the number has fallen significantly since. Reduced rates for younger jobseeker’s allowance recipients were first introduced when Deputy O'Dea was a member of Government in 2009. Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker’s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">The decision was made on foot of ongoing consideration of unemployment and incentives policy by the Government. The measure aims to incentivise young jobseeker’s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities. A jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker’s allowance rate who participates in an education or training programme will receive a higher weekly payment of €160. Some 4,700 individuals under 26 years of age are entitled to a reduced rate of jobseeker’s allowance on SOLAS funded training courses. More young jobseekers, approximately 5,000, are also attending other courses operated by the education and training boards such as the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, and Youthreach.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> At the end of March 2014 there were 57,900 jobseeker’s allowance recipients under 26 years of age, of which 36,800 were in receipt of a reduced jobseeker’s allowance payment. The equivalent figures for December 2013, before the introduction of the Budget 2014 measures, was 65,400 because, thankfully, the rate of youth unemployment is falling significantly. We want to incentivise young people not to end up trapped on social welfare but to take opportunities for education and training, and to take up employment where it is available, which would pay them infinitely more. That was the reasoning behind the Deputy's Government introducing this measure in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_52"> Some 39,400 of those 65,400 jobseeker’s allowance recipients under 26 years of age in December 2013 were in receipt of a reduced jobseeker’s payment. When allowance is made for seasonal factors, the trend in the number of young people on the live register has been in line with the trend for the register overall in the early part of 2014. However, the impact of changes like this is likely to be gradual rather than immediate, and will need to be monitored over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> In order to incentivise young jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and try to avoid them becoming welfare dependent from a young age, the changes made to Jobseeker’s allowance rates in 2009 were extended in budget 2014. This decision was made to encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and to ensure that they are better placed to avail of a future employment opportunity. A cornerstone of the Government’s strategy to tackle youth unemployment will be the implementation of the youth guarantee, which will ensure that young people receive a quality offer of assistance within four months of becoming unemployed. This objective is to be achieved over time by enhancing the Intreo engagement with newly unemployed young people, and by maintaining and developing the current range of education, training and employment interventions for young people. The youth guarantee is already being piloted in Ballymun involving a partnership of key national and local stakeholders. The findings from this pilot, which is being mainly funded by the European Commission, will feed into the national roll-out of the guarantee.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">I thank the Minister for the history lesson, but let me elaborate on her knowledge of history. Under the old scheme as introduced by the previous Government, if somebody was unable to access a training or education place, his or her social welfare was not reduced; now it is automatically reduced and that is the fundamental difference. There were many people under the age of 26 who could access employment, education or training. If they accessed education or training they would be better off so it was an incentive. In a reply to a parliamentary question of mine on 8 April, last week, the Minister told me that people between 16 and 25 who are in neither employment, education or training number 85,200. That is 85,200 young people, one in six people under the age of 26, who are neither earning nor learning. Will the Minister accept that the changes in the budget provided no incentive? If she does not, can she tell me how many people they incentivised? Does she accept that the changes in the budget were simply a device to cut the social welfare bill?</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_56">In order to incentivise young people to avail of training and education opportunities and to prevent their becoming welfare-dependent from a young age, changes have been made to the jobseeker's allowance. This decision is not discriminatory but rather a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">It was the Deputy's colleague, former Minister Mary Hanafin, in reply to Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh in April 2009. It is to give people a better opportunity, which so many young people are taking up. As we roll out the youth guarantee we will call in every young person under 26 years of age and over a period of time, particularly the people who are very hard to reach. There are people who left school early, went on social welfare, maybe got small bits of work but nothing that would constitute a well-paid job that would allow them to be financially independent. In the Ballymun pilot scheme young people are responding very positively to the engagement with our officials and people who are essentially helping to develop a life plan and go back into work and education. They get significantly more money as a consequence.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">The difficulty is that the budget change was presented as a measure whereby if a person under the age of 26 could not get a job there would be a place in training or education readily available which he or she could avail of and get an increased allowance, 60% more in most cases. However, there are not enough training or education places for the young unemployed. By the Minister's admission last week, 85,200 people under the age of 26 are neither earning nor learning. How many training places are being made available for those people? Is it not true to say that many of them, including many who have been unemployed for more than four months, cannot access a place in training or education and that in those circumstances it is grossly unfair to cut their social welfare?</p>

            <p eId="para_91">There are approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over €344 million for 2014. Following the most recent review of the private rental market, revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. For all counties, major urban population centres were tested to ensure access to housing and value for money. The Department used information from tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, to analyse actual costs in each county. The purpose of the most recent review is to ensure availability in the areas required, not to provide access to housing in all areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">Despite pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, as well as reductions or no change in others. The limits for counties Waterford and Kilkenny reflected the respective prevailing rental markets and analysis shows there are properties available within these limits. I am fully aware that in some areas, particularly Dublin, prospective tenants are finding it increasingly difficult to secure accommodation due to reduced availability of supply. Increasing rent limits will not resolve this difficulty and would result in additional increases in costs for everyone who is renting, including those who are at work and who pay their rent out of their wages.</p>
            <p eId="para_93"> The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market. Its officials have considerable experience in dealing with clients of the scheme and continue to make every effort to ensure their accommodation needs are met. The Department’s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the housing assistance payment, HAP. Officials are working closely with those in the lead Department, namely, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick with further roll-out to selected local authorities during the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">It has been stated repeatedly that the varying rent levels nationwide are intended to fall in with the cost of rent in the private sector. However, if, for example, one takes a one-parent family or a couple in Waterford with one child, they must comply with a rent limit of €475 per month. The average for all dwellings let in Waterford in the final quarter of last year was €540. These are the Minister's own figures, as well as figures from the average rent database of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB. Consequently, it is incorrect to think rental levels are at one countrywide. Second, I believe the rents are only reviewed every 18 months. Moreover, decisions are taken at central or national level, often by people who are far removed from the reality facing tenants in receipt of rent supplement who are put to the pins of their collars trying to find a place to rent. I will provide an example to the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">Based on the money available at present, for the aforementioned €475, a young family in Waterford would be lucky to get a one-bedroomed apartment. These are facts confirmed by the PRTB's average rent database.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">First, this is a supply problem in a number of cities. I note the recent study on what are the likely requirements for housing and homes in the near future. I believe the only solution is to have a major investment in housing and to have a housebuilding programme. Unfortunately, the direct involvement of local authorities in housebuilding was abandoned by the previous Government at the height of the boom because at the time, it was thought the private market could provide for everything other than perhaps special needs accommodation for older people and those with particular needs. Consequently, this is a supply issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> As for the specific area to which the Deputy referred, the rent limits are in line with the prevailing market conditions in Waterford. I suggest to the Deputy that if he has an issue, he should meet the official dealing with the rents because in many cases, particularly if there are any exceptional circumstances relating to the family or individual concerned, the community officers will be in a position to assist. However, there is an issue. I understand the area to which the Deputy refers is Ferrybank, which has a very small supply of houses for rent overall going back to the supply problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">First, applicants receive rent supplement on the basis that they have no other source of accommodation available to them. Otherwise, they would not be able to afford rental accommodation. The point is that in some areas throughout the country, rents have increased dramatically. It is incorrect to state it may only have increased in Dublin, Cork, Wicklow or wherever. Rents have increased in Waterford. All of the evidence is there from both the PRTB and the Department of Social Protection but yet, the limit has stayed as it is. All this is doing to many young couples is to force them into poverty, because they need some place to stay. They are not going to get onto the housing list - there are far too many people on that list - and inevitably must try to find rented accommodation. Yet, on an income that is nearly €130 less than in many other areas of the country, they are being asked to find such accommodation. My final point is it is €475 per month. While one can try to argue this with the Department, its representatives will reply these are the limits on which they have been told to work, namely, €475 per month. I have tried to do this, as have other Deputies and politicians in Waterford. It is not working and the Minister must change the rent allowance.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">As the Deputy is aware, many people in Waterford who rent are being paid the rent supplement within the limits. The Deputy should remember that the limits were identified by an intensive and extensive survey of all of the current up-to-date data. One concern I have is that because the Department accounts for just under 40% of the total rental market, it will end up pushing up rents for everyone. When the rent was increased last year and when the changes were made, there was a general welcome for it. However, since then, there has been a huge amount of publicity, much of which encourages landlords to seek additional rents. However, as for those renting in the private sector and those in receipt of rent supplement, the evidence we have, because we know what people are renting-----</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_109">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 30 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> This year, the Department will spend approximately €91 million on the farm assist scheme and it is expected that an average of 9,900 individuals will be in receipt of this payment each week. The farm assist scheme is based on jobseeker’s allowance. For example, a person with an adult dependant and two children with a means-assessable income from farming of €15,000 per annum would qualify for a farm assist payment of €84.40 per week. Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker’s allowance scheme, such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes. Recent changes to the scheme have brought it into closer alignment with the jobseeker’s allowance scheme’s treatment of self-employed persons because, as the Deputy is aware, most of those on this scheme have an income from farming.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash flow issues can ask his or her local social welfare or Intreo office to review the level of means applying to his or her claim. The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming. Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year. However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances to ensure the assessment accurately reflects the current situation. Since becoming Minister, I introduced this measure for both self-employed people and farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">Prior to that, the assessments were based on the preceding year's accounts and if a person had a catastrophic fall in income it was very difficult for that person to get farm assist benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> As part of the normal budget process, all potential budget measures, including any changes to the farm assist scheme, are assessed in terms of the impact they would have if introduced. Since the introduction of the changes to the farm assist scheme over recent budgets, the scheme is being kept under ongoing review. There are no plans to review it immediately but it will be examined in the context of the forthcoming budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">The Minister outlined what she had done since she became Minister and, as she will recall, before she became Minister she promised there would no cuts to basic social welfare payments. However, like many other Labour Party promises, that is a promise she broke when it came to the farming community. In successive budgets she reduced the amount of income earned by a farmer in his daily working life over the course of a year that can be disregarded. When she came to office, 70% of a farmer's net income was used to assess his income to calculate what his farm assist payment should be. She increased that in her first budget to 85% and she subsequently increased it and now there is no income disregard when assessing a farmer's income to decide the level of his farm assist payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> The Minister indicated in her reply that any farm family comprising two parents and two children with an average income of €15,000 would qualify for a farm assist payment. I point out to her that the average income for a farming family with a beef farm is €11,000, which means that the income of a farming family with an average cattle rearing farm would be under threshold for farm assist. With the changes the Minister has brought in, on the basis of the payment that is given to such farmers, the work they carry out day in, day out does not count for anything. They are not given any benefit for the work they do over and above the standard dole payment, up to the level of which Minister brings their income.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">More importantly, when I met the farming organisations and their representatives, I learned, understandably, that what they were concerned about in the run-up to last year's budget was that farmers who were experiencing difficulties because of fodder shortages were likely to have much worse outcomes in terms of their income than might have been anticipated the previous year. What I did, and have done for self-employed people also, which was not the case when the Deputy's party was in government, was to provide that any self-employed person, farmer or fisherman can go into the Department of Social Protection and bring with them details of their current accounts, especially if they have lost their business or have had a sudden catastrophic fall in income, which might happen from time to time for people engaged in farming. This is in contrast to the period when Fianna Fáil was in government when those people would have been turned away. The Deputy will remember at the time of the previous general election that there were widespread complaints from self-employed people that they could not access social welfare payments, but now they can. A total of €91 million is being spent on this scheme and I gave the Deputy the number of farm families who benefit from it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_119">There are approximately 10,000 farming families overall, and approximately 1,500 of those are in Donegal. The changes the Minister introduced to the income disregard means that for those 1,500 families, their income has been reduced and, as they come up for review, they are being assessed on the basis of an income of 30% less because the Minister has changed the basis from 70% of income being assessed to 100% of income being assessed. No benefit, incentive or recognition has been given for the fact that day in, day out those families work not only a 40-hour week but in many instances 12 hour days to run a family farm. The Minister is not giving any recognition to the fact they are working full-time. Instead she is bringing their income up to the level of the dole, which is a payment for people who are normally out of work and who we hope will be able to go back to work. However, those farming families work day in, day out. There needs to be recognition that they are in employment, carrying out a valuable role within their community and contributing to the rural economy. What the Minister has done is left many of those farmers in a situation where they get no benefit or reward for the daily work they carry out.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">We will look at that in the context of the budget, but it is a significant support of €310 a week for such a family. It is an important support, in addition to other supports such as the rural social scheme and other schemes, which my Department offers widely to people from farming families. I recognise what the Deputy said about the significance, contribution and hard work of farming families being an enormous contribution to society. That is the reason, despite extraordinarily difficult budgetary pressures and legacy debts that were bequeathed when we came into office, that we have emphasised continuing the support-----</p>

            <p eId="para_137">As provided for in budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pensions were introduced. These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with fewer contributions. People who have insufficient contributions to qualify for a full contributory State pension may qualify for a means-tested non-contributory State pension. In addition, some affected persons may be entitled to a qualified adult increase on their spouse’s or partner’s pension payment. The increase is paid directly to the qualified adult.</p>
            <p eId="para_138"> The homemaker’s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for contributory State pension easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person’s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_139"> The success of all these measures in ensuring equality of outcomes for men and women is evidenced by the poverty statistics, which show that women over the age of 65 are less likely to be in poverty than men of the same age. The most recently published actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the fund provides better value to female contributors than to male contributors. It also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment to be introduced in September 2012. It found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories will continue to obtain the best value from their contributions.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_141"> The introduction of homemaker credits would give increased recognition to women carers’ work to ensure child rearing and caring duties are rewarded. However, their introduction would raise a number of issues, most notably cost. Such costs would be expected to increase very significantly over time. I will keep this under continual review as the economy recovers. A total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for the contributory State pension in 2020, although that date is subject to change. Issues such as equality of outcomes for women and men, and homemaker's credits, will be considered carefully in the context of that reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_142">The change the Minister introduced has led to a situation, since 2012, where people with an average of fewer than 40 weekly contributions per year over their working life are seeing their pension entitlement reduced by €1,500 per year. That is a substantial reduction and more significant than the reductions affecting other categories of workers. I highlighted this issue at the time the change was introduced, pointing to the substantial impact on women in particular. A recent report in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> indicated that the Minister's Department made her aware of the negative consequences of this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_143"> This is an issue that has a particular impact on women who were excluded from work by the marriage bar. What does the change the Minister introduced say to women who gave up work to care for children and elderly relatives? The care they provided subsidised the State by enabling its lack of investment in services and supports. Are we saying to these women who sacrificed their careers that we do not value their contribution? Will the Minister introduce a homemaker's credit scheme to bring up these women's credits and ensure their entitlement to a full State pension rather than the current situation where they lose out because of their contribution to society?</p>

            <p eId="para_144">In 1994, as Minister of State in the then Department of Social Welfare, I was involved, together with the Minister at that time, Michael Woods, in introducing the credits scheme. I recognised that access to State pension and retirement entitlements is very important for both men and women. It was a landmark scheme introduced by the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil in government.</p>
            <p eId="para_145"> The Deputy is suggesting that we make significant enhancements to that scheme. It certainly is an issue I keep under constant review. Many people, including many women and particularly those of limited means, have an entitlement to a non-contributory retirement pension and may also qualify for a qualified adult payment in respect of their spouse. To change the scheme would probably involve a very significant cost. In each social welfare budget for the past three years, I have provided in the Estimates of the Department an extra €200 million or thereabouts for additional pension and retirement benefits in a context where we have far more people reaching pensionable age and living for much longer. The improvements in the economy will dictate whether I am able to increase the budget more significantly than that.</p>

Does she accept that an actuarial review is only that, and that it does not deal with issues such as unpaid caring work?

That scheme represented a landmark breakthrough in retirement provision. It is an issue we need to keep under review and monitor closely. Any change, however, is dependent on resources. In each of the past three budgets, in difficult economic circumstances, I provided an extra €200 million or so of additional funding for pensions against the background of the large and welcome increase in the number of people reaching pension age and the fact they are living much longer. It would require substantial additional resources to enhance the scheme further.</p>

At yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, representatives of Focus Ireland and Simon Communities of Ireland indicated that the Department is well aware that topping up is happening on a widespread basis and is in denial regarding the position in which people are finding themselves. Will the Minister comment on this practice of topping up?</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_103" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_152">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 10 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_153"> There are approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients, at a cost of €344 million for 2014. A top-up payment occurs where the applicant declares a rent lower than that actually being charged by the landlord. No evidence has been presented to the Department showing widespread incidence of illegal top-ups, although I am aware of reports of the problem. All such offences should be reported to the Department, which has specific legislative powers to deal with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_154"> To qualify for rent supplement, the tenant, landlord or landlord's agent must complete the rent supplement application and declare that the information provided is correct and accurate. The application form clearly states that making a false statement or withholding information may lead to prosecution. In June 2012, in order to improve the governance arrangements, the Department introduced powers of inquiry for staff to request formally and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of rent supplement tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_155"> Prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are finding it increasingly difficult, particularly in Dublin, to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. As I have indicated, it is very much a supply issue. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the rent limits were increased in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and north Kildare, in June 2013. Further increasing the limits at this time will not resolve the supply issue and would result in additional increases in rental costs for all persons renting, including working people making payments out of their wages. I have no plans to revise the current limits or the maximum rent review process at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_156"> In view of the ongoing difficulties, the Dublin local authorities are engaging with the Department in developing an inter-agency intervention system to identify vulnerable families who are in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy. These cases will be assessed on an individual basis having regard to individual circumstances, and families requiring additional support will receive the necessary assistance, financial or otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_157"> The fact that approximately 78,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating and negotiating with applicants of the scheme. I am aware of the practice by some leading property websites of asking potential landlords whether they will accept rent supplement tenancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">That practice is extremely unfair and it is leading many landlords more or less to tick the relevant box on online forms and indicate they will not accept rent supplement. We are asking a number of agencies to reconsider their practices in this regard, particularly as they involve a very unfair attitude abroad towards people who are in receipt of rent supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_160"> The Department is aware that some leading property websites ask potential landlords to indicate whether they will accept rent supplement tenancies. It is the Department’s expressed position that this practice should cease and the matter has been raised with the leading websites. However, it is open to any person who has been refused a private tenancy and who feels discriminated against on the basis of his or her gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or membership of the Traveller community to refer a discrimination complaint to the Equality Tribunal under the Equal Status Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_161"> I assure the Deputies that departmental officials administering rent supplement have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and will continue to make every effort to ensure their accommodation needs are met. While the majority of persons are in a position to engage successfully and negotiate with landlords, any customers experiencing difficulties should continue to engage with departmental officials.</p>

            <p eId="para_164">Those from the Simon Community indicated that the problem in respect of housing has reached crisis levels. It is no longer just people who have - I hate to use this word - traditionally been considered homeless who have nowhere to go. In that context, I am aware of increasing numbers of families, particularly those with children, who are being made homeless. The representatives from both organisations indicated that the crisis to which I refer is on the verge of becoming a disaster. I do not know what we have to do to get the media to pay attention to what is happening to a significant number of people. I met a family last week - I deal with such families every week - who slept in a car with their child. They approached the local authority and asked what they should do the following night and they were told to find a relative or friend with whom they could stay. The family in question has been homeless for eight weeks. I could give a litany of people who are in the same position. The Minister and the Government are in denial.</p>

            <p eId="para_182">There are approximately 90,000 individuals and families on the housing waiting list nationally. If we are truthful with ourselves, we must accept there is going to be an avalanche of repossessions. This means the numbers on the waiting list are going to increase. The number of social housing units that will be built in the next year will only run into the hundreds. This will in no way be sufficient to meet requirements. We are going to be obliged to rely on private rented accommodation for a period until supply meets demand. I am of the view that said period will be of a significant length. The Minister is in government and she cannot consider this matter in the context of a silo-based approach. There is a need for a wide-ranging strategy in respect of housing. In the short term, the Government must change its approach to this matter, particularly as increasing numbers of families are finding it impossible to rent properties. Regardless of whether the Minister believes it, this is happening. Focus Ireland, the Simon Community and <i>daft.ie</i> have all indicted that it is happening. We cannot just keep denying what is taking place. The Government must take action to provide for the people to whom I refer.</p>

            <p eId="para_183">There is no doubt that supply is a problem. However, price is also a problem. Rent supplement has been reduced, while rents are increasing. I know many people in Wexford who have been obliged to make up the shortfall which has resulted from this. In Dublin, rents are going through the roof. There is a good reason for this. Huge numbers of apartments - including a number I developed - have been sold, <i>en bloc</i> as opposed to individually, for less than half the amount that it would cost to build them today. An individual customer who buys an apartment or a house is obliged to pay market value. However, speculators have bought blocks of properties for half the market value. As a result, an increasing number of rental properties are in the hands of fewer people. This has led to the development of a cartel in the rental market. Due to the fact that they own so many rental properties, speculators can dictate the price.</p>

I have been informed by officials from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that, for the first time ever, they have nothing to offer families seeking accommodation. They cannot even provide homeless accommodation. The officials in question are just telling people to go away. What is the Minister going to do about this? We all know there is a need for social housing. The Government is planning to build approximately 500 council houses at a time when 95,000 are needed. The 500 houses to which I refer will not even match the number of people who will go onto the waiting list this year as a result of their own homes being repossessed because they cannot repay their mortgages. Private landlords are pulling out of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and leasing arrangements because they can obtain higher rents elsewhere. In such circumstances, the Government's plan is absolutely done for.</p>
            <p eId="para_189"> What does the Government propose to do? That is what we want to know. We do not want the Minister to utter nonsense about supply. The Government should commence building social housing units now and, in the interim, raise the rent cap in order that people might source private rented accommodation. We know that the latter is not a long-term solution. What solution does the Government have for families who are currently homeless and on the streets with their children?</p>

          <p eId="para_224">Obviously, the Bill has a narrow focus. Part of that focus and part of the reason it is being brought forward is because the Government, in particular the Attorney General, was facing a court challenge due to be held in July which it would have lost, essentially on account of the reasons articulated by the Minister on Second Stage last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> I rang the Ceann Comhairle's office to find out why my amendments were out of order. I was told it was because the Bill was only dealing with the issue of bankruptcy. This could have been a golden opportunity to deal with an anomaly in time for the local and European elections. The anomaly is that the Government calls us Independents on this side of the House, the media calls us Independents, we describe ourselves as Independents on our election material, we describe ourselves as Independents in press statements and we describe ourselves as Independents in everything that we do politically and yet we are not allowed to describe ourselves as Independents on the ballot paper. This could be changed if there was a will to change it and this would have been a timely opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> If this amendment was taken and agreed, it could have been done in time for the local and European elections. Instead, people will be expected to leave the space blank or to describe themselves as "non-party". I am not "non-party". I could decide to be in a party if I wished. I am not deficient because I am not in a party. I want to describe myself on the ballot paper as Independent, as do the hundreds of Independents who will be contesting the election. It is long past time that this was changed. I regret that we are not even going to be allowed to debate the amendment. It is a foregone conclusion that it will not be included and that is regrettable.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">Deputy Murphy's amendments provide that for a Dáil election a candidate who is not a candidate of a political party, as registered, shall be entitled to use the word "Independent" rather than "non-party". The amendments reflect Deputy Murphy's Electoral (Amendment) Bill published on 1 April 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> The relevant provisions of the 1992 Act set out that the expression "non-party" may be used where a candidate is not a candidate of a registered political party. This is based on the premise that the expression "non-party" on the ballot paper indicates adequately that a person does not belong to a political party. This description shows briefly, clearly and in a neutral way that the person does not belong to a registered party. It is a simple statement of fact and, as such, we believe it is appropriate for inclusion on the nomination and ballot papers. On the other hand, the description "Independent" could be viewed as a value-laden term and could have different meanings for different people. Indeed, it may not be acceptable to many non-party candidates. I note with interest the number of labels or identities being used by potential non-party candidates, including, for example, The People's Convention, Independents for Equality, Tús Nua, Kildare Action for Change and Independents Together.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> This Bill, which is major reforming legislation, has three main objectives. First, as part of the programme of reform we are implementing across my Department, it will merge the National Consumer Agency, NCA, and the Competition Authority to create a powerful body with real teeth acting to protect and vindicate consumers' rights. New criminal investigation functions are being added to the significant powers that already exist in order to combat serious white collar crime and improve competitiveness and protect consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Second, we are introducing strong regulations and enforcement powers to ensure fairness between suppliers and retailers in the grocery goods sector. There is potentially an inequality between these players that could be abused in a manner that would not be in the interests of jobs, consumers or sustainable safe food. Relationships will continue to be based on commerce and prices will continue to be set by hard negotiations. This is in the interests of consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> Third, diversity of content and ownership across the media remains an important part of a healthy democratic society. We are retaining the basic model of current laws, which is based on the principle of avoiding intervention by the Government in media ownership except in specific circumstances following procedures determined by law. This is in keeping with the recommendations of the advisory group established to examine this matter. However, it is important to modernise these laws to reflect international best practice and the latest technological developments. For this reason, we are implementing in full the advisory group's recommendations, with some enhancements, and making important changes to update laws in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> I now intend to deal with each of the main elements of the Bill in turn, the first being the amalgamation of the two agencies. Reform of the public service is one of the key commitments in the programme for Government and rationalisation of State agencies is a major part of that commitment. As part of that rationalisation, the Competition Authority and the NCA are being merged into one body, the competition and consumer protection commission. Since both were set up under statute, legislation is required to establish the new commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> As consumer welfare is at the heart of competition and consumer policy, the merging of the two bodies will ensure improved co-ordination of these two policy areas. The merger of the NCA and the Competition Authority will lead to the establishment of a new body with stronger powers and more resources to deal with competition and consumer issues. The basic aim of consumer and competition policy is competitive markets with better services and lower prices for the consumer. The merger will benefit consumers, bringing together the economic and legal expertise of the Competition Authority and the practical knowledge and experience of the NCA into an effective integrated organisation. It will lead to efficiencies and synergies in carrying out the functions of the new body due to the existence of a stronger and more co-ordinated body dealing with consumer and competition issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> An effective mechanism for overseeing competition and consumer empowerment in the marketplace is the best way to ensure that there are no barriers to entry and that jobs growth and innovation are promoted. This legislation will promote competition and consumer standards, long-term competitiveness and jobs growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> The Bill sets out, primarily in sections 6 to 45, inclusive, of Part 2, the structure, powers and functions of the new merged body. Many of these sections cover traditional provisions on the establishment of a new body and the dissolution of existing bodies. In terms of structure and corporate governance, the new merged body will comprise a chairperson and between two and six members who will act in a collegiate manner. This structure is modelled on that of the Competition Authority and, consequently, there will be no board. The initial members of the new merged body will be the members of the Competition Authority and the CEO of the NCA. Appointments thereafter can only be made by me as Minister following an open recruitment process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service, PAS.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> As is the case with the two existing bodies, the new competition and consumer protection commission will be independent in carrying out of a range of functions, such as enforcement, investigations and merger determinations. The commission will be accountable to the Oireachtas and me as the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in line with usual accountability and governance procedures and practices. Since being announced as part of the rationalisation plan for State agencies, my Department has worked, and is continuing to work, with both bodies to ensure a smooth transition from the two separate entities to a single dual-functioning body responsible for competition and consumer protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Crimes under competition law are often viewed as victimless. Let me be clear - we are all the victims of such crimes. Where the operation of the free market is restricted by collusion or other nefarious practices, the result is that consumers pay more than they should have to, whether it is to heat their homes or buy cars. The State and people as taxpayers are victims if companies engage in bid-rigging in respect of public procurement contracts for the building of roads, the fitting out of hospitals and schools or any of the services purchased by the State. All of this adversely impacts on national competitiveness and job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> One of the purposes of the Bill is to strengthen the enforcement of competition law by adding to the powers that will be available to the new commission. Breach of competition law is a serious white collar crime and, as with all other forms of crime, those who commit crimes must be punished accordingly. A suite of additional enforcement powers was provided to the Competition Authority in 2012 by me under the Competition (Amendment) Act 2012. I also sanctioned additional staff to be allocated to it in order to strengthen competition law enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Part 7 gives additional powers to the new commission by extending the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2011. In addition, some elements of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 have been incorporated into the powers of the new commission. As published, Part 7 also proposes the extension of the provisions of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 to serious competition law offences. However, the implications of the recent European Court of Justice, ECJ, ruling on the relevant EU directive on data retention and Ireland's Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 in general are being examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> Other substantive changes to the Competition Act 2002 under sections 46 to 68, inclusive, of Part 3 of this Bill mainly revolve around the procedures to be operated by the new commission in respect of merger notifications. Many of these emanated from a public consultation process held in 2007 and 2008. I also intend tabling amendments on Committee or Report Stage, including some relating to the merger regime, based on the practical experience gained on the operations of the regime during the 11 years since its inception.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> Regarding the Consumer Protection Act 2007, a series of five amendments is being proposed in sections 70 to 75, inclusive, of Part 5 on the basis of experience of that Act. I have previously stated that I intend introducing a further consumer rights Bill in 2015 that will update sales law and build on the experience of the Consumer Protection Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> I will turn to the Bill's second main element, that being, the regulation of certain practices in the grocery sector via the enabling provisions in Part 6. At the outset, let me be clear that the Government is strongly of the view that it is important to ensure a balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have robust agrifood and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy. Regulation of certain practices in the grocery goods sector is intended to achieve such a balance, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders, including the consumer, and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing on of lower prices to consumers. This balance is an important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> The need to regulate certain practices in the grocery sector has been asserted by many Deputies. Under the guidance of Mr. John Travers, an attempt was made to secure a voluntary code of practice. In May 2011, I published the Travers report, the findings of which were that there did not appear to be any likelihood of such a voluntary code being agreed. A draft statutory code of conduct was prepared and formed the basis of a public consultation process. Lack of any likelihood of a voluntary code was also recognised by the commitment in the programme for Government to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector. At the time of the publication of the Travers report, I recognised that regulation of grocery goods was highly contentious and that there was an inevitable strain in the relationships between suppliers and retailers. However, these relationships should be built on solid principles of mutual opportunity and fair competition, which does not always happen. I also stated at the time that I was disappointed that there had been no agreement on a voluntary code, as regulation by the Government should always be a last resort. Where regulation is contemplated, it should be forensically designed to avoid unnecessary costs on consumers and businesses and to ensure a fair balance is achieved between them.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> As the House is aware, the Oireachtas has examined this issue a number of times.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, under the chairmanship of Deputy Andrew Doyle, published a detailed report in late 2013 on the grocery goods sector and highlighted a range of areas which it believed were affecting the grocery goods sector in Ireland. The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation also produced a detailed report on the retail sector in early 2011 under the chairmanship of Deputy Willie Penrose.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> There have also been developments at EU level on the issue of the relationship between various parts of the food supply chain. In September 2013, a voluntary initiative on principles of good practices in the food supply chain was launched and adopted by certain European associations. However, not all elements of the supply chain signed up to this initiative, mirroring the different views on the value of a voluntary system that emerged in Ireland from the Travers report process. In a parallel exercise, the European Commission published its Green Paper, "Unfair Trading Practices in the Business to Business food and non-food supply chain in Europe", in early 2013 and commenced a public consultation on it to gather the views of market participants on the occurrence of these practices, their possible effects and the most effective remedies, if required. The public consultation process was guided by a range of questions ranging from asking if respondents considered that unfair trading practices were pervasive to whether there was consumer detriment in the presence of such unfair commercial practices. Given the diversity of respondents to the exercise, there was little consensus to any of the questions. The European Commission is considering the results to decide whether it will initiate any proposals in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> However, none of this precludes a member state from taking measures it believes may be required. Such complementarity between the EU work and the national work is recognised by the European Commission. Obviously, we will all take an interest in the implementation of the voluntary initiative and the impact of its development over the coming months, but it will not halt implementation of the commitment in the programme for Government to regulate in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> To give effect to the programme for Government commitment, the Government will introduce statutory regulation of certain practices. These will take the form of a series of regulations, with associated sanctions, rather than a code of conduct. This is a more powerful tool than a code. To oversee and enforce the regulations, there have been calls for an independent ombudsman. As the House will appreciate, the establishment of a new stand-alone State body to oversee this issue would not be feasible in the current economic climate for reasons of scarce financial resources, duplication with enforcement of existing legislation in the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 on activities that prevent, restrict or distort competition in the grocery goods sector, and the need to ensure there is no unnecessary proliferation of public service bodies. Hence, as has been noted in previous comments on this matter in the Oireachtas, the new amalgamated competition and consumer protection commission will be the independent body assigned responsibility for overseeing and enforcing these regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> This new body will be given the powers to enforce the regulations and will build on the considerable enforcement and investigative powers the two current bodies have built up over recent years, rather than start afresh with a new body. Contravention of the regulations will be an offence, as will failure to comply with any contravention notice issued by the new competition and consumer protection commission. That body will also have the power to list publicly all undertakings that either have contravened the regulations or failed to comply with the contravention notices. This will inform consumers on which undertakings are not abiding by the regulations. The commission will also be able to act on its own initiative or on the basis of information supplied to it. However, in enforcing any regulations, the basic tenets of fair procedure and natural and constitutional justice must be upheld. Of course, if there are no suspect practices being carried out, there will be no issue for any contracting party to such relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> It is important to note that the introduction of regulations does not, and cannot, guarantee anything regarding the prices received by any given link in the supply chain. Negotiations on price will remain an issue between the contracting parties, as happens in any commercial relationship. What the new regulations will be intended to achieve is to regulate certain practices, not set prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> These provisions are enabling provisions and set out the issues that will be covered by any subsequent statutory instrument, SI. Part 6 of the Bill, which covers sections 76 to 78, inclusive, sets out a long list of issues and activities which may be covered by such regulations. I intend that this implementing statutory instrument will be brought into force as soon as practicable after the Bill has been enacted, and I will consult with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, in drafting the regulations. This work will take place in parallel with the Oireachtas consideration of the Bill. The statutory instrument will be accompanied by a detailed regulatory impact analysis. The use of a statutory instrument rather than amendments to primary legislation allows for a more rapid response to changing conditions into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> With regard to some issues not covered by the proposal, I refer in particular to the disclosure of margins by retailers. The contents of the financial statements of companies are governed by relevant EU company law directives and regulations and by the applicable accounting standards. I understand the European Commission has no plans to amend this disclosure regime in respect of specific sectors in the economy as this would be open to accusations of discrimination and, were it to be required generally in the economy, it could have implications in terms of business costs and attracting foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> On section 69 in Part 4 and the issue of media mergers, under the current system, if the Competition Authority determines that a media merger fails the competition test, the matter is closed and the issue does not go to me, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, for a determination regarding the public interest aspect of the merger. If the authority determines the merger can be put into effect, I, as Minister, may direct the authority to carry out a full investigation based on the notification and analysis from the Competition Authority of its decision and the details of the merger as presented. As part of this process, the authority is required to give an opinion as to how the application of the relevant public interest criteria - the strength and competitiveness of media businesses indigenous to the State, the extent to which ownership or control of media businesses and control of particular types of media business in the State is spread among individuals and other undertakings which are listed in the existing statute - should affect the exercise of my powers. If I do not make a decision counter to the original Competition Authority determination, no more action is required. However, if I make a decision counter to the original Competition Authority determination, this decision must be confirmed by me through the making of an order which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is the existing procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> This Part of the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill 2014 will implement the recommendations from the advisory group on media mergers which published a report, the Sreenan report, during the lifetime of the previous Government. These recommendations are aimed at modernising the system for regulating media mergers to reflect international best practice and in line with the latest technological developments. However, the broad three-step process that currently exists in respect of media mergers will continue in existence in future: first, a determination by the Competition Authority, or the competition and consumer protection commission in the future, that a merger has taken place; second, a decision by the Competition Authority, or the competition and consumer protection commission in the future, on whether the merger should or should not be permitted to go ahead on competition grounds; third, in the event that the Competition Authority, or the competition and consumer protection commission in the future, lets the merger go ahead on competition grounds, a decision by the relevant Minister on whether the merger should be permitted to go ahead on the grounds of public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> There is no provision for, and the Sreenan report did not recommend, an ongoing regulatory function in respect of media ownership. The power only falls to be exercised in the event that a merger takes place, as defined, and that a merger is permitted to proceed on competition grounds. The key concept relating to the definition of a merger remains the concept of effective control. No changes are recommended or provided for in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> Section 69 includes a comprehensive suite of proposals to implement in full the recommendations of the Sreenan report, with two amendments. The first sees a change in the relevant Minister for such public interest considerations from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, with a major role for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in drawing up a report for the Minister prior to his making a decision on the matter from a public interest aspect. The Sreenan report noted that both Ministers could be the relevant Minister for the purposes of this test, but it came down on the side of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as the Competition Authority, an agency reporting to that Minister, would be responsible for the competition test of the proposed merger.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">However, given progress in the areas of media, broadcasting and the digital area, it is more appropriate that the responsibility be transferred to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> The second change relates to designating the relevant joint Oireachtas committee as a notifiable body when the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is considering any proposed media mergers from the public interest aspect. The Government believes that the opinion of the relevant joint Oireachtas committee is a very important element of the consultative process that would be undertaken. The Sreenan report did not foresee a specific role for the Oireachtas, but the Government believes that this should be included by way of a notifiable body in the consultation process. This will complement the views of a specific advisory panel which will be established to assist in the examination of any given media merger.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> The proposed Bill sees the new amalgamated competition and consumer protection commission's role strictly limited to examining the media merger from a competition angle only. The public interest test and final decision rests with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The new amalgamated competition and consumer protection commission will have no role in this aspect, unlike the current situation where the Competition Authority must give an opinion in the matter. This clear division of responsibility is one of the cornerstones of the Sreenan report's recommendations. It also includes a wider set of definitions, a longer list of relevant criteria to be taken into account and sets out a formal consultation process that should be followed in making a determination in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> I firmly believe that the effective mechanism for overseeing competition and consumer empowerment in the marketplace, which is one of the main aims of the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill 2014, is the best way to ensure there are no barriers to entry and that jobs growth and innovation are promoted. This will promote competition and consumer standards, long-term competitiveness and jobs growth. I look forward to working with Deputies on Committee and Report Stages of this Bill. In the meantime, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">I am pleased to speak on the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill 2014, which is before us at long last. I have listened to the Minister's speech. While there might be some interesting and helpful aspects in the Bill, his script spells out a number of items that are not included in the legislation, but which should be included. What we see in front of us is a weakening of people's consumer rights by the introduction of this Bill. It covers a number of areas that should be in the Bill that the Minister has concluded should not be in the Bill. The Minister stated that under the Bill the new competition and consumer protection commission's role will be strictly limited to examining the media merger from a competition angle only. The public interest test will be solely for the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> The new amalgamated competition and consumer protection commission will have no role in deciding in that aspect, unlike the current situation where the Competition Authority has to give an opinion on the matter. A new organisation is being set up, but the Minister is nobbling it at the ankles before he sets it up. The Competition Authority currently has power and authority, can act in the public interest and give an opinion on mergers in the media. This new Bill specifically takes power from the Competition Authority that it already has. People might not like the Competition Authority because it has this power, and they have got to this Government. They have said to this Government-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_270">I understand the point the Minister is making, but essentially we are giving the sole discretion to the Minister and we are taking away the power that the Competition Authority had. I accept what the Minister is saying, but even if we look at the role of Sky in our national sports in the last few weeks, there are many new cases which were not around when these committees made observations in the past. Media mergers, concentration of ownership and media power have increased enormously, as has the overall influence of media magnates on Irish society. Not only do they own media, communications and mobile phone networks, they are now also involved in hospitals so there must be some limit to monopolies and how much individuals can actually control in Ireland. The situation has been exacerbated in recent times, but this Bill is going in the opposite direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> Another element of the Minister's speech that I oppose is in respect of the role of an ombudsman. One of my first questions would have been whether this Bill will be subject to freedom of information, and I do not see that it is. We will need clarification of that on Committee Stage. I believe the Government has given a commitment on this. Time after time, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has stated that all new agencies will come under the freedom of information legislation, so I look forward to this Minister confirming that the Freedom of Information Act will apply to this new agency. It is not clear from this, but perhaps it is covered in some other legislation that will automatically bring it into being. Not only is the freedom of information legislation important, but so is the issue of an ombudsman. The public has lost faith in many institutions both in the public and private sector, but there is strong respect out there for the role of the ombudsman. There is no need for a separate ombudsman, but this organisation should be brought under the remit of the current Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> There is an argument that we do not want a stand-alone agency, but it does not have to be a stand-alone agency in the current economic climate. It is claimed that for reasons of scarce financial resources, duplication with the enforcement of existing legislation on activities would not be feasible. I do not buy that. As we are in a time of scarce economic resources and because we have been in a difficult economic situation, it is all the more reason for being careful with how public bodies carry out their functions and deal with matters on behalf of the public. For that very reason, the Ombudsman should have a role and we will be putting down amendments on some of these issues on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> I would also like to highlight one of the fundamental flaws in the Bill that is specific to Ireland. The Minister states that in respect of "some issues not covered by the proposal, I would particularly refer to the disclosure of margins by retailers". The big boys have won again and the consumer loses out. I am talking about the big multinationals. I have heard the current and previous taoisigh refer to items they have had to discuss at Heads of State meetings at EU level. Some of that was about the role and strength of supermarkets across the EU and how they were strangling the producers. This is not just a matter in Ireland; the role of the buying power of key players is an issue in every EU country. Three or four people can determine the livelihood of thousands of producers in Ireland and across the EU. I understand these matters would have been raised at G8 meetings, such is the seriousness of the purchasing power of some of these major multinationals when it comes to setting prices for the producers so they can move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> The Minister quotes EU company law and accounting standards, and I know that accounting standards require geographic details in respect of turnover, but the Minister does not want to go down the road of a disclosure regime in respect of the margin. I would say that there is a specific case for the island of Ireland when it comes to margins. Survey after survey shows the prices in supermarkets in Dundalk versus the prices of supermarkets in Northern Ireland, and the price of products sold by Boots pharmacies in the North versus the price of products sold by Boots across the country and in Dublin. Time after time we see schedules and lists published in the newspapers which show the different prices between North and South. I will not never accept that it is a different market. The response we get from all these multinationals is that the Northern Ireland market is part of the UK market and they have the economies of scale when selling to a population of 60 million, something that does not apply to a population of 4 million in the Republic of Ireland. Newry and Belfast are closer to Dublin than they are to London or Edinburgh, and I do not accept the argument being put up by these companies that they should not have to disclose their margins. When a company in England sources its products in England and sells into the market of the island of Ireland, it has different margins North and South of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">That is not in the interest of people on this island. This legislation is failing the Irish consumer in addressing the different margins that apply and the purchasing power of the multiples. The Minister acknowledged in his statement that the legislation does not cover the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> The Minister has left more out of the legislation than he has included. The Bill runs to 92 pages and admittedly has some excellent provisions, such as the setting up of a new agency. I have no problem with amalgamating two agencies and creating more efficiency, although the savings will be minimal because everybody has to keep his job, rights and entitlements and there will be contractual leases for buildings and other such arrangements. While there may be more efficiency in the longer term, which I support, the savings do not justify the introduction of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> The Minister stated there are three elements to the legislation. The first is the amalgamation of two agencies, which is good, although the savings for the public will be very low. Second, the Minister wants to deal with the issues arising between suppliers and retailers in the grocery sector. I have just explained how the Minister funked completely in this regard, and he refused to include sections in the legislation regarding the margins allowed on grocery products north and south of the Border. This has rendered the second part of the legislation very weak.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> The third element concerns diversity and ownership across the media. The Minister is saying he will not deal with this either. In fact, he is to reduce the power of the Competition Authority in this regard. The Minister would be better calling this legislation a Bill to establish an agency to reduce the powers and protection of Irish consumers than what he has called it. Two fundamental issues are not being dealt with. The Minister has failed to deal with the media issue and the relationship between suppliers and retailers in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> I wish to highlight a problem concerning competition in the retail sector. Last Christmas, we all saw the queues outside some of the German supermarkets, such as Lidl and Aldi, where vegetables were offered for 50 cent or 5 cent - I forget the particular offer. Owing to the offers many people were cleaned out. We were all informed at the time that the next target was the meat industry. The supermarkets were to offer much reduced prices for meat and were thereby going to do fundamental damage to local butchers in all the affected towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> There is a branch of every supermarket chain in my town, Portlaoise, and I check the prices in them all. Meat products in Lidl and Aldi are quite dear. I want that to be known because people believe there is great value there. The two supermarkets have good value on some items. These items are probably loss leaders but we do not know because they are German or from elsewhere in Europe. They are not the traditional products we are used to. The price of 1 kg or 0.5 kg of any meat in Lidl and Aldi is certainly no lower than in any other supermarket. I wish to knock on the head the view that some of the products are good value.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> The substantive issue with which we need to deal is below-cost selling. My main complaint about below-cost selling, on which I have a certain view, concerns how major supermarkets can sell alcohol below cost. This issue needs to be dealt with aggressively because teenagers, including 14-year-olds and 15-year-olds, are getting beer for under €1 per can. There was a time when one almost tripped over the pallets of beer when going through the front door of some supermarkets. While I accept that alcohol products are now segregated, this does not stop the drink getting into the hands of young teenagers, perhaps because it is purchased by older friends or family members. The main reason is that the drink is being sold at such a cheap price. There is a case not only for dealing with below-cost selling but also for imposing a new tax on alcohol sold in off-licences at such a low price. Below-cost selling is adding to the binge-drinking culture. Many difficulties in the health service arise from this over time. The serious impact is not being dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> When a supermarket buys containers of drink to sell below cost, it gets a VAT refund from the Government. This is absurd. Not only are supermarkets destroying the young population by making the drink so readily available, they can in turn get a VAT refund because they sell below cost. The matter is very simple. If a supermarket sells a can of beer for €1, it includes VAT, but if €1.20 is paid for the can of beer, including VAT, the purchase cost is higher than the sales cost. Therefore, when the supermarket submits its VAT return on the beer it is selling below cost, it actually gets a VAT refund on the loss. This is morally wrong and should not be allowed to continue. It is doing immense damage. These are the issues with which we should be dealing in regard to competition and below-cost selling when dealing with this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> I have referred to various aspects of the legislation and wanted to highlight matters that the Minister referred to in his opening statement before making my points on the legislation. There are some good points in the legislation but most of the good points that should be in it have been omitted. It is welcome that there is a new criminal investigation function. We need to ensure that the watchdog will have real teeth. We have grave concerns that it will not. When we consider some of the bodies with powers of prosecution, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement - I do not refer here to the Garda - we realise court cases are very rare. It is important that this matter is being dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> Where anti-competitiveness issues are concerned, the biggest culprit is the State itself. The Government is setting up Irish Water, which I will not discuss in detail. The Government is to set the price of water for every business in the State, and it will probably be different from the current price. Non-commercial consumers will have to pay also. There will be an additional cost on business considering that current rates vary from county to county because they are set at local authority level. Irish Water is to have a turnover of €190 million this year from the commercial customers it has taken on from the local authorities. I assume that if there is one national agency, a litre of water will be the same price in Dublin as in Caherciveen. It would be very absurd if different prices were charged by Irish Water in different counties, as happens at present. Some commercial customers may gain but some will be paying higher rates for water than they have been paying to date. The general public will have water meters installed in their houses as the year progresses and they, too, will have to pay. The Minister is adding to the cost of business. This is one of the difficulties we have with everything the Government is talking about. It wants to talk about competition but it is making sure, through a lack of competition, that it does nothing to bring prices under control.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> The questions of legal reform and the medical profession must be taken into account. On the grocery business, while "hello money" was banned many years ago, a new regime in now in place whereby retailers charge suppliers for marketing and promotion. The supermarket tells the supplier it is going to mention his or her product in a television advertisement but that he or she must pay for it. This is anti-competitive. We know well what will happen if the supplier says "No"; he will not be a supplier the following week. Companies and big buyers can abuse their dominant position in Ireland, and we want to see this rooted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> The Government is one of the significant contributors to high costs, and this distorts competition. If the cost of doing business in Ireland is higher than elsewhere, it makes it much more difficult for our businessmen to compete with those in other countries. Our electricity cost is among the highest in the European Union. There is a hotchpotch approach to waste disposal throughout the country. It is becoming more expensive as the years go by.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">In addition, the interest rates charged for small businesses are excessive when compared to many other European countries. The cost of other services, such as postal and transport services, is also increasing and the new carbon tax is another initiative that will add more costs onto Irish businesses and make them less competitive in the international market. The Minister brings forward this competition legislation today yet his Government is making it more difficult for these businesses, which are employing Irish people, to compete abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> One area where there is not sufficient competition is that of broadband, where everybody talks about the lack of services. In coming from my constituency today on the main motorway, I twice lost mobile phone calls on my hands-free Bluetooth set because there was not sufficient mobile phone coverage. In my constituency office, my mobile phone signal is not adequate. I do not know what the mobile phone companies have been doing in recent times but I say categorically that the quality of the mobile phone service has deteriorated in certain parts of the country and the broadband service is also at a very low ebb in many areas. There is not sufficient competition in those areas and it would be far better to force those companies to provide a proper service to their customers than to pass this legislation, which leaves out more than it includes.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> With regard to competition, I see a major lacuna in the legislation which goes back to the question of why we have the Competition Authority. This reflects a particular right-wing ethos whereby competition in king. Competition is not always king. The idea that we cannot have people negotiating collectively as this would distort competition is a bad thing because that is not necessarily the case. The Government cannot now negotiate properly with the IMO in regard to the contract with GPs because it would be deemed to be in breach of competition legislation. We had the same argument in regard to the pharmacy organisations some time ago, when we were told negotiation would be anti-competitive. I remember this issue coming up in a debate in the past. I am convinced that the EU legislation which states that competition is king also provides, when it comes to the health service, that competition issues can be set aside. We in Ireland have been weak in enforcing that aspect of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> We have not tackled the issue of competition in the legal profession. There is a cosy relationship between the legal profession and this House. I believe it has been too cosy and that there has been too much influence here. The troika came here for three years and the legal profession prevaricated about the need to reform itself. It was said there was so much other legislation, and that the draftsman's office, the Government and the Attorney General's office would have to be involved, so they never got around to reforming the legal profession. The troika is now gone, three years on. The legal profession won and the people of Ireland lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> The case I would cite in all of this is that of the State Claims Agency, which currently has on its books claims that the agency maintains will cost some €1.2 billion to settle - these are the figures produced in its annual report. Out of that €1.2 billion, however, approximately €500 million is for legal fees. This is the biggest element in many cases, where the legal fees are greater than the cost of settling the cases. The Minister is presiding over a situation where barristers can, by and large, get €500 million from the State Claims Agency over the next couple of years and there is no real competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I am not talking about internal competition among a few buddies dropping €50 an hour, or about the Attorney General setting a rate. Anyone who thinks that is where the debate is at does not understand the issue at all. Legislation has to be enacted that will allow the State Claims Agency to employ its own barristers, and that legislation must allow those barristers who are employees of the State Claims Agency on a fixed annual salary to represent the State Claims Agency in court. I know the legal profession will do a song and a dance and say a barrister is a self-employed person. However, hospital consultants can say the same but they still work for the HSE under contract, and we have dealt with the issue of the indemnity insurance of hospital consultants. All of those issues can be dealt with. A barrister cannot make a greater case that he is a self-employed professional than a consultant operating in a hospital. If we have solved it with the consultants on the medical side by bringing them under contract into the HSE, we must and should do the same with the legal profession when it comes to handling these issues. The tribunals have closed and the legal profession has now moved on. The new gravy train is the State Claims Agency. There is €500 million sitting there to be paid out by the Irish taxpayer on State Claims Agency claims in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I want to deal with some aspects of the legislation, although it is unfortunate that some issues that should form part of the legislation have been omitted by the Minister. As I said, the Ombudsman and freedom of information should have a role on this issue. I also want clarification, when the Minister is summing up, on the role of this new competition and consumer protection agency in respect of Irish Water and whether it will look after the interests of the consumer in that regard. I understand the commission will itself be able to initiate prosecutions. I hope it is aggressive when it needs to be in order to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Section 10 deals with the membership of the commission. It states that members will be eligible for reappointment on a temporary basis by a Minister for an aggregate period of not more than 12 months, where vacancies arise. How many times can a person be reappointed? There are generally fixed terms of five years under the new legislation. Can a person have two or three five year terms? The Minister might spell that out.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> On section 17, if it comes to prosecutions I agree there needs to be co-operation between other regulators such as the Commission for Aviation Regulation, the communications regulator, the energy regulator and the Health Insurance Authority. While I welcome that, when the legislation is going through the Dáil, the Minister might provide examples of how those arrangements will work and any legal and constitutional barriers that exist in other legislation that would prevent those organisations coming to agreement with this new commission. I have seen this arise before. There are regulations in place to deal with a situation where, for example, the Director of Corporate Enforcement wants to investigate a matter in regard to the banks and he might have information that is relevant to the Revenue Commissioners or the Financial Regulator. While, in some cases, the Director of Corporate Enforcement can pass his information back to the Revenue if he deems it relevant, Revenue is slightly more restricted in what it can pass to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Arrangements need to be set up in this regard. My question is whether there will be an equal transfer of information or whether it will be substantially a one-sided transfer of information. We are dealing with several other pieces of legislation, for example, in regard to health insurance, and there may not be the exact same provisions in other legislation allowing for this transfer of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> Section 24 outlines that the commission will report to the Committee of Public Accounts, which, it goes without saying, is a good thing, and everybody supports that. However, I have an issue with section 25, which deals with the accountability of the chairperson to other Oireachtas committees. My concern is that the section states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_297">The chairperson of the Commission shall not be required to give account before a Committee in relation to—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_298">(a) any matter which is or has been or may at a future time be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State...</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I fully agree that the chairman of this new commission, if appearing before the relevant Oireachtas committee, should not be required to give information in regard to a matter that may be in the future or is currently the subject of proceedings before a court or a tribunal. However, I have a problem with the suggestion that he or she may not give evidence in regard to a matter that has been before the courts and is completely disposed of. The public might want to know why the chairperson took a particular line in those court proceedings. There might be a question as to the cost of those court proceedings and whether they might have been done in a more efficient manner. To say that matters that have been disposed of in the courts, which are matters of public record and where the costs can probably be established through the Courts Service if it comes to that, cannot even be discussed by the chairman with the relevant Oireachtas committee is to go a little too far in terms of past matters. This should not be in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> If the commission does not want to be pursued on a line of questioning, it has the right to go to the High Court within 21 days and seek a declaration from that court.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Perhaps that is standard procedure for regulators and bodies like this. I am not sure. I am not a solicitor but I just asked the question and the Minister can give the answer. Is that a normal section of legislation or are we now issuing a new invitation to the High Court to interfere in Oireachtas committee proceedings? Perhaps it is the standard procedure that applies to all such bodies but section 25 invites the commission to go to the High Court within 21 days and states that the High Court shall determine whether or not the person should answer those questions. If the High Court determines that they should not be answered, the committee will not be allowed to follow that. If the High Court determines that they should be answered, the commission must answer those questions. This runs counter to practice relating to a committee where we set up fair procedures. That section is written by officials in the Department and essentially states that the Oireachtas committee must do its job with fair procedures. That section is an indictment of Members of the Oireachtas who are capable of operating lawfully within their own procedures that have been laid down here. </p>
          <p eId="para_302"> The last section I want to deal with is section 31, subsection (3) of which concerns whistleblowers. There is a fundamental contradiction between this legislation and the whistleblowers legislation being introduced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The essential difference is in subsection (3), line 15 where it states that it is essential that an employee making an allegation acts reasonably and in good faith in forming the opinion and in informing the commission. This issue of good faith has been taken out of the whistleblowers legislation because many people have a legitimate gripe and want to complain about something they are sore about. Just because they are sore and may not be lodging their objection in good faith does not mean they do not have a valid objection. The whistleblowers legislation has removed that requirement and states that an objection is valid regardless of why it has been made. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is now compromising valid objections by including that clause which flagrantly contradicts the whistleblowers legislation being introduced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>
          <p eId="para_303"> It is good to discuss this legislation. Unfortunately, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has left more out of it than he has included. We will discuss it further on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_304">Is rudaí uafásach tábhachtacha iad cúrsaí iomaíochta agus cosaint tomhaltóirí. Ba cheart don Rialtas an chumhacht a chur i lámha na ndaoine mar gheall ar na rudaí seo. This legislation provides for the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority into a single body to be known as the competition and consumer protection commission. These two extremely important agencies are to be distilled into one organisation. The Bill also provides for the regulation of certain practices within the grocery sector and amends the laws on media mergers by implementing the recommendations of the report of the advisory group on media mergers. Again, these are two extremely important areas - the grocery sector, which involves so many jobs in all parts of the supply chain, and the media sector, which is one of the pivotal elements of a functioning democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> Section 17 prescribes those organisations that will work with the new body. It does not mention Irish Water. Water charges are probably the biggest consumer issue facing people at this time. Although we in Sinn Féin have raised the matter a number of times with the Minister, he has failed to take our views into consideration. The Government has established a new governance model to manage, fund and deliver services which will be basically carried by the consumer and taxpayer. The new governance structure will include Bord Gáis, Uisce Éireann, the economic regulator and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. However, we are worried that there is a critical omission in the oversight here. Who will represent the interests of the consumer in this so-called water reform process? Can the Minister give us confidence that this legislation will allow consumers to have full recourse to their experience with this new body and structure? Will the provisions and functions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 now fully follow through to the citizens with respect to Irish Water? In other words, will the interests of consumers be protected in this legislation? </p>
          <p eId="para_306"> The National Consumer Agency represents the voice of the consumer. It enforces consumer legislation and defends the interests of consumers at the highest levels of the decision-making process. When we raised the need for stronger consumer oversight with the Minister and in particular with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, it was stated that the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is the independent regulator for Irish Water, has the power to direct Irish Water to prepare a code of practice on any matter that CER considers necessary and appropriate to secure the interests of the customer of Irish Water. CER has the power to direct Irish Water to comply with a code of practice prepared in accordance with the legislation. CER may consult with Irish Water, the public or any other person it considers appropriate. The National Consumer Agency participated in the consultation on the establishment of the water services utility during 2012 and submitted proposals to the Department which will be considered in detail. </p>
          <p eId="para_307"> That is all fine but the fact remains that CER is a regulator. It is not a consumer watchdog with the real teeth necessary to protect the needs of the consumer in this area. It is also worth noting that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government did not pay much attention to other needs of the consumer with regard to Irish Water such as set-up costs and where those moneys were being spent so how are we meant to have massive confidence in the Minister's approach to oversight of Irish Water? While the competition and consumer protection commission will automatically be under the new FOI legislation, the Minister could exclude it in the future by secondary legislation. Again, this reduces this House's opportunity to oversee that process. </p>
          <p eId="para_308"> The resourcing of the competition and consumer protection commission is extremely important. Indeed the Minister has lauded the fact that €170,000 will be saved by this new merger. However, the legislation notes that this organisation will be given extra powers to allow it to investigate a series of competition offences. There is a mismatch there to a certain extent. There is a reduction in money and an increase in functionality. While extra staff were given to the Competition Authority to improve enforcement in 2012, it is simply unacceptable for the Minister not to further resource a beefed-up mechanism which will oversee investigations. It is fine to have these powers on paper but unless the Minister puts in place the necessary resources to enforce them, they will not be effective. The alleged problems in the concrete cartel in this State have allegedly had the effect of increasing prices to the consumer and the State. The State is a massive consumer of concrete. The lack of a properly functioning market and competition in this sector has made it very difficult for those businesses that are compliant to be able to function. Without the necessary funds to enforce compliance, non-compliance becomes a competitive advantage. That is a real danger in any society where a compliant business looks at a non-compliant business and then decides it must become like this business if it wants to function in this market. </p>
          <p eId="para_309"> In any of these reforms, it is important that the Government does not just focus on the bottom line. It is also very important that the Government sets out to achieve regulation and oversight in a manner that improves the full market. Investment in empowerment will bring about greater savings to the State in the long run. </p>

          <p eId="para_315">We learned, for example, that the average cost will be between €250 and €300 and that the free allowance will consist of a seven minute power shower, a three minute tap run to brush one's teeth and two flushes of the toilet and that is basically it. That is the level of detail that was available this morning. There will be an annual standing charge, we were told, applying to all households irrespective of how much water they use. Basically, householders will pay for every drop of water used beyond the most basic morning routine. We have also learned that social welfare protection for low income families and particularly for pensioners has been ruled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> I remember the Tánaiste saying, very eloquently, in 2010 that he was against water charging because water is a necessity, and that he always believed essential services like water should be delivered as a public service. Despite this, for some reason the Government has set up a very expensive and complicated regime in Irish Water, costing €180 million, despite that water will still be produced and delivered by the very same people who have been delivering it for decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach. Were the Labour Party Ministers informed about this level of detail in advance of it being circulated to the media by the Government? Was a memo brought to Government today on the new water tax and was a decision taken? Can the Taoiseach confirm that the free allowance is as revealed in <i>The Irish Times </i>and <i>Irish Independent</i>? We meet many people throughout the country in the course of our duties who say they have no more to give with all the other charges they have had to cope with, particularly pensioners who have been very hard hit by the previous two budgets.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">I thank Deputy Martin for his range of questions. There is a lot on the Government agenda that has to be considered. This morning, at a meeting I called to deal with a number of matters, we approved the publication of the legislation dealing with free general practitioner care for children under six, the publication of the Bill dealing with climate change and carbon emissions, and the changes recommended by the Minister for Education and Science to the Bill previously known as the Teaching Council Bill. We also had our first discussion on a proposal from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the introduction of water charges. This is all about equity, equality, affordability and fair pricing. The situation, as Deputy Martin is only too well aware, is that we have a completely inferior infrastructure for water in many parts of the country. This State has failed to invest properly in that infrastructure over the years and that is why the Irish Water utility was created in order that it can borrow money off the Government's balance sheet to provide the infrastructure for water for consumers and businesses and to maintain our attractiveness as a location for setting up businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> Deputy Martin asked a number of questions. The Ministers' memo sets out a range of issues that are important. The Government, comprising the two parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, is united in supporting the Government's priority that water charges would be fair, affordable and as equitable as possible. We started that discussion this morning. The Government noted the importance, in the context of our recovery plan, of ensuring Irish Water, like Bord Gáis and the ESB, would be classified as a commercial semi-State body, the finances of which are separate from the Government's. In that way, Irish Water can fund much higher levels of investment to fix the inferior infrastructure we have. We also noted the official advice from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that the level of taxpayer subvention for Irish Water, consistent with it being classified as a commercial State company, could not exceed €537 million in 2015 and 2016. That equates to an annual average metered charge of €240. The Government has not signed off on these figures. There has been intensive engagement between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Central Statistics Office in recent weeks in order to understand the statistical rules that apply here in the context of how EUROSTAT conducts its business. Deputy Martin will be aware that the requirement to pass a market corporation test means that income from customers, ex-VAT where applicable, must be greater than 50% of production costs, including both consumption of fixed capital and interest. These are important elements. The CSO, in explaining the rules, has explained the maximum level of subvention that will be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> The Government will continue to discuss the question of how to make this as affordable and fair as possible for different categories of families. There are vulnerable groups here. One includes those who live on their own and who may be very vulnerable, including pensioners. Another is families with children, where there is an obvious requirement for extra water. The question of the scale of metering, the level of assessment and the general issues that apply in respect of all these things must be agreed. Deputy Martin mentioned standing charges, which is a matter in respect of which the Minister will give detailed policy directions to the regulator, who starts the public consultation process tomorrow in respect of the structuring of the tariff. The regulator will move on later to a more detailed analysis dealing with the actual charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> In answer to Deputy Martin, the issues he has raised, including vulnerability, ability to pay and standing charges, are all matters the Government will consider in the next two weeks, taking into account the overall headline figures under the rules as explained by the CSO in order for us to keep in line with the EUROSTAT requirements. If the market corporation test is failed, there would be an additional-----</p>

          <p eId="para_326">If we were to fail the market corporation test, the consequence would be a €700 million capital cost being incurred by Irish Water which would impact on the Government deficit and would have serious implications in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">In explaining the rules, therefore, the CSO has set out what the maximum subvention can be for 2015 and 2016. I want to make it clear that the Government has not signed off on any of these figures. We think it is important to discuss the elements surrounding that, including categories, vulnerability, ability to pay and levels of metering. We hope to conclude that within the next two weeks.</p>

If the Taoiseach had turned on "Morning Ireland" this morning and heard the political correspondent, Ms Martina Fitzgerald, he would have heard that the Government was bringing this memo to Cabinet today and that this was going to be announced today. By the end of "Morning Ireland" the Labour Party was rushing in some news that they had been told nothing about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> The first question I asked the Taoiseach was if the Labour Party Ministers were told in advance about the details of the Minister, Deputy Hogan's, memo before it was circulated to the media. The memo was circulated to the media and it should be published now in deference to this House and the public. The public are being treated with absolute contempt regarding this matter. They are not that concerned about passing some corporate market test that the Taoiseach is going on about.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">When I raised the issue of water charges with the Taoiseach yesterday, he said the Government had not taken a decision, various matters have to be taken into consideration, and there is a need to assess a whole range of issues before any decision can be taken. He then pulled together an unscheduled Cabinet meeting and sent his spin doctors off to the media to give details of a decision that he told the Dáil yesterday he had not taken. This is the latest in a whole series of decisions in which the Government has by-passed the Dáil in favour of governing by press release and media spin. On each occasion, the Taoiseach shows contempt for the Oireachtas, the Opposition and for his own backbenchers, especially Labour Party backbenchers, but most of all for citizens who will be affected by his decisions. The fact that the Taoiseach called a special Cabinet meeting to deal with these issues is down to the way he is playing catch-up. One debacle follows another and it is clear that the Taoiseach is trying to kick for touch on this issue. He is governing by making it up as he goes along.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">I recognise that there are 20 treatment plants around the country that are completely inadequate. I recognise that the infrastructure in so many places is grossly inferior to what it should be, so people have to deal with inferior, infrequent and poor supplies. The only way that can be dealt with is by having an entity that is entitled to borrow money to provide that infrastructure, construction jobs and facilities for business and domestic consumers alike. Some 40% of our water leaks away into the ground. This city has never dealt with this problem. The imposition of any new charge is always difficult for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> When I told Deputy Adams that the Government has not decided on all these measures, that is because the Government is required to discuss and decide the details of how we can make this affordable, equitable and as fair as possible. That is why it is only right that one takes into account whether houses include children, vulnerable individuals or people with particular medical circumstances that require more water usage than most. We must look at the scale of how assessments are to be carried out, taking into account the explanation of the rules by the CSO in the context of whether EUROSTAT means one can only give a maximum subvention level of €537 million for 2015 and 2016. That means that the Government cannot put any more finance into Irish Water without putting it back on the Government books.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">That would mean having to deal with a €700 million requirement later in the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> The Government is deciding on this and the details will be known before the local elections. The average metered charge as currently indicated by the information from the CSO is for €60 per quarter. That is the bill that will come to people in the first days of January 2015. Both parties in Government have every right to discuss the details of all of these issues and will do so in the next two weeks. A final decision on the proposition will be brought forward by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. It is very important for the future of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> When Deputy Martin was shouting from his bench, he did not share with Deputy Adams, who puts up with water charges in the North of Ireland without any problem, the information that he himself intended to introduce a €400 charge last year.</p>

          <p eId="para_368">I appeal to the Taoiseach to, for once, bring proposals to the Oireachtas for discussion and consultation with Members of the Dáil and Seanad. The Government's water charge, borrowed from Fianna Fáil and opposed previously by the Labour Party, is another tax on top of all the other taxes and stealth charges faced by struggling families who have already been hit. The Taoiseach must know that taking this money out of people's pockets means less money going into local economies, which drives down economic activity. As well as being unfair and unjust, the charges make no economic sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> Charges never reduce. It is inevitable that this charge will increase and that this is the first step in an escalating water charge. I pointed out to the Taoiseach yesterday that it makes no sense at all in terms of water conservation. It is clear that the real intent is to privatise water services in the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">Sinn Féin did not put a stop to that. They welcomed it with open arms. The taxpayer here pays €1.2 billion for water systems through 34 different local authorities. The system is not consistent or up to standard and it will never be up to standard until sufficient money is available to invest in infrastructure. The Government is unable through the Minister for Finance and the taxation system to meet the requirement here. We have been spending an average of €300 million per year when it should be €600 million or more to meet the requirements nationally for water and waste water treatment plants and the relevant infrastructure. I can point to areas in the far west where local schemes upgraded their systems, installed meters and constructed proper water treatments plants and saved 500 million litres of water in the first year. If the Deputy talks to those people they will show him the advantage of this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> While it is difficult where people have a new imposition placed on them, this is necessary to provide for the future. Both parties in Government are united in the view that we need a fair, affordable system. That is why the Government is considering the categories of vulnerable people, including those who live on their own, those with children and those who have medical requirements for exceptional water use on a daily basis. The rate of installation of meters is running at an average of 27,000 per month. To date, 185,000 meters have been installed and 400,000 are to be installed by the end of the year. We must discuss the way in which assessments will be carried out where houses are not metered as against where they are. There are answers to all of these questions. Over the next two weeks, the Government will continue to discuss the issues presented by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, taking into account the figures presented in the explanation of the rules by the CSO.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> The Government will make its decision in good time. We have not signed off on the Minister's proposition for the very good reason that we want to get this as right as possible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_381">It looks like Irish households will pay €250 a year to begin with. Factoring in the kinds of exemption the Taoiseach has referred to, approximately €300 million will be raised. Ireland's water infrastructure costs approximately €1.2 billion to run. We know there are a great many inefficiencies in the way it is run currently. There are 33 separate entities involved and layers of management and administration that those working in the service say are not needed. There are plenty of outdated monitoring and control systems. How much money could be saved by doing this properly?</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> It was estimated that in Northern Ireland, approximately 40% of the cost base could have been saved by updating the water service. Scottish Water achieved almost exactly 40% savings in the first five years after upgrading its system. Let us be conservative and say that Ireland can only achieve 25%. It would mean a saving of approximately €300 million, which is almost exactly the same amount that will be raised from water charges. Instead, we learned in January that Ireland is applying a different approach and that service level agreements are being put in place for the next 12 years. The entire cost base is being locked in. Unlike Scottish Water's saving of 40%, there will be no cost savings in Ireland over the next five to six years. We were told by the Cabinet that saving money early on could only ever be achieved in a mythical country. To the best of my knowledge, Scotland exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> The Government's approach means the new water charge will not pay for water or to upgrade infrastructure. The only thing it will pay for is political expediency. The €250 bill will not be for water, it will be a bill for unnecessary cost. It is a bill that effectively says, "We refuse to improve the operational effectiveness of the system so we are going to charge you instead". It effectively says, "We have decided not to implement the kind of reform that we promised the people before the election". The Government will not be charging Irish households for their water, it will charge them to maintain hundreds of millions of euro in unnecessary costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> Does the Taoiseach accept that savings in such an inefficient system can be found in the first five years? Will he instruct Irish Water to find these savings on behalf of the people and agree to reduce the water charges to households by whatever amount of savings can be found?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_231">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_385">If there was no subvention as proposed by the Government, the average domestic charge would be €580. Service level agreements, etc., are matters for further discussion. I do not accept that there should be 12 year service level agreements and I have said as much in the House before. The Deputy should also take into account the prospective 25% reduction in staff over the next five years. It is possible to achieve significant savings. Clearly, the system which has evolved over the years is no longer fit for purpose and is costing the taxpayer €1.2 billion across 34 local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> I point out to the Deputy that the EPA reports that remedial action is now required on 16% of supplies. Many of the at-risk schemes are very large and include schemes in Dublin and Cork which are the subject of official EPA reports. Deputy Donnelly is well aware of the significant supply constraint in a city as large and as rapidly growing as Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">It is absolutely unacceptable that 40% of water is unaccounted for, or is leaking away into the ground. Some 36% of water treatment plants did not meet EPA effluent standards in 2011. The European Commission has launched a pilot infringement case against Ireland in respect of 80 treatment plants. The State would not be in a position to deal with these infrastructural requirements without the advent of Irish Water, which is able to borrow to fund these things. The Government has decided to implement the "user pays" principle. We want to adopt that principle to make the system as flexible, affordable and equitable as possible. When the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government brings his proposition to the Cabinet, the Government will be perfectly entitled to consider it. It has a duty to talk about all of these issues. It has a responsibility to adhere to the principle of fairness and affordability in what is done here.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> As I have said, the metering programme is continuing with an average of between 27,000 and 30,000 meters being installed every month. All of these issues will be discussed and decided on by the Government in the next short time. The CSO has explained the rules in the EUROSTAT context. The maximum subvention in 2015-16 is €535 million, giving an average metered charge of €240 per household to be divided through the quarters as a utility measure. The Government's focus will be on the details of how this can be made as affordable and as fair as possible, in the knowledge that this is the last of the major decisions it has to impose on people. I recognise that this is always difficult. We have to deal with it in the context of how far behind this country is in terms of water quality and the water supply infrastructure. We will try to deal with it now in as fair and as affordable a way as we can.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">I agree with everything the Taoiseach has just said. It makes perfect sense. The problem is that it does not reflect what is happening. The Taoiseach has said he does not agree with the service level agreements, but they are in place for 12 years. To date, we cannot get a business plan from Irish Water. When we rang them this morning to ask if we could see a business plan, they told us that there is no business plan. There is an environmental assessment, a capital expenditure programme and some other report, but there is no business plan that we can see. We have to rely on what we hear from the Cabinet. In January, we heard clearly from the Cabinet that there would be no cost savings whatsoever for the first five or six years. I welcome the Taoiseach's position, but I respectfully suggest that it does not reflect what is happening on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> When I asked the Minister, Deputy Noonan, last week why the Government is abandoning thousands of Irish families that have mortgages with Irish Nationwide, he said, not unreasonably, that "nobody stands up for the taxpayer anymore". I will put aside the fact that the Irish Nationwide proposal would have benefited the taxpayer. I will ignore the fact that the taxpayer funded the payment of tens of billions of euro to bondholders. Instead, I will apply the Minister for Finance's very reasonable principle to Irish Water. In the case of Irish Water, every euro that this Government refuses to get from operational efficiencies is a euro that an Irish family will have to pay. I am very happy to take the Taoiseach at his word. My understanding of what he has said is that he believes there are savings that can be found in the first few years. Will he publish for Dáil Éireann the business plan? Will he show us what the cost base is and what the projected savings are? Will he commit that these savings can be passed on to Irish households in a reduction in the annual water charge?</p>

He told us nothing about what was to take place at the Cabinet table this morning. He did not mention what the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government had in the locker and intended to reveal. I ask the Government to provide time for a debate today. If it is not prepared to publish the memo that has essentially been circulated, at least we should be furnished with a copy of it. Everybody in the media world seems to have a copy of it. If the Dáil is to have any relevance to topical issues that are of huge concern to the public, the Taoiseach should facilitate a genuine debate and provide for the circulation to the Members of this House, who are meant to represent the people, of the material that has been made available to the media.</p>

Does the Taoiseach accept that the opposite is happening, with young GPs emigrating in alarming numbers, incomes dropping dramatically and GP morale at an all-time low? The legislation the Government promised in the programme for Government to deal with all aspects of primary care provision has not yet been delivered and many promises have been broken in this regard. When can we expect the universal primary care Bill and when will we see additional GPs, as promised in the programme for Government? Can we take it that the commitment to provide free GP care for those with long-term illnesses will not be met? Is there any prospect of discretionary medical cards being restored to the most ill and most vulnerable, including children with multiple disabilities, when the proposals for free GP care for children aged under six are introduced?</p>

It was the 2009 Ryan report which recommended the thrust of the proposals we now have. Considerable concern has been expressed by front-line providers in regard to the needs and care of children in so far as enforceability is concerned. When will the Children First Bill 2014 be brought before the House and is there a specific timeframe for its enactment?</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> The proposal for a health (general practitioner) medical service Bill to provide for a free GP service to children aged under six is one we supported on the basis that it would be rolled out universally within a very short timeframe. The concerns of GPs in regard to this legislation represent a considerable crisis. Members of all parties in the House attended an engagement with more than 400 GPs last Wednesday in Dublin to discuss the issue. Taking on board their concerns and the absence of negotiation with the IMO and other GP representative bodies, when will that Bill present before the House?</p>

          <p eId="para_437">Some weeks ago, an undemocratic and farcical decision was taken by a group of Fingal councillors, a number of whom will either not stand again or will be defeated in the forthcoming elections, in regard to the Dublin mayoralty. The overwhelming majority of the 127 Dublin councillors, from the Ceann Comhairle's area in Dún Laoghaire, from south Dublin, Dublin city and Fingal, voted that people at least be allowed to make a decision on whether or not Dublin should, in common with all other great cities, have a directly elected mayor.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">In view of what happened in Fingal and in light of the fact that many people believe that the legislation brought forward by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, was deliberately designed to end in failure, will the Taoiseach give all Dubs a chance to make a decision as to whether they want a directly-elected mayor? In a few days' time, people all over the city, from the Ceann Comhairle's constituency to my own, will be supporting the great Dublin football team in the national league final. There is a need for a democratic decision in respect of this matter. We should have a directly-elected mayor with strong powers and considerable autonomy because that is how it works in most great capital cities. Will the Taoiseach give the Dubs a chance to vote on having a directly-elected mayor by introducing new legislation the week after next?</p>

Councillors in Fingal were democratically elected to represent the people who live there.

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_317">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_486">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_487">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Ombudsman Act 1980 (as amended) to make provision for the inclusion of Irish Water in the schedule of agencies reviewable by the Ombudsman and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2014, the purpose of which is to amend the existing legislation relating to the Ombudsman in order to include a number of agencies on the list of bodies reviewable by the Ombudsman. Those bodies are Irish Water, Bord Gáis Éireann, EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> People in this House and outside of it accept that the role of the Ombudsman is to investigate complaints from members of the public who believe they have been unfairly treated by certain public bodies. The Ombudsman is impartial and highly respected. Up to now, all issues relating to water services have been capable of review by the Ombudsman. All local authorities come under the remit of the Ombudsman and any queries in respect of water supplies, services and fees or anything of that nature, particularly as they relate to commercial customers, could, until now, be dealt with by the Ombudsman in circumstances where a member of the public made a complaint because he or she was of the view that he or she had not been treated fairly. A problem now arises, however, in that the legislation under which Irish Water was established removes the right of members of the public to make complaints to the Ombudsman in respect of that company. To date, complaints regarding water services and supplies delivered by local authorities could be made to the Ombudsman if a person felt that he or she was unfairly treated by the relevant authority. That option was removed when Irish Water was established.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> The establishment of Irish Water has led to a reduction in existing citizens' and consumers' rights. It is ironic that today the House is debating - I have already made my contribution - the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill, particularly as the new super-quango that is Irish Water can completely ignore consumer rights and that such consumers will have no right of appeal to the Ombudsman. State monopolies should come under the remit of the Ombudsman. The Government refused to bring Irish Water under the terms of the freedom of information legislation on several occasions. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, refused to do so time and again in recent months. However, the Government was eventually forced to complete a U-turn and include the company under the legislation. I ask that it now agree to bring Irish Water and the other bodies to which I refer under the remit of the Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I take this opportunity to remind Members of a reply to a parliamentary question I received from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, on 4 March 2014. That reply states, "The Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce water charges based on usage above a free allowance." Now it has emerged that a minimum fee of €100 or thereabouts - the actual amount has yet to be confirmed - will be imposed. As is the case with electricity supplies and telephony services, VAT may apply in respect of this fee. I expect, therefore, that whatever is the final figure decided upon by the Government, the Revenue Commissioners will add VAT to it. This issue must be dealt with. There is no such thing as a free allowances in circumstances where one is obliged to pay €100.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> There are now two regulators for Irish Water. The Commission for Energy Regulation is responsible for the economic regulation of the company, while the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, will be responsible for regulating it in the context of environmental issues. As stated, there will be two regulators but no one has been charged to cater for the needs of the customer. A code of practice is to be approved but this will not be statutorily based and it will be developed and implemented at the whim of Irish Water and the Commission for Energy Regulation. I have included Bord Gáis in the legislation before the House because it is the parent company of Irish Water.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The Commission for Energy Regulation should be included as well because it is the regulatory body for Irish Water and I also wish to include EirGrid under the legislation. EirGrid has no concept of how to treat customers or the general public and it should be brought under the remit of the Ombudsman. All fair and reasonable people would accept that. Projects such as Grid Link, Grid West, the North-South interconnector and the Ratheniska substation are causing major problems. Never before has there been 35,000 submissions from the public made to a State body because of how it was implementing projects such as Grid Link. I praise those among the public for the time and effort they took to make submissions, but it proves one point, that the public are not happy with how EirGrid is going about the project. That is why there were 35,000 submissions. It proves more than anything else that people believe they are not being treated fairly by EirGrid. That is the reason EirGrid should now come under the remit of the Ombudsman. It is the role of the Ombudsman to investigate public bodies and EirGrid should be included. I call for support for this legislation to extend the remit of the Ombudsman to Irish Water, Bord Gáis Éireann, EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_499">Go gceadófar go dtabharfar isteach Bille dá ngairtear Acht chun an Bunreacht a leasú.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_501">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I seek leave to introduce the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Inclusive Budget Reform) Bill 2014. This is a relatively short Bill but it could potentially have a significant impact on how the Dáil operates, how we discuss and debate the issues around budgets and how we deal with our budgets and other financial matters. I am bringing forward the legislation in the context of the Constitutional Convention and the national debate on political reform, North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> One source of great frustration to me as an Opposition finance spokesperson and, I imagine, to many other Opposition spokespersons is the bar on our bringing forward legislation or amendments to existing legislation that causes a charge to be inflicted on the State. I have never understood this ruling fully and I have never been able to get my head around what constitutes the bar placed on us by the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> Each year, when we are dealing with the Finance Bill, we put forward amendments either to repeal a certain charge that the Government is proposing or to introduce our own charge which the Government may not have identified at that point. Alternatively, there may be no charge as we commonly know the phrase. The amendment may not necessarily relate to a taxation measure but a saving which the State could make. However, when we place these amendments what usually happens is that on the day of committee we get a ruling from the Chair, or, if it is taken in the Dáil, from the Ceann Comhairle's office, to the effect that the amendments must be ruled out of order because of the constitutional provision. If we are to have a proper, robust and mature debate on issues in respect of finances and the economy then we must remove the restriction in the Constitution that prevents Opposition Deputies bringing forward measures which would impose a charge on the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> In recent months I have produced several tranches of legislation that could not even be presented in the House because of this constitutional bar. For example, I drafted legislation which would make stateless multinational companies tax-resident in Ireland by default if they had no other tax residency anywhere on the planet. As a result of the constitutional provision the Bill could not be tabled in the House under an entirely appropriate ruling from the Ceann Comhairle. Then, some months later, the Government brought forward in the Finance Bill exactly what I had in my legislation. It was exactly the same thing. This makes a mockery of the process. As Opposition Deputies we are challenged at all times - in Sinn Féin we try to rise to the challenge - to bring forward solutions that are practical, costed and workable. We do so and we go to the bother of putting our ideas in the form of legislation. We go to the staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas and they have the legislation checked for its appropriateness and the way it is drafted, but we cannot even put it on the agenda or the floor of the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> Another rather detailed tranche of legislation which I have drafted relates to a wealth tax and the way a wealth tax could be applied, including who it would apply to, who would be exempt, how it would be calculated, what the rate would be, the powers in respect of calculation and appeal and what happens to the family home in given circumstances. All of these issues are dealt with in legislation I drafted on the wealth tax. Again, it cannot be introduced to the House because of the constitutional bar.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Another example that springs to mind is the travel tax introduced by the previous Government. During the previous term I recall putting forward an amendment to abolish the travel tax. It was ruled out of order. I was told that as an Opposition spokesperson I could not abolish the travel tax because it would incur a charge on the State and that this was prohibited under the Constitution. Yet, I could reduce the charge to 1 cent. I say this because sometimes it is no more than a joke and a mockery given the somersaults that Opposition Deputies must go through to try to find a way to amend legislation or bring forward proposals to try to circumvent the restrictions placed on us by the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> This legislation is simple. If we are genuine about political reform there is no reason anyone in the House should be prevented from bringing forward legislation to be debated in the House. The Government has talked a good deal about political reform. It must match its words with actions. I hope that not only will the Government allow this to pass but that we actually see it actioned. This is something the Constitutional Convention has called for as well. Let us do this to allow for a proper, robust, mature and appropriate debate in respect of issues that affect all our citizens throughout the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_514">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for giving me the chance to raise this issue. Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, has been working well in this, its second year. There have not been too many problems. However, nationality and immigration status pose an anomaly in terms of selecting people for grants. The case I am highlighting arose in 2012 and involves a child who is not an Irish citizen, but one of whose parents is, and who cannot get a grant. Were the child dependent on a parent whose civil partner was an Irish citizen, the child could get a grant. In fairness, when we highlighted this anomaly to the Minister, we were told that it would be reviewed, which it was.</p>
            <p eId="para_515">It was put on the Citizens Information Board website and on the <i>studentfinance.ie</i> website page. It stated that students must have permission to remain because they are the dependent child of a naturalised Irish citizen. It was taken down from the website but the child was still unable to get the SUSI grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_516"> I hope the Minister will examine this. We have been trying to deal with this matter over the past two years. We hope all dependent children of Irish citizens would be allowed to get the SUSI grant as we are trying to encourage as many people as possible to avail of third level education. These people have become Irish citizens, but the result is that their dependent children cannot get a SUSI grant. Perhaps the Minister will consider that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_517">Deputy Lawlor has mentioned a historical case. There is a specific anomaly here. The Minister for Education and Skills will have details about a specific case, where the mother has recently been naturalised and is an Irish citizen but the circumstances of her dependent daughter have changed suddenly as a result. Prior to her naturalisation, her daughter, as a dependant, was entitled to a SUSI grant, but as a consequence of the mother being naturalised in the second year of the daughter's bachelor of commerce degree in Galway, the daughter is not entitled to the grant. There is a distinct anomaly in that situation. It will probably require legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> The personnel in SUSI with whom I have been dealing on this case and a range of other cases have given us the space and time to deliberate on how we can move this matter forward or work around it. I reiterate what Deputy Lawlor has said. In the second year of the operation of SUSI it must be said that the staff in SUSI have been more than courteous and very professional. It is important to record our appreciation for their work and endeavours. They were subject to sharp criticism in the first year, much of it unwarranted. Obviously there were delays because it was the first time a centralised model took over from the vocational education committees, VECs, and the local authorities. There were teething problems, but the invaluable work so many personnel in SUSI are doing must be acknowledged and put on the record.</p>
            <p eId="para_519"> This matter is outside the Minister of State's remit but I am aware of his long-term interest in the education system and his championing in the past of equal rights and equal treatment for all citizens. There is a distinct anomaly in this case. A dependant who is over 18 years of age and who was entitled to a grant in the first year of a bachelor of commerce degree is not entitled to the grant in the second year as a consequence of her mother being naturalised. That is wrong and must be addressed. Whatever legislation is required must be introduced.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brian Hayes)<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_520">I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. I also thank them for their kind remarks concerning the staff who operate SUSI. I apologise that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, is unable to reply on this issue in the House today.</p>
            <p eId="para_521"> Under the terms of the student grant scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. The nationality requirements for the student grant scheme are set out in section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2012. The nationality rules require that the student be an Irish, EU, EEA or Swiss national. There are a number of exceptions to this requirement. A person who holds refugee status or the rights and privileges as specified in section 3 of the Refugee Act 1996 or holds subsidiary protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 meets the nationality requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_522"> In addition, a person who holds a prescribed immigration status as provided for in the Student Support Regulations 2013 may also meet the nationality requirement. These include permission to remain as the family member of an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen under the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006 and 2008, under the EU directive on EU treaty rights provisions, and on the basis of marriage to or civil partnership with an Irish national resident in the State or as the dependent child of such person. A person who has humanitarian leave to remain granted before the Immigration Act 1999 came into effect or permission to remain in Ireland following a decision not to deport a person under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 also meets the nationality requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> In all cases, to qualify for a student grant, it is the grant applicant and not his or her parents who must meet the nationality or prescribed immigration status requirements in his or her own right. In some instances, for example, where the student entered the country as a minor, their leave to remain is linked to that of their parents. Where it is established that a student meets the nationality requirement based on such leave to remain, a grant may be awarded. Where the parents are subsequently naturalised during the student's course, the student would continue to meet the nationality or prescribed immigration status requirements as their status is linked back to the parent's permission to remain in the State prior to naturalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> If there are particular cases the Deputies wish to raise, perhaps they would forward them to the Minister for Education and Skills, who can examine them and raise them with SUSI.</p>

            <p eId="para_525">The Minister of State's response is still not clear with regard to the cases we have raised. What the Minister of State says does not appear to be operated by SUSI. There are still students who should be entitled to grants on the basis of what the Minister of State said, but they are not getting them. That category should be made quite clear on the student grants scheme website. It should be clarified with regard to the nationality and immigration status of students that they would be entitled to a grant based on what the Minister of State has told us this afternoon.</p>

            <p eId="para_526">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I will forward the information directly to the Minister. In the short time available to me, I wish to put another matter on the record. There is no need for a response from the Minister of State as I am putting it on the record for the consideration of the people in the Department of Education and Skills. It relates to the issue of smaller schools. The initial thinking about smaller schools was that eventually a school would become a one teacher school and, as a result of parents voting with their feet and taking the students from that school, the school would close. However, that is not the case. Parents of children in one teacher schools, and I have in mind one such school in my constituency, wish to keep their children in these schools. The teacher is under pressure so we must examine the resources available to such teachers and other resources for protection, safety, regulation and a proper educational environment. I raise this for the attention of the people in the Department of Education and Skills. They should re-think the capacity and resources being provided for the teacher in one teacher schools. Parents are voting with their feet. They wish to keep their children in one teacher schools and we must support them.</p>

            <p eId="para_528">That this issue has arisen is probably an unintended consequence of the fact that more people are being naturalised. Thanks to the efforts of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, many more people are being naturalised as Irish citizens. He has broken the bottlenecks that existed in the system and, as a consequence, the issue the Deputies have raised might well have been extenuated in some cases. That many more people have become Irish citizens is a good thing.</p>
            <p eId="para_529"> My understanding is that where a young person goes into the system and in the course of their studies their parent becomes naturalised, they apply either for naturalisation themselves or for leave to remain, which is the normal immigration standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> According to my notes, where a student's leave to remain in the State is determined by reference to the conditions attached to their parents' initial permission to reside, that condition applies for the student even after his or her parents are naturalised and until such a time as a student naturalises himself or herself. The notes go on to state that students who qualified for a grant at the commencement of their studies, as they satisfied one of the conditions as set out in the student support regulations, would qualify for a grant following their parents' naturalisation. As one or both of their parents has become an Irish citizen, they then apply in their own right because they are over the age, and according to my information, whatever they had should remain.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> The Deputies have put on the record information that this is not the case, so I think it is a case of SUSI officials, the Minister and his colleagues in the Department getting together and seeing whether there are some unintended consequences that were not picked up in the original regulations, because this should not be happening and I fully agree with the Deputies that this is fundamentally unfair. The Minister for Education and Skills, being a good and honest man, will take this issue very seriously and see whether a solution can be found on a small number of cases that may have come to the Deputies' attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_532">I thank the Leas-Cheann Chomhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this urgent issue, namely, the funding crisis at the Darndale-Belcamp integrated child care service in Darndale, Dublin 17. Last week I had the honour of being brought around this excellent service by Barbara Quinlan, who is a board member, and by Kelda Barnes, who is the centre's manager. I was immediately impressed by their top class service, their quality care, their professionalism and their commitment to 260 children from the local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> It is important that the Minister hears this and that the Dáil knows about the valuable work taking place at the Darndale-Belcamp integrated child care service. This service was opened in January 2001, and initially the plan was for a maximum of 150 children aged from birth to 12 years of age, with playrooms, a kitchen, a dining area and sleeping rooms. Over the years, the centre has evolved into becoming the largest crèche in the country, and it now caters daily for 260 children, 90% of whom are from the immediate area of Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview. This is a recognised area of disadvantage and also includes a large Traveller community. One sixth of the children attending are Travellers and the centre employs one core staff member and eight community employment participants from the Traveller community. This is an area of severe deprivation. Addiction, unemployment, crime and, most recently, gun crime are part of their children's everyday lives. In 2011, 11 of the centre's children lost a parent to drugs or suicide. In 2012, a child in the centre's toddler room was held in his father's arms while his father was shot, and in 2013 the centre referred children to a social work team due to concerns about domestic violence and possible neglect or abuse. Forty of the children have direct links to the HSE social network, the public health nurse, the speech therapist, the CRC, St. Michael's House or to Temple Street hospital. Currently, 25 of the centre's children attend its project work for issues, including speech and language delay, attachment, domestic violence, learning disabilities and behaviour. This shows the valuable work that is going on in the centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_534"> The centre now has almost 100 staff members, with 45 core staff and the remainder being made of community employment, Tús participants, JobsPlus staff members, relief staff and volunteers. The centre no longer uses the HSE pay scale for the 45 core staff, as it is unable to afford the benchmarking payments and has introduced a 3% pay cut. The starting salary for core child care staff is €24,263, so there is no big deal in that. The centre has worked hard to improve the quality of the early years service it provides. It has achieved the Síolta award in 2013 and it is now participating in Aistear along with eight other centres in the area. This centre strives for quality and is a vital community support for the children and families. It feeds into the wonderful work done by the Preparing for Life team and the local DEIS schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_535"> The bottom line is that the centre needs €100,000 because it has run out of cash reserves, but it also needs an additional €200,000 per annum to stay open. I am talking about 260 children and €100,000 to keep this centre open. I urge the Minister of State to listen carefully to my submission and support this excellent centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_536">I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this very important issue. I am aware of the integrated child care service at Darndale-Belcamp, and as he rightly informed the House, it is a terrific centre and the work it does in that community is much regarded, not just locally but also as a pilot for communities in other parts of the city and country. I apologise that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is unable to take this matter in the House today, but she asked me to convey the following information to the Deputy McGrath.</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has a significant investment, totalling more than €260 million, to support the child-care programmes. This means that close to 68,000 children benefit annually from child care places as a consequence of the expenditure of that money. Despite the challenging budgetary situation, the Minister has succeeded in maintaining the preschool year as a universal and free programme, ensuring a significant number of children can avail of quality preschool services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> The Darndale-Belcamp integrated child care service was established in January 2001. Since that time the centre has evolved into the largest crèche in the country, catering for some 260 children daily. Of these, 90% are from the immediate areas of Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview. These areas are recognised as areas of severe disadvantage and include a large number from the Traveller community. Almost one sixth of the children attending are from the Traveller community, and one core staff member and eight community employment participants currently working in the centre are from the Traveller community. This is a welcome contribution that the community is making towards the success of the crèche.</p>
            <p eId="para_539"> The centre has a total of almost 100 staff with 45 core staff, and the remaining staff comprises community employment and Tús participants, JobsPlus staff members, relief staff and volunteers. The centre's income in 2013 was €1.959 million and its expenditure in 2013 was €2.022 million. The deficit for the 2013 was €62,508. The main income for the year was derived from a number of sources and the centre has annual service level agreements with its three main funding agencies, namely, the Child and Family Agency, FÁS and Pobal. Funding for this centre has been maintained, which is provided by the Department under the early childhood care and education free preschool year programme, or ECCE, and the community childcare subvention programme, or CCS, which supports low income and disadvantaged families with child care costs. To date in this school year, funding totalling €35,500 has been paid under the ECCE programme. Funding of €98,600 has also been approved under the CCS programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to ensure the situation is dealt with. We understand there is a difficulty in the balance that is required. Agency funding to the centre will be reviewed to identify efficiencies, and the impact in services resulting from a 2.8% reduction in agency funding last year and this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_541">The payment is being facilitated in order for a more comprehensive and detailed analysis to be completed so as to arrive at a long-term funding solution involving all the stakeholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_542">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I hope I am pushing an open door considering his statement that he hopes every effort will be made to ensure the matter is dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_543"> The project is excellent, which the Minister of State accepts. Having been involved in education, I take his point. If the project is closed, vulnerable children will be put at risk immediately. The issue of underachievement must be borne in mind. In some cases, many of the children in question are taken into care. It is important, therefore, that the project be kept open. A key strength of the project is that 60% of the staff are from the immediate locality. If it were an IDA project, we would all be jumping up and down over this.</p>
            <p eId="para_544"> Let me return to the issue that the Minister of State mentioned, namely, the identification of efficiencies. I have talked to Barbara Quinlan and Kelda Barnes, the manager. By God, they are well able to run the organisation efficiently and professionally.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> Historically, the HSE has paid for a manager, deputy manager, part-time cook, part-time cleaner and seven full-time child care staff members, and it has funded 90% of the operating costs associated with the 40 FTE children. However, since 2008 the funding has decreased annually, from €453,744 to €353,784. This no longer fully supports the named staff salaries and no funding is available to meet operational costs as a consequence. I have submitted the figures to the Minister already. It is important that the service be retained.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, really to focus on this project, think of the 260 children and the 100 local jobs that are making a valuable contribution to the broader society. The Minister of State should do his best to ensure the centre gets the funding necessary to keep it open.</p>

            <p eId="para_547">The Minister with responsibility in this area, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is well aware of the issues the Deputy has raised. As I stated in my previous presentation, the gap last year between expenditure and income was approximately €62,000. That has to be plugged. The lead agency in bringing together other agencies is the Child and Family Agency. FÁS, Pobal and the HSE will all be brought around the table to determine whether we can identify how the deficit can be plugged in circumstances where there have been reductions across the board, as I fully accept. It is crucial that the service remain for the children and, as the Deputy rightly said, the excellent staff who provide such a wonderful service to them. The Minister is fully briefed on this matter and that is why she has asked the Child and Family Agency to bring all the funders together to determine whether we can work this problem out. The sum of money in question is not huge and I very much expect and hope that the problem will be resolved sooner rather than later.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_548">I appreciate the opportunity to raise this issue to ensure sufficient financial resources will be in place so people on community employment schemes in County Laois who are currently working in child care can undertake training to improve their qualifications so as to continue working in this area. Recently I was contacted by a child care facility in County Laois, Jelly Tots in Abbeyleix. It is a crèche and play-school and it has been an outstanding facility for a number of years. It is a community child care facility, not a privately run facility. Those who have been working there for a number of years have been community employment scheme participants. In total, approximately nine people were involved working in Jelly Tots as part of the community employment scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> Recently, all child care-related community employment in County Laois has been centralised under Laois Partnership. That is fine and it happened on 3 March. I have no issue with the centralisation and with having the various community employment schemes all under the one central scheme in County Laois. This works well and there are approximately 30 people involved. I am sure the centralised scheme is very good and has a clear focus. It is not the case that the supervisor is dealing with tidy towns and then with community child care facilities, as can happen. The facility in question is dedicated to child care. It is a good idea to have a clear focus. The scheme is well run.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> The difficulty is that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, introduced new legislation to ensure everybody working in child care must have a FETAC qualification at level 5 to work in child care in 2015. This is the nub of the issue. The staff in question have been working in child care but now are required to have a qualification at FETAC level 5. This, too, is welcome. I appreciate it and it is a good, positive step because we want to ensure the best people are looking after our children. This ties in with the children's referendum we held some time ago with a view to putting greater emphasis on children. It is important that people working in child care have all the knowledge and training required. However, it has now arisen in County Laois that those staff currently working in this area who do not have the FETAC level 5 qualification must be trained to that level. Some in Laois already have that qualification. While Pobal has a learner fund, it excludes community employment participants because Pobal is publicly funded and there is a training budget in the community employment scheme. If the latter were used along with the funding of Pobal, this would be regarded as double funding. Therefore, the staff are not eligible to avail themselves of the Pobal learner fund, which presents a particular difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_551"> The community employment scheme authorities, which have very limited training funds, want to use that funding to train the staff with level 4 qualifications up to level 5. In the Abbeyleix scheme, perhaps four of the nine staff need the additional FETAC training. I am not sure of the figures pertaining to the scheme right across the county under Laois Partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_552"> Early Childhood Ireland has no course in Laois. The point is that while it is running the courses around the country, it did not run one in County Laois. I asked locals whether they had tried to get onto a scheme in a neighbouring county and they stated they tried Thurles and Kildare only to find there were no spaces available. We have good trainers in County Laois to carry out the training required. I understand, although I have not had it verified, that the Laois County Childcare Committee has applied to be a trainer to provide the facility but I believe no definite word has been given on this. It could serve as one possibility of allowing the training to happen in County Laois.</p>

            <p eId="para_553">I apologise on behalf of the Minister, who is unable to respond to this matter today. She has asked me to thank Deputy Fleming for raising it. She will examine it closely again on foot of the Deputy's remarks.</p>
            <p eId="para_554"> In response to the Deputy's question, the Department of Social Protection is consolidating and improving the provision of training and work experience for community employment, CE, participants, particularly those who wish to pursue a career in child care. For CE participants who work directly with children, a dedicated programme comprising formal learning and supervised work experience is now a mandatory part of participation, as the Deputy stated. This formal learning programme will lead to a FETAC level 5 major award in early childhood care and education. This is the minimum entry requirement for a child care practitioner. The programme will last two years, during which a major award will be earned. One year of work practice will lead to the programme lasting for a maximum of three years overall. This programme involves defined standards of achievement, a career progression path and a structure for CE participants in early years services. These changes are designed to provide a more tailored and valuable support to the provision of community child care and to achieve greater coherence between participation on CE schemes and the jobs market.</p>
            <p eId="para_555"> The new CE child care scheme started in Laois on 3 March 2014 under the CE sponsorship of Laois Community and Enterprise Development Company Limited. The child care CE scheme has been allocated 50 CE places. Thirty-three CE places are allocated for the direct provision of child care and 17 places are allocated for child care support.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">An additional training budget to facilitate the completion of the full major award at level 5 in child care will be made available. The child care CE scheme has also been allocated an additional CE supervisor to mentor and support the child care workers through the major award. The interviews for the new child care supervisor will take place before the end of April.</p>
            <p eId="para_557"> It seems, from the information I have, that an additional training budget to facilitate the completion of the full major award at level 5 will be made available. I hope that resolves the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_560">This is good news for the people in County Laois who are involved under the Laois Community and Enterprise Development Company Limited, to give it its full formal title, although I use the local title I am used to dealing with. I had said there are approximately 30 places on the scheme, and I am pleased the Minister of State has confirmed there will now be 50 CE places. That is quite an undertaking and makes it quite a large scheme. It is good that it should be centralised in the county and I want to acknowledge everything the Minister of State has said so far, which tallies exactly with the information I have been given. There are 33 places for the direct provision of child care and 17 places are allocated for child care support. The most important sentence from the Minister of State, which I will repeat, is: "An additional training budget to facilitate the completion of the full major award at level 5 in child care will be made available." That is good news. If the news was not good, I was going to ask whether there were any other mechanisms in the Department through some other schemes that could in some way be dovetailed to work with it, but in view of that good response, I am happy that this is no longer necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_561"> It was unfortunate that one or two people had commenced this when the funding ran out. So long as the funding and the training programme are in place and people are able to get their qualifications, I do not have a fixation as to whether this training is delivered through the Laois Community and Enterprise Development Company, through the Laois County Childcare Committee or through the organisation Early Childhood Ireland, as it is not my affair to interfere with that, no more than it is the Minister of State's. The essence of all of this is to make sure we have suitably qualified people in the area of child care from 2015. I appreciate the good news that funding will be made available to complete this training.</p>

            <p eId="para_562">I thank the Deputy. It is clear there is a responsibility on the Department to provide training. If we are asking people to move from level 4 to level 5, there is some obligation on funders to provide support to people as they go about that journey. I can confirm that an additional training budget to facilitate the completion to level 5 in child care will be made available. It is crucially important also that a new CE supervisor to mentor and support the child care workers through this award will be in place before the end of April. These are two important pieces of news the Deputy can take back to his constituents.</p>

            <p eId="para_563">At the outset, I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for debate. January and February 2014 will be remembered for severe storm damage and flooding right across the country. Thankfully, the storms have gone and the weather has settled down, but in one townland on the outskirts of the village of Newmarket-on-Fergus, at Ballycar, flood waters remain extremely high. These floods are a recurring problem which are having a detrimental effect on residents, on farmland and on the rail line between Limerick and Ennis, which is part of the western rail corridor. Five households are inaccessible, hundreds of acres of farmland remain under water and the rail service has been closed since 2 February and is not expected to re-open until the end of May. The extremely wet winter has dramatically increased the water levels of Ballycar Lough, resulting in meters of water covering the rail line and flooding farmland and the public road.</p>
            <p eId="para_564"> A solution to this problem needs to be found. In my view, no agency wants to take responsibility for the issue. In the meantime, passengers who turn up to Ennis railway station are forced to take a bus to Limerick and <i>vice versa</i>. Much has been invested in terms of marketing and physical infrastructure to get this rail line re-opened and to get passengers engaged with it, but all of that hard work is now threatened. Sadly, further money will be required to address the damage caused by flood waters to the train tracks when those waters recede. Equally, families living in Ballycar have to take a cross-country route through neighbouring properties to get in and out of their homes, sometimes two or three times a day. One family has twins under the age of two and it is a very difficult task for them each day. This is a recurring problem that needs to be resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_565"> It is important that a long-term solution is found and that local views are listened to. From speaking with local landowners and residents, I know they are more than willing to play an active role in coming up with a solution. It is my understanding that Irish Rail presented the OPW with an in-depth report focused on the flooding issues at Ballycar. This report has put forward a number of options which need to be explored and put into action. A swallow hole on the outskirts of Newmarket-on-Fergus needs to be cleaned and some sort of filter must be incorporated into it to prevent further clogging. Local landowners have put forward the view that an additional drain could be opened to link into the existing water channels, thus removing the flood from Ballycar by moving the excess water to tributaries feeding the River Fergus. I note and welcome Clare County Council's commitment, subject to funding being released, to raise the road at three different locations in Ballycar in an effort to keep the public road open.</p>
            <p eId="para_566"> What I am asking for today is that an official from the OPW would be appointed from the Mungret office to co-ordinate all agencies which have a interest in this matter, such as Clare County Council, Irish Rail and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, together with local landowners and residents, with a view to setting up a working group to seek a solution to this issue, and for the OPW to be the responsible agency to implement the solution. Rail users using the national rail network, specifically the Ennis to Limerick line, residents of Ballycar, landowners and the ordinary taxpayers want and deserve a solution to this problem. The flooding at Ballycar cannot be resolved without one agency taking a lead role and that agency must be the OPW.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_567">I thank Deputy Carey for raising this very important matter. As he knows, I am aware of the flooding problem at Ballycar Lough because he has raised it with me on a continuous basis. I understand that road flooding prevents access to a few houses in the area but that the substantive issue has to do with the flooding on the Ennis to Limerick rail line.</p>
            <p eId="para_568"> I am advised that the cause of this flooding has to do with the geology of the area, where the outfall from Ballycar Lough is a swallow hole which does not have adequate capacity to discharge the increased inflows which occur during prolonged rainfall. As a result, the water levels rise and can inundate the railway line and the adjacent road, blocking access to a small number of houses. The Office of Public Works has been liaising with Iarnród Éireann and the relevant local authorities in regard to this matter and will continue to work constructively with them. Technical advice and assistance has been offered and the OPW will continue to make its knowledge and expertise available.</p>
            <p eId="para_569"> On the proposal the Deputy has made, I believe it would be a good idea to set up a working group between all of the relevant stakeholders - the OPW, Iarnród Éireann, the local authority and the community. On the OPW side, I will undertake to commit an engineer or an official to attend such a meeting. It might be more useful, however, if the meeting was brought together by the local authority. Nonetheless, we will certainly play our part in working with all of the other agencies to find a solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> There are essentially two options available to deal with this problem. One is to attempt to undertake works to mitigate the flooding at the lough. This has been investigated and a preliminary cost of approximately €10 million has been estimated for the required works, which is one quarter of the national flood relief budget for this year - I just make that point.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">Another option is to raise the affected stretch of road and the railway line. Raising the road could be undertaken by the local authority at very little cost. In respect of the rail line, the OPW has consistently taken the view that as the flooding impacts primarily on the railway line and that the railway line would be the main beneficiary of flood mitigation measures, it is, therefore, a matter for larnród Éireann as the owner of the railway line to resolve the problem by taking the lead on and funding the flood mitigation works or by the raising the railway line.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> I am aware of the report prepared for larnród Éireann by RPS Consultants setting out a number of possible measures to address this problem. The OPW wrote to larnród Éireann in April 2012 with detailed comments on this report and indicating areas where it had concerns. The report recommended a scheme of works involving discharging the floodwaters downstream to an embanked area that already floods occasionally, contains some crucial air traffic control infrastructure, is in part the subject of significant environmental designation and only discharges to the sea when the tide is out. The concerns with this recommended scheme should be clear but the OPW expressed particular concern at a proposal to increase the discharge from the lough to a tide-locked area containing internationally critical low-lying transport infrastructure. The proposals in the report would require some further mitigating measures which the report has not taken into account. It was noted by the OPW also that the RPS report did not include a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed flood relief works. Proposed works on this scale could only proceed on the basis of a robust appraisal which indicated a clear economic justification for spending €10 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_573"> The OPW also pointed out that the estimated cost of raising the railway line was only marginally more than the proposal, preferred by larnród Éireann, that flood relief works be undertaken. When account is taken of the additional cost of the further mitigating measures that would be required but not covered in the RPS report, the economic argument clearly tilts in favour of raising the railway line. The OPW remains willing to work with larnród Éireann, the local authorities and local residents to produce an effective resolution of the problem at Ballycar. However, as I have indicated, the OPW has always been clear in its position that as larnród Éireann is the primary beneficiary from any proposals to resolve the flooding problem at Ballycar, it would have to take the lead on and fund whatever project may proceed, be it flood mitigation works or raising the railway line. It would appear to be the case that the latter option is the most cost-effective solution in any event. As the Deputy has made a very worthwhile contribution and proposal about a working group, I commit that my colleagues in the OPW will come to the table once others do.</p>

            <p eId="para_574">I thank the Minister for his reply. As I understand it, the railway line has already been raised. Clare County Council intends to raise the road at three different locations where it floods, which is welcome. I do not believe raising the railway line is the solution. I note that €10 million is a lot of money. larnród Éireann, the OPW and Clare County Council are all State bodies receiving public money and public money has gone into the railway line to get it up and running. It is a successful railway line and many people use it to go from Ennis to Limerick. This issue is undermining the national rail network. It has an impact on people going to work and tourists and needs to be resolved. It is having an impact on people living in Ballycar. I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has committed to involving an official from the OPW in a working group because there has been a lot of passing the buck in respect of this issue. I am delighted that the Minister of State has stood up to the plate today and committed himself to involving an official from the OPW in a working group. I will commit to contacting Clare County Council to ask it to convene a meeting between itself, the OPW, larnród Éireann, local landowners and the residents with a view to coming up with some type of solution. It may not cost €10 million. Local people have put forward some solutions that they feel may alleviate the flooding problem. I will commit to doing that and, hopefully, some solution can be found.</p>

            <p eId="para_575">The Deputy's suggestion that all the relevant agencies come together is a good one. It is worth putting on the record that we reckon that the cost of raising the road in the area, which could alleviate this problem, would be somewhere between €20,000 and €50,000. It is obviously a matter for the county council. It is also worth saying that we are clear in our view that larnród Éireann has the necessary legal powers under the legislation to deal with the flooding problem at Ballycar. If a railway order is made, the company's powers are very similar to those of the OPW. The primary beneficiaries here are the railway line and the rail network. They have a responsibility to try to find a solution in financial terms. If bringing the people together to see if some collective solution can be found is something worth pursuing, the Deputy can be assured that not only will the OPW be at the table, it will try to find a solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">Before the break, we discussed the importance of regulation but also the importance of the enforcement of regulation. This is a critical issue for so many elements of industry. We spoke about the difficulties experienced by many companies within the concrete industry and the damage done to the industry's consumers, including the State which would have been a massive consumer of concrete in the past with the associated cost to the taxpayer. The argument I was putting forward was that the proper resourcing of enforcement leads to a better functioning market which leads to reduced costs for the taxpayer and consumer and competitiveness in the entire industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> In a draft paper looking at white-collar crime oversight, the academic Elaine Byrne last year questioned whether the State bodies were fit for purpose. The question is very relevant. Ms Byrne notes that there are just three forensic accountants within a team of 70 officers at the Criminal Assets Bureau. Privately, senior officers from different agencies have confided in Ms Byrne that diminished resources are strangling their ability to do the job effectively. Those are very strong words from those at the coalface of enforcement. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is another area where resources simply do not reflect the need with which it is faced nor the stated commitment of the Government to tackle significant wrongs such as the investigation into criminality in Anglo Irish Bank. Elaine Byrne notes that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement saw a decrease in funding in 2011 of 7.5% and was allocated five administrative staff and five gardaí to assist with the Anglo investigation, one of the largest and most pivotal investigations of the economic health and well-being of this State. Budget allocations for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Office of the Ombudsman have decreased. What we have seen is a retrenchment of resources to the bodies tasked with enforcing the regulations of the State - a State that is on its knees as a result of regulations not being adhered to in the main. </p>
          <p eId="para_578"> We all agree that the strengthening of competition law is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">However, it is not worth a jot if the Minister does not resource it. We are calling for the Minister to show where the resources will come from for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> The grocery sector, about which I started my contribution, is one of the most pivotal sectors of Irish society because most people are consumers of it, it creates and maintains a lot of jobs and many of the SMEs in the State supply that sector. The muted response by the large multiples to the Minister's legislation is a cause for concern. Criticism has been levied at the Minister for not introducing a code of conduct, as was first promised by Fianna Fáil as far back as 2009 and which was recommended by the Travers report in 2011. Such a code was to be placed on a statutory footing and this is where my problem lies with the legislation. The Minister has said that he considers that regulations would be more appropriate than a code of practice and I would like to hear more from him on his rationale in that regard. The Travers report recommended the placing of the code of conduct on a legislative basis. We accept that jobs, businesses and consumers need to be protected but so too do suppliers. What we are looking for is balance. </p>
          <p eId="para_581"> On publishing the Travers report and the draft code of conduct in July 2011, the Minister expressed his disappointment with the grocery industry's failure to sign up to the voluntary code of conduct. However, that is hardly a surprise because most sectors and most industries would desire unfettered markets and would like to be able to operate in any way they choose. Most instinctually look for a reduction in regulations that may impose charges on them and cause difficulties for them, even if such regulations are, in general, designed for the better functioning of that market and for the safety of the participants in it, especially if there are dominant forces within a market structure. We must be honest about the Irish grocery sector which has a number of dominant players and vested interests. </p>
          <p eId="para_582"> The Minister is also asking Opposition Deputies to debate and discuss regulations that have not been written yet. The Minister has said they will be drafted and enacted as soon as is practicable after the enactment of the Bill. Is that not asking the Opposition to buy a pig in a poke? The Minister is asking us to trust the Government on this, it will address the issues and deliver in an adequate fashion. Suppliers have waited for decades to see some concrete action on the sharp practices in the grocery sector. They can be forgiven for finding cold comfort in what is before us. They will feel that this Bill is promising something at some stage in the future for which they have already been waiting for a long time. </p>
          <p eId="para_583"> It is very worrying also that the Minister is proposing to introduce an initial series of regulations reflecting some of the powers open to him and then he will take a wait-and-see approach before deciding if they need to be amended or strengthened. In short, we are merely getting enabling provisions to allow the Minister to regulate and all we have here are the bare necessities, which the Minister may increase as he sees fit at some point in the future. We need a clear legislative framework and a level playing field now for this sector. It appears that this is not a definitive goodbye to "hello money" after all, which is deeply disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> One of the phrases I have used most in the House since becoming a Deputy three years ago is that one cannot manage if one cannot measure. The Minister is probably sick of listening to me saying it at this stage. One of the major issues in this sector is large multinationals not declaring their turnover, profits or margins in this State. Hiding this reduces the ability of the Oireachtas to regulate and manage the sector. It also reduces the power of suppliers in their negotiations with these organisations. Transparency is on the side of good regulation and good market functioning and the Minister should also be on the side of transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> A free and diverse media - the "Fourth Estate" as it is sometimes called - is probably one of the most important components of a functioning democracy. Oversight of competition within the media should be strong, rigorous and independent. We need to make sure that we insulate the regulation of the media from the vested interests within the media itself. That could happen with a good, strong, independent commission. I believe that discretion in the hands of politicians on this issue is more often than not tainted by the huge influence that media moguls can have. Sadly, Ireland's media market is probably one of the least diverse in the world. The issue of the Denis O'Brien's Communicorp dominance in terms of media ownership in Ireland remains. Irish media has been characterised, for as long as I have known it, by a number of powerful oligarchs in Ireland and Britain. These very powerful individuals exert a fierce amount of control over the functioning of the State. A recent documentary on one of the news stations highlighted the level of influence that the Independent Newspaper Group had on general elections in the past and the deals made with Bertie Ahern in the run up to elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> People talk about freedom of speech in this State but in many ways freedom of speech is determined by how much money one has to control broadcast and print media. If ownership is centred in the hands of a few vested interests, that has a negative effect on the functioning of democracy. Diversity and plurality are what we need in our media system. Plurality is undermined when governments have close relationships with media owners, the case in point here being the Government's close relationship with Denis O'Brien, especially in the light of the Moriarty tribunal. If this legislation is passed, what difference will it make to the Government's dealings with his media interests? I ask that the Government addresses some of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> These are my initial thoughts and deliberations on this very important Bill. I look forward to hearing the Minister's responses to some of the points raised and to discussing this legislation further.</p>

        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_349">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_588">The Minister said that diversity of content and ownership across the media remains an important part of a healthy democratic society and I fully agree with him. However, he also said that he was retaining the basic model of current laws based on the principle of avoiding intervention by Government in media ownership, except in specific circumstances following procedures determined by law. I would like to see the Government not taking such a hands-off approach. I would like to see a lot more regulation in this area. Right now, the media in Ireland is in peril. The fact that the ownership of the Irish media is increasingly entering the hands of an elite few spells disaster for the possibility of engendering a vibrant and participatory democracy in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> The media and how it is structured does not appear out of nowhere. To quote the media historian Robert McChesney, "The policies, structures, subsidies and institutions that are created to control, direct and regulate the media will be responsible for the logic and nature of the media system". This means that the problem of the media is a political one and a serious debate about media monopolisation and the importance of a well-funded, objective and independent media needs to take place in this House. There is unquestionably a direct link between the control of the media and control over society.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> It is interesting then to consider what kind of information the mainstream Irish media disseminates to the public. Last year, Dr. Julien Mercille of UCD published a revealing study that examined how <i>The Irish Times</i>, <i>Irish Independent </i>and <i>Sunday Independent </i>reported financial consolidation and general budget issues from the period of January 2008 to 31 December 2012. The results are startling. Dr. Mercille's research stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_591">Significant support for fiscal consolidation [which we must remember is a core aspect of the austerity programme] is clear. In total, there are 431 articles: 236 (55%) are in favour of fiscal consolidation, 50 (12%) against it and 145 (34%) neutral. When neutral pieces are excluded, 83% of articles support fiscal consolidation and 17% oppose it. No time pattern could be detected in the evolution of views on fiscal consolidation, apart from the fact that a larger number of articles appeared towards the end of years (in the months of November and December), which is explained by the fact that this is the time at which the budget is discussed. Out of the 431 articles, 75 are written by outside writers (i.e. not journalists). Of these, 35 (47%) are economists or working in the financial sector, 13 (17%) are high political officials, eight (11%) are academics (excluding academic economists), but only five (7%) are from trade unions and seven (9%) from progressive organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Only a minority of pieces explicitly opposed consolidation itself by calling for a fundamentally different strategy, such as Keynesian economic stimulus. This can be seen in the fact that among all articles, 8% opposed cuts and only 3% stated a preference for increasing government spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> If only the 50 articles opposed to fiscal consolidation are considered, a similar pattern is found: 54% of them disagree with specific expenditure cuts while 20% suggest that public spending should be increased. The nature of the opposition to fiscal consolidation is therefore based mostly on disagreement with particular cuts, rather than with the principle of consolidation. This suggests that public debate in the media is framed around the ways in which fiscal consolidation can best be implemented, as opposed to comparing and contrasting it with other strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> Nevertheless, on economic policy, the<i> Independent </i>newspapers are ideologically to the right of <i>The Irish Times</i> and this explains why more opposition to conservative economic policies is likely to appear in the latter rather than in the former. This can be traced, in part, to the fact that <i>The Irish Times</i> is governed by a trust that ensures some level of independence from commercial interests. For example, it does not have beneficial shareholders and cannot pay dividends. A number of its board directors also come from elite institutions. Like other newspapers, <i>The Irish Times </i>is dependent on advertising revenue and sales, which veer it to the right.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> We must not forget that the media is part and parcel of the political and corporate establishment. Dr. Mercille has also written a paper on the role of the media in sustaining Ireland's housing bubble where he found that news organisations largely sustained the bubble until the property market collapsed. He wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_596">... news content reflects economic and political elites' interests and views. The Irish media can be seen as neoliberalised in line with Ireland's political economy. Over the last several decades, mergers have reduced the number of smaller, independent regional news organisations and increased the concentration of ownership... Both private and State-owned Irish media largely convey establishment views.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The control Denis O'Brien has over the media beggars belief. He holds a 29.9% stake in Independent News &amp; Media, which accounts for 40% of all newspaper sales in Ireland. The said gentleman also controls six radio stations, including Newstalk and Today FM. He controls the <i>Evening Herald</i>, the <i>Irish Independent, Sunday Independent and Sunday World</i>, and co-owns the <i>Irish Star</i>. In addition, he owns 14 regional newspapers, including the <i>Wexford People, New Ross Standard, Enniscorthy Echo </i>and <i>Gorey Guardian</i>, as well as two free newspapers. Mr. O'Brien's ability to shape the news in Ireland is massive as he controls 40% of it. How in God's name can that be healthy for democracy? </p>
          <p eId="para_598"> Last week in this Chamber, I had the audacity to criticise some aspects of how Independent News &amp; Media operates. I highlighted the fact that it had obtained a bailout of €138 million from the banks, of which almost €16 million fell on the Irish taxpayer. When I was walking out of the Chamber, a Deputy said to me: "Are you mad criticising the <i>Independent</i>? They'll get you." Anyone who was dumb enough to buy <i>The Star </i>yesterday - my life is too short to be reading such rag mags - will discover that they made an effort at getting me. They highlighted the fact that I was going to cost the State money. They did not highlight the fact that I had planning permission for 28 own-door units on that site, which have been sold for less than €20,000 each. If the bank had worked with me, it would not have cost them a fraction of what it is going to cost them now. There is no logic to what has happened. Similarly, there has been no logic to banks selling over 20 of my apartments at a time, which are going to investors for less than half what I could build them for tomorrow. It is also less than half of what the public can buy them for individually. This has a lot to do with rising rents in Dublin. I stressed this matter with the Minister at Question Time this morning. More and more apartments and houses for rent in Dublin are in the control of fewer and fewer people. That is because investors and speculators have bought up huge numbers of them at seriously reduced rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> One pays a price by daring to challenge these people. I will cite an example from the Minister's area of responsibility. George Monbiot wrote an article about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, in <i>The Guardian</i> - which is a newspaper we can only aspire to here - under the headline "This US trade deal is a full frontal assault on democracy". Mr. Monbiot wrote that "The purpose of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is to remove the regulatory differences between the US and European nations". He also said the TTIP would grant the ability to "big business to sue the living daylights out of governments which try to defend their citizens. It would allow a secretive panel of corporate lawyers to overrule the will of parliament and destroy our legal protections. Yet the defenders of our sovereignty say nothing." I find it incredible how little coverage there has been of the TTIP in Irish mainstream media. Irrespective of what postilion the Minister or I take, I find it frightening that it is not even being discussed one way or the other. That is really disappointing. </p>
          <p eId="para_600"> Let us take Shannon Airport. Margaretta D'Arcy went to prison for going on the runway and highlighting the fact that the US military still uses our airport to carry out terrible atrocities in other lands. The State washes its hands of it but so does the media; they are not interested. Margaretta D'Arcy has to go on the runway to highlight the fact that terrible things are happening. Almost 500,000 people have died in Iraq and we are part of it; we have facilitated it.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> A UN International Panel on Climate Change reported recently and it was very interesting what it came up with. In fairness to <i>The Irish Times</i>, Frank McDonald gave it good coverage. However, that paper and others are not covering the fact that our Government is going in the opposite direction to what the UN international panel on climate change is saying. We are not interested in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> A man telephoned me just after lunchtime today and told me that he went on the <i>Irish Independent </i>website to correct the fact that I was not here for questions yesterday. A number of Deputies were ridiculed in the media for not attending the House for questions. It was an unusual day because our questions came up more quickly than usual as three or four people were missing. Most of the Deputies, from all sides, who were missing for questions were at committees at the time. I was at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation asking Mr. Richie Boucher some questions on banking for SMEs. I actually did come into the Chamber because the questions came around a second time. Therefore, I was here for my question and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle can verify that.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The man in question went on the <i>Independent</i> website to clarify the fact that I did get here for my question, but they would not allow it and took it down.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> The same gentleman e-mailed me some material about Irish Water and the privatisation of water services. He sent me a copy of a letter that was sent to a Greek Minister by Commissioner Olli Rehn's office. It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_605">As you know, privatisation of public companies contributes to the reduction of public debt, as well as to the reduction of subsidies, other transfers or state guarantees to state-owned enterprises. It also has the potential of increasing the efficiency of companies and, by extension, the competitiveness of the economy as a whole, while attracting foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The Corporate Europe Observatory is a well respected body in Europe. It got hold of the above letter and sought to highlight the fact that the privatisation of water is being challenged in many quarters. It published the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_607">The European Commission is deliberately promoting privatization of water services as one of the conditions being imposed as part of bailouts, it has acknowledged in a letter to civil society groups. EU Commissioner Olli Rehn's directorate was responding to questions posed in an open letter concerning the European Commission's role in imposing privatisation through the Troika in Greece, Portugal and other countries. The civil society groups have today written to Commissioner Rehn to demand that he "refrains from any further pressure to impose water privatisation conditionalities".</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_608"> The Commission's push for privatisation goes against the growing trend in Europe and around the world which has seen water privatisation fail to deliver. Paris and many other cities have recently remunicipalised their water services due to negative experiences with privatisation. The Dutch government in 2004 passed a law banning private sector provision of water supply and the Italian Constitutional Court ruled that any future legislation attempting to privatise public services would be unconstitutional.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_609"> The Commission has not put forward any evidence to back its stance in its reply, even though research shows that public provision is often more effective than private. It also violates key articles of the EU Treaty which state that the EU should be neutral on the question of water ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> The gentleman to whom I referred earlier also tried to put that material on the <i>Irish Independent</i> website, but it was not allowed either. That is called "control of the news". If one dares to raise one's head above the parapet to challenge the establishment, one can expect to be kicked around by Independent News &amp; Media, which is very powerful. If asked whether the Taoiseach or Mr. Denis O'Brien had the most power in Ireland, most people would say it was my good friend Denis. It should not be like that. The Government should rein him in.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> A healthy, independent media would mean so much to this country. It could do so much to improve how our society works. The State should help to fund the media to allow it to be more independent.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_350">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_612">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill 2014. The Bill has three main purposes. The first is to amalgamate the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority as part of the Government's programme of rationalisation of State agencies. While it probably makes sense to amalgamate the bodies given that they are both directed to protect consumers, people who have experience of the Competition Authority and its lack of action on serious competition issues across the State will question placing the National Consumer Agency with it. The Competition Authority has completely failed to act to improve competition. I speak in the context of the operation of cartels in the concrete industry and the difficulties that have arisen in that regard. I have read reports that show that the lack of competition in the market could be costing the State approximately €2 billion a year. When we are talking about continuing and increasing austerity, €2 billion is a huge sum. It could be gained for the State if it had a Competition Authority with real teeth and the resources to act on behalf of the State and citizens. The Minister said the new competition and consumer protection commission will be a powerful body with real teeth acting to protect and vindicate consumers' rights. I wonder. While time will tell, the history of the Competition Authority suggests we will be sadly disappointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> By amalgamating the National Consumer Agency with the authority we are increasing the workload but I do not see a corresponding commitment to providing the resources necessary for the new agency to act on behalf of citizens to ensure that there is fair competition and treatment of consumers. It is a sad lack. As has been said many times in the House, we are great at making regulations and passing laws, but we do very little if anything when it comes to enforcing them. If we only enforced half the laws we have, Ireland would be a much better country for people to build their lives in.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> The second aim of the Bill is to implement the recommendations of the advisory group on media mergers. Deputy Wallace has clearly outlined the difficulties within the media in the State. There is little that needs to be added to what he said. While it is perhaps not a matter for the Bill, I have a particular problem. The legislation provides that media mergers should have a new emphasis on media plurality to provide diversity of ownership and content. Would such content include home-produced content? Is that something that could be provided for in the context of media mergers? It is stark to see that only 7% of content broadcast by national media is domestically produced. In France and Canada, where there is very strong legislation, adequate levels of domestically produced content must be produced by national media. Strong industries accompany the legislation in those countries. It may be a matter for another Bill but it is something at which the Government should look. Given his responsibility for jobs, I draw to the attention of the Minister the potential in this regard for growing and developing the cultural sector and creative industries across the State. It is something that could have a huge impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> The final aim of the Bill is to make provisions on grocery goods and to regulate the operation of the relationship between large multiples and wholesalers on the one hand and producers and consumers on the other. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine which produced a report last year which the Minister referenced in his opening remarks. We called in the report for the introduction of a statutory code of conduct in the groceries sector. During our hearings, we were lucky to have all the multiples with the exception of Dunnes Stores come to the committee to give evidence of their views on a code of conduct and whether it should be statutory or voluntary. It will be no surprise to anybody that they wanted a voluntary code. They said that in any event they were totally compliant with all current legislation and that nothing ever went wrong within the groceries sector. Therefore, they concluded that there was no need for a statutory code at all, which is interesting in itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> We heard contributions from Tesco, the Musgrave Group, Aldi, Lidl and Retail Ireland. It was interesting to hear them all say practically the same thing word for word. It was a rehearsed script the whole way through. I must give credit to the representatives from Aldi who said when they were questioned that they would be happy to comply with whatever code was introduced, whether statutory or not, although their preference was for a voluntary code. They were the only people to say that. It was also interesting during the hearings to hear representatives say when pushed that their reason for not having a statutory code was that it would place astronomical costs on them in compliance terms. These huge costs would have to be transferred to the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">In Europe the Commission has decided on a voluntary code after examining codes of practice. In the UK the position of Groceries Code Adjudicator, or supermarket ombudsman, has been established. The original report here was published in 2009. One would think they would have worked out the cost of complying with a statutory code but no one could indicate how much it would cost them, or even provide a ballpark figure. It is a facade and an attempt to delay the regulation. It was very interesting to see them trying to stall it.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> I was concerned when I read the Bill and saw the Minister had opted for regulation and statutory instrument. The list of provisions to be made through statutory instrument to regulate the relationship between grocers and their suppliers is long. We had hoped for, and the committee had recommended, a statutory code. The Bill states the Minister may if it is appropriate include provisions and the Minister may introduce regulations. This is of concern because we have seen such provisions contained in previous legislation - the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act is the most stark example, but years later nothing has happened. I am concerned these sections may not be enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> Last week the committee was briefed by departmental officials on how this would operate and we were reassured. In his speech the Minister emphasised regulations are in the process of being drafted and will be introduced as quickly as possible after the legislation is passed. This is good, but I imagine once the legislation is passed, the retail sector and large multiples will intensively lobby to water down the proposals in the statutory instrument and delay the enactment of various sections which will allow this to happen. The Government must resist this on behalf of consumers and on behalf of the small and medium enterprises throughout the State which are dependent on a fair contract and relationship with the companies they supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> I do not believe this legislation will add €1 or one cent to anyone's shopping bill. If it costs large multiples with turnovers of up to €1 billion a year €5 million to comply with the Government's code of practice or the regulations, it is a small drop in the ocean compared with their overall income and profitability. It is scaremongering and the Government must resist it to ensure regulations are introduced which provide for a proper and fair relationship to develop between suppliers and grocers.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> This always comes back to whether it will be enforced, and this is the big question which hangs over all legislation. We discuss all types of well-intentioned laws which are timely, needed and will set things right. I hope in a few years time we will not be sitting here wondering what happened with regard to the regulations, whether inspections are taking place, whether the new agency is examining compliance and whether cases of non-compliance are being brought to court, not simply to punish people but to change practices and behaviour. We need to be able to state such practices and behaviour have been ruled out once and for all. It is only through proper and rigorous enforcement of the regulations that this can take place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_351">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_622">The Competition and Consumer Protection Bill has been most eagerly awaited. The necessity of the change has been impacted by the economic changes which have taken place in Ireland since the 1980s when markets were liberalised and opened up with the completion of the Single Market. Many of the provisions of the Bill are commitments which can be found in the programme for Government and the Action Plan for Jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> At individual level, consumers are at a total disadvantage when it comes to the balance of power. Even when acting together, a considerable critical mass of consumers is required before the balance of power tips in their favour. Information is imperative to assist consumers. A strong advocate to act on behalf of the interests of consumers collectively is also essential. The current framework has not been adequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> It has been a source of irony how elements of competition law have negatively impacted on consumers. An example is telecommunications in Ireland, with particular reference to Eircom. The objective behind privatising Eircom was to comply with EU competition law and to provide consumers with greater choice. It was also assumed the private sector would provide the finance necessary for investment in services such as broadband. We now know the privatisation of Eircom has not worked out well. The inclusion of the entire communications network, along with the company, in the sale continues to impact negatively on communities throughout the country 15 years later. The coinciding of Eircom's private ownership with the property boom took away focus from investment onto the profitable sale of the company's property assets. With the recession, the company was unable to provide the investment required for improvements to the network and it was only last year the company was able to launch the eFibre broadband programme for areas outside the main cities. Added to this were the restrictions placed on the company from aggressively competing until its market share had fallen below a specific percentage.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> If all consumers, including householders and businesses, had access to the same number of service providers and the same level of choice and service, this would not have been a problem. However, the fact is that hundreds of thousands of consumers have been negatively affected by the evolution of the telecommunications market in Ireland. Particularly affected have been consumers in rural towns, villages and areas where the main broadband competitors such as UPC and UTV were not, and are not, available. A process that was supposed to provide greater choice, better service and more competition did nothing. Rather, consumers became victims of competition. They were supposed to be the beneficiaries but instead ended up the casualties of laws and actions, at EU and national level, intended to improve consumer choice and service. The Bill is an opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the recent past and ensure we have an organisation in the competition and consumer protection commission which is able to raise issues such as this, publicise them, act on behalf of consumers and play an important role in finding and implementing solutions or advocating changes to legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> Another interface between competition law and service provision to consumers is state aid. In the Single Market state aid is eyed with suspicion and is deemed incompatible with the Common Market and a threat to competition. Once again, however, this view ignores the realities of a country with a population density such as ours. It is undeniable that certain services just would not be provided without the support of the State. In the early decades of the State, the provision of electricity, public transport, health care and telecommunications occurred because of State support and intervention. While the situation has changed in many sectors, there remain some services, such as the provision of high speed broadband in rural areas or the provision of transport services such as air and ferry to our islands, which require and rightly receive state aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The national broadband plan stated the service would be put out to tender and broadband would be provided to the most remote and rural areas, but unfortunately the service has been very poor. In the new mapping which is taking place, we must ensure state aid is allowed to provide support for the most rural areas where the market will not provide such support. This is being examined and the Government is in discussions with the European Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> I do not view financial savings as the sole rationale for merging the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency. Rather, I believe the purpose is to create a stronger organisation to provide competition and champion the rights and interests of consumers. This should apply to consumers irrespective of where they reside and should take into account how actions and policies concerning competition can have different effects on different locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Consumer rights and health competition are inextricably linked. I agree with the suggestion in this Bill's regulatory impact analysis that the newly merged body will be stronger and more co-ordinated and will have benefits for the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> This Bill is also necessary because aspects of existing competition law have proven to be inadequate. The groceries order, which was introduced in 1956, was further strengthened in the late 1980s following the collapse of the H Williams chain of supermarkets. Among its provisions was a ban on below-cost selling of food and alcohol. The order was the subject of much debate and controversy before it was removed by the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006. There remains a ban on below-cost selling of food, however, by virtue of the Competition Act 2002. This will seem perplexing to many people, given that large supermarkets were able to sell Irish-grown vegetables at a fraction of their true cost before Christmas 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> Retailers, particularly those known as the multiples, drive down the price of fresh food at the expense of producers. We know that Irish farmers receive a fraction of the price that is paid for food, with milk being a prime example. There is a clear dominance and imbalance of power in the relationships in the grocery sector. The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine argued in its recent report on the grocery goods sector for the introduction of a statutory code of conduct for the sector, with an independent supermarket ombudsman. I appreciate the rationale for this. However, the Bill before the House proposes instead to empower the Minister to make regulations on certain aspects of commercial relationships. I hope the Minister will not be slow to introduce such regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> Legislation like the Bill we are considering, is important for the food industry, producers and retailers. The responsibility of consumers to be aware and informed is equally important. If they ask questions about the origin of food, the production of food and the proportion of the price being paid to producers, and make informed decisions on that basis, large retailers will have to take note. The effect of consumer power can be seen clearly in the case of the discount retailers. The wishes of Irish consumers to purchase quality food products that are locally sourced or produced has led to Aldi and Lidl changing their business practices in Ireland and in other European countries. Other supermarkets have recognised this by augmenting and increasing their support for Irish producers as a result of the increased competition in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> Media mergers are also addressed in this Bill. Media ownership has been an issue since the first newspapers rolled off the printing presses. This issue has evolved distinctly in different countries. For example, public service broadcasting in Europe is different from such broadcasting in the US. On this side of the Atlantic, public service broadcasters such as the BBC have been viewed as integral parts of modern society. Raidió Teilifís Éireann played a significant role in building our nation. It was important for Ireland to have its own radio station and television service.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> Just as the organisation of the groceries sector and the provision of food have changed since the late 1980s, so too has the media sector. The introduction of independent local radio stations has brought about a welcome plurality. All businesses go through stages of start-up, growth, expansion, consolidation and maturity. Media businesses, whether in print or in broadcasting, are no different. The economic uncertainty of the past five or six years and the changing business models have accelerated consolidation. Newspapers have merged and radio stations have been acquired. The issue of media ownership has grown in significance in tandem with this. The effects of the concentration of ownership in the hands of very few people have the potential to be highly negative.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> This Bill is not about controlling the media or about censorship. It is about ensuring fairness, transparency and equality, all of which are essential ingredients for a democracy. The growth of social media, facilitated by the Internet, has also been revolutionary. It has broken down entry barriers, encouraged and opened participation and lessened the power of old media. The task of regulating and providing oversight in the common good is becoming increasingly complicated. It is not something that many governments have been able to grapple with successfully. It is startling that 21 EU member states have no special rules for media mergers. Ireland is leading the pack on this issue. I hope the legislative process can be better at keeping pace with the changing communications landscape.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> The proposed competition and consumer protection commission has been described by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, as "a powerful watchdog with real teeth acting to protect and vindicate consumers". The Minister has indicated that a new criminal investigations function will be added to combat white collar crime. Only time will tell if this comes to pass. I hope it does because it would ultimately be to the benefit of everyone in the community.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_352">
          <from>Deputy James Bannon<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_637">I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I thank him for being in the Chamber for this debate. These debates are often left to Ministers of State. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is always in the Chamber for debates on legislation relating to his portfolio. That is very welcome. This Bill is the latest effort to balance consumer protection with competition. It shines a light on the debate over whether large retailers bully their suppliers. Those of us who live in rural Ireland pride ourselves on our local grocers and corner shops. We trust them to deliver a better product than the faceless supermarket chains. I regret to say that the local corner shop is slowly ebbing away as the supermarket sector monopolises the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> The people have continually driven forward, as it were, since the crash in 2008. We have worked hard over the past six years to get to where we are. This country is now creating more than 1,000 jobs a week, rather than haemorrhaging them by the day. According to the ESRI, this country has one of the highest predicted growth rates in Europe at present. I believe no other country could have done what Ireland has done. I attribute this to a unique feature in Irish society, namely, our sense of community, which has driven us forward. People throughout the country have worked tirelessly to get Ireland back on track, not because Germany told them to do so, but for the sake of their neighbours across the road and their local grocers on the main street. Local communities have been and are fighting to keep their towns and villages alive. It is disheartening that the heart has been taken out of the main streets of many towns in rural Ireland as a result of the development of supermarkets on the outskirts of those towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> I refer to my local county town, Longford, in this context. I took the time in recent days to count how many establishments or outlets in the town have closed in recent years. I found that 63 outlets have closed, one third of which were grocery shops at one time. The local grocer is essential to communities and must be helped and supported. The same thing can be said of the local post office. Indeed, they are often one and the same. Big grocery retailers are making massive profits in Ireland. One of the main reasons for this is their dominance over smaller suppliers. Small suppliers invest locally, whereas the large supermarket chains that make these massive profits invest outside of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> Before Christmas, farmers protested throughout the country against the below-cost selling of vegetables, a practice which is more commonly known as "loss leading". Farmers gathered in protest outside big chain supermarkets throughout the country and outlined their demands for change, signalling a warning to the Government to act to protect their interests. By selling below cost, the big retailers drive down the prices paid to growers. This issue needs to be monitored and addressed by the Government. I suggest that this sort of behaviour is driving many young farmers off the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> The practice of looking for "hello money", whereby payments are levied by retailers on suppliers to get onto their shelves, is now outlawed. The big retailers have found ways to get around this ban, however. Many of the marketing charges and promotional fees levied by retailers to cover the cost of price cuts are seen as a new form of "hello money" by another name. The Bill before the House will regulate the grocery sector and ensure there is fairness between suppliers, retailers and consumers on issues such as contracts and the delivery of goods. New legal requirements for record-keeping and the inclusion of certain terms in written contracts, together with strong enforcement powers, would ensure fairness and sustainability in this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Bill will create a new, powerful watchdog that has the strength effectively to protect the Irish consumer. The National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority will be merged to create the competition and consumer protection commission, as outlined in the programme for Government in 2011. The Minister and his Department have been working tirelessly since then to bring the Bill to fruition. The new watchdog will be given criminal investigation functions to combat serious white collar crime and ultimately combat higher prices and protect consumers. It will have a full 360 degree perspective on consumer markets in Ireland, allowing it to strengthen further the environment for consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> Anti-competitive practices are damaging both to consumers and the wider economy. The ultimate aim of the new body will be to ensure open and competitive markets where consumers are protected and empowered and businesses can actively compete. The newly merged body will result in savings of €170,000 annually. Its establishment is another aspect of the Government's fulfilment of its role to protect citizens' rights. It is important that large retailers are not allowed to cheat consumers out of those rights.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_644">I welcome the publication of this important Bill. Members of this House are particularly well served by the Oireachtas Library, and its staff have excelled themselves on this occasion. Their Bills digest has been of great assistance to us in providing background information.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> The Bill has three main functions, namely, the amalgamation of two existing agencies into the new competition and consumer protection commission, whose abbreviation, CCPC, makes it sound like the old Russian Communist Party; regulations regarding the groceries order; and the issue of media mergers. The initial work on these provisions began under the former Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mary Coughlan. The legislation will bring Ireland into line with most European economies. Indeed, our neighbours in the United Kingdom launched their merged body on 1 April.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> I have concerns in regard to some aspects of the Bill, which I hope the Minister will address in his response. The provisions of section 18 allow the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of the day to direct the CCPC in regard to Government policy and its implications. This raises concerns regarding the ability of the new body to do its job independently in a context where the Government is a major consumer and driver of costs in the State. We cannot have a situation where a Minister might use or abuse these provisions. I do not expect that to happen under this Administration, but if the relevant powers are vague enough, a future Minister might use the provision to stymie the CCPC's independence. It is an issue that needs to be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> On the consumer protection side of things, it is difficult in this time of great change, technologically and economically, for people to keep abreast of consumer rights. Likewise, it is difficult for agencies charged with safeguarding those rights to advise customers. We as consumers are often not fully aware of our rights until we need to call on them, by which time it may be too late. The new agency must be properly resourced to get information across to people. Moreover, it probably needs to do so in a shock tactic type of way given that large companies have many multiples of the promotional and other resources that will be available to this agency at any stage in its ownership. There needs to be some type of level playing pitch to equip and guard consumers in terms of their rights. One of the drivers of this merger was reform of agencies and cost control but, in pursuing those ends, we must ensure we do not damage the ability of the consumer side of the CCPC to keep people fully informed of their rights and obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> In regard to the competition side of its remit, we need an agency with teeth and the ability to call out any large organisation or sector within the economy where anti-competitive practices are occurring. If it is to have teeth, the legal protection given to the new body in the legislation must be enforced properly. It requires the powers set out in this Bill and in the 2012 Act to be properly understood. There is no sense in enshrining the types of powers set out in this Bill in law unless we train members of the Judiciary in those powers. We must have people on the Bench who fully understand the consequences and import of these provisions and their potential to assist consumers and smaller companies. It is essential that the Commercial Court is fully resourced and we have a cadre of judges within it who have the ability to implement the powers outlined in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> On the question of naming and shaming, we must bring the surveys formerly conducted by the National Consumer Agency back into frame in order that consumers can be consulted. Even though the Bill has been in gestation for a long time, the public consultation phase needs to be slightly more robust than it has been. Perhaps in the course of the coming weeks a debate can be initiated to ensure people are aware of what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> An important question is what type of budget the new agency will have. In a situation where two authorities with very different specialties are being merged, there needs to be a robust budgetary process internally that ensures all the functions of the agency are properly resourced. It is important, for example, that the consumer side should get the same types of resources as the competition side. The latter will require a great deal of legal support, which brings me on to the issue of the failure of the Government to tackle legal costs. Nothing is being done to tackle that issue in the Legal Services Regulation Bill. As long as those costs remain as high as they are, it is even more important that the competition side of the new agency is adequately resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> In regard to the groceries order, I am concerned at the vagueness in the Bill in terms of the regulations and statutory code. The plan is to give the Minister powers to implement a statutory code and regulations, and we have been given an idea of what those regulations might be. It is unfair, however, to ask the House to debate this Bill without seeing those regulations in advance. There cannot be a proper regulatory impact assessment without having effective regulations in place. While the Minister has given a flavour of what they will be, we really need to see and study them. Perhaps he will indicate whether we might see a copy of them before Committee Stage. There is also cause for concern in the provision that the Minister will have the power under the Bill to introduce new regulations as the process goes along, rather than introducing them all in the context of the Bill. He should at least give us an analysis at this stage as to what types of regulations we can expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> Deputy James Bannon referred to the utterly unfair playing field that pertains in the grocery market. There is a push on at this time to encourage small and artisan producers in a context where people are increasingly interested in sourcing their food locally. At the same time, however, the large retailers seem continually to be increasing their control and using their commercial prowess to that end. It seems a case of never the twain shall meet, and this Bill does not offer much enlightenment as to how we can protect smaller operators. Businesses worth €50 million plus will be subject to the Bill's provisions, but what about those in the middle, such as the distributors who bring the smaller producer into the larger chain? We need clarity in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> I see the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Andrew Doyle, is in the Chamber. That committee has published a very useful report on unfair pricing practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The notion of vegetables being sold for 6 cent, 7 cent or 8 cent does not make sense from either a commercial or a social point of view. We are all aware of that. This type of below-cost selling is going to result in food production in this country being concentrated in the hands of very big operators. Once again, the small guy will lose out. This cannot be encouraged. The legislation before the House must be the first step in preventing that from happening. It must also act as the first line of defence for small producers and allow them to stand up to the larger operators.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> In the previous Dáil, the then Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment examined the grocery market over a period of years. It held hearings on the matter and published a great deal of material on the cost prices relating to food and drink. Such prices are higher in Ireland than in other economies. The prices charged here by multiples which serve other economies are higher and those companies seem to make larger profits here. We would be able to obtain a definitive picture in this regard if we could obtain sight of the profits of such companies but we cannot do so because they jealously protect information relating to the amounts of money they make in the Irish consumer market. These prices are charged by the multiples in respect of a range of goods - such as the basic foodstuffs - which people need on a daily basis. It appears that the companies garner much higher profits in this jurisdiction than they do elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> One of the worst aspects in this regard is that many of the large grocery multiples use alcohol as a magnet to attract people. They entice people to enter their shops by using cheap or, in many instances, below-cost alcohol and then oblige them to pay higher prices than those charged in other markets in respect of basic foodstuffs and commodities. There is a serious problem in this country in the context of alcohol consumption. The one issue we continually dodge and refuse to debate is the role played by large supermarket multiples, particularly in respect of the way in which they use alcohol as a price attractor. Large quantities of alcohol are being sold with very few controls in place. The consumption of such alcohol is giving rise to all sorts of issues relating to anti-social behaviour and vintners and everyone other than those in the sector to which I refer are blamed for this. In the context of public health and competition law, the use of alcohol as both a loss leader and a magnet by means of which to attract people to enter shops before fleecing them when they purchase basic foodstuffs, etc., must be brought to an end. Provision to facilitate this must be made in the code of practice and ministerial regulations that are to be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> I must admit that I become nervous when reference is made to statutory codes of practice because they give rise to additional costs and make matters very difficult for small businesses. However, we have faffed about for long enough in respect of the grocery sector. There appears to be an unwillingness to take on that sector. The Bill before the House presents us with an opportunity to do so. I hope the Minister will seize that opportunity. Those in the sector do not respect voluntary codes of practice and tend to ride roughshod over them. I am of the view that a debate is required on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> I will now deal with the issue of media mergers. In that context, our thoughts are with the staff of Landmark Media which publishes the <i>Irish Examiner</i> and many other newspapers and which launched a redundancy programme today. This announcement again shows the vulnerability of our domestic media outlets, particularly at a time of such change within the media market. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has taken responsibility for this matter and will have the ultimate say - following a review carried out by the new CCPC with regard to any potential media mergers. Will the Minister opposite, Deputy Bruton, either when replying to this debate or on Committee Stage, outline what that process will involve? Will he indicate the kind of issues the new CCPC will examine? What controls will be imposed on the relevant Minister in terms of his or her ability to make decisions on these kind of matters? What support will be given to the Minister of the day? Will there be a court of appeal? These issues are probably dealt with in the legislation but I would appreciate it if the Minister, Deputy Bruton, could outline the position in brief.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> The Bill does not focus on the location of the major cost drivers within the economy at present. We debated this matter on Question Time yesterday, which, contrary to what people might have read in this mornings newspapers, did take place. It is evident that the big drivers in terms of costs for businesses are emanating from the State. One such driver is the cost of health insurance. Increases in this regard have been driven by tax increases which were introduced in the most recent budget and which affected 90% of policies. Health insurance companies are continually increasing premia and they state that in doing so they are - in their view - responding to health policy. There is also the fact that costs relating to utilities and electricity are the sixth and seventh highest in the eurozone, depending on whether one's enterprise is an SME or a larger operation. Will the Minister indicate the impact the Bill is going to have on utility costs? Costs relating to waste in Ireland are considerably more than those in competitor EU member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> It is quite ironic that we are debating the Bill on the day on which the Government is tearing itself apart in respect of the biggest monopoly of them all - Irish Water. There is going to be no competition at all in respect of water. Will the Bill before the House provide protection for citizens who might encounter difficulties in their dealings with Irish Water? In view of the kind of resources available to that company, will the Minister outline the robust role the new organisation - the CCPC - will be given in terms of taking it on?</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> Another issue which arises relates to rulings handed down by the Competition Authority in the past with regard to how people in various professions can organise themselves. I am aware that a court case is pending in respect of how GPs can organise themselves in order to lobby on their own behalf and obtain basic rights for themselves. I know that the Minister is not permitted to comment on the matter but during the course of this Bill's passage through the Houses, a verdict should be handed down in that case. It is quite unusual for an organ of State to use competition law against an organisation which seeks to represent the collective interests of its members in the context of their terms and conditions. A small cohort of organisations representing GPs, pharmacists and even actors is affected by what is happening in this regard. It strikes me that, in the context of this Bill, the Minister will have an opportunity to address that matter and grant people their rights in the context of freedom to negotiate and bargain. Perhaps he might give some consideration to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> There is already in place a robust body of competition law. There are many elements within the Bill which will enhance that. I wish to pay tribute to the two organisations which are being merged. Both the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency struggled over the years but they did some good work in difficult circumstances. If the new body into which they will be merged is to work, I reiterate that it must be independent of Government. The new body must be able to call out the Government, which is the biggest driver of costs and one of the largest consumers in the State. It must have the legal power and the powers of enforcement required to take on the multiples and also large corporations of any ilk in any sector who run roughshod over consumer rights and who treat those consumers as a necessary evil as opposed to being essential to their interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> We must use the Bill to inform the large multiples, particularly those which operate in the grocery sector, that they do not run the country. They must also be told that they are valued employers but that their operations must be regulated. At present, these companies appear to be able to do as they like in respect of producers, communities - particularly small, rural ones - and independent retailers. We must be in a position to use the Bill to ensure that we will have a healthy media sector that will be diverse in terms of both content and ownership. In light of this country's literary tradition, it would be ridiculous if, as a result of developments in the media market and technology, voices were concentrated in one area and focused in one direction and if those with literary talent were prevented from having outlets for their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> I welcome the Bill but there are aspects of it which the Minister must clarify, particularly those relating to the groceries order. As stated earlier, the provisions of section 18 will allow the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of the day and the Government to direct the CCPC. Will the Minister outline the exact position in that regard? I look forward to his reply.</p>

          <p eId="para_666">I welcome the introduction of the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill and I commend the Minister on the work he has done in respect of it. The Bill has been quite some time in gestation and I understand that certain difficulties and challenges arose in the context of dealing with the technical aspects relating to it. None the less, the Bill, which was placed on the A list at the start of last year's autumn session, is now before the House. Five years ago Deputy Creed and I published the Food (Fair Trade and Information) Bill, which specifically dealt with the grocery sector. I am glad that the Bill before the House incorporates many of the guiding principles contained in our legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine produced a report last October entitled Report on the Grocery Goods Sector: Increasing equity and transparency in producer-processor-retailer relationships. I commend my committee colleagues on their support and input into the drafting of that report and those who came before the committee to offer testimony. Not all of them would agree with our conclusions but at least they showed up, unlike one of our large domestic multiples, Dunnes Stores, which decided to ignore an invitation and that was a pity. None the less, the committee recommended a statutory code with an adjudicator or ombudsman. It was envisaged that this office would not be created at any cost and that it would be contained within the merged entity which is now going to be called the competition and consumer protection commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> As Deputy Pringle noted earlier, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine had some concerns about the general thrust of this legislation, in particular the fact that everything was being done by regulation. We received a briefing from the officials - I thank the Minister and his officials for that briefing - and we are satisfied that this is, in fact, a stronger and more enforceable methodology to ensure that the objectives of the Bill are carried through.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> The Bill sets out that all relevant undertakings in the grocery food sector should be guided by regulation. The list is extensive although not exhaustive. The Minister and his officials made it clear that because the circumstances can move or be fluid, there was a necessity to ensure that the regulations could be nimble and that they could be amended easily to reflect any changes. The position is similar to when budget measures are introduced and people find loopholes. The recommendation was that a corresponding ability should be incorporated into the regulations and the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> I welcome that the formal contract must be in writing, as must the circumstances or reason why it is being terminated, varied or renewed. The circumstances under which a contract of a supplier of goods may be varied must be in writing. There are further arrangements regarding promotion of the grocery sector, including arrangements for the preparation of annual compliance reports in respect of these regulations by relevant grocery goods undertakings and the submission of the reports to the competition and consumer protection commission, CCPC, as well as provision for the maintenance of records relating to the compliance activities for the period for which those records are to be held. These are all welcome measures. They will ensure once the new commission is established, the legislation is passed and the regulations are signed that there will be powers of compellability and criminal sanction given to the new CCPC. This is important in spite of some of the protestations of the major multiples and Retail Ireland to the effect that this would add costs ultimately to the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> Last week, I attended another meeting to do with general practitioners in which a well-known media financial consultant said we were doing it all in the interests of saving €170,000, a rather unfortunate observation from someone who proclaims to be an expert. He suggested that we were simply going through the motions of merging two agencies to save €170,000. That is not the purpose. The individual decided that he would advocate that position in the full knowledge that few people in the room actually understood what was going on because they had their own issues to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Deputy Calleary and others referenced minimum pricing of alcohol. A working group is deliberating on the minimum price per unit of alcohol and this is to be welcomed. I suggest that the regulations should include a requirement that alcohol should not be used for marketing or promotion, whether it is below-cost or over-cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> Fully 80% of our groceries are sold through the big five multiples and probably a similar percentage of our alcohol off-licence sales are sold through the outlets with 80% of the market. Our off-licences which, in the main, do not sell anything else, account for the remaining 20%. There are also some sales in filling stations, etc. It seems that every weekend newspaper has pricing for various goods that are available in the following week in a given store. Invariably, there will be a price for various carry-out offers for alcohol, whether beer or wine. That is unfortunate because generally they are loss leaders. This should not be allowed in the interests of public health apart from anything else. This, combined with a minimum unit price for alcohol, would be effective and I am keen to hear the Minister's thinking on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> I welcome the fact that the Minister realises the regulations must be made quickly. Although there is a reference to May, I am satisfied that the intention is to bring them in as soon as possible. I understand they are being drafted at the moment. There are different scales. The regulations acknowledge the fact that there is a particular model of retailer, that is, the franchise holder. Some of the franchise holders are as big as some of the comparable stores but others are small, no bigger than the operators that RGDATA represents. Is it possible on Committee Stage or Report Stage to discuss a way of ensuring that these stores are not unduly burdened? I am referring to small operators, perhaps a single entity or stand-alone franchise operated on a small scale. Any support measures from the point of view of compliance to reflect the level of activity and turnover would be welcome. This is something we might usefully discuss.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> Deputy Calleary referred to the disclosure of profits. I understand there are various reasons relating to foreign direct investment why one would not be keen for multinationals to disclose their profits but there is a specific group to which this point applies. According to today's newspapers we should almost feel sorry for one of the biggest retailers in the world, whose profits went down from €3.5 billion to €3.3 billion. The company is paying out over 14 cent per share. Perhaps that could be used as the reason why we should not have stronger regulations. It would be helpful to know the extent of profits to level the playing pitch. Small suppliers and producers find it difficult to generate collective bargaining power and they have always had this problem. The new CAP will allow for the formation of co-operatives or producer groups. This is recognised not only at Irish level but at EU level and I am keen to hear the Minister's thoughts on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> I welcome the fact that the Bill deals with media mergers. It is high time that when media mergers are about to take place the parties notify the relevant Department. I welcome the fact that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will have a proactive part in this process.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Harrington<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_677">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill. I welcome the Minister's presence in the Chamber. I welcome the Bill as part of the Government's programme to reform State agencies and to merge those deemed suitable to be merged, leading to better value for the consumer and the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">However, it is important that we evaluate what the Bill will do for the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> Consumer protection is defined as a group of laws and organisations designed to ensure the rights of consumers, fair trade competition and the free flow of truthful information in the marketplace. The laws are designed to prevent businesses that engage in fraud or specified unfair practices from gaining an advantage over competitors. They may also provide additional protections for the weak and those unable to take care of themselves. Consumer protection laws are a form of Government regulation that aim to protect the rights of consumers. For example, a Government may require businesses to disclose detailed information about products, particularly where safety or public health is an issue, for example, in the case of food.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> Consumer protection is linked to the idea of consumer rights and to the formation of consumer organisations that help consumers to make better choices in the marketplace and to get help with their complaints. Our membership of the EU has improved much of our consumer protection legislation. This Bill has been in the ether for some time, having been announced in the 2009 budget. Since it is highly technical and detailed legislation, it has taken this long to be produced. It must be noted that different forms of competition legislation have evolved and matured.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> The Bill addresses three broad areas. First, it amalgamates two agencies. With few exceptions, this move has been met with broad approval from some of the key stakeholders involved in consumer protection and competition. I look forward to reading Mr. Eddie Hobbs’s book some day. It might be interesting, but he has misread this situation as a money-saving exercise. Rather, it is concerned with providing a better and more efficient regulatory competition regime and protection to consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> I welcome the Bill’s provisions under which the new commission will play an important role in co-operating with other regulatory authorities, for example, ComReg, the aviation regulatory authorities, the health insurance authorities and others, to provide better services for consumers and citizens and a level playing field for industry leaders and those trying to get involved in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> We already have various pieces of primary legislation. It has been well noted that we are reasonably quick to adapt primary legislation to address new pressures or issues arising in the marketplace that have adversely affected consumers, producers, industry etc. This Bill is a significant milestone in consumer and competition legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> Section 4 on media mergers is particularly important. The 50 jobs that will be lost in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> under Landmark Holdings should be noted. It is a difficult day for those involved, but it highlights one of the issues facing the print media in the modern age, namely, technology that puts the news at almost everyone’s fingertips. Media, particularly print media, is finding it difficult to evolve into something that allows it to maintain its relevance. The response to this challenge seems to be consolidations, acquisitions and mergers and less plurality of ownership and content. This matter must be addressed. We all have different opinions on it, but every Deputy has a significant interest in current affairs. We might believe everything stops and finishes at that. What is happening is not a new phenomenon, but it has gained pace in recent years and should give us cause for concern. We should reflect on how our society can be better served by a media that is more diverse in ownership, points of view, content etc. I am not just referring to public affairs, but also to the niche interests that many of our citizens have come to enjoy. Often, those interests are lost in media mergers and acquisitions and, perversely, people who look to the media for such content find that, in a world where there is better technology and access to information, the quality of that information is sometimes less than appreciated. We require balanced legislation to deal with media consolidations.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> I will focus on consumer protection. It is an issue that continuously comes to the fore in a myriad of industries. Deputy Doyle’s agriculture committee produced a fine report on the groceries order. This problem, which has arisen in the past year or two, is addressed in the Bill. I look forward to further discussions on how the consumer can be protected in the long term by provisions such as those outlined herein.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> Recently, a household pack of vegetables sold for 5, 6 or 8 cent or whatever the case may have been. While there are short-term gains for the consumer in such practices, they are unsustainable in the medium to long term. They will not work for the consumer. For the producer, they are a disaster. We must provide the new commission with the teeth to investigate how such behaviour affects the marketplace. I support open and fair competition in the marketplace irrespective of which industry is involved, but short-term gains of the type described can be detrimental to the producer, the retailer and the consumer in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> The new commission should investigate the difficulties being experienced by the on and off trades in the drinks industry in terms of the regulatory framework and consumer protection. There is much work to be done in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> As a result of this Bill, I look forward to having a greater level of public naming and shaming of market players who do not conform with the legislation when enacted. Across the water, there is considerable interest in consumer protection programmes on television. They make for riveting viewing and comprise a further element of consumer protection. Including a provision in the Bill on naming and shaming after its enactment would be attractive.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">I thank the Technical Group for allocating some of its speaking time to me to speak on this very important Bill. I also thank the Minister and his officials for bringing this major reforming legislation, with its three main objectives, before the House. The structure is modelled on that of the Competition Authority. I hope that when the legislation is passed by the Oireachtas the merging of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority will deliver improvements in competition and create a watchdog with real teeth. It is part of the broader reform agenda within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which will see the number of agencies reduced by 41 over the coming months. That should be welcomed as it will streamline the agencies by pulling them together and putting them into more workmanlike shape. That is how I view it and I hope it works out that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> With regard to the three main aspects of the Bill, I will focus on the regulation of certain practices in the grocery goods sector aimed at ensuring balance and fairness between the various players in the sector - the suppliers, retailers and consumers. This is very important. At this point it is only right that I declare what could be classified as an interest in that I am a grocer, albeit a small grocer in a small village. However, as a result of that job or role, I have seen how some of our larger retailers carry on. Some of their behaviour is often questionable. Deputy Harrington correctly referred to what happened a number of months ago in some of the larger retailers when they sold groceries at nonsensical prices. I was glad to join the members of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, when they left Leinster House and marched to a store not far from here. We went in and bought vegetables in the store at ridiculous prices. We brought them outside and gave them away to people. We did it to highlight in the media that what the retailers were doing was quite disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> The people that day were vegetable producers and many of them had come from the midlands and north Kerry. These people grow vegetables and incur the usual increased costs due to the times in which we are living, yet they were watching their absolutely perfect vegetables being sold for virtually nothing. The consumer might have thought they were winning on that day, but ultimately the consumer would lose. Where a system does not allow for a fair price to be paid to the person providing goods to a shop, it will not continue to work. People must receive an honest, fair reward for the goods they sow, produce and sell to shops, including these large retailers. The practice of "hello" money and many other shady practices have been carried out over the years by the large retailers. I would vehemently and wholeheartedly support anything the Minister can do to put checks and balances in place to prevent such behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> One hears about the promotions being conducted by the larger retailers but these can be laid bare and ultimately shown to be not in the interest of the consumer. I have seen that happen repeatedly. Retailers have engaged in price wars just to put other retailers out of business. When they have put the others out of business they ratchet up the price and, to be honest, screw the consumer. That is wrong and I hope this Bill will address it. It would be right and proper for that to happen, as it is increasingly difficult for smaller retailers to survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> With regard to a code of conduct in the grocery sector, be it statutory or voluntary, I would prefer something rock solid. It should not be a voluntary code but a statutory code that is put in place and seen to have teeth. That would be welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> The other matter dealt with by the Bill is the updating and modernising of the laws on the media to take account of international best practices and technological developments. We live in an ever-changing world. If one wishes to see what can happen as a result of modern media, it is fair and honest to point out that without modern media we would probably have a different President of Ireland, with all due respect to the current President and I acknowledge he is doing a great job. However, that is a fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> I listened earlier to Deputy Wallace's contribution. I wish to set the record straight on one matter. I am no fan of large media conglomerates but I believe it is fair to mention somebody's name, Denis O'Brien, because I am doing so in a positive way and the Deputy did so in a negative way. When I hear his name I do not think first of the wealth he has accumulated for himself but of the jobs he has created, both nationally and internationally. When a person is successful, an employer and a doer, I must admit I would support such a person. It is only right to bring some balance to the record of the Dáil today. While he was cast as somebody who might not be particularly great earlier, I have a different opinion and I am anxious to put that on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> That said, I am aware of what the Minister is doing. The man I mentioned, large as his operation might be, is operating within the law, and always will and always has done in his business dealings. However, it is only right that this Bill will ensure that we will not have a situation whereby one person would have undue influence over this country's affairs. We must have modern laws that will ensure we are operating at all times to best national and international practices. It is a very difficult job due to the speed with which the media operate. We have seen in the past how an issue that might not have been portrayed correctly can be released on media outlets in seconds. It could be a big story because it takes off so quickly, but much of the information in it might be incorrect. There is a lot to be said for when the media moved a little slower because when it moved slower, it had a better chance of being factual. However, that is not the world in which we are living today and there is nothing we can do about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> I support the Minister in trying to ensure that the media are governed in a proper way, while at the same time ensuring nothing is done to stifle them, as we do not want that either. What we want is fairness and transparency. We would also wish that the media would be fair to us. It would helpful if, rather than trying to spin things for much of the time, they would just report factually and not tell blatant lies about people, as has happened in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Hopefully in the world we are living in, where people are a bit more active about standing up for themselves, they might be curtailed on that in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> I welcome the Minister bringing the Bill before the House and I thank him and his officials who sometimes do not get thanked for the work they do, but whose role is very important. They put an awful lot of time and effort into bringing a Bill like this before the House. They are not in here today as they are in other offices elsewhere, and I would like to acknowledge their work because it is important that they are appreciated and that we thank them for their efforts.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">This is a major piece of reforming legislation. It has taken a long time to make it to the House and I am pleased to see it is finally here. I am particularly happy to see that the legislation will deal with the issue of ownership across the media, which is an essential part of a healthy democratic society. The legislation is in keeping with the advisory group in this area, which recommended that the legislation retains the basic model of current media legislation, which is based on the principle of avoiding intervention by government in media ownership except in specific circumstances following procedures determined by law.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> However, it is important to modernise these laws to reflect international best practice and in line with the latest technological developments. The legislation will implement in full, with two changes, the 11 recommendations of the advisory group on media mergers, which published the Sreenan report during the lifetime of the previous Government. The broad three-step process that currently exists in respect of media mergers will continue in existence in future. First, there will be a determination by the relevant regulatory authority that a merger has taken place. Second, there will be a decision by the relevant regulatory authority on whether the merger should be permitted to go ahead on competition grounds. Third, assuming the relevant regulatory authority has given the go-ahead, a decision will be made by the Minister on whether the merger should be permitted to go ahead on the grounds of the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> The recommendations of the Sreenan report include the findings that there should be a statutory definition of media plurality, referring both to ownership and content. In addition, the Competition Act 2002 should be amended to incorporate a statutory test to be applied by the Minister in the discharge of his or her function on media mergers and there should be an ongoing collection and periodic publication of information and employment of concrete indicators on media plurality in the State. I think this is very important. The ownership of the media organs active in the State needs to be monitored in order to detect when competition in the media sector might be lessened - or indeed strengthened - with transactions involving media businesses. There should also be a separate system of notification of media mergers made to the Minister for clearance, as well as an obligation imposed by statute on parties to a media merger to provide full information to the Minister on all circumstances which might impair media plurality in the State and to notify any changes in information provided to the Minister, with appropriate penalties for non-compliance. In the event of the Minister deciding to proceed to a detailed investigation of a proposed merger, a three to five person consultative panel should be established on a statutory basis to provide advice to the Minister on the media merger.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> I am also very pleased that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is taking on these responsibilities from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as I feel that the former Department is a better fit. As a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources I will be doing all I can to assist in the passing of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> There is no provision for an ongoing regulatory function in respect of media ownership, nor did the Sreenan report recommend it. The power is only exercised in the event that a merger takes place as defined, and that merger is permitted to proceed on competition grounds. The key concept in the definition of a merger remains the concept of "effective control", and no changes are recommended or provided for in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> The law makes two changes to the recommendations of the Sreenan report: first, that the relevant joint Oireachtas committee will become a notifiable body and second, that the legislation will transfer responsibility for media mergers from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The definition of "media business" should be amended to include publication of newspapers and periodicals on the Internet and the broadcasting of certain audiovisual material on the Internet. One of the other purposes of the Bill is to strengthen the enforcement of competition law in Ireland by setting up the competition and consumer protection commission. Competition offences are serious white-collar crimes and they must be tackled effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> A suite of additional enforcement powers had already been provided to the Competition Authority in 2012 under the Competition (Amendment) Act 2012 and additional staff were also allocated to it to strengthen competition law enforcement in the context of the EU-IMF financial programme for Ireland. The Bill gives additional powers to the new competition and consumer protection commission by extending the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 and the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 to serious competition law offences. In addition, some elements of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 related to the use of the taped evidence at witness interviews have been incorporated into the powers of the new competition and consumer protection commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> The Bill also contains provisions to regulate particular commercial relationships between grocery businesses, such as large retailers, suppliers and wholesalers, and related undertakings such as franchises. The Bill provides that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will have powers to make regulations in respect of certain aspects of the commercial relationships between relevant grocery goods undertakings, and specifies those matters on which the Minister may make such regulations. The regulations will affect relationships between relevant grocery goods undertakings and other grocery goods undertakings. Regulations will only apply to contracts entered into or renewed on or after their date of entry into operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> I commend the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_363">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_713">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this Bill. When I was at the Cabinet, it would not be unfair to say that I was a strong advocate of the Bill. That is because I was chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation which prepared the first comprehensive report on the issue in March 2010, which examined the supplier-retail relationships in the Irish grocery market. That report identified serious irregularities in the market, which it recommended the then Government act to eliminate. It provided a very strong case for the introduction of a statutory code of practice and the appointment of an ombudsman to oversee its implementation and the strict adherence to its terms by all the participants. We indicated at the time that such a code of conduct should facilitate the maximum level of transparency and oblige suppliers and retailers to publish data, including their profit margins. We heard a researcher who went incognito to interview people, because there was a genuine fear that people would be delisted and so on. That was an excellent committee and it produced an excellent report, with seven very strong recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> This Bill is complex and is technical in nature but it is a long time in gestation. The dissolution of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency and the establishment of the consumer and competition protection commission has been long awaited. It was promised in the programme for Government as part of the elimination and streamlining of quangos, although the amount of money saved from this amalgamation would not set the place on fire. Nevertheless, it is a move in the right direction. I hope that this new body will be a strong and independent watchdog in carrying out its diverse functions, such as enforcement, investigations and even termination. It needs to be properly resourced to be effective in ensuring that the voice of the consumer in particular areas is heard and protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> I also hope that this new rationalised quango will not do what many quangos do. Very often the first thing quangos do when they are set up is to focus on medium sized businesses, which is the line of least resistance. While there are financial parameters involved from a turnover perspective, the commission should not just focus on that when dealing with consumer protection. The State is often one of the big suppliers of services and it should be the first port of call in ensuring that consumers are not getting fleeced. The setting up of Irish Water must be focused in this context where the interests of the consumer should be paramount, and these should be accommodated in this Bill. Irish Water should ensure that the consumer interest is being protected and it should not become a monolith that can do what it likes.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">It is important that there be some constraints brought into play regarding that organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> The savings achieved from the formation of the new body are estimated to be €170,000, which is minimal in this context. One of the main objectives of the Bill is to strengthen the enforcement of competition law by enhancing the powers of the CCPC, which are focused on competition offences that are serious and regarded as white-collar crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> I am aware that significant enforcement powers are already available to the Competition Authority under the Competition (Amendment) Act 2012. This Bill strengthens those and gives additional powers to the new CCPC by extending the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 and the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 to serious competition offences. I assume these will all pass muster in the context of our constitutional provisions and the emergence of new jurisprudence in this area at EU level and globally. </p>
          <p eId="para_719"> The Minister will recall that I raised the issue of media mergers in the Dáil by way of a number of parliamentary questions and Topical Issues, to which he responded on a number of occasions. It is now more than five years since the advisory group on media mergers, under Mr. Paul Sreenan, SC, published a report. It contained 11 significant recommendations. I requested that these be implemented by way of primary legislation and that the Minister should, if necessary, sever the legislation because, as far as I was concerned, it was too slow emerging. There seemed to have been an unnecessary delay. I did so with a view to ensuring the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources would become the repository of the public interest aspect. The Bill includes the change, which differs from the advisory group's recommendations, but this is sensible and correct in that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has seisin of the key areas of media broadcasting in the digital area. The issue of dealing with the question of plurality, from the perspectives of both ownership and content, is critical. I particularly welcome the proposal to designate the relevant joint Oireachtas committee as a notifiable body when considering proposed media mergers from the public interest aspect. This CCPC will examine the proposed media mergers solely from the competition perspective, while the public interest test and the final decision rest with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. This allows for more consistency and effectiveness, and I applaud that. It signifies a clear division of responsibility and is in full compliance with the advisory group's central recommendation in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> There is a comprehensive set of definitions incorporating a detailed list of relevant criteria that should be taken into account in the context of determining the public interest in the consultation process. These are voluminous and comprehensive and they reflect where the public interest lies, which is important in the context of media monopolies. I do not like media monopolies. A big problem in Ireland is that many of the newspapers are either at the centre of the political spectrum or are right-wing, economically and otherwise. There is no newspaper, or very few, propagating an alternative view. While citizens can have some very good ideas in this country, it is very hard for them to find a forum in which to air them because they do not fit in with the prevalent orthodox thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> I am particularly interested in the grocery goods provisions, and in particular the attempt to regulate particular commercial relationships and specify the time at which the Minister can make such regulations. I approach this aspect of the Bill with some form because I chaired the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which published a report on supplier relationships in the Irish grocery market in March 2010. We put significant effort into compiling the report, including by way of commissioning necessary research involving a number of grocery suppliers. Based on informal information gathered from suppliers in the State, there was good reason for concern that unfair practices were occurring in the Irish grocery market. There was no doubt about that in the context of the research and it is set out in our executive summary. I recall that we were eager to ascertain from various businesses the types of payments they were requested to make to retailers. The wide range of responses was illuminating. Payments were made to list products, and continual payments were made for their ongoing listing. There was a rebate per unit of items not sold by the retailer, and there was promotion investment and marketing contributions. The businesses regarded these types of payments as comprising a euphemism for "hello money". There were payments for retendering and rebates to the retailer, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> Chapter 5 of the report was illustrative and illuminating in so far as it clearly highlighted the disproportionate market power that large retailers retain in the Irish retail market and the disadvantages that this causes for suppliers and other retailers when seeking to conduct their business. I refer to the imposition of unfair conditions on suppliers. This has to be rooted out to bring about some sort of level playing field.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> A follow-up report was prepared and published in October 2013 by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the chairmanship of Deputy Andrew Doyle, who spoke earlier. I am a member of that committee. The report was titled, Report on the Grocery Goods Sector: Increasing equity and transparency in producer–processor–retailer relationships. It is clear that primary producers were suffering and being squeezed out of the market. The committee made 13 key recommendations, some of which we hope have influenced the Minister's deliberations on this Bill. We trust the Minister might be open to appropriate amendments to incorporate some of the recommendations that are not reflected in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> We recall the spectacle at Christmas of horticultural produce virtually being given away, at prices of 9 cent and 10 cent per packet. One would not even buy a millilitre of oil for the farmers' horticultural machines for this. This cannot be deemed acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> We need to protect small rural shops because they are being wiped out. There is no competition at all and they are being gobbled up by the large multiples. According to traditional Darwinian theory, the strong will always survive and gobble up the weak and eventually wipe them out. In large tracts of rural Ireland we will not have one shop. An example is the area between Mullingar and Longford. Within the next three to five years, there will not be one rural shop there. Everyone believes the big supermarkets are great and they are going to them to shop but at 9 p.m. there will not be any supermarket in the local village to cater for the person living two miles away who is short of a pint of milk or loaf of bread. Very often, one is better off paying the 2 cent extra to have a service that will not be made available by the multiples. I often say this to consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> In England, the corner shops were wiped out but now there is an effort to return to them. When our shops are wiped out, there will be an oligopoly, with a branch of one big supermarket chain in each town. The chains will be able to coexist because if there is a branch of one in one town, there will be a branch of another in the next. They will get on. The only people who will be wiped out will be the small people at the bottom of the food chain.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> We need more transparency with regard to profits made by multiples in Ireland. This would require legislation. I understand that this might prove problematic in terms of the rules governing foreign direct investment, on which the Minister is working. The representatives of the multiples will not appear before a committee of this House. Transparency would result in the throwing of some light on the actual cost of doing business in Ireland. Businessmen are always referring to the higher cost of doing business here. Transparency would show whether the often-vented mantra that it is more costly to do business here is justified. I hope the regulations, which are complemented by new investigation and enforcement powers, achieve a level playing pitch between suppliers and retailers in the grocery goods market.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> The introduction of regulations with statutory underpinning will probably be stronger than the code of practice and conduct we advocated and could be subject to quick legislative change and intervention to cater for eventualities or outcomes that were not or could not be anticipated. Therefore, it allows for greater flexibility. I know where the Minister is coming from in that regard. That is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> The Minister will liaise with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in formulating the appropriate regulations. I always like to see regulations but, when being introduced, they should always be subject to the views of the House so they can be amended, if necessary. This is important. I hate the idea of secondary legislation being brought forward and rushed through. In such cases Members are regarded as not having any ability at all to make change. In the making of regulations the Parliament should not be sidelined.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> It should never be forgotten that the primary producer, who is essential to the food chain, is also the most vulnerable, very often producing a product that is perishable and with a limited shelf life. That must be reflected in the regulatory framework. Equality in bargaining power should be the central objective. It is important that the imbalance of power in the food chain between the producer, supermarket and supplier be redressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> One of the concerns raised at the agriculture committee is that any enforceable or statutory code, such as is being introduced under this Bill, should work in harmony with EU law. If a new code is introduced in isolation, there is a danger that Ireland could lose its competitive advantage, possibly leading to a distortion of trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> With regard to freedom of negotiation, I note that section 4 of the Competition Act deals with representative organisations, for example, those representing pharmacies, GPs and the actors body, Irish Equity. This is something I also had a particular interest in when I was Chairman of the committee. Indeed, our President was somebody who advocated this very strongly. Those organisations were precluded by domestic competition law from representing the interests of their membership. When in opposition, I was vociferous in calling for this legislation to be amended to reflect the situation that prevails on the ground, so people could advocate and represent their interests, for example, actors and GPs, although I will not comment on the current situation except to say that we can see that everybody is circling but just cannot come to the point of getting some sort of deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> I am aware that aspects of this have been subject to court action and I do not want to interfere in that. However, there may be an outcome in terms of judicial determination that might be helpful in the context of this Bill. I hope appropriate amendments will be made to the original Act to accomplish this objective, which is important. I look forward to the rest of the debate. The Minister is to be complimented on bringing forward the legislation at this time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_736">I listened with interest this morning to the contributions from the various speakers on all sides of the House. I have to say I really enjoyed it. They say that when people spend long enough in this House, they see Members coming in here contradicting what they said many years before. I heard many of the contributions here today and I thoroughly enjoyed them from the point of view of the way attitudes have changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> I remember when this issue in regard to the groceries order was first being debated in this House. At the time, we had the Competition Authority pushing the agenda to abolish the groceries order, with Mr. John Fingleton heading it up and campaigning vigorously that the groceries order was anti-competitive and anti-consumer, and this was endorsed by the National Consumer Agency at the time. Mr. Fingleton succeeded in convincing the Minister of the day, Deputy Micheál Martin, to abolish the groceries order. Within a few short weeks, Mr. Fingleton had left us and had gone to a similar job in the United Kingdom, and was vigorously arguing the exact opposite, namely, that there was a need to introduce a groceries order in the UK because he had seen the decimation that had been created by the abolition of the very same type of law in the UK. Things come around very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> It is frustrating to see what has happened. We are now trying to clean up a mess that was created in 2005 with the abolition rather than the amendment of the groceries order. This Bill, in some small way, begins to deal with that but, sadly, the issue of alcohol and alcohol abuse, including its gross abuse through its use as a loss leader and the below-cost selling of alcohol, an issue that was highlighted at the time of the introduction of the legislation, is not being addressed in this law. We will have a report in June and there will be more navel gazing in regard to it. In the interim, however, we have the gross abuse of alcohol, which is freely and cheaply available, and is cheaper in some instances than a bottle of water or a litre of milk.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> After the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act 2005, we saw very quickly that food prices were not reducing. In fact, if one looks at the EUROSTAT figures, food is still comparatively expensive in Ireland compared to other parts of Europe, so we have not succeeded in reducing food prices. Even some of the big players in the food sector, such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Nestlé and Unilever, themselves complain about the dominance of the supermarkets, which is dictating the price they receive. They are the big players. What chance has a small producer, particularly in regard to non-branded goods such as perishable food products, when the big players in the industry feel they are being limited and restricted in regard to getting a fair price for their products?</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> We have a particular challenge for food producers in this country. The litmus test in regard to this legislation will be whether it ensures that primary producers get a fair return at the farm gate for their food product, one that covers the cost of production, leaves them with a basic margin and rewards them for the work and investment they are putting into producing the product. That will be the litmus test. This is not something that has come to the fore in recent times. I recall that in 2005 I published a food comparison in regard to the farm gate prices versus the supermarket shelf prices of food, and I published those figures again in 2006 and in 2007. Consistently, over that period, this showed a more than 200% mark-up from a farm gate price to the supermarket shelf price of basic foodstuffs. Taking a basic basket of goods which was costing the consumer €31, the farmer was getting just €13. Of course, the supermarkets were saying they did not have control over processing. I would like to know how much processing is involved in taking a head of cauliflower from north County Dublin and bringing it to a supermarket shelf in Dublin city centre, yet there was a 210% mark-up. The farmer was getting 50 cent while the retailer was charging €1.55 for that head of cauliflower at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> We saw what happened before Christmas in regard to Brussels sprouts, potatoes and carrots that were being sold at 5 cent. We were told below-cost selling of basic foodstuffs like that was illegal under the Competition Acts and that it could not happen, yet this went on under our noses and nothing seemed to be done about it. Interestingly, Agri Aware, through Ipsos MRBI, carried out a survey of consumers. Nine out of ten members of the public in this country felt that legislation should be introduced to give a fair price to farmers for foodstuffs, and seven out of ten believed that below-cost selling of vegetables was not to the long-term benefit of the consumer. We can see from the markup on fresh food produce that consumers are losing out in this regard. Consumers need to know why there is such a mark-up and farmers need to know why they are not getting a basic return for the work and effort they are putting into producing the product in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> The Minister in his earlier contribution said he was going to sit down, along with his officials, with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to draft a statutory code. That is not good enough. We need to see that statutory code and we want to see the colour of the Minister's money in regard to that statutory code. This legislation has been long enough coming - it has been promised and promised. I believe that, at the very least, in tandem with the publication of this legislation, the Minister should have been in a position to publish a draft of that proposed statutory code. I will be proposing that an amendment should be included in this legislation that will ensure that statutory code is, at a very minimum, adopted within six months and gets the formal approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas so that Members of this House can see that secondary legislation, have it debated and ensure it deals adequately with all of the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> These include issues such as hello money. Even though in theory this is banned under the current law, in practice it is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">As the Minister knows, in 2009, Deputy Creed highlighted the fact that individual food suppliers were paying €1 million per annum in hello money to retailers to get prime shelf space in supermarkets. He went on to say that ten companies were forced to pay €30 million during a four-month period to access secure shelf space in supermarkets. That practice is continuing today even though the Consumer Acts prohibit it. This is because the Acts put the onus on the supplier to initiate court action when the supplier is not in a position to do this because of the stranglehold the retailer holds. I would like to see amendments to the primary legislation - it is written in black and white here - to ensure that the food producers and processors are protected when selling their food products into supermarkets and that practices such as the use of hello money are abolished once and for all. </p>
          <p eId="para_745"> The final issue I wish to raise with the Minister is one I raised last week. I thank him for the reply I received on foot of my question on the Order of Business. As he knows, the issue I had was a far broader one, namely, competition law and access to markets across EU borders. Sadly, nothing is being done about this. I know the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is holding a summit on the beef sector tomorrow. Hopefully, we can see some progress in respect of that. An analysis carried out recently by the farming section of the <i>Irish Independent</i> showed that Irish beef producers are experiencing price declines that are up to six times greater than those faced by their EU counterparts over the past 12 months. This is equivalent to a €200 per head loss or reduction in prices for beef farmers in this country. </p>
          <p eId="para_746"> The beef sector is an integral part of the agrifood sector in this country and is worth €2 billion per annum to the economy. However, the industry has been decimated over the past 12 months, particularly in respect of the collapse of bull beef prices which is having a direct impact on farmers' livelihoods. There is a significant price differential between here, Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Not only do we have a price differential, but we have a situation where some factories north of the Border and in the UK are refusing to kill cattle born in the Republic of Ireland. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Bia need to engage directly with their counterparts in Northern Ireland and Great Britain as well as the major retailers and processing groups to take these artificial and anti-competitive barriers out of the system. I raised this issue here today is because the retailers and major processors about which I am talking are operating in this jurisdiction, Northern Ireland and Great Britain. They have different rules depending on where those cattle are born. Factories are applying an uneconomic 400 kg weight limit on stock here yet the same meat company dealing with the same retailers into the same market is operating a 450 kg limit in other jurisdictions. This is making it virtually impossible for Irish farmers to produce product to go into those markets. It is not just those particular specifications. It happens with specifications such as the final residency period for animals. It is 70 days for Irish cattle but in some of their counterparts' requirements, it is down as far as zero and all for beef that is going into the UK market. Not only is it anti-competitive, it is manipulating the trade and pricing and profiteering on Irish beef and British consumers. </p>
          <p eId="para_747"> We have a bizarre situation where we can export live cattle on the hoof to Benghazi in north Africa yet we cannot export those same cattle to Belfast or Birmingham. There is something fundamentally wrong with a system that allows such a situation to arise. We have EU labelling laws that specifically provide for that, we have no problem with live trade from Ireland to other jurisdictions and this issue does not arise with the live trade across the borders between Spain, France and Italy and yet we cannot bring live cattle from this country across the Border to Belfast and have them slaughtered north of the Border. There is something fundamentally wrong and it needs to be immediately addressed because it is undermining the livelihoods of Irish beef farmers. </p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_748">I thank Deputy Naughten for giving me some of his time at short notice. The Bill is an omnibus Bill. Rather than going into the anatomy of the Bill, I will look at the overview. There are more than 70 new Members of this 31st Dáil. This is territory that the experienced and longer serving Deputies will have been familiarised with over the years. It is an omnibus Bill that addresses three main areas; the amalgamation of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority; the changes to competition and consumer law, including making provision for the regulation of the grocery goods sector; and the recommendations of the advisory group on media mergers. That is a really broad spectrum. To be able to get an authoritative handle on that would require a huge amount of focused time.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> It is very important to take up the themes of experienced contributors here such as the points made by Deputies Naughten and Penrose. Deputy Penrose spoke about the disappearance of the corner shop. This affects not just the village shop, but shops in smaller towns which are being displaced by large supermarkets - from the corner shop as we call it in English to the carrefour as the French call it, which is the crossroads scale of doing business. </p>
          <p eId="para_750"> We need to be careful about the opportunities for the production of the consumer goods we consume - the farmer, producer, grower and so on. If we allow the power of the multinational-scale operators to dictate what goes on in the marketplace, we will lose that sense of innovation and creativity. There are levers that can be used quite apart from the usual regulatory ones. We could target taxation at the larger multiples and have a differentiated corporate taxation arrangement and a relief taxation or compensating arrangement for sole traders or smaller producers who have been conducting business effectively and honourably for a minimum number of years. It is a different way of looking at things and I invite the Minister and his officials to look more closely at it. </p>
          <p eId="para_751">Loss leaders, below cost selling and the alcohol problem must be addressed. It is not good enough to just tinker at the edges and look at the algebra of what has happened in the past and what can be done about it. There is a physical challenge, which is to get the stuff out of the reach of people who should not be consuming it and work towards that. We need to work out how we can do that in terms of pricing or physical obstacles to obtaining it. We must work from simplified first principles rather than looking at the labyrinth of rules, regulations, papers and articles that exist at the moment. We need to clean the blackboard, start from first principles and simplify.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> I believe the framing of this Bill is a bit unfair. It is called the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill but that is not what it is. Its constituent elements are highly complex, convoluted and labyrinthine. Maybe the Bill should have been produced in three parts so that we would have an idea of what level of investigation and consideration needed to be applied. An omnibus approach is not ideal. We are all in favour of consumer protection but this Bill is not really framed honestly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Helen McEntee<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_753">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for bringing it forward. It has been long awaited for many different reasons. I wish to focus my contribution on the agricultural sector and the smaller producers in particular, that is, those growing fruit and vegetables and selling them on to the larger multinational corporations. I met with many such producers in recent times and before I was elected and they raised the issue of below cost selling in the sector and the fact that there is not a fair balance among all of the stakeholders and players on the field. This has been apparent for a long time and has resulted in many smaller producers being unable to sustain their businesses. We must deal with that. I know that I am always blowing the trumpet for County Meath, but we have a fantastic reputation for the quality of our food and local produce and for our people. I would hate to see a fantastic industry and tradition disappear because we took our eye of the ball for a split second, because that is all it takes. Something must be done and this Bill, without a doubt, is a good start and I thank the Minister for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> The legislation deals with a number of different issues but I particularly welcome the section that focuses on grocery goods. We need to regulate certain codes of practice in the sector. We need to do that in order to strike a good balance and to ensure fairness between the different stakeholders, including suppliers, retailers and consumers. We need to give consumers some credit in terms of what they are buying and where they are buying it. Most people that I speak to want fresh, local, Irish produce and are often prepared to pay that little bit more to keep it Irish, to ensure that they get what they want and that their neighbours do not go out of business. It is unfortunate that we need to introduce regulations in this area but needs must. I welcome the Bill and anything that protects the interests of smaller farmers. I know that initially there was talk of a code of conduct but I believe that statutory regulation is what is needed and I am delighted that this is the route the Minister has taken. Codes of conduct are more often than not ignored so we need to ensure that the legislation is effective and is adhered to. The regulations will have full legislative force and will be enforceable by law in the context of the issues covered by them. </p>
          <p eId="para_755"> An issue that was raised with me by many people on the ground was the need for an ombudsman to oversee things. I spoke to the Minister about this and believe we should keep it in mind and not dismiss it out of hand. Hopefully the merging of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority will create a strong oversight body that will do the work of an ombudsman. However, we will have to see how that works in practice. We must make sure that it is completely independent and that people feel they can make a complaint without facing repercussions elsewhere. People need to feel that they are completely protected and I hope that is what we will see. </p>
          <p eId="para_756"> When it comes to the regulations, there are many issues covered in the Bill which I welcome but it would be important to see more information on these regulations before they go into the legislation itself. I am sure the Minister would agree that this is legislation from which we can work and which we can build on and strengthen over time, according to what works and what does not. There are two specific issues about which I am concerned, the first being the requirement for a company to have an annual worldwide turnover of €50 million in order to enter into the contract. That it is fine for the small grower who deals directly with the likes of Tesco, Aldi or Lidl, all of which have a turnover of over €50 million every year, but it is problematic for those who sell their produce to a middleman or a distribution company which does not have a turnover of €50 million annually. Perhaps we could examine the possibility of reducing the threshold of €50 million. The second issue is retention of title which is not addressed in the Bill. This is a problem that many farmers and suppliers have to deal with when a company goes bust. By right, the goods should still belong to the farmer or producer until money has changed hands. We need to do something to protect the smaller farmer.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> Much of what is contained in the Bill is a step in the right direction. I welcome the legislation, although I think it could possibly go a bit further. Having said that, I know the Minister is open to change and debate, which I also welcome.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinHeydon" eId="spk_369">
          <from>Deputy Martin Heydon<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_758">I thank the Minister for bringing this long-awaited Bill before the House. I understand the complexities involved in trying to bring together so many different facets of law. The Minister is charged here with achieving a very fine balancing act which seeks to ensure the best outcome for the consumer, while respecting the rights of primary producers and processors. It is important that pursuing the best for the consumer does not have unintended consequences, as can often happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I wish to focus on the grocery goods aspects of the legislation. I was heavily involved in the preparation of the aforementioned committee's report in October 2013, entitled Increasing Equity and Transparency in Producer, Processor and Retailer Relationships. The committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Andrew Doyle, put a significant amount of work into engaging with all of the key stakeholders and hearing their points of view. Some stakeholders were more giving of their time than others. On the large multiples side, unfortunately Dunnes Stores was unwilling to participate and discuss matters with the committee. However, we had a very robust debate with the other big multiples. In fairness, we listened to a lot of their concerns and issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> A couple of articles were published at the time of the publication of the committee's report, one of which referred to the committee as one which was "stuffed with Fine Gael farmers" and which was behind a new quango. That took a very specific view of our work. The underlying suggestion was that a Deputy coming from an agricultural background might not have the best interests of the consumer at heart. The author never outlined whether he had any links with the retailers or the multiples or whether his views were purely altruistic. As the committee chairman pointed out in response to that article, having farmers on an agricultural committee is not the worst crime in the world, no more than having teachers on an education committee or doctors on a health committee. Our background means that we would be very aware of some of the difficulties being experienced by primary producers.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> Such problems were clearly manifest before Christmas for fruit and vegetable producers. We saw primary producers being put under enormous pressure, with carrots and Brussels sprouts being sold for a few cent, far below the cost of production.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Those primary producers had to take the hit on that because of a price war. That kind of protection is required because otherwise such people will go out of business and will not be there to produce the food. Consumers need to realise that food is different from other commodities and that security of food supply cannot be taken for granted. My grandfather, Lord have mercy on him, always used to say: "When you're doing a deal with somebody there has to be something in it for all sides of the bargain." Everybody needs to come away with a little bit of something, but if one side is squeezed so much that there is nothing left for them, they might not be there to do the deal next year. </p>
          <p eId="para_763"> The horsemeat scandal highlighted an element of that to a point. A large retail multiple was selling six own-brand burgers in a box for €1.20, which is 20 cent each. That large multiple informed the large producer that it needed burgers for 8 cent each, which is what they would pay. If the processor did not provide that, the multiple would go elsewhere. The large multiple may have been surprised and shocked to find out afterwards that the burgers contained horsemeat. It may not have known that directly, but it must have known that it is not possible to produce a beef-burger for 8 cent. Therefore, the multiple had to know it, albeit inadvertently. We need to address that kind of issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_764"> The below-cost sale of drink as a loss-leader is a product of a previous drive that was supposed to be pro-consumer. In many respects, however, it turned out to be much more pro-retailer and has left us with a significant amount of difficulty. </p>
          <p eId="para_765"> I welcome a lot of what is in this Bill and I look forward to the detailed work that will happen on Committee Stage. I am disappointed there is no ombudsman as part of the legislation, but I accept the Minister's point about the costs involved and the risk of duplication. Nonetheless, we should keep a close eye on what is happening with the adjudicator's position in England which seems to be quite effective, although it is relatively new. As Deputy McEntee said, we should keep an open mind as to how these things will work out in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> To go back to our report, we want a fair balance between all three parts of the equation. The retailer must be able to make a margin, while the processor and primary producer are in a vulnerable position as price takers for their product, but they need a fair margin to survive. That is also in the consumers' interest in the long run. </p>
          <p eId="para_767"> I welcome the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority along with the extra powers being given to the new merged entity. I accept what the Minister said in his speech earlier, that prices will continue to be set by hard negotiations. Everybody wants to be able to do a fair deal and they do not mind hard negotiations once the deal on the table is agreed. The Bill provides a back-up so that everyone knows there will be implications for anti-competitive behaviour. Breaking competition law can have a significant impact on all consumers, although it may sometimes be hidden. Our national competitiveness, which ultimately leads to job creation, is well protected under these new measures. </p>
          <p eId="para_768"> I commend the Minister for his work in bringing this long-awaited Bill before the House. I look forward to see it progressing through the Oireachtas, as well as seeing how its various aspects will ensure a fairer system whereby everyone will be protected in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_769">I compliment the Minister for bringing forward this important legislation. Following on from the last speaker, I do not know where media commentators would place me on the spectrum, given that I am totally in favour of everything he said. I am not a Fine Gael farmer but I do advocate on behalf of the farming community who make up a large part of the economy in my constituency. I make no apologies for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> Both the media and farming organisations have commented favourably on the Bill. They have laid down a challenge to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to follow through on the legislation. I know the Minister's background and he is committed to ensuring that there is fairness and equity for primary producers. That has been well enunciated both in this House and elsewhere. </p>
          <p eId="para_771"> I know, as the Acting Chairman does, that poultry producers have suffered at the hands of such behaviour for a number of years. The poultry industry used to be a massive employer in my constituency. We had two processors outside Newcastle West which employed hundreds of people. At the time there was little or no protection in terms of labelling, consumer information or ensuring that the practices identified in this Bill were dealt with. Both processors went out of business within 12 months of each other. Luckily the producers are still there but they, no more than beef or milk producers, have major input costs, including gas, water and cleaning out poultry sheds. Yet the amount they are getting for their product has remained static. </p>
          <p eId="para_772"> Beef farmers are also concerned about their input costs and what they are getting for their product. They are producing an exceptionally high-end, quality product that is fully traceable. It is safe, the best in its class and beats everyone around the world, yet beef farmers feel that the price being paid for the product they are sending to factories is questionable. I encourage both the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to sit down with stakeholders in the beef industry to examine this as a matter of urgency. This is a major issue for the rural economy in my constituency and others around the country. The issue arises from falling prices versus rising input costs that producers are now expected to bear, in addition to the degree to which the product must be finished.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> I wish to declare a vested interest in one aspect of consumer protection that is not included in the Bill, which concerns rural pubs. One can currently buy a slab of beer and bottles of vodka in a supermarket as loss leaders at a knock-down price that is cheaper than water. We know there are health implications for young people and for society at large. However, there are also implications for publicans who really should be included in the terms of the Bill. I have a vested interest in this because I have family members who are publicans.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> It is frightening to see the number of pubs that have been lost across the country in recent years. If something does not happen soon we will not have to worry about the Scottish case that is being, or might be, taken in the European Court because there will be no pubs left at the rate they are disappearing. That is no exaggeration. Something will have to happen to stop this haemorrhage of people from rural pubs to a situation where they are drinking in an uncontrolled environment at home. We know about the societal damage and the health implications, so such measures are badly needed. </p>
          <p eId="para_775"> Getting back to the thrust of the Bill, any day when there is one State agency less than before is a good day. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is merging the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority into the new competition and consumer protection commission. When we came into Government we gave a commitment to the de-quangoisation of Ireland. Initially, a lot was done to reduce quangos but a lot more needs to be done. Some Government Departments are effective in de-quangoising but others need to do a lot more. Every effort needs to be done to achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> The main thrust of the Bill examines dominance. The Irish grocery sector is now dominated by three or four key players. Farming representatives and others have asked why those sectors are not required to publish annual accounts detailing the profits they make in Ireland. Why are they afraid to publish detailed information that would tell consumers and the authorities about the amount of profits involved? I implore the Minister to examine ways by which that can be done so that the playing field can be levelled both for Irish and non-Irish producers.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">From the consumer's point of view and for the parents of young children feeding a family, it is essential to get value for money. No one disputes that. I go back to one of the central points I made at the start. The consumer deserves to know what it is he or she is buying and where it was produced. At the moment, that is not the case. Labelling continues to be an issue whether in relation to chicken fillets or milk.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> On the issue of supermarket practices, I note that I worked for Proctor &amp; Gamble, a company referred to by previous speakers. The company had huge difficulties in relation to shelf space in supermarkets. If the likes of Proctor &amp; Gamble have difficulty securing shelf space, what hope would I have if I were a cauliflower producer from Balbriggan? If those practices can be addressed to facilitate a level playing field for producers, it must be a good thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Farming organisations, producers and commentators have welcomed the Bill. They have all thrown down a marker however. They are waiting to see what happens. The implications of the Bill are important. We cannot allow certain practices to continue <i>ad infinitum</i>. While the consumer will be in a better position when the Bill is enacted, I encourage the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to look at the beef sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> I also ask the Minister in his role as a member of the Cabinet to address the demise of the rural pub. The Bill will address in some ways the demise of the rural shop. I concur with the remarks of Deputy Willie Penrose in that regard. If we do not grasp the nettle in terms of the sale of alcohol, we will not have a rural pub infrastructure any more than we will have a rural shop infrastructure. I welcome the Bill and look forward to its implementation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_371">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_781">While I welcome the very belated publication of the Bill, some of the previous speakers have highlighted a whole lot of issues which remain unaddressed in the proposed legislation. The Minister has now been in Government for three years. The Bill was on the A list in autumn 2012. We are getting a Bill dealing with the relationship between suppliers and retailers which gives the Minister the power to make regulations. I wonder how many of the regulations will be made before the next election. I wonder if the Minister will publish the legislation and bring it to the House for detailed debate. If that is not done, we will not get something effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> Europe has made a god of competition. It considers that if it is competition, it is always good for the consumer. What Europe defines as "competition" is in many cases a free-for-all among small groups of very dominant players. Too much of anything, no matter how worthy in principle, always leads one to a bad space. We saw that in relation to the banks. The theory was that the banks would regulate themselves as they knew how to make money. It was thought that if there was outside competition, the banks would get it right and everyone would get money at a competitive rate. AIB, Bank of Ireland and others now justify the mess they made by arguing that they had to follow a small bank, which was Anglo Irish Bank. It is a simple example of the way the god of competition across the world led to major difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Regarding retailers, particularly the multiples, the first thing to take into account is the fact that five major companies - Musgrave, Tesco, Aldi, Lidl and Dunnes - control the bulk of the Irish retail market. These are very powerful purchasing groups. The second thing we must get into our heads is a bit of joined-up thinking. We are always in favour of more expenditure and free this and free that, forgetting that the money must come from somewhere. We always talk about cheaper prices for consumers, but we must be clear about who will ultimately bear the burden of cheaper prices and what the broader price will be. Our economy depends to a very great extent on the food industry. It is vital to the well-being of the country in terms of economic activity and Exchequer funding. So much of what we earn as our net international earnings comes from agriculture and the agrifood industry. If we talk about cheaper prices for consumers while decimating an industry employing 300,000 people, are we really solving any problems and obtaining a price advantage? Are we in fact taking the money from the very consumers we intend to help by making the economy less robust? Will we end up having to put more money into the CAP to ensure the survival of the family farm? Are we, as a society, of the view that a factory farm approach in Ireland would be better than the structure we have with all the consequences a change would mean for the environment, rural communities and society at large? We must lead a debate in which all of the angles of every decision we make is understood.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> We must recognise that the major multiples do not act in the interests of the consumer. If they did, they would not sell alcohol below cost. Many Members have pointed that out today. The multiples know it is not good for the consumer to buy vast quantities of alcohol while skimping on food and other essentials. They do it because it is profitable and provides them with the leverage to attract customers who then buy other things. If the multiples were altruistic, would they always have the sweet counter up beside the checkout to get the loose change from one's pocket when the children want the sweets? This is a country which has a major problem with obesity. Supermarkets are there to make money and for them it is all about the bottom line. We found out when we dealt with this in the joint committee that the major problem we face is that we do not know what supermarkets make in Ireland. We know that prices are higher here, but we do not know how much money is being made. Supermarkets make vague statements about higher overheads, but that cannot be the cost of bringing the goods in. Prices in the North of Ireland are not the island of Ireland prices, they are the UK prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> I want to talk about what happens in reality. It is something the Bill will do very little to address. The joint committee looked at the liquid milk situation in great detail. Ireland has a national milk agency which is made up of different parties and is a Government-sponsored body. Its job is to ensure there is fresh milk on shelves 52 weeks of the year. The agency produced a great many statistics to the committee which gave lie to the idea that if the price to the farmer is reduced, the consumer gains. According to the agency, while the price of milk is not much different from its price in 1995, the farmer gets 11% less for every litre than he or she did nearly 20 years ago. In other words, farmers used to get 43% but now they get 32%. In simple terms, that represents €45,000 for a 100 cow farmer producing 5,000 litres per cow.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">It is a huge amount of money and shows when they squeezed the liquid milk producers in the State, as we know they did, the ultimate beneficiary was not the consumer but somebody in the middle. We have considerable knowledge on how much the processor takes out of it because some instances involved co-ops which are farmer owned. We know they are not the location of the big rise in costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> On 30 March 2014 a Sunday newspaper contained the type of advertisement to which one would not pay too much heed in the normal course of events. A certain major multinational retailer in the State made a promise to keep the price of a punnet of strawberries at €1.99, of tomatoes at €1.79 and of blueberries at €2.69 for the next 12 weeks. One might think bully for them and that is great for the consumer but before we all rush to clap them is it not curious this was done just as we came into the Irish season, when Irish producers put these materials on the supermarket shelves? If the Minister carries out an investigation he will find these are not economic prices for Irish producers to produce these goods. I wonder whether the supermarket suddenly lost money on these products or whether it put pressure on producers to reduce their prices to uneconomic levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> For good reasons the people involved in the industry are reticent to speak about what is going on for fear of retribution. One might presume a benign scenario in the price promise case I have detailed, but we know what happened at Christmas, which not only affected primary producers at the one time of the year they hoped to make a few bob but it also put ordinary greengrocers who are not part of the multiple set-up at a total disadvantage at a time of the year they were trying to make a few bob. These people can do this one year and need never do it again as they can destroy with one stroke. I am interested to hear whether anything in the Bill will stop this type of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> We have spent the past three months looking at the issue of beef, bull beef, steer beef and every other type of beef but many valid questions have not been answered. It is fair to state some of our problems have arisen because of the horsemeat scandal of last year as there is much greater inspection in the factories by multinational retailers with regard to what they get, and rightly so. To blame processors or somebody in the supply chain for putting in the horsemeat is a little disingenuous and simplistic. I have no doubt part of the temptation was the ever-present downward pressure on prices on those competing to remain listed on the supermarket shelves. Of course people should not cheat but this does not mean one should not look at the pressures they face which drive them to cheating. We have many unanswered questions and I am afraid we will not receive composite answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> Something which greatly annoys me is that if a band of farmers, such as liquid milk producers, come together to try to level the playing pitch against these enormous organisations the Competition Authority will be on their backs suing them for forming a cartel. I understand the new CAP will have provisions to allow producer groups a structure to defend the interests of the smallest weakest parties involved in the chain, but when I asked the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the details I was told there were many difficulties with it and the Department could not indicate to me what a producer group will be allowed to do. As far as I am concerned unless the producer group is allowed to act on behalf of farmers in a concerted way, and people at primary production level are allowed join together, the completely unequal relationship which exists at present will continue. If anybody thinks this unequal relationship is a good idea I ask them to consider what will happen if some day we end up in a country which produces no potatoes, no vegetables and no liquid milk and we import liquid milk onto the island of Ireland. It involves very specialist production. Perhaps we will import it in midwinter.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> The Minister shied away from the idea of a statutory code and instead he will be able to make regulations. Will he give us detailed indications on which of the provisions in the Bill he intends to use to make regulations? They are specific. Will he confirm whether he has instructed the officials to start drafting these regulations in anticipation of the Bill passing through both Houses of the Oireachtas? Will he give us an indication as to whether, prior to the regulations being laid formally before the House, he will allow and facilitate the draft regulations being brought to the appropriate committee? I suggest this would be a joint sub-committee involving the committee dealing with the Minister's Department and the committee dealing with agriculture. This would allow us to examine the draft regulations. When is it hoped to have whatever regulations the Minister intends to introduce signed into law?</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> I am not against the idea of using regulations because they give the Minister a set to which he can keep adding, so long as the general provision in the Act is wide enough. This is something we must consider when the Bill is going through the House. The use of regulations will allow for easier amendment. I do not believe the regulations in themselves will deal with the fundamental concern I have, which is not about defending the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble or Nestlé against a supermarket because I am sure they can have an equal battle and can slug it out on equal terms. They are not where the problem lies. We know where it is. Protecting our agriculture industry against predatory practices, which are happening, and protecting small manufacturers and artisan foods against predatory practices would not have any significant effect on the consumer price index. It would be possible for the supermarkets to absorb it if they had a mind not to abuse such products in their pricing policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> I am curious about an aspect of the Bill and I ask the Minister to explain it. If one of the big five supermarkets breaks the regulations it will face a summary fine of €3,000 and €5,000 for a second offence, or a fine of €60,000 on indictment and €100,000 for a second offence. I am sure they are trembling at the thought they might be fined these amounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">I am sure they are being kept awake at night wondering how they will come up with the money to pay that kind of fine if they are prosecuted.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> It is interesting that the Minister said he might name some of the companies we are dealing with. We have named Dunnes Stores time and again. One of my colleagues did so again during this debate. In my view, Dunnes Stores showed total discourtesy to the Oireachtas, which is elected by the people, when it refused to take up an invitation to address the joint committee. In fairness to the Musgrave Group, RGDATA, Tesco, Aldi and Lidl, they all came in. Dunnes Stores decided to say to the elected people: "We do not answer to you; we do not turn up." I would not mind but it is an Irish company. It is amazing that the media, which got very excited when one individual - Angela Kerins - failed to turn up at a committee meeting, for some reason did not show any interest in the fact that a company which has a great deal of influence over people's lives did not turn up in this case. Even though Dunnes Stores has much more influence over people's lives than Rehab, its failure to turn up does not seem to have been worthy of media comment. That is why I believe the threat to name and shame organisations under this legislation is unlikely to faze some of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> I do not envisage that many prosecutions will be taken unless the proposed competition and consumer protection commission takes prosecutions off its own bat. One is told time and again by people involved in this sector that they are unwilling to speak on the record about what is happening because they are afraid of being delisted by the five big players. They will do no more than give an indication of what is happening, or they will get a third party to do so, because they know their goose is cooked if they are delisted by the five big players. They will be liquidated and will go out of business. Despite the proposed regulations, the way this is set up leads me to expect that not many complaints will be made. Too many people will be afraid to make complaints because they will be worried that to do so would cause their situations to go from bad to absolutely worse. Therefore, I am not yet convinced that we have dealt with this whole issue. I believe the EU has to take a leading role in this regard. The total reform of this whole relationship that is needed should be led at EU level. This is bigger than any state. Some of these supermarkets are much bigger than some states. Unless this imbalance is tackled at EU level, European farming will require more and more subsidies to survive.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">I thank the many Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Bill. Some of them feel there is not enough in it. Deputy Mathews has suggested that there might be too much in it and that some parts of it could have been separated out.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_799">In an ideal world, we would have had a consolidated Bill, which would have been even bigger. As it would have been consolidated, it might have been easier to follow. There are three elements to this. We had a competition Bill last year as well. It is a rolling programme of reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> In opening the debate, Deputy Sean Fleming expressed concern about the decision to give responsibility for appointing a group to look at media mergers to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland rather than the Competition Authority. He suggested that this will rob the Competition Authority of its role in some way, but I think the contrary is the case. As other Deputies have said, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is a body that studies media plurality and diversity. It is steeped in digital media as well as written media. I think it is better equipped than the Competition Authority to carry out this function. These bodies are already subject to the Freedom of Information Acts and that will continue in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> Deputy Sean Fleming also asked why we are not using the existing Office of the Ombudsman, rather than the new competition and consumer protection commission, as the enforcement body. We are taking our approach for a very good reason, which is that the existing Office of the Ombudsman does not have any of the legal background in this. Instead, it deals with public service issues and has no powers of enforcement of the sort we envisage here.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> The below-cost sale of alcohol was a consistent theme during the debate. Different versions of the same point were made, for example when it was suggested that minimum alcohol pricing should be introduced. Obviously, a much wider issue of public policy that is not confined to competition law is at stake here. Competition law deals with fair trading rules and the abuse of dominance, etc. As many Deputies indicated, the below-cost sale of alcohol is being considered in the context of the effect on society of drinking rather than in the context of its effect on competition. I appreciate that it is an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> Deputies Tóibín and Pringle expressed some concern about weaknesses in the enforcement of competition in certain product lines. It is important to recognise that the Competition Authority is independent in the conduct of its business. It has very strong powers of investigation and can take action where it establishes that abuse of dominance or collusion is taking place. It is open to the public to bring any such abuses to its attention. We have strengthened the authority's enforcement powers, increased its number of staff, added to the number of penalties it can impose and supported the forensic nature of its ability to pursue these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> A number of Deputies asked why we decided to provide for regulations rather than a code of conduct. To put it simply, regulations are enforceable by an authority like the proposed new commission, whereas codes of conduct are typically used as guidelines, in the labour area, for example, and are not compellable by criminal sanctions. We are seeking to introduce compellability here. That can be done by means of regulation. It has been recognised by Deputy Ó Cuív and others that the flexibility associated with regulations means that they can adapt to changing circumstances. Something that is enshrined in primary legislation does not have that flexibility because it is there for all time.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> The question of whether margins should be published was raised on a number of occasions. It was mentioned at the end of the debate by Deputy Ó Cuív. It is clear that such an obligation cannot be imposed on some sectors if it does not apply to all sectors. If we were to impose such an obligation, it would raise much wider issues relating to foreign direct investment and other matters. Deputy Ó Cuív might be interested to note that before he spoke, Deputy Naughten referred to some very useful work he did in 2006 and 2007 and which I remember well. By simply comparing farm gate prices with supermarket prices, Deputy Naughten was able to make a very good analysis of what was happening and the trends that were occurring. Deputy Ó Cuív repeated some of that analysis. One does not need to see the profitability numbers or accounts of individual companies to see what is happening in the marketplace. The new authority will have a role in looking at pricing. To be fair to the National Consumer Agency, it has published very useful North-South price comparisons. It has examined the treatment of the same product in different shops, for example. It has provided people with some very useful information.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> People sometimes expect too much of this legislation. Deputy Ó Cuív outlined his belief that competition law should be used to assure a person a living, in effect. No competition law can deliver that. We have seen many companies go to the wall because cheaper products were imported or made available elsewhere. One cannot use competition law to guarantee a living to people in any business. One can use it to ensure the terms of engagement between the primary producers and the multiples are fair, and that is what we are doing in this legislation. The terms that are set out in this legislation are very substantial. They relate to issues such as having a written contract and being able to produce that contract for inspection. They specify how that contract should deal with all sorts of things that are sources of concern, such as the manner in which suppliers are affected when goods are put on promotion or when there is wastage or shrinkage.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">If the forecast made by the supermarket is wildly wrong, what happens to the supplier's contact? These are real concerns which we can and will seek to address. The regulations are being drafted in parallel with the bringing forward of the legislation. Members' contributions in the Chamber today and the debate in committee will influence how we introduce the regulations and they will, of course, be presented to the House for consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> Deputy Thomas Pringle raised the question of whether we can regulate home-produced content on radio stations. This is not an issue that can be dealt with by consumer law. To be fair, we do use taxpayers' money through licence fees to support the provision of home-produced programmes and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> Deputy Mick Wallace raised the much broader question of why, in his view, some of the issues about which he is concerned are not adequately reflected in the media. Again, this is not a competition issue and cannot be dealt with through competition law. What we can do is ensure that where a media merger is proposed by a party who already has a very substantial interest in the market, it will be scrutinised not only on competition grounds but also on public interest grounds, taking into account such issues as diversity, plurality of ownership and so on, and a decision will be made following a full and open consultative process, with an advisory council established and people having the right to have their views heard. When the Minister makes his or her decision in such cases, the advice he or she received will be published along with the decision. It will be a fully transparent process.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> Deputy Dara Calleary raised a concern regarding ministerial direction. The objective here is not to direct the competition and consumer protection commission in any area where it has independent freedom of movement and its own statutory remit. The provision in question is a general one. On issues of pay, for example, or the terms on which people are employed, the Minister would have the authority to offer direction. We can clarify those provisions as we go through Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> Several speakers referred to resources, with some highlighting the saving of €170,000 through the establishment of the new agency. That saving is not the purpose of this legislation. It is simply the sum which arises from the removal of an existing board. The Bill will greatly strengthen the enforcement capability of the new body compared with that of the existing agencies. We recognise that without the teeth to match the law we are bringing in, we will not have an effective agency. There are real benefits in bringing together the two dimensions in which people view the market, namely, the consumer side and the competition side, the latter having to do with fairness of trading between producers. Both dimensions can have a positive impact for consumers if we get the balance right. The objective is to ensure consumers are informed, can exercise their rights and are not hoodwinked by unfair practices or misleading descriptions. If we have no barriers to entry, effective means of dealing with collusion where it occurs, and prevention of abuse of dominance, then we create a marketplace where there are good outcomes. Bringing those two dimensions of oversight of our markets together under the remit of one agency is a win-win situation. It creates a more pragmatic agency than we would have where the focus is merely on the fairly legalistic competition background, and gives teeth to the agency in dealing with consumer protection issues. We get the best of both worlds by bringing the two dimensions together under one agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> In my opening speech, I recognised the work done in this area by Deputies Willie Penrose and Andrew Doyle. They highlighted many of the problems and issues that have arisen and greatly assisted us in our work.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> Several Deputies raised the issue of the turnover limit of €50 million. Perhaps we have got it right in this regard given that one Deputy expressed the concern that small operators might be caught by unnecessary compliance while others felt the threshold should be reduced in order that suppliers would not find that some of those with whom they are dealing are not covered by the legislation. There is a balance to be struck here, and we must try to strike it at a point that is fair. Again, this is an issue we can tease out on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and others referred to the practice of vegetables being sold at 5 cent and argued that this does not serve anyone's interest in the long run. That is fair comment, although I am aware that at least one of the retailers selling at those types of prices did pay farmers the full contracted price. In other words, it is not altogether clear that such practices always mean the farmer loses out. We are trying to ensure there is fair practice in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> Deputy Peter Mathews raised the broader issue of how to promote an environment where small and medium enterprise can thrive. Some of the effort in that regard is general, encompasses broad supports for entrepreneurship, while some of it, as the Deputy said, necessitates a consideration of narrower issues such as how we can help small operators to survive in more remote areas. Tax policy is clearly a vehicle in that regard. Deputy Penrose highlighted the issue vividly by painting a picture of a future where there is no store between Mullingar and Longford. The pressure on small operators is coming not just from the business environment but also from the choices people make. That is something we cannot control through competition law, but we can try to ensure there is a level playing pitch.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> Deputy Denis Naughten raised several issues regarding the beef trade which stray well beyond the scope of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> In regard to the regulations, as I have said, they are in production. The model was based to a considerable degree on that produced by John Travers. In fact, all of the aspects reflected in his model are reflected in the general powers I have taken in the Bill. We have a good basis here for drawing up regulations that will be effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> I hope we will proceed to Committee Stage in a timely fashion, where we will have an opportunity to get into the detail of these provisions. I thank Deputies for their contributions and look forward to further discussion with them in committee. I take this opportunity to thank the officials who put a great deal of work into this legislation. It is a complex proposal, as Deputy Mathews pointed out, which deals with three different areas. Getting legislation through the Houses can remind one of waiting in a station through which the train passes only now and again. Once one has boarded the train, it is important to get the issues dealt with in an opportune way. This Bill sees the fulfilment of two commitments in the programme for Government. We will provide the time on Committee Stage to ensure every stone is turned and there is full transparency in terms of what we are proposing to do.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_822">The current health system is both unaffordable and unfair. That it is unaffordable is evidenced by the fact that the spend relating to it quadrupled between 1997 and 2009 and that in January 2011 there were 569 people lying on trolleys in hospitals throughout the country. It is unfair because it gives rise to a situation whereby people are often treated on the basis of what they can afford, not what they need and certainly not when they need it. The system is also unsustainable. This is the case because, thankfully, the number of people over the age of 65 in this country increases by 20,000 each year. This is a good thing but it imposes both a strain and a burden on the health service. That is why we must change both the system and the model of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> The Government has embarked on an ambitious programme of health service reforms and we are already seeing positive impacts from those reforms. However, Deputies should realise that there are limits to what reform of a fundamentally flawed system can accomplish. If we want to realise the kind of health service which we desire and which our people deserve, then radical reform is the only option. Some have questioned whether we can afford this kind of reform. My answer is simple: we cannot afford not to reform the system. Without this kind of radical reform, the pressures on a dysfunctional system will become overwhelming. People have also asked whether this is the right time to introduce reforms, particularly in view of the financial difficulties the country is experiencing. To them I say, "If not now, when?"</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> The profound inequality at the heart of the current health system is most obvious in respect of access to acute hospital and consultant services. Although the public health service provides universal access to acute hospital services, the fact is that individuals who choose and can afford to buy private health insurance do so mainly because it gives them faster access to certain hospital services. If hospital services are free, why have almost half the members of the population chosen to take out private insurance? The answer must be that they have lost faith in the public health service's ability to deliver on time for them. This is what an unfair, two-tier health system means in practice. Those who can afford it can obtain faster access to hospital services, and those who cannot must wait. They must do so because the high costs that make our current system unaffordable lie at the root of the unfairness. High costs mean that services must be rationed and this gives rise to long waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> The Government made a commitment to the kind of radical reform needed in order to tackle one of the most profound inequalities in Irish society. We committed to introducing a system of universal health insurance, UHI, so that everyone will have health cover from his or her choice of insurer and access to high-quality care on the basis of his or her medical needs, rather than on his or her ability to pay. The publication earlier this month of the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance underpins the Government's determination to deliver on its commitment. We were clear from the start that achieving this goal would require at least two terms of office. The job of this Government is to put in place the building blocks in order that a fair and cost-effective system of UHI can be delivered by 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> The White Paper sets out the model of UHI for Ireland. In designing this model we were acutely aware of the opportunity we have to learn from the experience of other countries, both in the context of the good practices they have developed and also from the inevitable mistakes they made. We did not want to import the model of another country, rather we wanted to learn from the experience in states such as Germany and the Netherlands in order that - in line with the commitments in the programme for Government - we might develop a model that best fits the needs of the Irish system. We looked to Northern Ireland when developing the special delivery unit. Since it was established, it has assisted those on the front line to deliver great progress. We looked to Denmark and Canada in the context of taking steps to ensure patient safety. We looked to the UK when seeking to establish the hospital trusts. We are not importing a single system from elsewhere, rather we are trying to learn from other systems in order to discover what best suits our situation. With that objective in mind, my Department undertook detailed policy analysis of various multi-payer models to design the basket of health services for the future and financing mechanisms for UHI.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the members of the UHI implementation group I established in early 2012 for their contribution in terms of the support and advice provided to my Department. I value, too, the advice the group supplied in respect of some of the core building blocks for UHI, including the introduction of a money-follows-the-patient funding system and the creation of hospital groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> What will the Irish model of UHI mean for the people? Under it, everyone will be insured for the same standard package of services. In broad terms, this package will include core primary care as well as acute hospital services, including acute mental health services. Under UHI, there will no longer be any distinction between public and private patients. As set out in the programme for Government, everyone will have health cover from his or her chosen insurer. The health insurance market will include a number of private health insurers but people will still continue to have the choice to be covered by the publicly-owned VHI. Insurers will commission health services for their customers from health care providers, who will compete for business in a well regulated market. While people will buy their UHI policies directly from their chosen insurers, a system of financial support will ensure that cover will be affordable. Those on the lowest incomes will have their costs fully paid for by the State. The State will subsidise the costs of others on the basis of their ability to pay. These subsidies will be paid directly to insurers. The Government is determined that people on low incomes who currently qualify for medical cards will not lose out on benefits under UHI. However, all individuals - regardless of whether they pay all, some, or none of the cost of the UHI premium - will be able to access a standard package of health services on a fair and equitable basis that will meet their health needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> Our system of UHI will be founded on principles of social solidarity. I refer here to the right of people to be accepted by their chosen health insurers and to switch insurers annually - in other words, open enrolment; the right to renew their UHI policies, that is, lifetime cover; and the right to the same policy for the same price, regardless of age or risk profile - in other words, community rating. These are fundamental protections that currently apply in the private health insurance market and they will continue to apply under UHI. It is intended that the standard package of UHI will cover a comprehensive suite of core health services. Under this single tier system, neither insurers nor providers will be allowed to sell faster access to services in the standard UHI package.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I am firmly committed to this fundamental aspect to reform in order that everyone will be able to access the health services they need in a timely manner. I realise some are concerned that the introduction of universal health insurance, UHI, could mean that waiting lists grow even longer. I agree this would be wholly unacceptable. We have already achieved great progress in reducing waiting times and we are not finished yet. This is why I will bring forward a strategy shortly to bring waiting times in Ireland in line with European norms and this will take place in advance of the introduction of universal health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> Some health services are unlikely to be included in any standard package of services under UHI, for example, surgery that is purely cosmetic as opposed to reconstructive surgery after medical treatment. People will still be able to pay privately for services not included in the standard UHI package or purchase supplemental health insurance cover for these. However, these supplemental policies will not be subject to community rating and, therefore, supplemental health insurance premiums may take into account risk factors such as health status and age for non-standard procedures. Certain services, including social care, public health and well-being services, will continue to be funded by the Exchequer through general taxation. They will not be included in the standard UHI package and people will not have to buy supplementary insurance to access them. However, I emphasise that these will be delivered in an integrated manner and around the needs of the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> The delivery of a single-tier health system supported by universal health insurance is a central pillar of the Government's overall health reform programme. Since coming into office I, along with my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and the Minister of State, Deputy White, have been working on a range of reforms which will result in a fundamental shift in the way our health services are funded, organised and delivered. The purpose is to improve health outcomes, develop our health services, make the best use of limited resources and lay the foundations of the future universal health insurance system. The aim is to ensure more efficient and effective delivery of services in order that we can move away from a hospital centred model to one that provides the most appropriate care in the most appropriate setting. Members will have heard me say frequently that patients should be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible. The aim is always to improve outcomes for the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> The introduction of UHI is the most radical reform of the Irish health system since the foundation of the State. It requires time and careful planning to implement. My goal is to put in place the essential groundwork to underpin UHI in the lifetime of this Government in order that UHI can be implemented by 2019. I am reminded that some people say we are going too quickly while others say we are going too slowly. We are going to do it right. That is the most important thing and we need not take as long as other jurisdictions because we can learn from what they have done. We will not be so precipitous as to rush this or not do it properly. The White Paper identifies and outlines progress to date on the key structural, regulatory, financial and information related building blocks that will pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance. I will refer briefly to some of the key building blocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> As Deputies will be aware, universal primary care is at the core of the Government's goals for universal health insurance. Today, the Government approved the health (general practitioners service) Bill 2014, which provides the basis for each of the 420,000 children in Ireland aged five years and under to access a general practitioner service without facing the barrier of fees. At present, the parents of approximately 250,000 children under six years of age must pay if they need to attend a GP. This legislation will bring Ireland into line with health systems in Europe which ensure all children can access a family doctor when they need the service. The Government has provided new additional funding of €37 million to meet the cost of this measure. This represents the first step in introducing a universal GP service for the entire population. Under universal health insurance, every member of the population will have a universal entitlement to the core primary care services provided by GPs. The Bill will be distributed to Deputies in the coming days when publication is complete. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Alex White, has invited the representative bodies of GPs to meet him in connection with the draft GP contract for the under-six years service, which the HSE recently published for public consultation. I encourage GPs and GP bodies to take up the offer. The best way to engage is across the table in order that we can learn of their concerns and address them.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> One quarter of our children under three years are either overweight or obese and we know what this means for their future health. We need to consider a contract that looks to prevention rather than episodic cure all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> The transformation of public hospitals into independent not-for-profit hospital trusts is a key commitment in the programme for Government. As a first step in the process, seven hospital groups have been established. The creation of hospital groups is a critical step to improving hospital performance and, ultimately, patient outcomes. Chairpersons have been appointed to all seven hospital groups and board members have been appointed to three out of the seven hospital groups, the west-north-west hospital group, the University of Limerick hospital group and the children's hospital group, and appointment of the remaining four is imminent. Group chief executives have been appointed to five hospital groups and the HSE is working to appoint group chief executives to the remaining two groups. Following this, management teams will be appointed. The strategic advisory group to oversee implementation of hospital groups, the development of policy direction and the guiding of the reorganisation of acute services is in place and has had several productive meetings, which I have attended. On 1 January this year, we began the phased implementation of a money follows the patient funding system for acute hospitals. This will bring an end to the inefficient block grants and deliver funding on the basis of the number of patients treated. While the initial focus of the new funding system is on hospital care, the aim is to extend the system to care in primary and community settings. We know what happened with the inefficient block grants. When the money ran out, everything stopped. Doctors, nurses and staff got paid but patients suffered with cancelled outpatient and theatre appointments. This will no longer be the case. However, it will not only be about volume and the number of patients. It will also have a particular focus on outcomes, for example, the number of patients who have had to be re-admitted because initial treatment was not successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Effective regulation of the safety and quality of health services is important to protect and safeguard people's health. The approval of national health care standards and ongoing work in respect of licensing legislation are central to achieving good governance, patient safety and quality of care. Draft legislation to support the new licensing regime is being prepared. It is my intention to have the new licensing system up and running in early 2015. It has been a matter of concern to me that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has no role in licensing. As matters stand, private clinics and hospitals, primary care facilities, home care organisations and home help organisations are services where consumers and patients need to be protected and there needs to be oversight by HIQA in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> Competing health insurers will form the backbone of the new purchaser-provider split. They will be the commissioners of a wide range of primary care services, acute hospital services and acute mental health. Even before UHI, we need an affordable competitive market that meets the needs of consumers. I am keen to create the best possible environment within which more people will seek to take out and keep health insurance. In particular, I encourage younger people to join as early as possible, and to this end we will have in place lifetime community rating and discounted rates for adults. Lifetime community rating is designed to encourage people to join health insurance schemes early. Late entry loadings are applied to those who join later, but of course there would be a grace period to allow people take out insurance and a strong communications campaign to give everyone adequate notice of the change. I have heard Deputies raise in the House an issue I have raised myself. It it important that a 50 year old who has been in the VHI all his life should get some recognition of that fact <i>vis-à-vis</i> a 50 year old who was never insured before and who takes up insurance for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> The second initiative I will be announcing involves some discounted rates for young adults while protecting the important principle of community rating. This is to help address the sharp increase in the cost of insurance faced by young people or their parents around the age of 21 years when child discounts cease. This change can lead to young adults downgrading cover or leaving the market altogether. Subject to the appropriate legislation, I intend to provide for these two initiatives to operate from 2015, allowing for an appropriate notice period for both customers and insurers.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> I am committed to making further improvements to risk equalisation for health insurance as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">In January 2013, I introduced a new permanent risk equalisation scheme designed to take greater account of the extra cost of treating older and sicker patients compared with younger and healthier ones. Last December, I introduced further improvements to the scheme's effectiveness. This process will continue. I am committed to improving the extent to which we take the health status of patients into account so that the extra costs of sicker patients of all ages are more fully reflected in the scheme. My Department is working with the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, to develop a more refined measure of health status as part of the risk equalisation scheme in order that insurers can be encouraged to take on sicker and older patients. Insurers have been making submissions to the HIA on the issue and I intend to set out my overall plans shortly for the scheme that will operate from 2016 to 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> We continue to address the issue of the cost of private health care through renegotiation of consultants' contracts in respect of the procedures that are performed, particularly those that take much less time than they used to, benchmarking what consultants are paid, auditing hospitals and challenging clinicians' rationale for some of the tests they conduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> Significant organisational change is necessary to pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance, UHI. This will involve the abolition of the HSE, which will be replaced with structures that deliver the essential purchaser-provider split, a key building block for UHI that will pave the way for health care providers to operate as independent entities in the future market-based health system. These are important initiatives that individually and collectively will play a vital role in improving our health service in advance of the introduction of UHI.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> As well as providing detailed information on the UHI model, the White Paper overviews the processes and structures for determining the future health basket, including the services that will be funded under UHI as well as the ongoing management and review of the future basket; sets out the options for financing UHI; and clarifies the key regulatory and cost control frameworks governing the UHI system.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> In designing our future health system, we must decide which services should be funded through UHI and which should continue to be funded directly by the State or individuals' own resources. These questions are of fundamental importance to everyone living in Ireland. The answers are complex and multifaceted, involving various technical, economic and ethical considerations. These are deeply value-laden decisions and, therefore, it is important the values underpinning the health basket reflect the values of the society in which we live. Good practice in other jurisdictions in these decision-making processes involves a critical blend of technical appraisal and comprehensive consultation with all relevant stakeholders. Therefore, I intend to establish a commission comprising all relevant expertise within the coming weeks. The commission will be tasked with developing detailed and costed proposals on the composition of the future health basket, including those that will form part of the UHI package of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> However, these considerations cannot be solely based on expert analysis. They must also be based on values. In that regard, the commission will be required to engage in consultation with the public and system stakeholders. I hope the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children will be centrally involved in the consultation process. The committee is being invited to conduct hearings and make recommendations on a values framework that will assist in underpinning decisions on the future health basket and to consider the options proposed by the expert commission. Responsibility for the final decision on the services to be provided under UHI will, of course, rest with the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> UHI represents a substantial shift in how we finance and organise the health system. I am determined that total spending by the State on health care under UHI should not exceed total spending under the current two-tier system. With this in mind, the White Paper has been prepared with due regard to the fiscal realities and the need for robust cost control. The White Paper sets out a comprehensive cost control framework to ensure affordability and contain costs. These range from price monitoring of insurers and setting maximum prices for health care providers to more aggressive measures, such as capping insurer overheads and profit margins.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> Ultimately, the cost of UHI will depend on a number of key decisions, including the basket of services to be covered and the scope and design of the financial support system. My Department is working to develop and refine proposals on cost control mechanisms, the financial subsidy system and, critically, costed recommendations for the basket of services to be provided under UHI. This work will proceed on the basis of the overriding requirement that overall costs remain within Government expenditure targets. Before seeking the Government's approval to draft UHI legislation, I will revert to it with all relevant cost estimates. A critical part of this work will be our new national health care pricing office, which is already up and running on an administrative basis but which will be placed on a legislative basis so that people can be assured it is truly independent of those who provide the care and those who pay for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> A dedicated UHI implementation team is being put in place within the Department of Health to drive forward all aspects of the UHI project. The team will be led by the deputy Secretary General and will include specialist skills in such areas as project management, communications support and actuarial and financial advice. This expertise will be sourced externally, as required. The team will be responsible for managing the consultation process, UHI communications, developing costings for UHI and developing policy options for the provision of financial support for citizens in respect of their UHI policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> In any reform, we must first put in place many of the building blocks, a number of which I have outlined. We must beef up the HIA to give it the tools to regulate the market more seriously. The current situation of more than 256 different policies is set to confuse consumers. The HIA does a great job of providing advice on its website. None the less, we should force insurers into offering fewer products with greater clarity for the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> We must reform the Department of Health. A Prospectus report has made several recommendations about capacity deficits, specifically in particular areas of expertise. These recommendations are being addressed. As the House knows, we are reforming the HSE through a provider-procurer split and the new directorates and hospital groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Tomorrow, we will launch Professor Brian MacCraith's report on his work with non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and other stakeholders in respect of the training and career prospects of NCHDs and new consultants. This work is long overdue and has led to the loss to Ireland of many fine doctors who, after emigrating, have proven their worth by rising to the top of the finest institutions in the world. We want to bring those doctors home and retain the new doctors coming through in order that they can look after Irish people and have the opportunity to engage in research and innovate with new pharma, medical devices and care delivery methodologies.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> I had the pleasure and honour of launching Lollipop Day for the Oesophageal Cancer Fund, OCF. Professor John Reynolds of the fund told me it had improved the outcome for oesophageal cancer by nearly 20%. This did not involve new operations or drugs but better organisation and management of care. Many aspects of the care we offer need to be examined and reformed if we are to get the best outcome for our people and patients. This is what we wish to achieve. At the end of the day, these are our families, friends and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> Delivering a single tier health system, supported by UHI, is central to achieving our policy vision for the health system, a vision that is far-reaching and ambitious, but one our people deserve. I repeat that it is not my health service or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's, but everyone's, and I want everyone to have an opportunity to feed into the process of developing the UHI policy and to have his or her voice heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">I hope that results in the major changes being put in place in the best possible way for the benefit of everyone. I urge individuals, local groups, national organisations and other bodies to participate actively in the consultation process and make their views known on the future funding and delivery of our health service. Full details of the consultation process are available on my Department's website at <i>www.health.gov.ie</i>. This consultation process by way of e-mail will stay open until 28 May 2014. However, as I am at pains to point out, the process through the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and through the commission will continue for several months.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> I am a republican. I believe in the Republic and I believe a republic should cherish all its citizens equally. This policy of universal health insurance goes to the heart of supporting such a value. It is a value most Irish people hold very dear.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_378">
          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_857">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. Obviously, our party will set out its views on this and on how we fund our health service in the years ahead. I listened to the Minister's remarks regarding universal health insurance and read The Path to Universal Healthcare, which is called a White Paper. We are a long way from seeing a White Paper on universal health insurance as this is simply a discussion document which will facilitate consultation with the public, Members of the Oireachtas, the health committee and other stakeholders. That it would be called a White Paper simply indicates that people in the Department of Health do not know the parliamentary process. A White Paper is supposed to be a body of detail that will generate legislation, and this document is a long way from that. It is, in effect, a discussion document. Nevertheless, it is available and is in the public domain, so we can now discuss it.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> The Minister said that he is a republican and that every member of society should be cherished equally. We all subscribe to that. In fact, in our election literature Fianna Fáil calls itself the republican party. The word "republican" has been much maligned in Ireland over the years, but I claim to be a republican too and a member of a republic. That is a sweeping statement, but the broader issue is how we fund our health service over the next number of years to make it equitable, fair and sustainable. One can have an equitable and fair system, but it will not be sustainable, or one can have a sustainable system that might be unfair. The issue is to put a funding system in place whereby people can access health care based on their clinical need as opposed to their ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> The implication by some commentators in discussions on this issue is that private health insurance is almost parasitical and that these people are living off something else. The bottom line is that private health insurance has for many years lightened the burden on the State in its obligation to provide health care for its citizens. That is a fact. For a long time up to now, perhaps half of our population has taken out private health insurance. While the number has dropped dramatically in recent times, the general principle of having private health insurance has been well established. When people take out private health insurance, they lighten the obligation on the State to provide health cover for them. While that is subsidised through tax reliefs, when a person uses the public hospital system, they subsidise that system through payments from insurers.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> There is a very complex system for funding the health service in this country. The public hospital system is funded by taxation and subvention directly from the taxpayer. There is a certain percentage of funding from private health insurers and there are out-of-pocket payments. That combination is how we fund our health service at present. Is it inequitable and unfair? Yes. There are huge elements where some people cannot access health care when they need it. The key question is why that is the case. Is it that the public health system is inefficient and is not run in a way that makes it efficient, lean and, more important, responsive to individuals when they present to it?</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> What the Minister calls a White Paper and what I call a discussion document is very light on detail. We still must be convinced that by 2019 we will have a system in place whereby a bunch of health insurers will line up in Dún Laoghaire or Dublin Airport to come to this country, claiming to be delighted to get into the Irish health market and anxious to become part of this system. I am dubious as to whether many health insurers will come into the Irish health sector to provide private health insurance. I do not believe that will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> We currently have four insurers. There is the big player, VHI, and the three private health insurance companies. The four of them insure just under half of the population, and that number is dropping. There are many reasons for that. There has been a downturn in the economy and people's ability to pay for health insurance has been damaged. Equally, on the Minister's side, there has been a series of policies which have made private health insurance unaffordable for many families. Last year, the Minister for Finance came to the House and, with a single swoop of his pen, increased the burden on families. I am quite sure the Minister was not happy with that proposal, because it increases the cost of health insurance for families who are already hard pressed. Equally, there is the full cost recoup of private patients in public beds, which will have another impact on the cost to families for the provision of health cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> In the meantime, the Minister, in his stated policy, wishes to encourage people to take out private health insurance so that when we move to compulsory universality, as many people as possible will be insured. Those on medical cards who cannot afford it will have it purchased for them, and for the cohort in between, who have neither medical cards nor private health insurance, there will be some form of subvention from the State. That means people will be fully assessed. Key questions must be asked in that regard. What will be considered discretionary income? Will it be based on the medical card assessment or on what will it be based? What types of expenditure will people be permitted in terms of mortgage repayments, maintenance of cars and investment in education? All of these questions will have to be answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> We are a long way, on the Minister's path to universal health insurance, from knowing how much this will cost an average family. We are an equally long way from knowing what type of cover they will have. The Minister says there will be a basic basket of services and that the acute hospital setting, inpatient and outpatient services and mental health services should be included in it. However, if they are to be included, it should be stated in the White Paper, if it were a White Paper, and we could discuss the issues relating to it. Nothing is said in the White Paper about what should be in the suite of services or basket of health care to which people will be entitled under universal health insurance. That is a big void in this document.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> Turning to the mechanics of this and the funding model proposed by the Minister, there are many assumptions in it. The Minister said that no one will pay more than they are paying already. That is simply inaccurate. Of course they will pay more than they are paying now. Private health insurance premia are increasing by the hour. Three years ago the Minister said that no one would pay more than they were already paying, but premia have increased by 20% to 30% under the Minister's watch. Even if it was introduced today, many people would be paying a great deal more than they were paying three years ago. Are we to assume there will be no inflation in private health insurance premia between now and 2019? That is the only way it will not cost more, and I do not believe we can make that assumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> Are we to assume that the tax reliefs in place for private health insurance premia will continue, or will they be removed? If they are removed, it will be another inflationary impact on the cost to families. How will the 20% cohort in between be able to afford to pay for private health insurance? Bear in mind that this is the compulsory purchase of private health insurance. The days of the two certainties of death and taxes are gone. It is now death, taxes and compulsory private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> There is a great deal to discuss. This is not simply about deciding the suite of services that will be included in the basket.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">There is an awful lot more to this than the Minister is outlining, along with the complexity of it. However, the key issue is whether or not it will be sustainable. Will it be sustainable for the State? Will it be sustainable for many families who are making a contribution to the health services through their taxation, but who are unable to afford private health insurance? What happens that cohort?</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> We endlessly talk about the Minister's endless utopian ideas, but when we look at the discussion document, we cannot find any credible substance to what he is proposing and how he intends getting there, other than this meandering consultation that we are to have tonight, over the next month at the health committee and at the commission that is to be established to look at all these issues. The fundamental principles in this are slim enough, but the most important issue had to be in respect of the suite of services, the basket of goods, the cover that will be provided by health insurance companies. None of that is in the Minister's discussion document.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> The Minister looked at the German model, the Dutch model and around the world to find the best model, or an amalgam of models that would suit the Irish situation. That is fine. Of course he should send people out to look at the various models to ascertain which one is most suited to this country. However, when we talk about the cost of health care, there seems to be a perception in Ireland that we are spending huge amounts <i>per capita</i> on health, but when we look at the figures, we are still a long way behind some countries that the Minister claims will provide a more efficient health system than our own. The OECD statistics on the <i>per capita</i> expenditure expressed as purchasing power parity is on page 57 of Health in Ireland: Key Trends 2012, which was published by the Minister's Department. According to the statistics, the Netherlands spent $5,000 <i>per capita</i> in 2010. Germany spent $4,338, France spent $3,974 and Ireland spent $3,718 <i>per capita</i>. That includes public and private providers. The Minister is coming in here and telling the House that he is going to create a fairer, equitable, more sustainable model, and he is following countries that are spending far more <i>per capita</i>-----</p>

          <p eId="para_874">We only know one thing. The Minister is asking private health insurance companies to provide a standard suite of cover which we do not yet know what it will cost or what they must be obliged to cover, and that they will compete with each other and with hospital groups or trusts and drive down costs. If the Minister asked the people who looked at these various insurance models and health systems throughout the world, he would find that that type of model does not work. That is the issue with which we have a problem. If he does not believe me, he should listen to some of the people who sat in the group advising the Government on this issue. They had major concerns about the Dutch model and other similar models in respect of maintaining and curtailing costs. We want an equitable and fair system, but at the end of the day it must be sustainable. Without that, we are going around in circles pretending that we are going to introduce a model that this State can afford, when we know before we even set out on this path that we are going to run into difficulty. They are saying in Holland and elsewhere as we speak that their systems simply do not drive down the cost of health care. It may make it equitable, but being equitable without sustainability is not a panacea for major problems.</p>

          <p eId="para_877">In this system, the Minister is saying that hospital groups will compete with each other to provide health care, and they will then tender to work with the private health insurance companies. If I live in Moville, Carndonagh or in south-west Cork and the Minister has set up hospital groups from Tralee to Waterford and from Letterkenny to Galway, somehow there will be competition within that health grouping. Of course there will not be competition. This is only a pretence. We simply cannot have a system whereby there will be very competitive tendering processes and delivery of health care by different groups within those areas. That simply will not happen. Even the discussion document in the White Paper provides an indication that this will not happen. The Minister is trying to look at other countries with dense populations, such as Holland, which is not much bigger than Munster but has a population of about 16 million or 17 million. The Dutch had 18 insurance companies at one stage, but they are now down to three or four and none of the problems that emanated from the Dutch system and other universal health insurance multi-payer systems has been taken on board by the Minister. That is what I find incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> I would not be too worried if I was the only person saying that. However, the Minister's Cabinet colleagues are saying it as well. They say it to his face in the Cabinet and they certainly say it around here, because they simply do not believe that going down this particular route will deliver a fair, equitable, sustainable health system. In fact, some of his Cabinet colleagues have gone so far as to state that it will put the State finances at risk. That is something the Minister should seriously take into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> Rather than highlighting the difficulties with the broader principle, let us go into the detail and assume that it is implemented. Every private health insurance company will be legally obliged to carry a certain amount of capital, as they will be regulated by the Central Bank. There has not been a mention of that in the Minister's discussion document in respect of how that will bear out in terms of costs. In order to have a very competitive insurance market, insurance companies will have to make a profit before they enter the market. They will have to be guaranteed that there is some form of return on their investment. When they make profit, they will be taking that amount of money out of the health system. That is what they will be doing. Assuming they work on a margin of 10%, or even 8% on a streamlined basis, with a €16 billion spend, that is a lot of money not going into the health system and going into insurance companies. All those issues have to be factored in, because they will only operate in a system whereby they make profit and they will also have to carry capital on top of that. All these things will take funding from the health system which will be transferred to private health insurance companies. Universal health insurance will add to greater sustainability problems and will not resolve the problems of equal access based on clinical need.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> A press release was issued which stated "White hails Government decision on free GP for under sixes". I presume the Minister hails it as well. Nearly a quarter of a million will benefit from the decision. Unfortunately, there has been no extra allocation for medical cards.</p>

          <p eId="para_884">The idea that Fine Gael would hail a policy whereby the oldest, sickest and those with profound disabilities and significant life challenges would have a medical card taken from them at the age of six is despicable. This is happening day in, day out. There is not a Deputy in the House who has not raised the issues of discretionary medical cards and medical cards being taken from people who need them badly. We have encountered cases in which people in the latter days of their lives had medical cards taken from them. Organisations advocating on behalf of people with disabilities and illness write to us every week of the year stating their members are having their cards withdrawn. Elderly people of 85 and 90 are being dragged through review processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> We are all for probity in the use of public funds but I just do not accept the argument that the under-sixes arrangement is not being funded by those who most need medical care and medical cards. It was a gimmick because Fine Gael set out in its original promise or commitment that the first to come into consideration would be those with a long-term illness, followed by those in the high-tech drug scheme. The proposal was to roll out the system to the rest of the population thereafter. Bearing in mind the money provided in the Estimates for the last year, it is evident that there has been no ring-fencing of extra money. If would be all fine and proper if there had been. Even last year's Estimates indicated the Government would make €666 million in cuts in the system and that there would be a probity trawl worth €108 million. There was no extra funding provided for people in receipt of medical cards; there was a reduction. What occurred represents a shameful exercise. I still cannot believe the Government sees nothing wrong with asking those most in need to give to those who may not need the medical card at all. It is transferring a service from the very sickest to individuals who may not be sick and who may have the means to pay for a general practitioner. This scheme would be wonderful, as echoed in the palaver, if it were not funded by taking medical cards from those who most need them. We feel very strongly about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> I raised this issue last year on budget night. With great fanfare, the Government walked in here to announce this particular election stunt. If the Minister for Finance had stated, either before or after the Minister for Health spoke, that the Government was to increase the amount of money available so those with discretionary medical cards could retain them and that it was to provide extra money for universal general practitioner care for those under six, it would have been tolerated, but not the other way around. What occurred was done in an underhand, disingenuous way. Day in, day out, organisations make presentations to this effect at the Joint Committee on Health and Children and individuals consistently highlight in our clinics their plight or that of their loved ones. I am not making up this. Many organisations and individuals are saying what I suggest day in, day out. I suggest that the Minister meet some of them and listen to their problems. If he is saying there has been no change to how discretionary medical cards are awarded, he is not living in the same world in which I live. What I describe is happening day in, day out.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> I raised some time ago the difficulties that general practitioners are facing. We have encountered this in recent days. There is a crisis in general practitioner services nationally. I raised this long before the general practitioners decided to highlight their concerns at very public meetings throughout the country. I am no mouthpiece for general practitioners; they are well able to fight their corner. The Minister is one himself.</p>

          <p eId="para_889">The bottom line, however, is that there is a major problem in general practitioner practices, particularly in rural areas. There will now be a major problem in areas of socio-economic deprivation. If the Minister is saying this is not happening, I fear we are facing a greater difficulty than I imagined. The one argument on which we can all agree is that primary care represents the best way to deliver health care in communities throughout the country. It is a question of keeping people out of the acute hospital setting by delivering health care in general practitioners' practices throughout the country. This is a principle of the primary care strategy published in 2001. It has been a principle that all political parties and stakeholders have bought into. The unfortunate problem is that we are starving general practitioners' practices and primary care teams of the resources they need to ensure people can be treated in the least complex way. It is not just a question of general practitioners' practices.</p>

          <p eId="para_900">With regard to the effort to reduce costs or not have them escalate, about which the Minister has spoken, and the competition in the multi-payer system and multi-provider system, I cannot understand how the Minister believes that will work. The means by which it will work are very unclear in the strategy document. It is very unclear that those who provide the care - the general practitioners, nurses and consultants, for example - will address all the pertinent issues. Who will pay them and how will they be paid? How will staff earn according to their grades? Consultants who are currently working in both the public and private systems, for example, will not be able to do so at all under the system under discussion. Will such consultants be compensated by the universal health insurance system? Alternatively, will they pack up and leave for elsewhere? No thought has been put into this. This is the difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> The Minister claimed he has achieved a lot in regard to the reduction of waiting lists. Last year, there was a surge in waiting lists and then they were reduced. The reduction was because the National Treatment Purchase Fund, or its current equivalent, bought many services through the private system. Therefore, it is simply not the case that the public hospital system is delivering on its own all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">There is a cross-utilisation of resources in the sense that the public hospital system has contracted work out to the private hospital system, and that has been happening on a continual basis. I am not saying it is a bad thing, but when people are waiting, they should be treated. However, the Minister has been saying waiting lists have reduced dramatically. They have been reduced because the Minister is contracting that work out to the private hospital providers. The idea the Minister would give himself a clap on the back as if he had almost transformed the whole system simply is wrong. There are people in the public hospital waiting system, day in, day out, and they are being transferred into private hospitals for treatment. That is what has been done for the last number of years through the National Treatment Purchase Fund and it should continue to be done until such time as we have a public hospital system that can actually deal with those long waiting lists within its own capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> That is the key area the Minister should be targeting for the next number of years. He must ensure people are not waiting. Whether it is treated by contracting out public or private services, people deserve to have treatment when they need it.</p>

          <p eId="para_917">That is regrettable. We will have a two-tier contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> In the introduction to the document we are addressing, entitled, The Path to Universal Healthcare: White Paper on Universal Health Insurance, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, on behalf of the Government, says it aspires to "a universal single-tier health service with access based on need, not income". I want to say that I personally, and we in Sinn Féin, share that aim, and that it has been the very basis of the health policy I have presented here over many years. However, we believe the model the Government has adopted is fundamentally flawed. It is a so-called free market model based on competing private, for-profit health insurance companies, and that is where we clearly part. This is the Fine Gael model which, in my view, won out in the programme for Government. This is a purely market approach, treating health care as a commodity and believing that consumers will benefit from competition, but the real beneficiaries will be the private health insurers, and they will benefit doubly. First, they will have a mass of new customers forced by Government legislation to take out policies and, second, they will benefit directly from Government payments to them on behalf of people who cannot pay private health insurance themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> I have said it here before and I make no apology for repeating it. We often hear the phrase: "Cut out the middleman". The Minister's, Deputy Reilly's, model of universal health insurance is cutting in the middleman. It is adding to the cost of health care because the profit margin of the private health insurance companies will inevitably push up the cost of health care. We in Sinn Féin say to cut out the middleman. This can be done by funding public health services from fair and reformed general taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> The Minister's plan is based ostensibly on the Dutch model, which is not working as is claimed and has actually led to the rationing of health care and to much greater medical inflation. We believe this plan will cost both the State and the citizens more than a State-provided taxation funded system. We believe it will lead to a system where private health insurance companies will ultimately determine what level of health services people receive. The private health insurance companies will become gatekeepers if this system is adopted and future Governments will be constantly trying to play catch-up with legislation and regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> We need a real debate and real progress on health reform. The consultation process and public debate on the best model insurance, whether State-provided or a mix, should have begun when the Government came into office three years ago. Instead, we have had a predetermined outcome as presented by this so-called White Paper. A "White Paper on financing universal health insurance" was promised early in the term of the Government and it is interesting that, at some stage, the word "financing" was dropped from the title. That was the title and it is no longer there.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> Sure enough, there is precious little in this White Paper about the financing of universal health insurance and, in particular, what it will cost individuals and families. It has taken over three years to produce a White Paper with a truncated and narrow consultation process with, again, a predetermined outcome. It is both very late and, as I have already said, half-baked. What is compulsory health insurance going to cost people who have neither a medical card nor private health insurance at present? That key question is not answered in this document. Crucially, the document does not describe the basket of care that will be provided under universal health insurance, which a consultation process is supposedly going to help determine. This immediately raises the question of what conditions, syndromes and needs will not be covered, as will be the case. We are being presented with a consultation process with a predetermined outcome and a deadline of 28 May, clashing directly with the local and European elections now swirling about us.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> Sinn Féin wants to see universal public health care based on medical need and funded from fair and reformed general taxation. On this basis, we will be participating in the consultation and the debate, and we will make our own party submission. I urge others listening to and watching this debate today also to participate as I believe that is critically important. We are calling for an open debate that will examine all options for health care reform and funding, not just the option presented by this White Paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> Even in the very unlikely event that this plan is delivered on schedule, we will not see it implemented until 2019. What happens in the meantime? Let us for a moment look at what is happening now. We have ongoing cuts year on year which have caused huge damage in our health services. To give just one example, with a growing and aging population, we cannot possibly sustain safe hospital services when over 5,200 nursing posts, or 13.5% of the total, have been cut since 2010. As has been highlighted in the Private Member's motion this week, only one in every three people with life-threatening conditions were responded to by an ambulance service within the target time last year.</p>

          <p eId="para_926">I repeat it. We all accept that health care is expensive and has to be paid for. The question is how to pay for it in a way that ensures the best possible health care for all who need it and which does so with the best achievable value for money. The Government is proposing to bring in universal health insurance, with the State subsidising those who cannot afford to pay insurance premiums. The State will still have a huge regulatory, managerial and funding role. Why, then, give private, for-profit insurance companies such a central place in the system? What contribution will they make? They are funded by the consumers who buy their products. The insurance companies, on behalf of policyholders, will buy services from private or public hospitals or other service providers, and they will have to make a substantial profit in the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_927">I rise unapologetically to make a plea which has come to me from local interests who are very fearful of developments in the ambulance service. I applaud the motion and Fianna Fáil for recognising the work that has been done by paramedics over a long period of time. I deplore the fact that delays in ambulance response times have far exceeded both nationally and internationally accepted norms. We have a crisis in our ambulance service which is recognised in this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> I specifically wish to state that I have had representations from people in the Nutgrove area of south Dublin who are very fearful that if the HSE takes over this and other areas, it will force a closure of bays in Nutgrove and other areas in the centre of south Dublin. This will mean that the response times will be further reduced. It will mean that people in this area which is the centre of my constituency - I am talking about areas like Dundrum, Ballinteer and Sandyford - will not be reached in such good time because the ambulance in the Nutgrove area will be removed and replaced by those in locations decided by the HSE. </p>
          <p eId="para_929"> I plead with the Minister to consider giving an instruction to the HSE so people in south Dublin are not neglected or deprived by decisions of this sort and do not have to make representations to him and me in the future to ask to keep the Nutgrove bay open so that they are not dependent on Loughlinstown and Tallaght which are outside this area and too far away and to ask that we ensure that those response times are guaranteed to remain within the 11-minute or even ten-minute period, which they have traditionally been.</p>

          <p eId="para_930">We sometimes hear about the need for those in power to take action before it is too late. For Wayne McQuillan who was stabbed in Drogheda in New Year's Eve, it is already too late because it took the ambulance 32 minutes to get to him after the initial call. The Minister of State may be aware that his distraught family attended the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children when we heard from representatives from the ambulance service earlier this year. It is a bit rich for Fianna Fáil to clap our paramedics on the back when the cuts to the forefront of this were begun on its watch. None the less, the reality is that we have a dysfunctional ambulance service which is undermining the quality of the work put in by our very dedicated paramedics on the front line. Against that backdrop, the suggestion that Dublin Fire Brigade would be removed from administering that service is absolutely ludicrous when it is coming to light that HSE mismanagement has been responsible for much of the problems that exist in the ambulance service. In my constituency, a HSE ambulance driver told me how they received a new ambulance vehicle which had 70,000 miles on the clock. He reported how six crew members turned up for a shift with only two ambulances to put them to work. Obviously, "Prime Time" elevated many of these stories. The proof shows that Dublin Fire Brigade, which covers 40% of national calls on 7% of the national budget, has the best response times in the country. If anything, we should be holding back and looking at the idea put forward of a national capacity review. In my opinion, the outcome of that will be that the ambulance model that has been adopted in other countries is the best for patient safety and that there should be no undermining of that service in the short term because other people's lives, like that of Wayne McQuillan, will be forfeited as a result.</p>

          <p eId="para_931">I rise to support the motion on the ambulance service requesting adequate funding for the service. Anybody who has an eye to see or an ear to hear knows that the ambulance service is under-funded, under-resourced, understaffed and under-equipped and that it compares unfavourably with our neighbours in Northern Ireland and particularly Scotland. We have about 1,600 staff while Scotland, which has a similar population, has 4,500 staff and double the funding. It is widely accepted that the ambulance service in this country is in crisis. The Minister has looked for a review from HIQA. The unions and staff associations have been looking for a resource study for a number of years and I believe the HSE has finally agreed to such a study.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> In these circumstances, there should be no more service cuts and certainly no more service cuts in south Tipperary. I commend the Tipperary Ambulance Action Group which is opposed to the cuts across south Tipperary and came together to campaign on this issue. It has completed a comprehensive study of the ambulance service in south Tipperary. The study confirms that on the basis of the current ambulance service configuration in the county which is based on three stations - Clonmel, Cashel and Tipperary town - the current staffing levels and equipment in those stations, in excess of 55% of the population of south Tipperary cannot be given an adequate service that meets the minimum response times. What does the HSE want to do? On top of a crisis, it wants to introduce further cuts. This is completely ridiculous and I am calling on the Minister to stop any cuts in the ambulance service, not just in south Tipperary but throughout the country, and to ensure that the service is properly funded and staffed. </p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_933">There is a major crisis in the national ambulance service - a crisis that leads to deaths. The estimate is that one person per month dies unnecessarily as a result of the under-resourcing and the cuts that have been imposed on the ambulance service. It does not get any more serious than that. People are dying unnecessarily. The cuts the Government is imposing - not just the recruitment embargo that impacts on these services but the more general cuts across the health services - are exacerbating this situation. When the Minister downgraded the accident and emergency services at St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown, we predicted that it would cause a crisis in St. Vincent's Hospital and this has now been confirmed by the consultants in St. Vincent's. This leads directly to further problems in terms of emergency vehicle response times because as the firefighters and ambulance drivers are reporting, ambulances are then queuing up for hours outside emergency departments because those departments are overwhelmed and under-resourced and there are not enough beds in the hospitals. All of these things are combining to cause a life-threatening crisis which the Minister intends to make worse by attacking one part of the emergency services that is working, namely, Dublin Fire Brigade which provides ambulance services in Dublin. Dublin Fire Brigade provides 40% of the emergency responses and must survive on only 9% of the budget. The Minister wants essentially to pillage that service in order to compensate for the crisis in the national ambulance service. It is outrageous.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> It is very simple. The resourcing levels in our fire and ambulance services must be brought up to international standards, there must be no more cuts and the Minister must lift the recruitment embargo so that we have the vehicles and resources to provide the services that save lives. </p>

          <p eId="para_935">We are trying to improve our accident and emergency units yet there is a difficulty in getting the people who most need to arrive there in a timely fashion to these units and a difficulty in how it is organised. The recent "Prime Time" report highlighted in a more global way what many of us saw locally and was very useful from that perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">I would also like to commend the front-line workers but shifts are not being covered and ambulances are just not there. In Maynooth, for example, there is no ambulance on a Thursday so do not get sick in Maynooth or the surrounding area on Thursdays between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. The ambulance is substituted by a paramedic on a motorbike, which might be all right in some circumstances but certainly not if one needs to be rushed to hospital having had a heart attack or been involved in a road traffic accident. </p>
          <p eId="para_937"> The minimum response times are set for a good purpose. They are set because there is a need in very specific circumstances, like in the case of a heart attack, to get people to a hospital within a certain period of time or their chances of survival will reduce. Last year in my constituency, a man and his young son were in view of Naas General Hospital but there was no ambulance available to be deployed. Gardaí succeeded in resuscitating the man at the side of the road but he did not survive. He may not have survived even if he had been taken to the hospital by ambulance but in reality he was not given the kind of chance that he deserved. Not only was he an unfortunate victim in this situation, but his young son was with him at the time and the trauma of seeing this incident will stay with him forever. There is clearly an issue and we are all seeing it. How the service is managed and run and the resources that go into it really need to be got right and I have concerns that it is not at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_938">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion. There is no doubt, following the recent "Prime Time" programme, that there is a heightened level of concern and worry over the ambulance service. Even if we were to go down the route of taking on new recruits and supplying more ambulances, it would take time. The question is how we can move the service on in the short term over the next six to 12 months. I have spoken to paramedics on the ground and while they would all like extra resources, they understand that there would be a time delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> They would also like to see some form of education of the people so that they would understand what the emergency service actually does. I have been contacted by a number of paramedics who said that there is still a certain element of the population who see the emergency service as a taxi service to the hospital. In one case, an individual was in the waiting room of an accident and emergency department in a hospital. He saw ambulances coming in and out and noted that patients were being brought straight in and did not have to wait. He got it into his head that he would be seen quicker if he was in an ambulance. He left the accident and emergency department, went home and called an ambulance. That was an absolute waste of that ambulance's time. Some GPs, but by no means all, who do not want to take a chance or risk with a patient will ring an ambulance. That is also a waste of an ambulance's time, particularly if the situation is not life threatening. People must remember that our paramedics are very highly skilled and trained. The first line of care does not start at the door of the hospital - it starts when the person is met by the paramedic. That is the level of training and skill that paramedics have. They are not simply there to pick up people on the side of the road, put a blanket over them and bring them to hospital. People have to understand more about what our emergency services do.</p>
          <p eId="para_940"> We would like to see more resources going into this area and I call on the Minister to do everything he can on the embargo on staff and so forth in the long term. However, it is important to remember that the job these people do is so highly specialised that getting additional staff is not going to happen overnight. We have heard a lot about the dynamic deployment of staff, which is all well and good but it is more suited to the bigger towns and cities. In County Galway and rural Ireland, that is not so simple. Response times of eight, ten or 12 minutes are just not going to happen. We must accept the fact that it will not happen in the more remote areas. If an ambulance gets to someone within eight minutes but the person dies, is that a success? If an ambulance gets there within nine minutes and the person survives, is that a success? While we are all hell bent on targets tonight, have we actually considered what is best for the patient and what happens to him or her?</p>

          <from>Deputy Jim Daly<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_941">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Of all of the issues that can be debated in this House, very few will generate the kind of emotion that debates on the ambulance service will do. Myself and my colleagues from west Cork have had some first-hand experience of this recently when there was a major reconfiguration of the service there. During the debate a lot of agendas and scores were being settled.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> While I do not ever like to play party politics, it is ironic for the party opposite to have tabled this motion, given that it gifted this Government a service that clearly was not working as it should. They then criticise us when we take on the amount of reform that we have done, through the National Ambulance Service, despite having promised not to do Punch and Judy politics. This is a classic example of opposition for the sake of it. Indeed, some other speakers are guilty of that charge too. I regret that is the case. Everybody opposite has spoken about more resources but I have yet to hear any of them say where they would like the resources to be taken from. Until people stand up and take courageous decisions and rise to that challenge, a lot of what they are doing is empty, nauseating and very dispiriting. It is no wonder that people are so cynical about politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> I mentioned the reform agenda and the reconfiguration that took place. Experience in west Cork demonstrated that the service was in need of very substantial reform. We have moved away from a system where ambulances were on call. In the past, when somebody called an ambulance, a call went through to the drivers who were in bed asleep. It could take up to 20 minutes to mobilise drivers, get them into the ambulances and on the road, heading to rural parts of west Cork. Thankfully, that system is now gone and we have moved to an on-duty system. Ambulances are on duty 24 hours a day and people can now call an ambulance and it is ready to go immediately. In addition, a more important development is the introduction of rapid response cars. There was an issue with ambulances going from places like Clonakilty or Dunmanway to Cork city, waiting outside the accident and emergency department for the trolley to come back, with the ambulance parked up and two paramedics sitting there for hours on end, leaving areas without cover. In that context, I wholeheartedly welcome the introduction of rapid response cars that never leave the area. They constantly drive around and are deployed so that they are within 20 minutes or less of any area in west Cork. If my dad, who is in his 83rd year, had a stroke - God forbid - or my young fella started choking, I would be very grateful to see a rapid response car at my door within ten or 15 minutes, with two highly trained paramedics and the best of equipment in the back. People need to start recognising and appreciating the value of that and understanding that it does not always have to be an ambulance. </p>
          <p eId="para_944"> I concur with the previous speaker on the issue of waste. Paramedics will tell one about people ringing up with very minor and trivial issues but the ambulance crew has no choice but to collect them and bring them to hospital. They can then be left for hours outside the accident and emergency department waiting for the patient to be seen and either discharged or admitted. The new paramedic cars are a very substantial development and I commend the Minister, the HSE and the National Ambulance Service on their introduction. </p>
          <p eId="para_945"> An additional €3.6 million has been invested in the ambulance service this year but I am a firm believer that it is not all about resources. It is about how we do what we do and that is the difference between this Government and our predecessors. The solution to everything from Fianna Fáil for 14 years was to throw more money at it, with the result that we quadrupled the bill for health during that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_947">To quadruple or increase by 400% the health bill is nothing short of shameful. Deputy Kelleher can protests all he likes and sometimes he doth protest too much but it is not about how much we spend. That is not how we are going to be judged and that is not the solution. It is about how we do what we do and about getting value for money because ultimately, we are answerable to the taxpayers. This is not the Government's money nor is it the money of the Department of Health or the Minister. This is the taxpayers' money. We must ensure that reform is what we are all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"> I acknowledge the introduction of intermediate vehicles which serve a very good purpose in transporting patients who are not critically ill. Deputies will have seen them on the road and they are an extremely welcome development. I commend the Minister on the reforms introduced to date and also the paramedics on the wonderful work they do every day. To call the system dysfunctional is disgraceful.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gerald Nash<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_949">I wish to focus on the matter of HIQA response times which are fundamental to this motion. Response time targets were set in 2010 for HIQA. Incredibly, those targets were laid down by a Government that, extraordinarily, did not seem to have the first clue about the capacity of the ambulance service to deliver on those very targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">In other words, the then Government, including Deputy Kelleher, the Minister for Health and HIQA imposed targets without any kind of detailed analysis of the service's ability to meet the very targets they set down in 2010. It was what might be described as a Hail Mary pass to the ambulance service, hit and hope, with no clue as to the number of emergency vehicles, personnel or equipment available to meet the very targets they were determined to hold the HSE and the National Ambulance Service to. This is a damning indictment of the system presided over by the movers of this motion. It is yet another example of back-of-the-envelope style governance from Fianna Fáil, which Deputy Kelleher turned into a fine art. </p>
          <p eId="para_951"> The motion appears to have been scribbled down on the back of a cigarette packet. It implies that there has been a reduction in funding to the National Ambulance Service in recent times, whereas in fact since 2012 there has been a marked increase in the resources available to the service. Extra money is available - up by €9 million on 2012. </p>
          <p eId="para_952"> Neither is there any acknowledgement in the motion of an important development in the ambulance service which will take place this year. That is the migration from the blunt metric of measuring ambulance response times to a system of measuring actual clinical outcomes. Bizarrely, under the current set of indicators, if a patient subsequently dies but the ambulance has arrived on time - and within the target response time set down by HIQA - that is considered to be a good call. Nowhere else would this be considered acceptable, so I am glad that is set to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> The motion conveniently ignores the fact that a full-scale capacity review of the ambulance service across the State has been initiated. I understand that the review, which will take six months to complete, is under way. Fianna Fáil abjectly failed to have one done before response time targets were introduced, yet now they conveniently choose to ignore the fact that the capacity review is under way at all. It has not been mentioned in the motion. </p>
          <p eId="para_954"> The ambulance service is unrecognisable now compared to ten or 15 years ago. The staff are extremely well trained to top international standards. It is about time we had that capacity review and I am pleased it is under way. If extra resources are required, I am sure a way will be found to secure them for the staff and citizens who rely on the service. If the service needs to be reorganised, I am certain that staff and management will respond accordingly.</p>

          <p eId="para_956">I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. Recently, alarmist headlines have been appearing in local newspapers. Deputy Moynihan has been saying that ambulance services in north Cork are a cause for serious concern. A HSE worker claimed that people will die as a result of these changes. These exaggerated claims are adding to people's concerns, particularly in rural areas. Changes in systems always cause some concern, but this concern is unjustified. We live in changing times with new technologies, new ways of treating emergencies, better qualifications and a free hospital environment. There are new centres of excellence where patients are assessed on the scene and transported to the most appropriate hospital. This could involve bypassing the nearest hospital to a specialised unit where better results can be achieved. The National Ambulance Service is not static and must regularly evaluate its resources in line with new developments in medical treatment and advancing technologies.</p>
          <p eId="para_957"> A service that is stuck in antiquated services is no longer the best way of serving patients in changing times. Having ambulances stuck in areas that are not being used is not the best use of our scarce resources. There would be just cause for concern if the ambulance service was not continually taking into account changes in our infrastructure and medical technology, as well as improved methods of treatment. </p>
          <p eId="para_958"> In the past, artificial lines on a map sometimes designated which ambulance would respond. The newer system ensures that the nearest appropriate response is mobilised to the location of the incident. Under the new system resources will be sourced from all stations within Cork and surrounding counties to support the delivery of pre-hospital emergency care. </p>
          <p eId="para_959"> The new national ambulance control centre is a single point of contact for answering and directing all emergency calls. This will reduce the potential for error regarding boundaries which in the past have not always enabled the nearest available resource to be dispatched in the case of an emergency. </p>
          <p eId="para_960"> The system also ensures that the most appropriate skilled paramedic or advanced paramedic will be dispatched based on a patient's clinical needs. This will help to achieve the best possible outcome for patients. In the past because there was not the same pre-hospital assessment, a patient was taken to the nearest hospital which in many instances did not have appropriate facilities to deal with the particular incident. For instance, all patients seriously injured in a road collision, fall or assault are assessed on the spot, provided with immediate treatment and then transported to the hospital that has specialist expertise to treat the injuries, even though this may not be the nearest hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> It is estimated that this can lower mortality rates by up to 25%. Equally, all children are now only transported to hospitals with a specific paediatric expertise on that hospital site. In the past, children were often taken to the nearest hospital which may not have had any paediatric or appropriate staff to deal with the situation. </p>
          <p eId="para_962"> Medical science, devices and systems are advancing and changing continuously, which is welcome. However, this demands constant changes in transforming the health service, all of which are aimed at improving outcomes for patients and clients. The National Ambulance Service has a key role to play in this process and in doing so will encounter challenges in the current environment. However, the main objective is to strive continually to provide the highest level of pre-hospital emergency care, including getting a paramedic to the scene within eight minutes and, ideally, an ambulance within 19 minutes. </p>
          <p eId="para_963"> I agree with the statement contained in the amendment and acknowledge the selfless dedication of our paramedics and the high quality of care they provide. I had a private experience of this recently and I can say that the paramedic arrived within 12 minutes, while the ambulance arrived within about half an hour of the paramedic. The care provided was absolutely excellent. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_964">In the course of this debate we can all agree not only on the importance of the National Ambulance Service but also the very good service provided over the decades, along with the changes that have occurred within the service. Irrespective of which side of the motion we are on, I think we can all agree to that. I have no disagreement with some of the comments that were quite rightly made last night about the professionalism of those working within the ambulance service and the level of care those men and women provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> It is appropriate to say that, like those working with the fire brigade and frontline hospital services, we do not appreciate ambulance service staff until we need them in our own homes. It is only when such services are required on our doorstep that we appreciate their value.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> People working for the ambulance service in Dublin and elsewhere can describe the changes that have taken place. That is because nothing stands still and Irish society has changed so much, including lifestyles and increased car ownership. All these societal changes, in turn, influence the sort of service that is provided by the National Ambulance Service which has had to change with them. Ambulance staff will testify that this is not a problem. </p>
          <p eId="para_967"> Both trade unions representing ambulance staff in Dublin, SIPTU and IMPACT, have welcomed the review of the service in the city. That is a good and progressive thing. I will not go into too much of the detail as most previous speakers have referred to it, but we await the outcome of the review. A review of services is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it has more positives than negatives. If it leads to a better ambulance service, we should welcome it. That is what the people who provide the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service are saying. They welcome the review and, particularly, its independence, which is very important. I await the outcome of the review. We will all take notice of it and see what beneficial changes can be made.</p>

          <p eId="para_968">Legitimate questions and concerns have been raised on foot of the motion. However, it is ironic that the party across the House is moving it when it has sent the chickens home to roost on this and so many other issues wreaking havoc on society. Out of service to the people and to ensure they are getting a proper ambulance service, the matter must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_969"> I refer to a number of welcome initiatives which have been undertaken by the National Ambulance Service, including the development of an intermediate care service, which is specifically focused on the delivery of inter-hospital transfers. That frees up existing emergency resources to focus on responding to emergency calls. Issues such as the ones to which Deputy Connaughton referred can be tackled this way. Where acute ambulance services are required, they are ring-fenced and the resources are not used for run of the mill work that could be done by lower grade non-health transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_970"> In my area, I welcome the frequent use of the air ambulance. Ours is the third largest county and there are vast rural areas where there is no way an individual suffering a severe heart attack could get to University College Hospital, Galway within the golden hour to be treated properly. I am aware of many cases in which the air ambulance has been called out and all has been well for the individuals concerned. I am glad to say so. It is a welcome, nuanced approach to the sort of health care sensitivity we need for people in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_971"> I acknowledge the development and support of training for advanced paramedics. Their service means that people can receive treatment and early intervention even before they reach hospital. That can help medical staff in hospitals to do their job and ensure the best possible outcome for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> There is no denying there is cause for concern, and certainly in my own county in relation to response times in certain cases. I understand why. There is a personnel problem. If a member of a two-person team goes out sick, there is no overtime available to allow the team to operate with someone else. This is in a vast rural county which has bad roads. The periods of time people have had to wait in some cases are unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> As part of the review, the cost of the contracts of private ambulance operators must be considered. I am told that the particular contract which affects Mayo, which I understand is a national contract, could be done for half the price by a local operator to the same standard. However, the rules around procurement do not allow it. The challenge is, perhaps, to take money from those contracts and invest it in the direct employment of ambulance personnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> I pay tribute to the ambulance staff and paramedics on the ground who do a very fine job. Many people have had great experiences with them. I am particularly familiar with the personnel operating in my county. I welcome the review of ambulance services, which is timely. There has been a great deal of scaremongering and we understand how that works in politics. However, we all want to know there is a sound ambulance service. I look forward to the review of response times. I expect resources to be put into the areas, particularly rural areas, that need them on a wider basis than size of population.</p>

          <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_975">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. I agree with only two lines of it, which are the references to "the selfless dedication to their work, of the paramedics in our ambulance service" and "the high quality of care that they provide". I will speak first about targets and ambulance response times, which are vital. The current targets are not satisfactory. We are moving the target to 80% but should be setting an even higher one. We need to set a standard for the people to believe. It is ironic that Fianna Fáil has mentioned targets for the first time in the context of the ambulance service. The only target Fianna Fáil ever set was a target of 300,000 people who would become unemployed during the tail end of its reign. It was a disgraceful target.</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> My concern is about the centralisation of control and dispatch. Local knowledge is vital. We need further training on that for paramedics, particularly those who are newly qualified. Wherever they are sent, they should have proper coaching on locations. The thing I took from the "Prime Time" documentary was that it is sometimes important for a patient to know how long an ambulance will take to arrive or where it is coming from. If a person was close to a hospital but the ambulance was coming from a more distant location, he or she might be moved in a different way. We may have learned from the failures that have occurred to give people more information.</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> The current system is undergoing a transformation. It is vital to change the way we do our business. The most important thing to do is find a smarter way to spend the money we have. We are modernising and reconfiguring. It is important to ensure there are no longer county boundaries or districts within the ambulance service. We are introducing reforms. It is important to recognise that quality of care is not necessarily about the presence of an ambulance but the attendance of a person who has the relevant knowledge. In that regard, the attendance of a rapid response vehicle was vital in an incident at a swimming pool in Maynooth. The crew member had the necessary knowledge of how to treat the children involved. It is vital to look at getting people to the scene to help rather than necessarily to demand an ambulance every time.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> There has been criticism of where the service has gone. The statistics indicate that there are in fact 300 more paramedics than there were in 2008 at the end of the Celtic tiger period. The population was not that much different then but the spend by the previous Government on the paramedic service was abysmal. We have 534 vehicles in the ambulance fleet, which is an increase of 74 since 2010. Rapid response vehicles represent an exciting way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> We have spoken throughout the debate about target times. It is not always about that. The most important thing to do is to try to save people's lives. If an ambulance arrives late according to the target time but saves a person's life, that is the most important thing. I support fully what we are doing to reform the service and ensure we get people on the scene as quickly as possible, albeit not necessarily in an ambulance.</p>

          <p eId="para_981"> The practices in place in some of our hospitals mean ambulances travel massive distances of geographical terrain thanks to reconfiguration.

          <p eId="para_992">I commend Deputy Kelleher on the motion. I like the mention he made of providing an ambulance service of the highest international standard. It is a noble aspiration. He clearly pointed out the great work done by paramedics, but they need to be properly resourced. It would be very difficult to have a service which is of the highest international standards if the budget is cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> I will speak about rural areas because it is more difficult to establish an ambulance base in such areas and to have a safe and efficient ambulance service when cutbacks are made. The example I will use is the town of Tuam which has an ambulance base. I was one of many public representatives who fought for more than 15 years to have a base established there. When we got it we expected a 24-hour service but what we got was a day service and even this is not fully operational. It is disappointing a town such as Tuam, which is not small and has a hinterland covering north Galway and south Mayo, does not have a base which is open 24 hours. It has more than 30,000 people in the catchment area, €2 million has been spent on the building and the trade unions have been fighting a very strong case on behalf of their staff. The personnel are very well qualified and provide high-quality care in the region. They are very dedicated to their work, and they work under very great pressure. Some of the staff are trained at St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe. At present Galway city is being used as a base with all of the congestion which goes with it and the traffic on the Tuam to Galway road. We are waiting for work on the motorway from Gort to Tuam to begin but the contract has not been signed on it yet. I hope it will soon open. There are other bases in Loughrea and Carraroe but Galway seems to be the base for our area.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> I commend in particular the great work done by the Order of Malta and the Red Cross. I understand in the past grant aid was given to these organisations to purchase voluntary ambulances but the staff are not regarded as qualified. I cannot understand this. I raised this as a Topical Issues matter recently and it seems even though they are very fine organisations their staff are not considered qualified.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> "Prime Time" brought this matter to our attention with the fine programme on the reality of what is happening to the ambulance service. It highlighted the large number of people in rural areas and the fact staff are not being transferred to areas such as Tuam where they are needed. When the Minister replied to the Topical Issues matter I raised he stated the 2014 national service plan includes a reform programme with additional funding of €3.6 million and 43 staff. I do not see the results of this investment in the western region. The fact the Tuam base is not fully operational shows it is not apparent. There is a particular challenge in rural areas so let us see some of this funding. I hope the Government will consider the north Galway and south Mayo area, which is one of the biggest catchment areas without an ambulance service.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> The health correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, Eilish O'Regan, recently wrote that HIQA is conducting a six-month review of the ambulance services. I hope this review will be done very soon. The situation is urgent and needs action. I had representations from the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, which raised the issue of the worrying rise in the number of serious delays in response times. The NASRA stated it does not have the personnel or vehicles to meet the targets and it is time for the service to accept these targets are unrealistic unless cutbacks are reversed. This clearly states the situation. A national control centre is to be put in place and steps are being taken in this regard. I certainly hope this happens. I am sure the Minister of State agrees that where a building is available, such as that in Tuam, it should be staffed, training should be provided and the ambulances should be put in place. I hope this can happen quickly in the case of Tuam.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_997">I join my colleagues in commending our health spokesperson, Deputy Kelleher, for tabling this motion and allowing two evenings of debate on what is a critical issue of exceptional importance and concern throughout the country. I am sure the Minister of State will acknowledge this, particularly as a result of the very effective investigative work done by "Prime Time", which highlighted real deficiencies and the stretched resources our ambulance service must deal with on a daily and nightly basis in various parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> I commend the Trojan work done by the highly trained staff in the ambulance service throughout the country. I am sure the Minister of State will join me in commending them for the work they do. It is not something everybody has the ability or strength to do because it is a very difficult job and requires an ability to deal with very stressful situations. Those who work in it must have a vocational spirit to be able to take on the role and carry it out as they do day in and night out. Unfortunately, we have not supported them sufficiently, or in the way we should, to enable them to carry out the role. They try to do it as best they can with the resources allocated to them but they are human and can only manage a certain amount of work. They cannot be in two places at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> The Minister of State is aware that my county of Donegal has had very unfortunate situations where target ambulance response times have not been met. I will reference one very unfortunate case which has been dealt with in the House before.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">The family of Maura Porter, who unfortunately lost her life on 30 December 2013 as a result of a road traffic accident in Carndonagh, County Donegal, has been very strong in putting across their experience and in trying to ensure no other family has to experience a similar situation again. It took up to 50 minutes for an ambulance to attend the scene of the accident, in which Maura was a pedestrian, even though there is an ambulance station approximately half a mile from there. Unfortunately, Maura passed away some time after she reached the hospital. Members of her family who live right beside the scene of the accident spent an excruciating 40 or 50 minutes at her side as they waited for the ambulance to come. They will never know whether it might have made a difference and she might have survived if she had been treated earlier, but they want to ensure - at a minimum - that no other family has to experience this type of situation in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> Unfortunately, people in Donegal and other parts of the country have been unable to get the necessary reassurance that the relevant and required resources are in place to ensure calls can be responded to in the shortest time possible; indeed, within the target times that have been set. Deputies have mentioned other cases from across the country which support the contention that the fact that ambulance response times are not being met is evidence that our resources are over-stretched. In June of last year, 45% of Echo calls and 49% of Delta calls in the west were responded to within the target time. The figures in the north west were 75% and 62%, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> I know there have been some changes within the ambulance service. It has been moving from an on-call service at night time to a rostered service. I think that is a constructive move in that one can now be sure that those staff are actually on duty, as opposed to being at their homes, when a call might come in. That should lead to faster response times. Unfortunately, that can only be the case if they are actually at base when the call comes in. It will depend on whether someone has the misfortune to take ill after an ambulance has been called away on a call and has not been replaced, and there is no replacement ambulance within a reasonable distance of that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> In the Carndonagh example that I mentioned, there is a station beside the location of the unfortunate accident. There used to be two ambulances on call during the day and one ambulance on call at night. As a result of the move away from on-call to rostering, that has moved to a situation where there is one ambulance rostered all day and one rostered at night. In order to try to keep two ambulances per day in the station, there is supposed to be an ambulance sent from Letterkenny every morning to back that up. Unfortunately, that is not happening in reality. If the ambulance is on call at night, no ambulance is sent in to take up its position. This means that if a second call comes in, one has to depend on being lucky enough to have an ambulance in place. Otherwise, an ambulance might have to make a one-way trip of 40 or 50 minutes to reach an emergency case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> Many Government Deputies have spoken about successful outcomes. Is the success of an outcome dictated by the treatment that is provided to the patient when the ambulance actually arrives? Is the success or otherwise of the call-out dictated by how the patient responds or by how quickly the ambulance arrives? When people speak about successful outcomes, I wonder whether they are somehow trying to diminish the importance of getting there on time. There is no doubt that when the ambulance gets there, the treatment that is made available to the patient is crucial. We have ambulance staff who are exceptionally well trained to do the best they can when they arrive on-site. There is no doubt that the time involved in getting there - the speed with which the ambulance gets there - is crucial to outcomes. The sooner the ambulance personnel can get there to provide expert treatment and bring the patient to hospital, the higher the chance of a successful outcome and the higher the chance of the patient making a full recovery, particularly in cases of cardiac arrest and stroke.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> We need to see what the type of investment that Deputy Kelleher has outlined in his motion. This investment is necessary to increase the number of personnel, facilities and ambulances to the level necessary to enable ambulance staff to meet the targets that have been set. It is also needed so that people throughout the country can be confident that the service which is in place will be available to them if they ever need to use it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1006">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Private Members' debate. Unlike some Deputies on the other side of the House, I have consistently spoken on health matters during my time in this House, as I did when I was in the Seanad. I am glad that my party's health spokesman, Deputy Kelleher, has given us an opportunity to discuss this issue as part of the business of the House. Deputy O'Donovan and others have failed to recognise that those of us who were elected for Fianna Fáil - there might be fewer of us than we might like - have a mandate to raise issues of national importance. There is a legitimacy to the existence of the Opposition. It is not all about doing the political thing by saying "they are all bad and we are all good". Notwithstanding where we have come from, I think we are in a position to contribute to debates of this nature by virtue of our understanding of the issue and the interaction we have with our constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> I am certainly not here to knock the ambulance service or say that it is all wrong. I am sure the same thing applies to Deputy Kelleher - he will speak for himself - and to other Deputies. The ambulance service does an exceptionally good job. It delivers very well for many people most of the time. If we have learned anything from recent history, particularly in relation to the way our economy was run, it is that we should not be afraid to look beneath the bonnet, question the norms that have existed heretofore or challenge the current thinking. We must be able to engage in a critical and dispassionate analysis of the issues in the best interests of the people who put us here and who we are here to represent. We should be able to do that in a collective way. I appreciate that the business of the House requires Opposition parties to use Private Members' time to propose motions. I accept that the Government will usually try to amend those motions and win the vote at the end of the debate. We all know that is what ultimately happens. Everybody has a capacity to bring forward ideas and identify problems in a way that improves services in the long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008"> There have been significant advances in the quality of the vehicles used by the ambulance service. The move towards single ambulances that carry just one patient has required an increase in the number of ambulances. There was a time when an ambulance was little better than a meat truck. We have moved beyond the era when injured people were thrown in, piled up and taken to the closest hospital. The quality of the service is much better now. We now have a high-quality air ambulance service. Without seeking to applaud previous Governments, I should mention that many of these improvements were put in train under the reconfiguration process that was initiated by Mary Harney when she was Minister for Health and Children. There are some people who are taking credit today for what has been achieved without referring to when these things happened. It is understandable that there might be some confusion as there were many changes in health service delivery during that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> As well as being critical of us, Deputy O'Donovan complimented the great service in Limerick. While I agree to some extent with what he said, he failed to recognise that the manager of the ambulance service participated in a recent "Prime Time" programme that was very critical of the service. She was identified as a whistleblower. One cannot have it both ways. We must look to the people who have identified the weaknesses and the flaws.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> We have had some progress in terms of the provision of advanced paramedics, which certainly has been effective. However, the whole reconfiguration process has put a greater burden on the ambulance service. It is a pity that Deputy Patrick O'Donovan clearly did not prepare for this debate and instead decided simply to come in and throw a few political balls about the place. He did himself a disservice in so doing because it showed a fundamental weakness in his understanding of the way in which the health service has changed. Reconfiguration was never about saving money. It was about improving the outcome for the patient and ensuring a greater level of patient safety. I supported the proposal, as did others who are now in opposition, against the bleating of the then Opposition, both Labour Party and Fine Gael Members, that patients would die. Deputy O'Donovan's colleagues in my county erected posters, developed a campaign and frightened people by claiming that reconfiguration of the health service would lead to the deaths of 20 people in Clare every year. I have challenged all of them on that claim but none has come forward with any sound statistics to back it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> Of course, what they predicted has not come to pass. However, reconfiguration has put a greater burden on the hospital in Limerick, on accident and emergency services and on bed capacity. It also has imposed a greater burden on the ambulance service. The increased investment which took place when the reconfiguration was initiated was not enough and will not be enough to reach the targets set down by the Health Information and Quality Authority. It would be nice if colleagues on the Government benches who have the benefit of following in the wake of those of us who had to take the bullets to get reconfiguration through would at least accept their role in taking it to the next stage, which is building on the foundations that were created and continuing to roll out an enhanced ambulance service. That is the job in which the advanced paramedics and first responders are engaged. They provide a wonderful service, but there are not enough of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> None of us here is blinded by delusions of there being some endless pot of money at the end of the rainbow. There is no expectation on this side of the House that the Government can simply click its fingers and deliver everything that is needed. There must, however, be a planned approach. If we saw a coherent plan coming forward from the Government or the Health Service Executive which showed a capacity to build towards acceptable norms as set down by HIQA over a defined period, everyone would accept we were on the right track. What we have instead, however, is some members of the Government parties, Fine Gael in particular, proclaiming at every opportunity that a little growth in the economy will allow the Government to offer tax breaks at the next budget. That is being done because we happen to be in an election environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and other members of her party, they have not engaged in that type of auction politics. The Minister of State knows full well, in the brief she holds, that there are very significant gaps in service delivery. Those gaps can be seen in the ambulance service, in elder care, and in services for people with disabilities and mental illness. The Minister of State is struggling to find the cash to do what she wants to do. In fairness to her, she has rightly indicated her view that if moneys become available as a result of an upturn in the economy, they should be used to fill those gaps. That is the correct approach, not a return to the auction politics of the past, at which, I acknowledge, my party was as good as Fine Gael is showing itself to be. I assure the House that we have learned our lesson, but from what I saw of the antics of the Deputy from Limerick tonight, who really should know better, I can have no confidence that the other party in government has taken that lesson on board. However, fair play to the Labour Party for challenging Fine Gael in its auction approach to politics. We saw it again today, with Members briefing journalists and then denying they had done so. It is all about courting popular opinion on the cusp of an election when all the opinion polls are showing that Fine Gael is taking almost as hard a battering as the Labour Party. At least the Minister of State's party has been upfront in accepting the responsibility that befell it upon coming to power.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> I appeal to Fine Gael Members to approach this issue with an open mind. I ask that they at least be prepared to accept that while a great deal has been done, there remains a significant amount of work to do, and that when funds become available, as they will with the pick-up in the economy, those moneys should be used to improve and enhance services, including the ambulance service, in a manner that meets the needs of diversely populated rural areas and benefits all.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_444">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1015">There are three official ambulance blackspots designated by the National Ambulance Service, namely, Tuam in County Galway, Mulranny in Mayo, and the west Roscommon-east Mayo area. The National Ambulance Service has spent €1.74 million putting in new ambulance stations at each of those locations, including at Loughglynn in County Roscommon in the case of the west Roscommon-east Mayo area. The new policy of the ambulance service of dynamic deployment means there no longer needs to be an ambulance station but only a parking bay and toilet facilities for ambulance crews. We have a situation now where the facilities are there but there are no ambulances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> Based on a comparison with Northern Ireland, we have approximately one third of the ambulances needed to provide an adequate emergency service across the country. As I said, bases have been installed in the three nationally recognised ambulance blackspots, yet we have no money to provide ambulances or crews to serve those bases. As a result, the National Ambulance Service is obliged to borrow ambulances from Ballinasloe, Galway, Castlebar and Roscommon town, with those stations left scrambling to find vehicles to respond to emergencies. This is the reason we are failing to meet the HIQA targets for the west, where fewer than one in every two ambulances arrives within the 90 minute target and where, in fewer than one in five cases, a first responder, be that a paramedic, doctor or a person with a defibrillator, arrives on the scene within eight minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> People argue that it is all about outcomes. However, if there is no ambulance and no first responder at the scene of an incident, there will not be a positive outcome. It is important to bear in mind that these are HIQA standards. The Government has used standards set by that independent body to justify its reconfiguration of other services. The existing ambulance service needs to be reconfigured to meet the standards that have been set out and the requirements of the public. What is happening at the moment in my part of the country is a case of death by geography, because we do not have the required number of ambulances. We need more ambulances and more ambulance crews, and we need them now.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1018">I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to the motion brought before the House in the name of my party's health spokesperson, Deputy Billy Kelleher. It is a timely motion which arises in the context of the recent "Prime Time" programme and on the basis of individual incidents and anecdotal evidence regarding the ambulance service generally throughout the State. The reality is that ambulance response times are unsatisfactory by both national and international standards for a whole range of reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> I take this opportunity to express my admiration for the exceptionally well-trained and dedicated staff who man the ambulance service nationwide. The difficulties we are experiencing with the service are a question of resources. The retired national director of the ambulance service said at the end of 2011 that an additional 300 personnel were required as well as an investment of €30 million plus on the capital side to bring the service up to standard and ensure nationwide response time targets were met. That is a very significant investment by any measure in what is a vital element of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> The obvious question that comes to mind in this discussion is whether we can afford to adopt the motto of doing more with less when it comes to the ambulance service. Whatever about other areas of the health service, it seems clear it is not a motto which fits this particular service. We have had two incidents in Drogheda, in very close proximity to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, where ambulances were not available to respond to emergency incidents. This happened in Drogheda, where the demographics are relatively good as far as the delivery of an ambulance service is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">In counties such as Roscommon, Donegal and others along the western seaboard, the delivery of ambulance services is a much more challenging prospect in light of the distances which must be travelled. There is a need to address this issue as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> Statistics for the north-east region show that between 2012 and 2013, the number of rostered paramedic hours at Dunshaughlin ambulance base was cut from 336 to 312 per week. Cover at the bases in Ardee, County Louth, and Virginia, County Cavan, was cut by 24 hours per week during the same period. The Dundalk and Monaghan bases lost 48 hours. Simple arithmetic shows that if this sort of curtailment is imposed on the ambulance service, response times - as has now proven to be the case - will inevitably suffer. If individuals throughout the country unnecessarily lose their lives as a result of the fact that response times are longer than should be the case, this places a serious burden on the health service in general and on the political leadership within it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> I wish to refer to something which, I am sure, is an occupational hazard for members of the ambulance service but which should not be. On 1 April last - Members will note the significance of the date - a bogus call for assistance was made to the ambulance base in Dundalk. The caller apparently indicated that a 14-year old girl was in labour at a location which is not a huge distance from the base. Given that it was an emergency situation, a fully-manned ambulance and rapid responsible vehicle were dispatched to answer the call. I will not repeat what was said to the staff involved when they arrived at the scene. I will state, however, that it was very unsatisfactory. I do not know if this type of behaviour has been replicated elsewhere throughout the country but I have no doubt that action must be taken in respect of it. I understand that the incident in Dundalk has been reported to the Garda Síochána which, I am sure, will take the appropriate action. It is difficult enough to deliver ambulance services within the constraints to which reference has been made. If, however, bogus calls are being made and are placing additional pressure on the service in general, that is extremely unsatisfactory, appalling and should be condemned by all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is present. She has a social conscience when it comes to most matters and I know she will empathise with the points being made by Members on this side of the House in the context of the delivery of ambulance services. This matter needs to be addressed urgently. Additional resources must be allocated to the national ambulance service because, as already stated, it is not possible to do more with less in the context of the delivery of ambulance services in this country. The resources to which I refer must be provided as soon as possible. The Estimate for the Department of Health is most likely under consideration at present in preparation for the budget that will be introduced later in the year. I ask the Minister of State to examine the position of the ambulance service in the context of that Estimate. My constituents in Louth and east Meath would certainly appreciate an increase in the expenditure relating to the general service.</p>

          <p eId="para_1025">I thank those who made contributions to the debate up to now. I must admit that I did not hear all of the contributions but I will very much take on board what was said during those for which I was present. I wish to express my thanks to the people who crew ambulances throughout the country. I recently had an opportunity to be very thankful for those individuals. As Deputy McConalogue correctly stated, treatment begins when a highly trained paramedic or first responder attends at the scene of an accident. That is why what these people do is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026"> The Minister, Deputy Reilly, outlined the significant reform programme currently under way within our ambulance services. Everyone acknowledges that this programme has been put in place. We are making progress and additional resources have been provided to the national ambulance service, NAS, to facilitate further developments. Additional funding of €3.6 million and 43 extra staff were provided in 2014. The NAS is working to ensure the provision of high-quality and timely emergency pre-hospital care services, using all available resources as effectively and as efficiently as possible. However, as with any pre-hospital service, the process of development and modernisation is ongoing, particularly as technology and clinical standards change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> A number of Deputies referred to the use of officer response vehicles. While usage of these vehicles is currently under examination by the NAS, I should clarify that officers use official vehicles in line with NAS policy on the authorised use of official vehicles. Use of a vehicle out of hours may be approved by a senior manager where it is necessary for an officer to be on call. Deputy McConalogue explained the difference between rostering and being on call very well. Use of a vehicle out of hours could include parking it overnight at an officer's home in order to facilitate on-call availability. Officers using vehicles out of hours are qualified to respond to life-threatening calls. These vehicles can be tracked by control centres and are available for dispatch. It is important to note that the vehicles in question are a valuable additional resource, particularly as officers provide an emergency service in their communities outside normal working hours. Officers are not paid an on-call allowance and respond to these calls on a <i>pro-bono</i> basis. In the first quarter of this year, officer vehicles responded to over 630 incidents. More than 250 of these occurred outside working hours and the officers involved received no payment for their attendance in respect of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028"> A number of Deputies also raised issues relating to ambulance coverage in specific areas. They may wish to note that an independent review of NAS capacity nationwide is currently under way. This review will provide greater clarity while also determining the level and use of resourcing required in terms of staff, vehicles, skills and distribution for the provision of a safe and effective service now and into the future. It is accepted that we need to further improve the service. The single national control system, which is due for completion in 2015, will improve our control and dispatch performance. We are also continuing to develop the intermediate care service, which is specifically focused on non-emergency clinical transport, such as inter-hospital transfers and low acuity work. This frees up emergency resources - which traditionally provided such services - to focus on more urgent calls. In order to drive improvement, performance response time targets for 2014 in respect of high acuity emergency calls have been increased in the service plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029"> Further areas for improvement will be identified by the three separate reviews of pre-hospital care which are currently under way. I have already mentioned the capacity review. In addition, HIQA is examining governance arrangements to ensure the timely assessment, diagnosis, initial management and transport of acutely ill patients to appropriate care. A joint review of Dublin ambulance services, commissioned by Dublin City Council and the HSE, will determine the best model of ambulance services for the city. The reports relating to these reviews will inform the development of a modern, clinically-driven system - properly resourced - which will deliver appropriate and timely services for the benefit of patients. I assure the House that the NAS will continue to modernise and reconfigure services in order to deliver the best possible level of pre-hospital emergency care.</p>

          <p eId="para_1030">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this timely and important debate. We have witnessed the fanfare relating to the reforms of the ambulance service and we have been informed that the latter has been hugely improved. I have grave concerns with regard to the service, particularly in the context of how it operates in rural communities. The Duhallow area where I reside is now served by an ambulance shared between Millstreet and Killarney. Anyone who is familiar with the geography of the region will be aware that the distances involved are quite large. Prior to the introduction of the shared service, another ambulance had already been removed from the Duhallow area and replaced with a rapid response vehicle. Individuals and families unfortunate enough to have been obliged to depend on the service were frustrated by the amount of time they were obliged to wait for the ambulance or rapid response vehicle to arrive. This matter was recently the subject of a debate on the local radio station.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">One of the people administering or working within the service texted in. Obviously, he could not give his name because of the position he held. He stated categorically that he was seriously frustrated, that morale was decidedly low and that they were challenged in every which way. Let us consider the geography of it. Let us suppose an ambulance picks up a patient in the Duhallow region, Millstreet, Kanturk or Newmarket and then travels to Cork, which is approximately one hour away. The paramedics must stay with the patient until he is admitted or whatever and they are there all day. This means the entire western Duhallow region and east Kerry is without an ambulance for the duration. There is a major need to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> We met representatives of the HSE when they were discussing taking one ambulance out of the region. They gave us various glowing statistics and figures relating to what would happen in future and suggested that the control unit would know the level of oil in the engines of the ambulances and the pressure of the tyres and so forth. This has proved not to be the case in recent times and ambulances have broken down at various stages. These cases have been well documented in the media, they are in the public domain and I have no wish to go into them because I have no wish to infringe on the families involved or their privacy. Evidence exists to show that the service, as reconfigured, is not working. There is a serious need for a review of the whole situation to prevent any serious incidents arising. Specifically, in the case of my region, it is not acceptable to take an ambulance out of what we would call north Cork but what is now being banded by the HSE as north Cork-east Kerry, a great raft of countryside. It is not acceptable and it will not work. I imagine if this continues many cases will be highlighted in the media in respect of people waiting. In certain cases people have had to wait for one hour, an hour and a half or two hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> The accident and emergency service has been taken out of Mallow General Hospital and since then Cork has become the port of call. I was in an ambulance after a relative of mine was involved in a road traffic accident. The ambulance leaving the road traffic accident was going to Cork but midway <i>en route</i> had to divert to Mallow because the patient, an uncle of mine, was in serious danger. Thankfully, he got to Mallow and was able to be resuscitated before he was moved on to Cork. There is a serious issue in this regard. I speak from deep experience in respect of having to wait for ambulances for over one hour. This was the position before the reconfiguration. I shudder to think what it will be like in future. This is relevant not simply because the matter was highlighted on "Prime Time". Many of us are hearing about it daily in our constituency offices. This is one of the most pressing issues that must be dealt with. What is being rolled out is not for the better.</p>

          <p eId="para_1034">I acknowledge the dedication, commitment and, above all, the actions of Deputy Billy Kelleher, who has achieved a significant public service by providing for this debate. The motion we have placed before the Dáil boils down to the assertion of two simple factual statements. Our ambulance services are under-resourced and, as a consequence, we are placing people's lives at risk. The only appropriate response to these facts is for the Minister of State and her colleagues in Cabinet to consider resourcing the ambulance service appropriately. Instead, we and the public are being presented with a Government counter motion that one could only argue is a work of fiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035"> I offer an example from my constituency, Galway East. In 2012, a new ambulance base was built at a cost of €1.7 million and opened in Tuam to service north County Galway. As welcome as this was, the issue of staffing arrangements in the base continued to be a source of great concern to my community. We take the word of paramedics over the word of the HSE senior managers and officials in the Department. I maintain front-line staff provide a great picture of the reality of what is taking place in the service. The base in Tuam is only staffed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from Galway City and, sometimes, Ballinasloe. For the most part it is only covered by a two to three days per week, 12-hour roster. On certain weeks there are no rostered staff there. This is relevant since the response time to Tuam from Galway city is 30 minutes on a good day. On a bad day it can be between 40 to 50 minutes before an ambulance arrives. For example, response times to Glenamaddy, an area of north County Galway, can take up to 50 minutes on a good day. Sometimes, Galway city is unable to respond and therefore an ambulance is dispatched from Loughrea. The response time for the Tuam area can be up to one hour, and this is not an acceptable situation. It makes a mockery of the 19-minutes target quoted in the Government counter-motion. The Government has referred to the strategic deployment of ambulances. In previous responses, the Government used to refer to dynamic deployment, but the spin seems to have been upgraded and it is simply not working.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> There is no talk today of strategic deployment to address the situation in Tuam and north County Galway. One paramedic put it to me that while paramedics were well-trained and capable of delivering high quality care, often patients do not need a paramedic carer but rather to get to hospital as quickly as possible. They need to get towards a centre of excellence at maximum speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037"> In the current situation, this Government is riding its luck in rural Ireland. Last year, only one in three people with a life-threatening condition were responded to inside the target times. In my area, this has been evident in several high profile cases. This time last year, I put forward suggestions under a Topical Issues debate to facilitate providing for staffing levels on a 24 hour, seven day basis for the existing ambulance services in County Galway on the basis of providing a full-time 5/7 or 7/7 roster for Tuam. In response, the Minister of State said at the time that the proposition was eminently practical. More than one and a half years has passed since that eminently practical proposition but nothing has happened in respect of the staffing levels in Tuam, and north County Galway continues to be at risk. It is considered a blackspot area with respect to coverage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038"> I call on the Cabinet colleagues of the Minister of State to stop playing Russian roulette with my community. This is not fiction and no doubt the counter-motion is not based in reality. I call on the Minister of State to consider carefully how she could provide for an adequate level of resources for Tuam and north County Galway. It is inexplicable that we have a situation whereby €1.7 million of capital spend took place in 2010-2011 and yet there is no staffing provision for a roster. It is not acceptable that people have to wait up to one hour or an hour and a half to have the services of an emergency medical technician and access to the general hospital. I call on the Minister of State to act on this. The situation is a source of great concern and I call on the Minister of State to respond to us in that respect.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_449">
          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2014-04-16T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1039">I welcome the contributions from everyone with regard to this motion. The purpose of the motion was not to scaremonger or frighten people. It was simply to highlight the inadequacies of a service that is critical to many people. We have been accused of Punch and Judy politics. I do not mind being accused of being Punch or, for that matter, Judy, but I would be failing in my duty if I did not raise this issue because it is an issue of key concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> There has been couched language from the Government Deputies in their support for the Government motion. At the same time, they raised legitimate concerns in mild language. Perhaps I am more direct but the bottom line is that there are major problems with our ambulance service. It is not meeting the required targets as laid down by the Health Information and Quality Authority. It is under-resourced and understaffed. By any stretch of the imagination, to deny that this is the case leads me to believe that we have a greater problem with regard to the provision of emergency care in the country than I had thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> We have had members and representatives of the HSE National Ambulance Service before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. They were at pains to say that things are okay. However, we have discussed the matter with front-line personnel, including advanced paramedics, paramedics and the people driving the ambulances. They have informed us that there are major deficiencies in the service. Issues have been outlined by Deputies on this side of the House in respect of some parts of rural Ireland which highlight that we are now playing dice with people's lives. There are inadequate resources and personnel in large tracts of the country when it comes to emergency cover on a 24-hour basis, and the "Prime Time" programme exposed this. I and others have tabled parliamentary questions time and again to try to find out the true extent of the deficiencies in the ambulance service. We now know that this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">Our difficulty is with the denial by the HSE and senior management of the National Ambulance Service, NAS, and at ministerial and departmental levels. We must acknowledge that, by any international standard, the Irish service is under-resourced and understaffed. Compared with Northern Ireland or Scotland, the service we are providing is amazing. This is down to the dedication, determination and commitment above and beyond the call of duty of the service's personnel. The difficulty is not caused by the personnel working in the service, but by the lack thereof. We must tackle that shortage to ensure we have a service in which people can be confident.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> We have discussed the reconfiguration of hospital services throughout the country, universal health insurance and the creation of hospital trusts and hospital groups in the context of what the Government calls the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance. A key problem is that, as the Government downgrades emergency departments in hospitals, ambulances must drive longer distances to provide cover. This stretches personnel's ability to reach emergency scenes in a timely fashion, as highlighted in the "Prime Time" programme. Given the response times for delta and echo calls, the service is not meeting the requirements set by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> A review is being carried out, but we want a full comparison between the ambulance services of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland. In this way, we could definitively know how under-resourced we are. The former director of the NAS stated that we would need approximately 400 personnel in addition to the current level of 1,600 staff. That is a lot. By publishing HIQA's guidelines but lowering the threshold, we are dropping standards so that they can be met. This is not proper policy. It is disingenuous to claim that the standards are being met. Of course they are if they keep being lowered. They were meant to be 80% as regards first responders, but they are now 70%. HIQA's recommended guidelines are being manipulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> If one spoke with front-line personnel, they would say that they were at breaking point. More importantly, we know what happens when, from time to time, an ambulance is not available to be dispatched to the scene of an emergency. People's lives are being put at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> The Government will reject this motion, but I urge it to keep in mind the opinions expressed by Deputies from all sides of the House and to consider resourcing the NAS.</p>
