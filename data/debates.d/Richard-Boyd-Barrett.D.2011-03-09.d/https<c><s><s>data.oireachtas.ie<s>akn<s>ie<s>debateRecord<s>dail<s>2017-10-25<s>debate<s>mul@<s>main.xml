        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">As I said before the adjournment of the debate last night, despite repeated claims by the Government of its success in inducing economic growth and restoring the fortunes of the economy, the truth is the budget did not allocate enough money to solve the housing and homelessness emergencies. It did not allocate enough money to deal with the shambles and crisis in the public health service. It has not ensured restoration, even now, of the pay slashed from public servants during the period of austerity. It has failed to allocate sufficient investment in key infrastructure in areas like the arts and the development of renewable energy. Indeed, it has come up short in all the urgent investment and public spending requirements. In respect of practically every inequality and injustice facing this country, the budget failed to deal with the problems, crises and injustices.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> The key question is why that is the case. Is it because there is simply not enough money? Is it because this Government's priority, as becomes clear when we look at this Finance Bill, is to ensure that the people who actually have money are not taxed? Yet, they could be taxed to boost our tax revenues to allow us provide the resources that could solve the housing and health crises. That would allow us to restore pay equality for nurses and teachers and invest in our infrastructure. The Government refuses to tax those who have the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> This is summed up by the issue that has surfaced again in recent days relating to Apple and the €13 billion. It is really rather extraordinary. It is not simply that the Government does not want to collect the €13 billion, or €19 billion including interest, that could transform the situation in this country for ordinary people. In fact, the Government is now facing fines and notice of legal action from the European Commission because of its refusal to collect that money and put it in an escrow account pending the outcome of the appeal. Incredibly, the Government is spending millions on the appeal to ensure that the people do not get the €13 billion. The Government is spending taxpayers' money defending Apple's tax evasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> That begs the following question. Why, even under instruction from the European Commission, has the Government not put the €13 billion in the escrow account? We are told it is because of commercial sensitivities and difficulties in getting an investment manager for the escrow fund. I thought that was what the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, was for. The NTMA is well capable of managing bonds and reserves of funds. Why, in the case of Apple, has it taken a year? Why are we now risking fines to find an investment manager? I will explain the reason - it was indicated by Bloomberg in recent weeks. It is because the Government is treating Apple with kid gloves. I suspect the Government may be even negotiating with Apple as to who the investment manager should be. Incredibly, the Government put in a condition that whoever gets the contract for managing the escrow account must be managing at least €500 billion worth of assets. What companies manage €500 billion worth of assets? Only American companies do. What are the difficulties in sorting out this problem? It has to be that the Government is dancing to the tune of Apple. That sums up what is going on in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> Whereas the profits of these corporations have jumped by an absolutely extraordinary amount, they pay pitifully low levels of tax because the Government is ensuring that they do not pay the tax. There are massive loopholes designed specifically to ensure that they do not pay tax. That is not speculation, given the treatment of Apple.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> I have heard on the grapevine that a further four or five Apple-type cases are coming down the line from the European Commission involving some of the other big US multinationals in respect of which the Government has given the same favourable treatment and designed specific tax breaks to ensure they do not pay taxes. We can see this when we look at the tax expenditures outlined by Revenue. They are absolutely extraordinary. Between 2015 and 2016, the figure for tax breaks under the heading of intra-group transactions jumped from €2.9 billion to €9 billion in one year. Who is benefitting from that increase of €7 billion in the tax loophole? This is in addition to the research and development tax credits, which amount to €700 million, and €2.7 billion for losses brought forward. The losses-brought-forward heading was mostly to benefit the banks. They pay no tax even while they are ripping off those with tracker mortgages and other mortgage holders on a range of fronts. They are paying no tax. Yet, the Government will not tax these companies. That money could provide the billions we need to transform our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> None of that is in the Finance Bill. Instead, there is a little tinkering and some tokens. There is nothing serious to give us the revenues we need to solve the problems. All of this is summed up in the treatment of Apple. Apple is only the tip of a big and rotten iceberg, reflecting how this Government, of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, protects the biggest and most profitable corporations in the world from paying any taxes and robs the people of the resources they need to solve the urgent social crises our society faces.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_8">We have dealt extensively with the general questions of the budget previously and, therefore, I do not intend to rehash them, except to say this is a budget for the 1%. It is a small-state budget. This budget will not resolve any of the crises facing people in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Something very interesting was said yesterday by Deputy Michael McGrath. He said that the bedrock of our industrial policy is our competitive corporation tax regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">It is very revealing to have it said in such stark terms by the so-called Opposition, but we know it is a view shared by the Government. It illustrates the very limited nature of strategy that exists from the point of view of the capitalist class in this country and its political representatives. The notion that being a tax haven is an industrial policy is laughable. Nowhere in the world, apart from tax havens, do they say that an industrial policy is made up of a "competitive corporation tax regime". It is laughable in terms of a description and there is a real problem if that is the policy but it also sums up the reality of Ireland functioning as a corporate tax haven.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> To starkly illustrate the point I will give the figures for corporation profits and the effective rate of corporation tax paid on them over the past five years to 2015, the year for which the latest figures are available. In 2011 total profits declared before deductions was €77.5 billion and total corporation tax paid was just over €4 billion, which is an effective rate of corporation tax of 5.37%. In 2012, just over €80 billion in total profits was declared and €4.4 billion was paid in tax, which was an effective rate of tax of 5.4%. Total profits in 2013 was €87 billion, while total corporation tax paid was €4 billion, which means an effective rate of corporation tax of 4.7%. In 2014, total profits were €103 billion in profits and close to €5 billion in tax paid which was an effective corporation tax rate of 4.75%. In 2015, which are the latest figures available, corporation tax profits have doubled in the period to €156 billion, while only €6 billion was paid in tax, giving an effective rate of corporation tax of less than 4%.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> That is utterly wrong. It represents a robbery of working-class people in this country and of developing countries in particular. It robs from their public services and has real consequences for real people. The other thing is that it is utterly unsustainable and to stick to the idea that one's industrial policy is going to attract corporations here on the basis of paying little or no tax due to low rates of tax, little regulation and everything else is utterly blind and shows the short-sighted nature of the strategists for capital in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> When one looks around the world and, for example at Brexit and the possibility of a bargain-basement Brexit driven by the Tories, it will include also slashing regulation on corporations if the Prime Minister gets away with it. Donald Trump repeatedly makes reference to Ireland's corporation tax rates and the need to slash to 20% US corporation tax rates. One can also look for examples elsewhere in Europe. It is a dead-end strategy. It is a race to the bottom in which everybody loses except for corporations and does not provide any sustainable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> An industrial policy must be based on public investment, supporting research and development and investing in infrastructure. A socialist industrial policy must have its bedrock of public ownership and investment in the likes of green energy, in which the private sector simply refuses to invest. There is a daily consequence of that for the people on trolleys in hospitals. There was a very impressive protest yesterday by pupils, parents and teachers of Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna who have been in prefabs for 21 years and those involved have encountered obstacles but they have not been promised school buildings that do not involve going in and out of separate prefabs and having cold classrooms for another five years. They rightly do not believe those promises without an indication that something will happen. They are dealing with the consequences of what is happening in terms of industrial policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Social Justice Ireland produced stark figures indicating 17% of the population are at risk of poverty, 25.5% are experiencing deprivation and that without the social welfare system, 46% of the population would have been living in poverty in 2015. They face the consequences of the political choices which, as Deputy Boyd Barrett outlined, are encapsulated in the Government’s attitude to Apple.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> There has not been sufficient debate in this House on the so-called sugar tax, which is obviously a tax on particular soft drinks, as opposed to sugar full stop. I am opposed to the soft drinks industry. I agree wholeheartedly that soft drinks play an important contributory role to health crises in this country and lead to obesity and it would be much better if people drank fewer soft drinks. What I do not agree with is introducing another regressive tax. We have had so-called green-washing before whereby austerity taxes were introduced under the guise of being environmental taxes such as water charges but now we have health-washing of taxes and taxes being brought in on the basis that they are somehow to improve people's health. The reality is that it will be a regressive tax. Ireland has a regressive, not a progressive tax system, whenever one takes into account the amount of indirect tax paid by people. The Government, Fianna Fáil and other right-wing elements always say we should just look at the income tax, which is progressive. Yes, the income tax on its own is progressive but it could be a lot more progressive, as we will outline, but when one takes into account all the indirect taxes such as VAT, of which consumption taxes are a major part, then it is not a progressive system where the bottom decile of household income earners pay 27.75% of their gross income in tax in total and the top 10% only pay less than 2% extra, namely, 29.2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The so-called sugar tax on soft drinks in reality will be another regressive tax. It became a matter of controversy in the US presidential election whereby it was introduced in Philadelphia and Bernie Sanders, the self-proclaimed socialist, opposed the tax while Hillary Clinton was in favour of it. There was a dispute, some fact-checking was done and the conclusion was that the so-called soda tax in America would disproportionately increase taxes for low-income families and people of colour. That is the consequence of sugar tax. The vast majority of it will be passed on to consumers and will disproportionately affect low-income earners.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> If we are serious about public health what we should have is a proper amount of physical education, PE, in primary schools. According to a UCD study we are the third lowest in 37 European states, with the average time spent on PE being 46 minutes in a week. That is not impressive when one looks at the reality of physical education. That compares with religion getting two and a half hours a week, regardless of ethos. If we really wanted to improve public health we would invest in a national health service in order that people's poor rate of visiting dentists and tooth brushing would be tackled by people having access to and a connection with a dentist and doctor among other health professionals. Ireland would increase its spending on health promotion, which relatively speaking is low.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> If the Government is serious about tackling soft drinks companies then it should regulate where and how soft drinks are available, for example, not having can machines in schools and it would tax those companies. Ultimately, soft drinks companies, which are part of major conglomerates, should be in public ownership and under democratic control. A secondary issue is the fact that the by-product of the sugar tax will be to incentivise further the sale and consumption of artificial sweeteners, which are also not without complications. Some studies show they can lead to an increased consumption of sugary foods because they make people crave the taste of sweetness and are potentially addictive. Studies involving saccharine and rats have shown a link to weight gain and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. I am opposed to the sugar tax, which is regressive. There are better ways of tackling the issues, as I have outlined. We will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFitzmaurice" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_20">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill. The mathematics on which it is based may be wobbly for the simple reason that a third of the budget is built on stamp duty, which will make available an extra €300 million, and the rest is based on increasing the old reliables. The one third estimated to come in from the new stamp duty, amounting to approximately €360 million, will put a bit of trepidation into certain parts of the market. I will go into that in depth later on as amendments will be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I agree with the spirit of it in terms of taking on vulture funds and land hoarders. </p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Politicians are going around the country day in and day out to towns where many buildings have, unfortunately, closed due to the recession. We are trying to encourage people to buy such buildings. We do not need to give them another kick in the teeth. If we are trying to revive small towns we need to make sure we provide incentives. I am not talking about land hoarders or vulture funds. However, the first €300,000 of any purchase should be dealt with in the tax code. The price of a house in Dublin would not be €300,000 because, unfortunately, people have to pay a lot more. There are exemptions, but we need to try to encourage people to set up small family-run businesses. A grave mistake has been made. It is not helpful in terms of encouraging people to set up businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Until last December farmers could, in the interests of efficiencies, receive reliefs when farms beside them came up for sale. Farmers now face a 6% stamp duty rate when buying land on the open market, which is a grave mistake. I will table amendments in that regard. We can see where political allegiances lie when the Bill goes to committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I listened with interest to the previous Deputy and a lot of what he said about the sugar tax is correct. The money generated should be invested in education, in particular physical education, in order to create awareness in national and secondary schools. There is no point in imposing a tax for reasons other than helping people. We should not take money from where it should do good. We know what problems may arise down the road. We should redouble our efforts. Money should be targeted towards helping people who have problems with obesity and to educate the next generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> My first budget was on 10 October 2014. The self-employed who owned small businesses faced a discrepancy of €1,650 between what they and PAYE workers could claim in tax relief. On the day the then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, clearly stated that anomaly would be addressed within three years. The figure reduced to €950 and an additional €225 brought the total to €1,175. It is disappointing, given that the Minister said the problem would be solved. </p>
          <p eId="para_26"> I welcome the rise in payments for old age pensioners. It is not a lot, but at least things are going in the right direction. Many Deputies have spoken about pensions, especially the current debacle whereby people who reared our generation and were forced to give up work are at a significant disadvantage. The system penalises them for rearing another generation. The issue needs to be sorted out rapidly. Something like €60 million would resolve it. I know there is no pot of gold to address what went wrong, but putting people on a level pegging would be a start.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Working people are having a euro taken from one pocket and put into another. There is nothing in the budget for them. People need to be aware of the backdoor charges which are being introduced. There is a rise in the PSO levy. The ESB is increasing the price of electricity. People should go through all of the different costs and they may, unfortunately, be worse off. People talk about those who get up early in the morning. Having done all the sums, while on paper there may be one or two euro a week for people if they go through the taxes which are being introduced by the back door and which nobody keeps an eye on they may find, they will be worse off.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The Minister has introduced certain measures for crèches. However, some staff in crèches around the country are on very low rates of pay. We need to examine the child care sector. It is good that over 2 million people are working, but we have to make sure we make work available to those who want to work and that the system is workable for them. Facilities must be in place and they must be affordable. There is no point working every day if one has to throw every single penny back into a crèche. I recognise that moves have been made. However, there is significant pressure on many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> One of the biggest talking points in the budget was agriculture. The other side of that is rural Ireland. It was announced that rural Ireland got an increase of 12% in its budget. However, when one drills down to the budget for each Department, one finds that the biggest section of Ireland has the smallest budget in every Department. That sums up what is going on. </p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I welcome the ANC announcement, which was in the programme for Government. It was unfortunate to read in <i>www.agriland.ie</i> how CAP is dished out. There was a commitment in the programme for Government that there would be a review of CAP, whereby 80% of the grants go to 20% of the farmers. The average in each section of the country is there in black and white for anybody to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> I can rest my case for the simple reason that large landlord farmers are still coining it. Smaller operators, who are the heart of rural Ireland, rear families and are involved in communities and keep them alive, are being treated in the same manner as they have been down through the years despite a commitment in the programme for Government to sort out the issue. Obviously that is not being addressed in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> I was baffled that a party which, in the eyes of the media in particular, was the so-called farmer's party would hammer family members with a 6% stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> I recognise that in the Finance Bill, the Government has changed the consanguinity rule for people under 67 years, and that it has been abolished. However, if one buys land 20 or 30 miles away, where there was a tax exemption, it has now gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> The Government must be mindful of small farmers who might be trying to buy 10, 15 or 20 acres at the most, which will be their only purchase in life in addition to what they already own. They cannot compete in a situation where the European Investment Bank, EIB, has given money to people in Norway to come in and buy our land from us and take it over. We cannot compete with that. The small farmers in areas of the country who are trying to buy 10 and 20 acres do not have that kind of money at their disposal. The message which this budget clearly sent out is that we can forget about the small family farm, we are courting the guy who can afford to pay 6%. That rate does not matter to the big fella and a vulture fund can afford it because it bought it for half nothing but what about the small farmers with 20 or 30 acres, in Cork, Kerry, Mayo or Donegal, who for once in their lives try to buy 10 acres that come up beside them? Will we let the whole lot be planted around them by foreign investors who are coming into this country and taking it over? Is that the Ireland we want? That is the message that is going out from this budget. If politicians take responsibility, we will make sure it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> In small towns, there may be a shop, pub or some small hardware store that could be bought with €300,000 or €400,000. Do we not want to keep someone local in those businesses or do we want to charge them an extra €4,000 in every €100,000? That is what we are going and telling them, to get the hell out and abandon their town. This affects farmers and small businesses but it is about something above that; it is about everyone who lives in rural areas of Ireland who want to see small towns prosper and recover. </p>
          <p eId="para_36"> The way this has been done is ill-advised and ill-thought out. I agree with the Minister of State. If we had to put 50% stamp duty on vulture funds, I would have no problem with that, I agree with it 100%. We can hit them because they bought it low. The funds might start talking to people who they are trying to drive out of their houses, having bought their loans from other banks at 30% or 40% of their value. They might finally start talking to them if we hit them with a real, substantial tax or stamp duty. That might be the solution for these guys who will not come to the table and who are faceless in this country, and send middle men in to talk and bring people around in circles. </p>
          <p eId="para_37"> We must make sure that like the thresher which separates the grain from the straw, we separate the family operation, the small farm and business from the rest because they are the heart of many communities. Unless we do that this budget is saying goodbye to more buildings and towns around the country. That is the clear message we are sending out.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> I ask the Minister of State to consider what we are trying to do when amendments to the Finance Bill are tabled. If the Government wants to bring in the money by hitting the big vulture funds, that will not be a problem This Dáil would back it 100%. This country needs to send out the message that it wants to encourage SMEs and family farms because the message going out at present is that we are a country that encourages landlordism and one can forget about everything else. </p>
          <p eId="para_39"> I acknowledge the Government did not have hundreds of millions available for this budget to solve things. Some good things were done, such as tax coming down, but we should look at the area of transport, which delivers food and is very important to the entire economy. When our lorries go to England or to other countries, they must pay a tax because they are Irish lorries. We face a situation, and Deputy Michael Collins who is in the Chamber knows even more about this than I do, where lorries come in from Spain that go down to the end of Cork and drive up to the top of Donegal and the Irish people do not receive a red cent from it. They haul fish and bring backloads in with them. They are doing a lot of Irish work out of business. It needs to be addressed and is something I spoke about a long time ago. When we go into England, we must pay £10 to travel on their road and if one does not, there is a fine of £500. This also applies in Northern Ireland. Irish hauliers are crucified and many have lifted their business from the country and gone to Bulgaria and other places where they have bought their insurance for a fraction of what it costs here, because they had to. They can get it for approximately one seventh of the cost they were being quoted in this country. That is unfortunate because not only is it a loss to the Exchequer but when others are able to come in, it creates further problems for the business. </p>
          <p eId="para_40"> It is a good thing that the country is picking up or certain parts at least, and we need to ensure that we introduce a system of apprenticeship. One cannot get drivers at the moment, farmers will say they are struggling to get workers and we are struggling to get the ordinary tradespeople to build our buildings. We can talk about getting as much employment as we want or building as many houses as we want but if we do not have the guys or the ladies who can do the work, we are in serious trouble. The emphasis has been one of driving people towards college, and giving a secondary status to trades. I acknowledge positive reforms in apprenticeship this year, where accountancy and a few other apprenticeships have been added. It is very important and I welcome it. We need to speed it up and look towards Germany and Norway, where the latter has something like 330 different apprenticeships. It is hugely important that we drive this on because we must build the buildings, we need different expertise in different sectors and this must be encouraged as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I also welcome developments in the colleges this week, where NUIG has borrowed its first €60 million from the EIB. We need to drive this on as part of the efforts to solve the shortage in housing. It will not solve it all but the colleges have a lot of land. It is a licence to print money because they are sure of getting people in and the buildings are necessary for student accommodation. It will not solve the whole problem but each person who finds accommodation takes pressure off some city somewhere in the country, which is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> When the amendments are introduced to the Finance Bill, I ask that the Government protect the small family farm and small businesses. I do not mean the big businesses, because whatever the Government wants to do with them, it will have 100% backing from this Dáil. I ask the Government to look hard at this matter and give them some relief. </p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_44">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. During my statement on the budget three weeks ago, I warned that what appeared to be a soft budget would prove quite different when the finances were broken down over the following weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">I hate to say "I told you so" but as we are trashing out the Finance Bill to implement all of the proposed budgetary measures and as there has been time to examine the various increases and decreases, it is clear that what I said was correct, namely, that the devil would be in the detail. The extreme increase in the rate of stamp duty, from 2% to 6%, for the conveyance and transfer of non-residential holdings is absolutely detrimental to small farms and businesses throughout the country. Businesses and farmers in rural areas are struggling to survive as matters stand. This huge rise in the rate of stamp duty will diminish the intentions of entrepreneurs to start up or expand in the near future. I am totally opposed to this new measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> On budget day, I welcomed the €5 increase in all social welfare payments. However, why must the recipients wait until next March to receive this increase? Why could it not be effected immediately, as with the increase in the price of cigarettes? The increased rate of stamp duty came into effect on 10 October. The €5 million investment in the new strategic communications unit to allow the Government to improve its image among members of the general public was totally unnecessary and unacceptable. This €5 million would be better spent on addressing the problems in our health system or on the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> The budget did very little for the agricultural sector. The Government not only implemented the insane change regarding stamp duty, it also did little to improve the lives of those in the agriculture sector. This is our biggest sector. The Government's failure to equalise the income tax credit for the self-employed before 2018, as promised in the programme for Government, was both disappointing and cruel for our self-employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> On the fishing sector, I agree with Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice regarding Spanish lorries leaving Castletownbere in their droves every week. There is every incentive for foreign vessels to be looked after in our waters. Last week, our fishermen experienced one of the worst crises in many years. Their pots and materials were smashed up against the rocks by Storm Ophelia and Storm Brian. We are looking for a compensation package for those fishermen just so they can replace their equipment. The request is falling on deaf ears. The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, passed the request to the Minister but the latter has not replied to help the fishermen at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> Overall, I am disappointed with both the Finance Bill and the various measures the Government has introduced. I do not believe I will be able to support it without a number of changes in respect of the issues I have outlined.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_50">I very much support the call by Deputy Michael Collins for a compensation package to be put in place for fishermen. I have been contacted by many fishermen from around the coast who have been affected adversely in recent weeks. The tools of their trade have been destroyed. Quite simply, they do not have the money to replace them. They were not expecting this to happen. They are not covered by insurance and are in really dire financial circumstances. I hope and expect that the Minister will seriously consider putting in place a compensation package for the fishermen who are genuinely affected and hurt. Not a lot of money is required in each case. However, putting no package in place would be enough to place the fishermen at a considerable disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill because it gives us an opportunity to catch up on developments that have just transpired. When a budget is first introduced, one does not really see the detail. It is only in the following days, when one studies it and everybody gets an opportunity to go through it, that one sees exactly what is in it and, more importantly, what is not. In this case, I was hoping people who are less well off would be taken care of. People who were struggling through the economic downturn got nothing in this budget that is of any consequence or importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> Since I became a Member, I have always said it should pay people to work. Young families who have a mortgage, are struggling, trying to pay for child care and working are really finding it difficult to make ends meet at present. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, knows the kinds of people about whom I am talking. They are individuals who are out working every day of the week, who may have a loan for a car and who have a mortgage. They have to pay for child care and they have many other bills, including for health care. All they see is that they are getting hit continuously.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Of course, we must also talk about the elderly and disabled. I agree with the sentiments of Deputy Michael Collins, who stated the Government is boasting about an increase of €5 per week but not giving it to people until March. As a rule, it has always been the way of Governments and Departments of Finance to apply increases at midnight but not give out any benefits for about six months. That is wrong and the practice should stop. When the Government says it is giving people something, it should give it to them immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> I am not happy about the increase in the rate of stamp duty for farmers. When I look through the exemptions and other provisions, I am still worried about transactions relating to land. We must always ensure that people who are changing ownership of land are catered for. In many cases, the farmer is just the custodian of the land. He does not have it for its monetary value and is only holding on to it for the next generation and trying to improve it. That must always be borne in mind when people are dealing with finances and budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> With regard to the vast amount of money that is being made available for electric cars, in the region of €10 million, I am totally opposed to it. I consider it a waste of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> In recent days, I was dealing with a couple of awful cases involving people who provide care for individuals who are, unfortunately, terminally ill and who are seeking carer's allowance. I raised this matter yesterday and want to raise it again today because I want to drive home this point. I appreciate the reaction that I got from the Minister, Deputy Coveney. He saw merit in my case and believed it deserved a hearing. When the person being assessed for the carer's allowance is terminally ill, he or she does not have four or six months in which to have the claim processed. The application process should be streamlined. Once the medical evidence is submitted to the Department and once it is medically proven that, unfortunately, a case is terminal, there should be absolutely no delay. No individual or party in this House will disagree that when a person is terminally ill and somebody is seeking to care for him or her, that person should immediately be put on the carer's allowance. It is only right, proper and respectful. I want that to be driven home today, as was the case yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> As I stated, when one studies the budget and goes through all the ins and outs, one realises that it will mean very little improvement in the lot of people in rural areas. Earlier this morning, I saw the cranes against the skies here in Dublin. This city and the remainder of the country are absolutely unrelated to each other at this stage. I refer to the price of property, the rents that are being charged and the work that is taking place here. I do not begrudge the people of Dublin the work but they should not believe it is being replicated throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> Consider the case of someone working on a community employment scheme in south Kerry. He or she may be glad and lucky to be on it. Here in the Dáil, I have raised the number of people the authorities are trying to remove from schemes. It does not make sense to me. When people are on schemes, that is all they have. They want to remain on them for as long as possible. They certainly do not want to be called in and asked questions about what they have at home or what they have under the bed. That is happening in Kerry at present. Is the rest of the country being treated in the same way? The percentage of people being called in is extraordinarily high, and I cannot make sense of it. I would like answers on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> When it comes to budgets and finance, we have to take care of everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">We have to ensure that those who are less well off will be taken care of and that every opportunity is taken to provide work, schemes, or other money-making avenues, be they for small farmers or for people living in housing estates or whatever else. We must always remember that there are two worlds in today's Ireland: Dublin and the rest of the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DannyHealyRae" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_61">I too am glad of the opportunity to raise a few issues arising from the budget. I first will reiterate what my colleagues have said in respect of social welfare payments. People are very hurt and angry about the meagre extra amount they will now receive. They have been told that they will get €5 but it is not even clear if they will get that full amount. They will now have to wait for another six months, well into next year, and Christmas will have passed before they can get that extra money. Many of the increases in the budget will affect them in the meantime. Many people, then, are very annoyed and hurt over this.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> We then come to the matter of the extra funding allocated to the Health Service Executive, HSE, to provide very important services. I stood here one year ago and said I hoped the €950 million allocated in that budget would not just be consumed by the HSE. Most of it was, of course, and we saw no results on the ground in Kerry, where people are still waiting for cataract operations, teenagers are waiting for orthodontic treatment and people are left on hospital trolleys. There are 21 people on trolleys in University Hospital Kerry today. Why are more beds not open in the new hospital in Kenmare? Why at times does Killarney Community Hospital not operate at full capacity? Why are only half of the beds open in the new hospital in Dingle? The land for that hospital was donated free of charge by a local landowner. It is terrible to think that the facility is not now being used for the purpose for which it was intended and there are offices in places where there should be beds. This is very wrong. </p>
          <p eId="para_63"> As for the fair deal scheme, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, announced there would be fairness for farmers and those involved in the farming sector. A motion passed here in the Dáil several months ago even though the Government opposed it and Fianna Fáil failed to vote for it. It passed thanks to some of the colleagues to my right here who could see the need for fairness for the farming community. The Minister of State announced the scheme was to go ahead some weeks ago but I have seen nothing addressing it or no funding allocated for it in the budget. I was not happy with his statement to the national newspapers that a cap would be put on farms and farm residences for only three years. It is not fair to take an individual's farm into account in the assessment at all. If a mother or father has gone into a nursing home it is very unfair to think that the value of the farm would be adversely affected. The assessment should take into account the value of the residence alone, not the farm itself, in order that farmers can be treated equally to everybody else being assessed for the fair deal scheme. Farmers should get equal treatment and fair play. </p>
          <p eId="para_64"> In many such instances, people would stay at home if they could get home help. It is very difficult to get a second home help to come in in the morning or in the evening to operate a hoist, for example. This then demands the presence of family members to help the care assistant with this task, something that is not always possible. If it is no bother to get the fair deal scheme for these people, why not ensure they get more home help instead in order that they can stay in their homes longer? Anyone in a nursing home who is still in possession of his or her senses - some, sadly, are not - will say his or her one ambition is to be at home. Even if such people state the nursing homes are grand and lovely, they all will say they would rather be in their own home. Why not transfer some of the fair deal funding across to be used for more home help?</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> On the issue of stamp duty in rural Ireland, I very much regret that it is being applied to farmers who need to buy extra land and will not qualify for the exemptions. In order to stay in the running, farmers have to expand and drive on but many farmers who would like to do so will be hit by this 6% stamp duty. Likewise, a young fellow getting a site from his father on family-owned land will also have to pay this duty.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">If he is only getting the site, he will have to pay the 6% and transfer the site to his name before he can get a bank loan. I know what I am talking about because people very close to me have had to do this already and will have to do it again now and the duty has risen from 2% to 6%.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> I am grateful for the funding that was given to local improvement schemes last year and I hope that it will be doubled next year because people in County Kerry have been waiting for their turn for eight or nine years now. As I have said here before, people in rural Ireland are every bit as entitled to a good road to their door as people in Dublin 4. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine returned €1.6 million to the Exchequer for 2016. I hope that does not happen again this year because people in rural areas are suffering. As a barometer as to what is happening, the proud parish of Scartaglin is not able to continue in the county league because the young fellows are all going abroad. Even in my own parish of Kilgarvan, another six left for Australia in the last few days. Emigration is still happening and rural Ireland is badly affected by it. Let us just take a place like the parish of Lauragh, where the two shops, the post office and the Garda station have all closed. There is nothing there now to identify it as a parish in its own right, barring one pub down in Kilmackillogue. Everything is closing. This is what is happening in rural Ireland. The people of Sneem and Caherdaniel can only field one team between them whereas heretofore, they could put out three and four teams at various times.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> During the housing debate last night, I asked for the extension of the repair and leasing scheme to rural villages. The Minister of State, Deputy English, responded by saying that the scheme already covered rural areas. It does not. The only areas that qualify for this scheme are those with an immense pressure for social housing. If the Government wants to revitalise rural towns and villages not already included under the repair and leasing scheme, it will have to extend the scheme. It is no good for the Taoiseach to talk about vacant properties when such properties are not fit to be lived in. It is not fair and we will not have houses or be able to provide housing until he extends this scheme right out around rural areas. Many of the houses in these rural villages are falling down.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">That is the truth of the matter. If the Minister wants to revamp those properties, please include them in the repair and leasing scheme because they are not included at present.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_76">This Finance Bill, like the budget that gave rise to it, lacks any kind of coherence or ambition for the country. A small amount of money was spread around very thinly, without any apparent strategic objectives being set. For that reason, it turned out to be much ado about nothing, and a missed opportunity. The small amount of money that was available - which could have been increased, had the Government chosen to do so - could have been used in a meaningful and strategic way to set long-term objectives for the country. Unfortunately, it seems that electoral objectives were more important to this Government than any kind of strategic objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> The Finance Bill must be seen in two different contexts. The first is the extraordinarily restrictive fiscal rules that apply and seem to have been accepted in their entirety in this country, and the second is the Government's seemingly obsessive preoccupation with tax cutting, and in particular tax cutting that favours people who are better off and earning far above the average wage, and the impact of that kind of approach on family budgets. On the fiscal rules, we know that during the austerity years capital spending was scaled back very heavily and there was little regard to the long-term impact of such an approach. We are now facing the consequences of that, with a massive overhang of underinvestment in the capital area and in our infrastructure generally. That is holding us back very substantially. There is a huge infrastructural deficit, of which the housing crisis is the most obvious example, but we also see it in the lack of investment in electricity infrastructure, rural broadband, transport and a whole range of areas. We should be investing in balanced regional development, for example. </p>
          <p eId="para_78"> Just this morning I had an email from a constituent of mine who had recently given up driving into work in the morning, which is the objective we have set and something we are trying to encourage people to do. This person told me that this morning in Glasnevin he was waiting at a bus stop from 7.45 a.m. until 8.15 a.m. and during that period eight buses passed by, all of them full, while the queue at his stop was lengthening all the time. That is a very clear measure of the extent to which we underinvest in public transport. While we know that we should be encouraging people to use public transport for environmental and competitiveness reasons, among others, there is still massive underinvestment in public transport. On the north side of Dublin, there is no rail option for my entire constituency. There has been no significant investment in public transport, and that is why the Swords Road and Drumcondra feature every single morning on the AA traffic reports. This is having a very real impact on people's ability to move around and to get in and out of work effectively. It is affecting competitiveness in a very substantial way in that most people in the Dublin area, and certainly the north side of Dublin, are taking anything from an hour to an hour and a half to travel perhaps five miles into the city centre to get to work. </p>
          <p eId="para_79"> If Ireland is to catch up, we need to invest very substantially in our infrastructure. That is not happening. We have been hugely constricted in what we can do because of the very restrictive fiscal rules. These rules are undoubtedly damaging Ireland's interests, and they should be very seriously challenged. Under the current rules, the cost of anything that Ireland allocates to infrastructure and other capital projects is calculated over a four year period, which makes no sense whatsoever. If we are talking about significant investment in rail projects, for example, those projects will be of benefit and be in use for 50 to 60 years, so why are we calculating the investment costs of those projects over a four year timescale? Housing is a similar area where there is a massive underspend. We expect houses will last us 60 to 100 years, yet the costs of the investment in them are spread over a mere four years. That makes no sense either. </p>
          <p eId="para_80"> The amount set aside under the revised capital plan, despite recent improvements, is wholly inadequate by any kind of standard. It is fundamentally unambitious for the country. Investment as a percentage of GDP will remain very low under this plan, and the amount we spent in 2017, for example, is very similar to the amounts we spent during the austerity years when we could not afford to borrow and we were almost entirely dependent on IMF and EU funds to keep us afloat. We are not investing very much more than we did during those very difficult years. </p>
          <p eId="para_81"> We in the Social Democrats firmly believe that the plan is extremely unambitious and lacks any kind of long-term thinking in terms of the needs of the country. It makes sense to invest heavily now in order to save in the long term. That is what the approach of Government should be. We should be investing in things like an extensive retrofitting programme, rather than the tokenistic stuff that is being done at the moment. If we do that, we will undoubtedly save in the future. We are facing fines of some €600 million per year from the early 2020s because of our failure to meet our targets in that regard. We need to take a long-term strategic view of investing now so that we will save money in the future. Unfortunately that has not been the approach taken by Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_82"> The partial sale of AIB is a perfect example of how the fiscal rules work against Ireland's interests. The proceeds of that sale could not be used to invest in infrastructure when that would have been the sensible and prudent thing to do. Meanwhile, we borrow funds at historically low interest rates, and in some cases we enjoy negative yields from some investors, yet we are not allowed to capitalise on the opportunity which that situation presents to us. We can get money for next to nothing, and we are precluded from availing of that possibility. We should be borrowing now, when money is so cheap, but fiscal rules are preventing us from doing that. The kind of approach that this forced us to take works against the interests of the country and against any kind of common sense. That is why we say that the Government should be challenging those rules in a robust way. There is no indication that has happened. During the economic collapse in 2008 and in subsequent years, the Government did not challenge the EU on the conditions of the bailout. Everybody is paying an enormous price for that, and we have been burdened with huge public debt as a result of the Government's failure to stand up to the EU. This is happening again now, in relation to the fiscal rules. The Government is taking a cowering approach to this issue, which does not serve the country's interests. The Government needs to stand up for the people, challenge those rules and make the case in Brussels that the EU is forcing us into a situation which is holding back the country very significantly. It makes no sense whatsoever. </p>
          <p eId="para_83"> At the very minimum, we in the Social Democrats believe the Government should have done what IBEC was proposing to do, which was to use the official GDP figures for the purposes of calculating the fiscal space.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Unfortunately, that has not been done. The Government, for some unknown reason, has decided to use the imputed figures rather than the official GDP figures. If we did as IBEC proposed, it would have allowed an additional €400 million in fiscal space. That should have been availed of and used for infrastructural investment. Overall-----</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_17">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_86">Yes, that is right. We agree with the point which IBEC has made, which is that we should use those official figures to enable us to leverage additional fiscal space in order to begin catching up on the glaring underinvestment in infrastructure in so many different areas across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> The other context in which we are discussing the Finance Bill is that of the Government's attitude to taxation generally. While the Taoiseach talks about giving something back to people, we know that the approach taken in cutting income tax and reducing the USC has had a very minimal impact on the vast majority of people in this country. There is a lot of talk about giving something back. Strategically, it was a mistake to do that. The €300 million, or whatever the precise figure is, which was used for this tax package would have been much better spent had it been concentrated and focused on reducing the cost of living. Instead of doing that, we had a mish-mash of what Fine Gael wanted and what Fianna Fáil wanted.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> That resulted in a situation in which our income tax system has become even more skewed and more regressive than it had been. For example, as a result of the changes to income tax and the USC in the budget, a single person earning €23,000 will benefit to the tune of €1 per week. A single person who is self-employed and earning €70,000 will benefit to the tune of €10 per week. Where one person in a couple is working, and the family's income is €35,000, they will benefit to the tune of €4 per week and yet where both people in a couple work and earn €70,000 they will gain €9 per week. Those tax changes have turned out to be quite regressive. We know that the majority of workers earn less than €35,000 per year. The majority of income earners earn less than €35,000 a year. For the vast majority of those people, the tax changes in the budget will be of little or no benefit. At most they will deliver €1 or €2 per week, which would hardly be noticed by most households. </p>
          <p eId="para_89"> If one looks at what has been happening in respect of the cost of living over the past number of years, particularly during the austerity years, families have increasingly been hit with very significant rises in costs in areas such as housing. In this morning's <i>The Irish Times</i> we read that the cost of renting in Dublin now represents 55% of a person's take-home pay. It is 55% when the standard is expected to be approximately 30%. That is entirely unsustainable for people who are caught in that trap. We also know that the cost of health care is a huge barrier to accessing care. There are issues with the cost of insurance; the cost of child care; the fact that we do not have any paid parental leave; the cost of public transport, with fares are rising all the time; the cost of energy; and the cost of education, as we do not even have free primary education in this country yet. All of these very significant costs are impacting on family budgets, meaning that people have little or nothing left in discretionary income at the end of the week or the end of the month. </p>
          <p eId="para_90"> For many reasons - equity being one, but also competitiveness and dampening down wage demands - we would have been much better off as a country if whatever funds were available for this year's budget and the associated Finance Bill were used to target the cost of living and to bring it down for all families. That could have happened if the Government had taken that kind of approach. If the Government had listened to what people said last year during the general election, they would know that people are not stupid. They know that it makes much more sense to have good quality public services, which are available to people universally, because they benefit everybody, as opposed to taking this approach of cutting taxes. This approach is not sustainable in the long term because we need to maintain our tax base. We should not be eroding it. That is how we pay for good quality public services. It really is very disingenuous to pretend to the public that the integrity of the tax base can be run down and undermined while still providing people with decent public services. It is simply not possible to do that. Examples of our approach are seen right across Europe, particularly in the Nordic countries. The social contract which should exist is that people pay a fair share of tax relative to their income and, in return, everybody gets decent public services. That is how to create a decent society. Unfortunately, this Government has taken a very different approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> The other very disingenuous argument which is often used for cutting taxes is that we need to attract people back home - entrepreneurs and the many Irish people who are currently living all over the world. That argument does not stand up at all. IDA Ireland has made it very clear that the big obstacle preventing people coming back home to live and work is the exorbitant cost of housing. IBEC made a presentation to Members of this House which stated very clearly that when it comes to attracting companies to locate here or attracting individuals to return, the two big obstacles it has identified are the crazy cost of housing and the lack of access to decent health care at an affordable cost. IBEC made that very clear. It is not about taxes, it is about the services. If people are considering coming back from Canada, Australia or wherever, they are thinking about whether there are decent schools and good public transport, whether housing is affordable, and whether there is decent public health care. Those kinds of things matter much more to families than getting tax cuts. </p>
          <p eId="para_92"> While I am on that topic I want to raise the issue of the special assignee relief programme, SARP. It is a nonsense. It is deeply unfair. We should not have it. The SARP tax relief is aimed at reducing the cost to employers of so-called high-end staff by providing special tax benefits. The employee must be on a salary in excess of €75,000 and we know that a great many of them are on massive salaries. This is really a scam to help high earners to avoid paying tax. Not only that, but they are also subsidised in sending their children to private schools.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_19">

          <p eId="para_94">They are given a €5,000 tax break to send their children to private schools. That is deeply unfair. It is a slap in the face to most ordinary taxpayers who are put to the pin of their collar to survive. Again, it is just a front to enable people to avoid paying their fair share of tax, as is the Government's attitude to corporation tax. The Social Democrats fully support the 12.5% corporation tax rate, but we should insist that companies actually pay that rate. The effective rate of tax should be close to 12.5%. There is potential to raise very significant additional funds by doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> Finally, I want to talk about another tax scam, which is the tax relief on big pension pots, which is gradually being scaled back. The year before last, however, we were promised by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, that he would introduce restrictions on effective tax relief for private sector pensions so that nobody would be entitled to tax relief on pensions in excess of €60,000. That did not happen. There is potential there to raise an additional €120 million if the Government were to follow through on the promise it made in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">The net effect of the failure to follow up on that promise is that Ministers and senior civil servants can continue to benefit from pensions of up to approximately €100,000, which is an exorbitant amount. These are people who made the rules to suit themselves. Fairness is needed but it has not been provided in the Finance Bill, which is ill-advised and lacks ambition and coherence. We could have done much better if the Government had taken a different approach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_20">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_97">The Government has listened to the people, continued its commitments and invested in areas that most need investment. We want to improve the lives of older people, share the benefits of the return to economic growth by improving the lives of those in their later years. We want to keep people living in independently in their homes. We are increasing funding for home adaptation grants, which will allow up to 11,000 grants to be provided to support older people to remain at home or much longer. I regularly visit elderly people, many of whom believe they will not be discharged from hospital once they are admitted. We want them to realise that hospitals do a fantastic job and that their goal is to have older people return home as soon as possible after admission. The Government has made a commitment to achieving this.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> The introduction of a new telephone support allowance will benefit more than 124,000 people. Telephones are extremely important for older people as they allow them to keep in touch with families and friends. Elderly people living alone have the comfort of knowing that if someone enters their home or something happens at night, they can press their alarm and have a friend, neighbour or garda quickly come to their house.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> The extension of the period in which fuel allowance is provided to 27 weeks, commencing in the first week of April 2018, is good news for older people who will receive assistance in buying fuel for several more weeks each year. The measure will benefit more than 375,000 households, particularly pensioners, widowers, people with disabilities, lone parents and long-term jobseekers.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> A further €5 increase in the State pension will come into effect in March 2018 and the Government has committed to further increases in the years ahead. Additional investment of €10 million in the free travel scheme is designed to encourage more operators to join the scheme and extend its coverage to remote areas. More bus operators are entering the market in my home county of Louth, which gives people living in rural areas an opportunity to visit urban areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> The budget also provides for a reduction in prescription charges for all medical card holders aged under 70 years from €2.50 to €2 per item, with the monthly cap reduced from €25 to €20. The Government has also provided support to enable workers aged 50 years and over to find employment. Employers will receive a subsidy of €10,000 for employing a long-term unemployed person aged over 50 years. I would not like people to be considered unemployable once they reach the age of 50. The Government has done as much as possible to encourage employers to take on people aged 50 years and over.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> The Government is also tackling housing and homelessness problems through the provision of a total investment of €1.83 billion for housing in 2018. Next year, local authorities and approved housing bodies will build 3,800 new social houses. The social housing current expenditure programme will deliver an additional 4,000 social houses next year. Funding for the housing assistance payment will be increased by €149 million in 2018, which will enable an additional 17,000 households to be supported and accommodated. Coming from Dundalk in County Louth, I know how important it is for people to get onto the housing ladder. The Government is trying its best to tackle the rental crisis. We must act soon to address the shortage of houses. </p>
          <p eId="para_103"> Funding for homeless services will increase by more than €116 million and an additional €500 million for the direct building programme will result in an additional 3,000 new social houses being built by 2021. The addition of Exchequer funding of €75 million for the local infrastructure housing activation fund will support local authorities in delivering affordable housing. The housing needs of 25,500 households will be met in 2018, which means an additional 98 households will have their housing needs met every day next year. Everyone deserves a fair chance and equality of opportunity. A safety net should be available to those who need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> People tend to forget that many families split up as a result of the economic crisis of the past ten years and this has contributed to the housing crisis because accommodation is often not available for a spouse who leaves home. It is important to look after both parties when a family splits up. When a man leaves home, he will often find it very difficult to get onto the housing list and secure a two or three bedroom house which would allow him to give his former partner a hand looking after their children. Local authorities could do many things in this area. The housing crisis is not helping anybody. </p>
          <p eId="para_105"> I welcome the funding provided to recruit more than 1,000 special needs assistants by September 2018, bringing the total number of special needs assistants to more than 15,000. Not a week goes by that someone does not visit my office in Dundalk seeking help to secure a special needs assistant for a child with a disability. The provision of 1,000 new posts is, therefore, very welcome. The funding provided to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools is also welcome, as is the increase in funding for breakfast clubs in DEIS schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> Budget 2018 will also help working families. The reductions in the lowest rate of universal social charge, USC, from 2.5% to 2% and the 5% rate to 4.7% are welcome. The income threshold for the higher rate of income tax will increase by €750. The entry point for a single earner will increase from €33,800 to €34,550. The combined effect of the USC and income taxation measures will be to increase the annual income of an average family with two incomes by between €500 and €600. Both partners need to be in employment if a family is to get onto the first step of the housing ladder and it is important that we look after this group of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> The increases in the earnings disregard for one-parent family payments and jobseeker's transitional scheme to €20 per week and in the weekly rate of the qualified child payment by €2 per week are welcome measures. The preschool programme is being extended to ensure preschool children are entitled to two full years of preschool services. This measure will benefit approximately 127,000 children and save families approximately €4,000 over the two years of a preschool programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> In health, the recruitment of an additional 1,800 staff in front-line services across the acute, mental health, disability, primary care and community sectors is very welcome, as is the increase by €35 million in mental health funding in 2018. The Government has committed to further increasing funding by €5 million in 2019. In addition, €90 million has been allocated to improve access to hospitals for patients. To ensure we have the ability to help the most vulnerable children and their families, the allocation to Tusla will increase by more than €40 million in 2018, bringing the agency's total allocation to slightly less than €754 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> The Government is ensuring that all parts of the country have an equal opportunity to share in economic growth and prosperity. A sum of €35 million has been made available for the Leader programme and funding for the town and village renewal scheme has been increased by €3 million to €15 million. A further €10 million has been allocated to local improvement schemes. This is badly needed investment and I wish the Government would provide much more for this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> The community services programme, for which €40 million has been allocated, will move to the Department of Rural and Community Development. In addition, the Government has increased funding for the programme of peace and reconciliation, PEACE IV, by €2.9 million, bringing total funding for the programme to €3.7 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> In tackling crime, the Government has provided further resources to allow for the recruitment of an additional 800 gardaí in 2018. A further 500 civilian staff will be hired to enable gardaí to move from desk work. When one considers that Templemore College was closed only a few years ago and many gardaí were retiring, this is a major boost. While it would be difficult to recruit and train more than 800 gardaí per annum, I would welcome a decision to increase annual recruitment to 1,000 or 1,200 new gardaí. The visibility of gardaí on the beat and in patrol cars, especially at night, is extremely important. The recruitment of 500 more civilian staff in the Garda is excellent because civilians are well capable of doing desk work and this will allow gardaí to be out on the beat where they should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> I also welcome the increase of €64 million for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, bringing total Exchequer funding for agriculture to more than €1 billion in 2018. This funding will support our largest indigenous industry and strengthen the agriculture sector's ability to meet the challenges of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The Minister will also bring forward a €15 million package in response to Brexit. A further €25 million has been provided for a Brexit loan scheme for the agrifood sector. Many people do not realise that the agriculture sector has done a fantastic job over the past ten years to help Ireland out. Exports of food and other agricultural products have kept this country going in recent years. Under the Brexit loan scheme, up to €300 million will be made available at a competitive rate to help businesses with their short-term working capital needs. This will be of assistance to Border towns, including my home town of Dundalk. People are very concerned about what is happening with regard to Brexit. Ireland and the EU are doing their best. The problem seems to be with the UK. Its right hand does not seem to know what its left hand is doing. We are one of the 27 remaining member states. It is important that we work together as part of a team. I hope the UK will sort out its problems as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> I welcome the retention of the special 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector, especially in the run-up to Brexit. I also welcome one or two of the increases that were announced on budget day, such as the increase from 13.5% to 23% in the rate of VAT that applies to sunbed services. This measure, which will take effect from 1 January next, is being introduced in recognition of the clear evidence of the link between sunbed use and skin cancer. I encourage the parents of young children to keep them away from sunbeds. The last thing parents want for their children is for them to get cancer. I also welcome the increase of 50 cent in the price of a packet of cigarettes. I am pleased that our corporation tax rate will remain at 12.5%. As a native of Dundalk, which was affected by the recession, I know the town would have been in serious trouble without foreign direct investment. Many of the jobs that have come to the Dundalk area in recent years are supported by foreign direct investment, which is very welcome. People are worried about what is going to happen with the rates of PRSI and USC. I am glad that the Minister intends to establish a working group next year to consider whether a process can be put in place to facilitate the amalgamation of these charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> I thank the Chair for letting me speak this morning. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on doing a fantastic job in budget 2018. While I think it was a fair and prudent budget, I would like more money to be found to help people. This might be possible in budget 2019. The Minister for Finance is doing a good housekeeping job. This Government and its predecessor have learned from past experience. It is important for it to keep doing the housekeeping properly. I congratulate the Minister again on the good job he did with the recent budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">As I have already spoken extensively on the budget, I propose to focus on some of the issues that arise in the context of the Finance Bill 2017. I will begin by speaking about the process itself. Many of the contents of this Bill, which was published last Thursday, were signalled in advance. The Bill is being discussed generally on Second Stage before it is the subject of a line-by-line examination on Committee Stage. This process is in complete contrast with the process on budget day, when the budget is dumped on the House and various Ministers make departmental announcements at press conferences outside our Parliament. Nobody ever gets a chance to see the detail. The process of announcing the budget, which goes back decades, needs to be reformed and changed. The kind of scrutiny that is given to the Finance Bill every year needs to be given to the entire budgetary process, including the individual departmental Votes.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> The first issue on which I would like to focus is Brexit. This Finance Bill covers 2018, which will be the last year before the UK leaves the EU in 2019. David Davis has said this morning that the negotiations will continue right up to the wire at midnight the night before the date on which Brexit is due to happen. There is no sense within the Finance Bill of the urgency that is needed to tackle Brexit and the supports that are needed for business, in particular, to deal with it. I accept that funding has been promised, but we have heard no detail on that. Many Deputies attended a briefing across the road this morning at which representatives of Teagasc set out their thoughts on Brexit. Teagasc is doing some interesting work on innovation and on opening various markets to Irish farming. According to Teagasc's research, a hard Brexit, which looks likely at the moment, could lead to income reductions of between 30% and 35% in the farming sector. I suggest a similar point could be made about the manufacturing sector. We can see the impact that the fall in the value of sterling associated with Brexit is having on small businesses that depend on the UK market, particularly this year in the tourism sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> There is no sense in this Bill of the urgency that is required, the preparations that need to be made and the supports that have to be put in place to assist companies that will be affected by Brexit. The representatives of Teagasc had some really interesting things to say this morning about what they are doing to open new markets, particularly in China. They are educating Chinese people about the value of Irish cheese and about new innovative products which use powders. A timeline is needed for that. Small companies need support to foster innovation and to start building new markets, but that support is not available. One cannot build a new market in a single day. The agencies are not receiving the support they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> I would like to speak about climate change. As I listened to the contributions to this debate over the past couple of hours, I got more and more depressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">Last Friday, I spent an hour with approximately 30 sixth class pupils in my local school who had spent the week doing a project on sustainable development and climate change. As I listened to Deputies in this Chamber this morning, I wished they were put through the wringer in the same way that I was interrogated last Friday about what we are not doing on climate change. Christine Lagarde of the IMF has said this morning that "we will be toasted, roasted and grilled" if we do not take action in this area. I was toasted, roasted and grilled last Friday for what we are not doing as a political class to get this country ready for climate change. Following Storm Ophelia last Monday week and Storm Brian over the weekend, it is beyond me that people are still denying that this is a problem and hoping it will go away. As Deputy Shortall said this morning, and it is incomprehensible that people are still denying this, we are facing the prospect of up to €600 million in direct fines if we do not get our act together. That would have an effect on all the services Deputies are trying to protect.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> Almost ten years ago, a Finance Bill changed the behaviour of Irish people by encouraging them to move to diesel cars. We need to bring in similar measures now to incentivise the use of sustainable cars, including hybrid and electric cars. The provisions in the Bill before the House do not go far enough because people do not have enough trust in the reliability of such cars and this country does not have the necessary charging infrastructure. I accept that the Bill contains measures to encourage employers to give excess electricity. We need to introduce a series of measures that will wake people up to the reality of what we need to do to confront climate change. While such measures will have an upfront cost, that will be minimal in the context of the fines that are coming at us, the costs associated with flood damage and flood relief schemes and everything else relating to climate change that we are facing as an island nation. I have given an example of how a single measure changed behaviour. I suggest that the Minister for Finance should show a similar degree of ambition by introducing measures that will change behaviour in this respect on many fronts. I am not just talking about motoring; I am also talking about the way we build and heat our homes and the way we approach many other areas. I think this Bill fails that test.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> The changes that are being made in respect of stamp duty and capital gains tax are being packaged as a housing measure. I fear that some of these changes will add to land hoarding, particularly in advance of the introduction of the vacant site levy. We should consider one proposal in this regard. If people who have owned land for less than four years sell that land to a local authority specifically for local authority housing or an affordable housing scheme, perhaps they should be given some sort of capital gains tax exemption on the basis that the land in question will be used for social and affordable housing. I suggest that this exemption would not apply in circumstances in which the planning permission is not secured, for whatever reason. There is a danger that the capital gains tax exemptions, in particular, will be used and people will not move on land, particularly outside Dublin and the other large urban areas. The housing problem is not confined to our cities; it is a problem all over the country. I suggest that there is potential within this measure to move on lands that local authorities can buy and start building houses on, which is what we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> On the night of the budget, I challenged the Minister about the stamp duty figure and the revenue figure. I have not yet seen anything that diminishes my doubts about the sustainability of the figures in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">We have had some extraordinary years. Granted, it is through the type of people one does not want in the market but they handed over the cash for property development and, in particular, in commercial property transactions. The entire budget appears to built on that single figure, but I have not received any assurance that the figure will materialise on the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> There are changes in agriculture, but they were always there. The existing exemptions have been extended to apply to the new rate. There is a case to be made for that in today's context of sustaining agriculture generally and, more importantly, sustaining family-led agriculture as opposed to company agriculture which is where it appears to be going. Where a farm is being consolidated or where land is being bought to consolidate a farm or make it bigger some type of incentive should be given, as was the case previously. We are pushing our farmers to increase the size of their operations for sustainability and Brexit reasons and we should put money behind encouraging them to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> The national planning framework will be debated in the House this week. We will also have the newly revised, bells and whistles capital plan published in December. However, there is very little in this Finance Bill to encourage people to move home or move away from the cities and work in the regions. Yes, we must resolve the broadband situation and get broadband into homes to give people the technological capacity to work at home, but we should be incentivising companies to encourage people to work from rural areas. We should give companies some type of break with PRSI if they can give their employees the technical skills and equipment to base themselves in a rural area and work there. The technology is available to do it. What is needed is the encouragement. People will sign up for that. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is from a rural constituency and he knows that people make the trip to the city on a Sunday night or Monday morning against the will of every bone in their bodies. They know they can do as I have suggested but they cannot because we have not sorted out the broadband or given encouragement to companies to do it. In terms of sustaining regional life and, in particular, family life it is something we should consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> There is a need for a comprehensive review of incentives. Dublin city is doing relatively well. We had the debate on the 9% VAT rate for tourism, restaurants and so forth. Other areas of the country are not doing well. It is time we had a debate on using tax policy to incentivise specific regional areas. Instead of shaking one's head and saying it cannot be done we should be told why it cannot be done. This is a small island but there are precedents all over Europe for city taxes and industrial taxes. If we do not use tax policy to move economic investment around there will be very little enhancement.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> Finally, it was said earlier that this country is a tax haven, in the megaphone politics being used in the Chamber. It is not a tax haven. While the speakers were saying that the country is a tax haven they were also seeking more investment in services. Approximately 350,000 people work in multinational companies in this country. If they were gone, we would have a serious problem trying to meet our obligations for services in health, education and elsewhere. The people who use the phrase "tax haven" and slam our tax policy then demand investment in services, but they do not add it up or make the connection between the two. Throwing terms such as "tax haven" around in the Oireachtas is completely out of order. It is unfair and does not reflect the reality. We have a very successful industrial base. Tax is only one reason for that. More importantly, it is based on the quality of our workforce, our education system and the ability of our workforce to respond.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">I am glad to have an opportunity to make some general points on the finances in the budget. This is the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill and we will get into more detail later. I am well aware of our responsibilities and commitments in the confidence and supply deal, as intolerable as it is at times for the House to put up with it. However, such was the arithmetic and it was the responsible thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> Notwithstanding that, I appeal to the Minister to consider the need to address the pensions issue between now and Committee Stage - I realise a social welfare Bill is due to be introduced as well - and the anomaly that has been highlighted by many people for some time. It has led to a discriminatory situation for women and some men who had a break in work. There is also the issue of stamp duty on farm transactions. There is an exemption for transactions within families and within certain age groups, but most of the transactions will take place outside that age group and outside a family. In effect, we are applying a penalty to people who are trying to consolidate farms and build their output. It is something we should examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> With regard to housing, last night Members took a fourth opportunity in almost as many weeks to use Private Members' time to highlight the emergency that exists. All we have done in here is engage in window dressing, with talk of PPP schemes and much fluffy language without tangible action. The Finance Bill has failed to be radical and to take account of the emergency. I accept that we hate to think of incentivising building or builders given how out of control things became in the past, but we must be realistic. A third to half of the cost of a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Dublin comprises VAT, levies and other forms of taxation. We might have to be radical and push that VAT rate and the levies down to try to get guys building again. It is not to make all of them multimillionaires and, indeed, it is something we can revisit once things are up and running and building is taking place in the places it is required around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> At present, we are busy fools, talking about the need for solutions and things that might or could work. The reality is that nothing will happen unless the State engages in a wholesale building programme as big as the one carried out in the 1950s. We must incentivise builders to start building what we need and that may require taxation measures, much as it pains me to say it given our past. In addition, we must provide finance to small builders such as the person who built two houses in Collooney, ten in Burtonport, five in Dungloe or 20 in Sligo town. Without those guys using their expertise to do that we will not solve our problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> I also spoke in last night's debate about the process. If the Minister decided tomorrow to build 1,000 houses in Dublin, provided the money and told a builder to build them it would be between three and six years before a key would be turned, such is the so-called streamlined process within the Department for doing these things. There is much duplication between local authorities in terms of planners, engineers, architects and so forth. It is the same in the Department in Dublin and down to the building unit in Ballina. We are not being clever in how we are doing our business in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> I have digressed a little from finance. One item in the budget that galled me, and it has to have galled the Minister of State too as I know him a long time, is the €5 million for the spin unit. What is that for? There are press officers in every Department who are competent, qualified people. There are press directors in parties and we have the Government Information Service. Now this €5 million is being provided. I mean no disrespect to John Concannon, a personal friend from Sligo and probably one of the country's best marketers. He will be delighted to have €5 million but what will he do with it? My colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, tabled a parliamentary question recently in which he asked who was paying for the boosts to Facebook videos coming from Merrion Street. Suddenly, they stopped. Is that what the €5 million is being used for? Is it to boost the image? John Concannon is a brilliant man. What will he be doing with this money on behalf of the Government? He was responsible for the great initiative whereby all the great buildings of the world are lit up in green on St. Patrick's Day. Is it now the case that we can look forward to all the buildings in Ireland being lit up in blue in honour of Varadkar the Vain? The House should have a breakdown of where the €5 million is being spent. Did my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, touch a nerve when he asked who was boosting the Merrion Street Facebook, who was paying for it and whether that is where the money is being spent? I have a problem with that if it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> The €5 million was not used to provide additional home help hours throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">To use a local example of Sligo University Hospital, last week I was given figures that show the outpatient waiting list there has gone up eightfold in six months. What could €5 million have done to achieve a reduction in that list? The child and adult mental health services in the north west have a shortage of child psychologists and some 400 children are critically ill regarding their mental health and need to be seen. Would that €5 million not have helped those children greatly? I am sure Deputies could give equally good examples of how this money could have been better spent in their constituencies. Many of us in the House have, for example, mentioned the Translarna drug. It is a very expensive drug and only two children in Ireland require treatment with it. It is around €250,000 per year, or whatever it is, but when one considers the costs to the health service in caring for these children as their conditions worsen without the benefit of the drug, it will cost the State more. Again, would that €5 million not have been better spent?</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> The Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Government hardly need more spinners. All parties have press officers. It is the nature of the beast and we all put out press releases. We are all on Twitter and Facebook and we all put videos up online and so on. What is the €5 million for? I know the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, will not say it here in the House because he has to wear the team jersey and he will defend the Government to the hilt - that is the nature of the game - but perhaps he could ask at his parliamentary party meeting if we could have a break down? Will he then come to the House and say, "The €5 million for the strategic Varadkar-the-Vain promotion fund is going to be spent as follows"? It is not for lighting up buildings in green, as we had for St. Patrick's Day for Ireland following the genius of John Concannon when he was with Fáilte Ireland. Can the Minister of State tell us that the money is for such tangible things? It is Mugabesque - the kind of thing that Robert Mugabe would have done over the years in his country - and it is unbecoming for a democratic State such as ours. It is probably the most disturbing aspect of the budget that has come before the House. I will keep at this until we get a breakdown of where that money is going. I look forward to this time next year when the Department of Finance appears before the Committee of Public Accounts to account for where this money was spent but this far in advance, I urge the Minister of State to put on the record what the money will be used for so we can measure it from a public accounts perspective when the time comes.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> The budget has given a small amount to certain people but, sadly, like so many budgets, it has failed on the big picture issues. We also have this disgraceful own goal of €5 million. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's comments.</p>

        <speech by="#LouiseOReilly" eId="spk_31">
          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_146">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2017. Fine Gael and its de facto junior coalition partner, Fianna Fáil, provided for €335 million in income tax cuts and USC. This was much needed money that could have been spent on housing, education and especially on health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the impending flu epidemic and the winter crisis that is heading towards us in the health services. This was reported by Dr. Muiris Houston in Monday’s <i>The Irish Times</i> and was also recently reported by RTÉ’s "Prime Time" programme. Have these reports and the weeks that followed the delivery of the budget speech changed the Government's mind in any way or convinced it that the health service needs more funding?</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> I understand that many of those who sit on the Government benches will never have to rely on or use the public health system, but I can tell them that it is in a state of absolute, total and complete crisis. It is in crisis because of the current policies of the Government and the previous failed policies of Fianna Fáil's government. The health service immediately needs additional funding in order to increase capacity by reopening closed beds and hiring more front-line staff. We have a problem in that we cannot even keep the staff we have. We are struggling to recruit any more.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> The biggest failure of this budget and the measures before us in the Finance Bill is the absolute and utter failure to tackle the crisis in our health service. The measures, such as they are, are short term and some are populist. The National Treatment Purchase Fund has its cheerleaders in Fianna Fáil, but these measures will not help in the longer term. They are short term if anything. This is one of the most important Bills of the year on which we as legislators will work and days such as this provide us with the opportunity to assess critically the ideas laid out, away from all the hoopla of budget day, as was referred to earlier. We need to look at ideas that are bad and offer up good ideas where we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> We heard the leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Micheál Martin, giving out at his party’s Ard-Fheis that Fine Gael has gone too far to the right. Sinn Féin rejects right-wing politics and right-wing policies, but we do not abstain on them. We vote against them. Fianna Fáil is happy to abstain on such policies because they too are on the right and support those policies. They do not fear the outworkings of the bad aspects of this Finance Bill because it will not impact them.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> What is missing from this Bill tells us the real story. There is no attempt to crack down on exemptions which encourage land hoarding. The failure to do this will only exacerbate and perpetuate the housing crisis. This is good news for developers and good news for landlords, but it is not good news for ordinary workers. Again, as with the crisis affecting the health service, the housing crisis is not too likely to impact those on the Government benches. Maybe this is why it is not a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Where are the moves for pay equalisation for teachers, nurses, gardaí and others? Where is the funding for the much needed commission on nursing? These workers, who provide front-line services, are very likely to be suffering from the crisis in the rental sector, paying 60% of their wages on rent, and more on motor insurance, health costs and the cost of living. They are left with little or no hope despite the fact that they are the people who get up very early in the morning. How does it look to them when they see no action on the tax-free status for the banks for the next 20 years? They see things for what they are, and they see that they are carrying the can so banks can enjoy their status.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> I also want to raise the fact that there have been no changes to betting duty, some of the money from which could have been ring-fenced to help with addiction services for those with problem gambling habits. There is a clear lack of urgency in dealing with gambling addiction in Ireland despite all the indicators showing that Ireland has a serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> A recent report showed Ireland has the third highest gambling losses per head in the world, and the highest online gambling losses anywhere. More needs to be done to address this problem which is escalating year on year. I am sure many Members here watched the documentary last night on RTÉ, "Living with an Addict", where we saw the impact gambling addiction has had on Galway hurler Davy Glennon’s mother and brother. It was powerful and emotive viewing and it illustrates how much we need to do to protect those people who have vulnerability in this instance and to protect their families who very often bear the brunt of this addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> Currently there is no ring-fenced funding to tackle gambling addiction. The betting tax, already one of the lowest in the world, generates nearly €30 million, with some €6 million of this ring-fenced to support the bloodstock industry. Not one cent of this fund goes to support those with gambling addiction or their families. An increase in the betting tax could have been used for awareness campaigns and addiction support for those who suffer from problem gambling, but yet again the Government has shown its lack of backbone when it comes to dealing with the gambling industry, just like it has done with the banks. For these reasons and many more, I will be opposing the passage of this Finance Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_156">For some time we, and Deputy Lisa Chambers in particular, have been raising with the Government the crisis among all ranks and at all levels in the Defence Forces in terms of morale, the retention of specialist personnel, pay and conditions, the retention of members generally and health and safety to no avail. It is fair to say that the Government's collective head is in the sand regarding the crisis relating to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Researchers at the University of Limerick, in an unprecedented piece of work, having interviewed and gained observations from more than 600 serving personnel reveal a shocking story of neglect of our Defence Forces, which underpin our very democracy. There is near unanimous agreement, across all ranks and age profiles, that the Defence Forces, comprising the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps, are all at risk. Some officers have told how they are kept awake at night by concerns about whether work carried out on aircraft in the Air Corps leaves them safe for flying because so many experienced personnel have left. One officer said, "There is going to be a huge safety issue in the Air Corps", while another, referring to pay and conditions, stated, "The Defence Forces has been turned into a JobBridge". Some chaplains have said that they have given up encouraging people to say in the uniform. A number of privates spoke of struggling to survive, often depending on their parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I will cite some quotations, namely: "People have to leave to survive"; "I can't get a mortgage. Some members are even on family income supplement."; and "People are sleeping in cars." At one point, someone says, "This is unacceptable". In the context of health and safety issues, one senior officer, citing absence of middle management as a significant cause, stated, "We are already seeing it in the Army - little accidents. There is going to be a big accident". Two other quotes are: "It's going to come and if it keeps on unravelling it will come. We fear a serious incident with a number of deaths ... It could be overseas"; and "In the Air Corps we have seen that [already] with three or four fatal accidents".</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Air Corps ground crews are working too many hours. In the Naval Service, there are not enough personnel to man seven ships, never mind eight. Women returning from maternity leave feel they are discriminated against, often paraded. People feel that under no circumstances can they access mental health services or admit they are affected by stress or any similar issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">First, on behalf of the Government, I want to once again express our very strong support for our Defence Forces - the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps. The Government is very proud of the role our Defence Forces play, whether it is around the world on missions such as in Mali, which I discussed with President Macron yesterday, or in Lebanon, whether it is in the context of what they did last week in helping the civil power to deal with the effects of Storm Ophelia, or whether it is the part they play in so many different ceremonies, including those relating to the centenary of the 1916 Rising last year. We very much support, value and respect our Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> As the Deputy will be aware, a very successful recruitment process is currently under way to bring at least 800 replacements into the Defence Forces. Recruitment was never halted even during the recession, unlike in other areas. Also, the budget for the Defence Forces has been increased for next year, which is hugely significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> In terms of difficulty in recruiting people with particular skills to the Defence Forces, we accept that this is an issue. It is certainly an issue in the Air Corps because pilots and air traffic controllers can be paid much more to work in the same jobs in the private sector. That is now occurring not only in the Defence Forces but in parts of the public service. It is not universally the case across the public service but it is the same in some parts of the service in the context of certain roles, including some within the Defence Forces. What are we doing about it? We are doing two things. First, public sector pay restoration is under way. This is happening across the public sector. We agreed only a few weeks ago with the trade unions an extension to the Lansdowne Road agreement, which provides for two pay increases next year and provides for a full pay restoration for over 90% of public servants within the next couple of years. This action will very much reverse the pay cuts which were a feature of the Deputy's time in government and that continued into the early years of the previous Government. However, those cuts are being reversed now. In terms of some of the new recruits, pay restoration will be in the region of €5,000 a year, which is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> When it comes to particular areas within particular parts of the public service in respect of which we have a difficulty recruiting and retaining people because the private sector pays better, the Cabinet last week decided to refer those issues for a detailed study to the Public Service Pay Commission. Some of the areas involved are in health and others are in the Defence Forces. We have particular difficulties in recruiting and retaining people to certain professions in these areas. We look forward to the commission's report, particularly as it will look at the matter objectively. It will study the reasons for the difficulty in recruitment and retention, where it is and is not a feature within particular branches of the public service, and what might be done to rectify matters. It is not all about pay. As the Deputy will be aware, it can often be about other issues. We very much look forward to receiving that report and being able to act on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">I asked the Taoiseach a very simple question: does he accept - yes or no - that there is a deep crisis within our Defence Forces? His reply does not tally with the testimony of more than 600 personnel in an unprecedented piece of research conducted by the University of Limerick. There has been other supporting evidence regarding this crisis. I also asked whether he is satisfied about the health and safety of people working in the Defence Forces, particularly the Air Corps. I instanced some quotations from the research in regard to genuine fears and concerns about the capacity of the Air Corps and safety issues relating to the corps. I ask him, very simply, whether he is satisfied about health and safety within the Air Corps? He failed to reference the shocking failure in the context of the retention of Army personnel. With recruitment, people come in but others are flooding out. I reference Senator Gerard Craughwell's contribution to the Seanad yesterday. The Senator knows a thing or two about the Army, having served in it previously. He said that never in his experience has the Army, the Naval Service or the Air Corps been neglected so much by Government and never have they been at such a low ebb than is currently the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> We do not need the kind of typical response we tend get in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">What people are looking for - I refer here to the wives of Army personnel and those who have traditionally been associated with the Army - is some sense of acknowledgement of their plight and crisis. We have been raising this matter for well over a year and there is no sense of a solution coming from Government at all.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">To answer the Deputy's question, a crisis, no, but real substantive issues that need to be dealt with, absolutely. We completely accept that there are issues in the context of recruitment and retention in particular parts of the public service, including the Air Corps. In terms of health and safety, the Minister of State with responsibility for defence has received an assurance from the general officer commanding, GOC, of the Air Corps that any issues around health and safety will be dealt with. We have no specific concerns, therefore, in the context of health and safety. The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will meet the representative associations to discuss the findings of this particular report. It is important to say that since the report was compiled, PDFORRA has signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement. It did so in March, which was after the report was compiled. That allowed for the commencement of pay increases and payment in arrears to its members. These improved pay scales have now been implemented and backdated to 1 July. The Minister of State will attend the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, conference in the next week or so.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> It is also worth mentioning the kind of investment that is now going into the Defence Forces. There is a capital allocation of €406 million for the next six years, which is very significant. That comprises: €250 million for new Naval Service ships to replace existing vessels; €55 million for armoured personnel carriers as part of a programme running over five or six years; a Cessna aircraft replacement programme, the tender for which is ongoing; €11 million to purchase armoured utility and logistics vehicles; and €5 million for replacement Pilatus aircraft. In terms of barracks, €33 million worth of projects are now at various stages of construction, including: €3 million to upgrade the accommodation in the Curragh; €3.8 million for the locker block refurbishment at Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin; and €2.7 million for an upgrade to Custume Barracks in Athlone. By any measure, that is a significant capital investment programme taking place in the years ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">I want to talk to the Taoiseach about the North and about his Government's recent briefings to the media. Last week, press reports attributed to briefings from the Government said that Sinn Féin's leader in the North, Michelle O'Neill, did a deal with the DUP to restore the Executive but that she was blocked by senior members of the party. Michelle is a senior member of the party. In fact, she is the party's nominee for the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister when we get the institutions back in place. These briefings on the part of the Taoiseach's Government were untruthful, malicious and shameful. They were in line with his remarks to Teachta McDonald a few weeks ago. He said then that it is no wonder the people of Northern Ireland do not have an Executive "because this is the attitude of Sinn Féin. They are constantly hectoring and making smart aleck remarks. There is a lack of temperance, a lack of respect for other people and an inability to listen or to compromise." These were the Taoiseach's words, which reflect the attitude that underpinned last week's briefings and the claims that there was a basis for a deal and that Michelle O'Neill and Conor Murphy have been hung out to dry. None of this is true. In fairness to the DUP, Arlene Foster contradicted the spin to the effect that a deal was imminent last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Let me say again for the record that Sinn Féin's endeavour is to have the institutions reestablished and functioning properly as quickly as possible. I was in Stormont yesterday, on Monday and last week. I dealt with these issues this morning and will do so again later. I know that the process is slow. That is because of the resistance to change within elements of political unionism. These stubborn elements are being humoured by the British Government in denying citizens their rights, and the Taoiseach is tolerating it. These talks are essentially about implementing existing agreements that have been broken.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Equality, identity and rights are central to this. These are rights to which citizens are entitled in every other part of these islands. These are rights contained in the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements. Perhaps the Taoiseach would advise me on which of these rights citizens in the North should give up. Perhaps he would also advise the Dáil on how he discharged his responsibilities and how he approached the British Prime Minister in respect of these fundamental matters. It is no coincidence that the Government's briefings ran parallel with briefings from the British Government, although theirs were much more temperate. On reflection, why would this not be so, when they have the Taoiseach's shiny new communications unit to do the nasty briefings? Will the Taoiseach tell the Dáil and the people of this island the purpose of the briefings? What exactly was he trying to achieve?</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I never give up. The Taoiseach has learned nothing. I asked him a straightforward question. These were briefings from his Government. What about accountability? What about transparency? I asked him what they were about and he did not answer. The Taoiseach should also explain why a Government source accused Sinn Féin - as the Taoiseach has done just now - of being more focused on preparing for direct rule than on restoring the institutions in the North. Why am I particularly concerned about this accusation? It is because I wrote to the Taoiseach almost a fortnight ago about his Government's responsibility to prevent British direct rule in keeping with a long-standing agreement with the British. I have yet to receive a reply to that letter, although the briefing followed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> Why would the Taoiseach want to undermine Michelle O'Neill? Over 70% of nationalists in the North voted for the party she leads. Does the Taoiseach think those citizens do not read his remarks? They are absolutely dearg le fearg with him over the tone he has taken up. It is as if John Bruton was back in the Taoiseach's office.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">With respect to the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and John Bruton, the Taoiseach has to fulfil his responsibilities, his obligations and his duty to the people of the entire island. In particular, he must deal with the British Prime Minister as an equal and ensure that both Governments honour their obligations. That is much more difficult than last week's carry on. It is much more difficult than the Taoiseach's glib answers of a moment ago. It would, however, be much more beneficial to everyone, particularly the people in the North.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I have no difficulty speaking for myself. I think anyone in this House will know that I speak my mind and do not mince my words. I do not need to operate through Government briefings and I am not going to account for Government briefings any more than I would expect Deputy Adams to account for Sinn Féin briefings or unattributed sources in newspapers. What I have said, I have said very clearly. The primary responsibility to form an Executive in Northern Ireland falls to Sinn Féin and the DUP. They are the ones who went out and knocked on doors in several elections and sought a mandate from the citizens of Northern Ireland. They got a mandate and there is now a situation whereby the North could be the worst affected area in the European Union when it comes to Brexit but where there are no elected Ministers to speak for the people. We have a situation where the money for public services is running out.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The British Government may have to introduce a budget from London because politicians in Northern Ireland are willing to allow money to run out for education, health care and other services. There are enormous challenges to be dealt with. I ask Deputy Adams and his colleagues to make the necessary compromises to enable an agreement to be reached. In forming a coalition it is always necessary to make compromises. Fine Gael had to make many compromises to form the last two coalitions. It is important not to look for cover for those compromises. Make them, own them and defend them and do not try to spread the blame.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">I raise an issue of huge concern to both my constituents in Cork South-West and people all over the country. I speak of people who have been left hurt, sick and frustrated by the incompetence and delays on the part of the Health Service Executive, HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> For the many reasons I will outline, elder care is at an all time low. Yesterday, a 90 year old man from Bantry, west Cork, travelled 503 km over five hours to Kingsbridge Hospital, Belfast for a cataract operation, which took place this morning. Mr. John Patrick Harrington, is, as I said, 90 years old and is a carer for his wife. He is blind in one eye and was fast losing sight in his second eye such that an urgent operation was needed. His family was told that he could wait up to four years to have the procedure carried out under the HSE. While the proposed solution, which has now taken place, was against my own principles, I discussed it with the management of Kingsbridge Hospital in the context of the cross-border health care directive. The hospital, in turn, contacted the patient in Bantry on 2 October and 23 days on, as we speak, John Patrick, had his operation carried out in what the family describe as a stunning facility, and is now on the five-hour journey home to Bantry. Does the Taoiseach accept that this is a failure of the health system in this country? Is it also a failure to care for the elderly in our country, many of whom worked tirelessly and are now left suffering and in need of simple procedures? Is it right that I am now seeking volunteer drivers from west Cork to take elderly people to Belfast for simple operations that cannot be carried out in the South of Ireland? </p>
          <p eId="para_198"> I also want to draw the attention of the Taoiseach to a similar matter which, again, affects our elderly. Bandon Community Hospital is a state-of-the-art facility operated efficiently by management and staff. The extension and refurbishment works ongoing at that hospital for the past year and a half were completed in August 2017 but no patient has yet been allowed pass through its doors owing to the refusal of the HSE to adequately staff it, resulting in many elderly patients who urgently require beds having to travel 40 miles to Macroom Community Hospital for a bed, a journey for which no public transport is available. The Friends of Bandon Community Hospital and the people of Bandon have fundraised hundreds of thousands of euro only to see the newly-renovated hospital lie idle while the HSE twiddles its thumbs. Is this the right way to treat elderly people in west Cork or in any part of the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> In Bantry General Hospital, the contracts of a senior consultant, Mr. Aboghaly, and his registrar, Dr. Khan, expired two weeks ago. We now hear that interviews for their replacements have taken place in the past number of days and that replacements are imminent. Surely the HSE knew months in advance that these contracts were due to expire such that interviews could have taken place sooner. However, this did not happen and the much-needed surgical unit in Bantry hospital is now in jeopardy. Mr. Aboghaly was a consultant of excellence and his loss will have a huge affect on many elderly people in west Cork who relied on him. Again, I ask the Taoiseach, is this the right way to deal with our elderly and health care in west Cork?</p>

          <p eId="para_202">I am sure that for a long time before that, he would have been affected by loss of vision and all that comes with that, including isolation which I know can be much worse in a rural area. I am pleased to note that he was able to avail of the cross-border health care directive, which means his treatment was funded by the HSE and by the Irish taxpayer even though he had to travel to another jurisdiction for it. One of the benefits of EU membership is that people can avail of the cross-border directive. The number of people availing of it is increasing all of the time. I would like to see more people, at least, consider the option of having their treatment in another EU country and having it paid for by the Irish State. It would, of course, be preferable that people would be able to have these operations in their own counties or, at least, their own country. To try to achieve this, the Deputy will be aware that under budget 2017, funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund was increased significantly from approximately €20 million in 2017 to €55 million in 2018. In addition to this, a further €20 million is being provided to the HSE to enable it to reopen, staff and fully equip theatres in orthopaedic, ophthalmic and ENT hospitals to allow for an increase in the volume of these procedures to be carried out, including hip, knee and cataract operations. As part of this programme, an additional 20,000 such operations will be carried out in the next year. I sincerely hope that in the months ahead men and women with conditions and problems similar to that of the gentleman mentioned will get their treatment much quicker.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The Deputy will also be aware from the National Treatment Purchase Fund statistics that the number of people waiting for an operation or inpatient procedure has fallen for two months in a row. We anticipate that when the new data are published in a week or so, they will show the numbers have fallen for three months in a row. We have a long way to go but it is encouraging that after a long time, the number of people waiting on operations is now falling again.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. In regard to the 90 year old gentleman who, as I said, is currently on a five-hour journey to west Cork having had his operation carried out in Kingsbridge Hospital, Belfast, why is it not possible to have procedures of that type carried out in Cork or, at least in the South of Ireland? Why can our health service not treat our elderly in the same way as they can be treated in the North? Some 25 days on from when the first contact was made with Kingsbridge Hospital, the gentleman concerned has had his operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> In regard to Bandon Community Hospital and Bantry General Hospital, I urge the Taoiseach to speak to the Minister for Health about the issue I have raised. These are two excellent centres and they need to be open to the public. We need to know the surgical unit in Bantry General Hospital is safe. Can the Taoiseach assure me today that services at the surgical unit will not be cut back and that there will be no closure of services at Bantry General Hospital, which provides treatment in a catchment area of up to 90,000 people?</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> As I said earlier, health care is at an all-time low. Terminally ill patients are begging for medical cards, home help hours are being cut to the bare minimum and some carers must wait months on end for their payments to come through. Often persons have passed away before a carer's allowance application has been approved. This lack of care and compassion for our elderly is unacceptable. This is all happening on the Taoiseach's watch.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">When it comes to our health service, I acknowledge that we can do better. We do very well in lots of areas. It is important to recognise that and to recognise the work of our health service staff in that regard. Life expectancy in Ireland has improved considerably in recent years. This did not happen by accident. It is the result of better public health and a better health service. The number of cancer deaths is falling. The number of cardiovascular deaths by, for example, stroke and heart attack is falling considerably. Having not built any public hospitals in well over a decade, there are now three new public hospitals under construction, including the national children's hospital, the national forensic mental health hospital and the new national rehabilitation hospital in Dún Laoghaire, in respect of which I had the pleasure of turning the sod with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, earlier this week. We now have free GP care for children under six and pensioners over 70. We are reducing prescription charges and diabetic care can now be provided in GP surgeries. We are also seeing improvements in public health in terms of the decrease in alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking. We have very good screening programmes that are much better than those in other countries, for example, around breast and colorectal and cervical cancer. There are lots of good things happening in our health service. We should be fair to people who work in health services and fair in general in acknowledging this.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> The Deputy is correct that we can do better. I have outlined to him how we intend to do better when it comes to cataract procedures in particular. It is also important to point out that when it comes to people who are waiting, often the figures do not tell the full story. When it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who are waiting for an appointment or a procedure and operation, more than half will wait less than six months and approximately one third will wait less than three months. We should aim to get to a position where it is much better than that and in which the vast majority of people wait no more than three months but we have a long way to go.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">During Leaders' Questions on 5 April this year I raised the issue of the tracker mortgage fraud with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and I told him what has been appearing in the media in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I did not have a whistleblower within the banking system but, rather, a healthy suspicion of senior bankers backed up by 30 years of banking scandals and rip-offs such as the DIRT scandal, the Ansbacher accounts, the bogus non-resident accounts and the destruction of the country by the banks during the boom-bust period. I knew, as did every Irish citizen, that the banks and senior bankers have no moral compass. The tracker mortgage fraud is a huge scandal that requires criminal investigation. I asked the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, to make a formal complaint to the Garda and call in the fraud squad to investigate banks. I told him that any delay in ordering a Garda investigation could lead to the destruction or alteration or both of relevant records with a view to blaming subordinates and junior staff. In an effort to protect the banks and senior bankers, he refused to call in the Garda. Six months later, all Members can see the extent of the massive fraud involving 15 banks and €1 billion and affecting 20,000 or more mortgage holders. It is abundantly clear that the scandal involves collusion by the banks in a systemic and widespread fraud. It is a scandal that the Garda has still not been sent into the banks and that no formal complaint has been made to it. Does the Taoiseach accept that if the then Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, had agreed to my demand six months ago to send the fraud squad into the banks, much fraud could have been avoided and much trauma, pain and even deaths and self harm prevented? Will the Taoiseach at long last send in the Garda fraud squad today in order that senior bankers can be held to account? Does he accept that until senior bankers are made subject to the normal criminal fraud law, more people will become victims of this kind of bank crime?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_212">The Central Bank has engaged the Garda on the matter and because that has been done, it is probably inappropriate for me to comment upon it except to say that this is a democracy and neither the Taoiseach nor the former Taoiseach nor the Minister for Justice and Equality can send in the Garda or the fraud squad. A complaint is made to the Garda and considered and the Garda then decides whether it needs to carry out an investigation or a raid. I do not know if Deputy Healy made a complaint to the Garda at that time but it would have been open to him to so do.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> The people who should be at the front of our minds are the 20,000 individuals and families who have been affected by the scandal. Considering the average size of a household, there are probably 40,000 people behind the 20,000 accounts. Almost 1% of the country's population has been affected by this issue and subjected to unnecessary stress, financial hardship and in some cases lost their homes or investment properties. As we said last week, that banks incorrectly removed people from tracker mortgages was a serious breach of trust. We also believe some banks have been dragging their feet in solving this problem at a real human cost. We are in the middle of a complex process but affected customers should have their tracker mortgages restored and be fully compensated as a matter of priority. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, met the chief executive officers of the main banks such as Bank of Ireland, AIB, Ulster Bank, Permanent TSB and KBC and sought a detailed explanation from each bank as to the status of its tracker redress programme, an explanation for why the process has been so unbelievably slow and its plans for resolving it quickly. Although the Central Bank as regulator is a fully independent body, the Minister has contacted it to make sure it has sufficient powers and resources to ensure the banks resolve the problem. The Government will take further action in the coming weeks and months if there is not further swift progress on the matter resulting in the restoration of those 20,000 people and their families to the correct interest rate, as well as full compensation and redress.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">The Taoiseach said the Central Bank has been in contact with the Garda but he knows that no formal complaint has been made either by the Central Bank or the Taoiseach, who is quite entitled to make a complaint. The banks have a 30-year history of scandal after scandal and have been rewarded for that. The public was forced to bail them out to the tune of €64 billion and citizens have suffered desperate austerity and deprivation as a result. Variable rate mortgage holders are being ripped off by having to pay twice the EU average rate. Unfortunately, successive Governments have protected the bankers. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, was sent in to discuss the issue and admonish the banks, whatever that means. At best, it is a slap on the wrist. It is possible that the banks will be fined. The Taoiseach knows that any fine levied on the banks will be paid by their customers. Why is the Government deliberately avoiding sending in the Garda and making a formal complaint on the matter as either the Taoiseach or the Government could? Is it not now clear that banks and bankers can only be brought to their senses by criminal investigation? The Taoiseach should send in forensic accountants from the Garda and the fraud squad and should do so now.</p>

The Bill is hugely important for the health of our society. Some 500 people die each year from alcohol-related cancers, there are three deaths every day due to alcohol and approximately 1,500 hospital beds are occupied as a result of alcohol-related illnesses. Professor Frank Murray recently warned of the enormous lobbying against the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 by the alcohol industry. The alcohol industry should have no role in formulating national alcohol policy. The autumn legislative programme describes the Bill as a priority.

As the Taoiseach is aware, four years have passed since the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant scheme closed following concerns raised by the Ombudsman about its legality. As a result, thousands of people with disabilities can no longer get the supports they need to aid their mobility. For months the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities has answered parliamentary questions indicating that the general scheme of this legislation will go to Government shortly. He has given the same answer since February at least. Why is this delay ongoing, and when will this House have concrete proposals to deal with this long-standing matter?</p>

          <p eId="para_233">I am not sure specifically what is the question. All I can say is that the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics is based in St. James's Hospital and is staffed by medical people, pharmacologists and economists. They receive information from the drug companies, assess the claims made by the drug companies as to the efficacy of a medicine, assess whether the cost proposed reflects the efficacy and make a recommendation to the HSE as to whether it should be funded or not. A similar process is run by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. It is a normal system that is used around the world. It is always open to companies to come back with new data. Very often a company will present data stating that a drug does this, that or the other thing and that does not necessarily always stack up. However, new data can come along and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics is always open to reconsidering applications if new evidence shows a medicine to be effective.</p>

This is a very serious matter because it is having an impact on the effectiveness of the committee system and, I believe, the structures of our parliamentary institutions in Leinster House.

          <p eId="para_252">It is on the same matter. The Taoiseach will know that I brought forward legislation in February to abolish the mandatory retirement age. It received cross-party support on Second Stage in this Chamber. It ended up in the justice committee and went through pre-committee scrutiny. That is seven months ago. I have written twice to the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and likewise have not received any response. We are waiting for a money message. My Bill is one of 18 pieces of opposition legislation stacked up there and, for whatever reason, no response or money message has been received. I do not know whether this is a deliberate attempt to bury these critically important pieces of legislation, particularly this one, which received cross-party support. We need a response. The people out there who are being forced to retire against their will need a response on this, they need a money message and it needs to be progressed immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">I want to raise the issue of rural transport. There is a commitment on page 50 of the programme for Government that a report on rural transport will be made available within six months. The issues to be examined are, for example, the sustainability and accessibility of existing routes, in addition to the potential of new routes. This is a huge issue in rural communities, as the Taoiseach knows. I was very disappointed to learn the report will not be available until 2018 because the work simply has not been carried out. What that is saying to rural communities is: "Put up and shut up". We will not put up and we certainly will not shut up either. We want action on this. We want basic services and transport in our communities. This issue has been raised a number of times and I certainly will be raising it again until it is resolved.</p>

I am not familiar with the details of the particular report in question but there is absolutely no need for the Deputy to either put up or shut up. I can assure her we are very committed to expanding rural transport routes and, indeed, the number of rural transport routes this year is 1,300, whereas only two years ago it was just over 1,000. While we might not be producing enough reports to satisfy the Deputy, we are certainly increasing the number of routes and services.</p>

As we know, one in six couples are having trouble conceiving. For all of them, it brings with it a great emotional toll, as well as financial hardship, and every month that passes is causing more emotional and financial hardship. When will this be available for the women who need it? I also want an assurance that it will be for all, regardless of income.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">The heads of the assisted human reproduction Bill were agreed by Cabinet in the last few weeks and we expect it to go to committee for pre-legislative scrutiny as soon as possible. It is a complicated area. Legislating for and regulating assisted human reproduction is not straightforward but plenty of other countries do it and we should do it, although we are well behind others in that regard. Once that legislation is through, it will facilitate us to bring in a scheme of financial support for this treatment. While the detail of that has not been worked out, the Deputy will be aware the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has done a study which sets out some of the options. Some financial support is already available in that IVF and other treatments are tax deductible and one can claim 20% back in tax and the medicines associated with it are covered under the drugs payment scheme. Nonetheless, it is the strong view of the Government that we should be doing much better. Many couples who have difficulties with fertility borrow a lot of money and even re-mortgage their houses on occasion to pay for this treatment. We need to do better by them. Before we can put in place a scheme of financial support to do that or treat it as a normal medical treatment, as we should, we first must make sure we legislate for it and regulate it.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">Last year's Finance Bill made a specific commitment with regard to the introduction of new dental treatments for PRSI contributors. However, many people have contacted my office for the up-to-date position on when these new benefits will be introduced. Can the Taoiseach advise as to when persons with relevant PRSI contributions will be entitled to avail of the reintroduction of free dental scale and polish treatment?</p>

          <p eId="para_276">That was actually the Social Welfare Bill, which I introduced last year. I can confirm that the changes to the dental benefit scheme will come into effect from 28 October, that is, in a few days' time. From that date, dental benefit will provide for a payment towards either a scale or polish, or, if clinically necessary, protracted periodontal treatment, in addition to an existing free dental exam. If the normal fee charged by the individual dental clinic for a scale or polish is €42 or less, the treatment will be free to the customer. However, if the normal fee is over €42, the customer will pay the balance up to a maximum co-payment of €15. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will make a payment of €42 in regard to protracted periodontal treatment, with the customer responsible for the balance of any fee over this amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> The dental examination and treatments outlined will be available once per calendar year and, for the first time, will be extended to farmers and the self-employed who pay PRSI at class S. This is the restoration of the free scale and polish with the maximum co-payment of €15. It is very much part of the Government's policy of expanding social insurance and making work pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">The programme for Government pledges to increase capital investment in infrastructure. Obviously, this is very good news for the construction industry but it is not so much good news for workers on low pay who are trapped in bogus subcontracts. Both in March and July of this year I asked during Questions on Promised Legislation for the then Taoiseach to give us an update on the report that was being led by the Department of Finance and which formally involved his own Department. Three months on, we have no update. Today, I received an anonymised letter from a construction worker in my constituency who is working on a site in Clondalkin and is being paid below the statutory wage. Because he has been forced into a bogus subcontract, he is not able to benefit from proper PRSI contributions. My question is simple. When will that report be published and, crucially, when will the Government introduce the necessary legislation to protect workers and taxpayers and abolish bogus subcontracting in the construction industry?</p>

          <p eId="para_279">I understand from the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, that the report will be published in the near future although I do not have an exact date for it. It indicates that bogus self-employment is a real issue but perhaps not on the scale that people may have previously thought. That, of course, is evidenced by the fact the number of people in self-employment has not increased dramatically but has increased in line with general employment, so the view that a huge number of people are being pushed into self-employment is not supported by the statistics. That is not to say it does not happen on occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> To respond to something else the Deputy said, I do not agree with him that an increase in capital investment is solely good for the construction industry. Let us not forget what that increase in capital investment is - it is more schools for kids to go to, more hospitals for patients to use and more roads to get us to work and to home. I am disappointed that a Deputy of this House should be pejorative about capital investment in that way.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">I want to raise the issue of the appointment of special advisers by the Government, particularly by the Taoiseach, who signs all of these orders. Under the Public Service Management Act 1997, the lawful power to appoint special advisers exists in section 11. It has to be done on foot of a Government order and that order takes the form of a statutory instrument which the Taoiseach signs. The issue that arises is that in more than two dozen of those cases, not only did the Taoiseach appoint the special advisers but he backdated their appointment, in some cases by 12 weeks. In the case of all six of his own special advisers, he backdated their appointment.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">When the finance committee raised this issue, on my insistence, with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the private secretary replied and said that the Department was seeking advice from the Attorney General's office on whether the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2007 granted the power to make such orders with retrospective effect.</p>

Last week, I raised the issue of bus services being heavily disrupted in north Kildare-south Meath. Over the weekend, we learned that Irish Rail strikes were planned for the coming months. I believe that six dates have been announced. From dealings with the National Transport Authority, I am aware that not only are service disruptions becoming the norm, but planned service improvements have been deferred, for example, the ten-minute DART and extra services from Kildare through the Phoenix Park tunnel into the city centre. These improvements have been deferred, rescheduled or postponed indefinitely due to what appears to be ongoing industrial unrest, but that is not clear in some cases. What actions is the Government taking on these issues?</p>

          <p eId="para_299">These are very important matters, and probably matters that would be better answered by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport than me. I am very encouraged by the fact that we are seeing a significant increase in the number of people using public transport this year and last year, and a lot of that is down to the improvements in the economy and the fact that there are more people working. I am looking forward in a few weeks' time to opening the Luas cross-city with the Minister, Deputy Ross, which is a project that I signed the order on seven years ago. I remember well at the time that, when my officials told me that it would take seven years, I thought, "Sure, I never know where I will be then".</p>

          <p eId="para_302">It is good to see those improvements happening but, on a more serious point, I certainly would share the Deputy's concerns that any industrial dispute or any strike in Irish Rail would impact very seriously on taxpayers, passengers, and working people. Strikes, unfortunately, in the transport sector happen too often. They are always resolved in the normal way with the engagement of the Workplace Relations Commission and sometimes the Labour Court. I would really express my wish on behalf of the Government and people and passengers that the deal that they are inevitably going to come to anyway they come to without unnecessary strikes.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">As the Taoiseach knows, the programme for Government committed to a second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford, subject to an independent review. That review took place. Unfortunately, it was not favourable. Just before the summer recess, all of the Waterford Oireachtas Members met the Minister for Health, who committed to a national review. He also stated that he would expedite that review, that it would be underpinned by an international independent person of standing and have other members as well, and that he would revert to us with a timeframe and clear terms of reference. That has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> I do not know whether the Taoiseach has this information at his disposal, but will he confirm when the review will take place, whether the terms of reference are in place and has the work on finding someone of international standing who can carry out this review been done? Will the Taoiseach outline to the House the timeframe? This is an important issue to people in the south east who are without emergency cardiac care on a 23-7 basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">Again, I think that this question would be better answered by the Minister for Health because I may not have the most up-to-date information. I understand that a mobile cath lab is now in place in Waterford. I will be interested to see in the coming months the impact that that has on wait times for patients. If it has reduced wait times for patients, I think that strengthens the case for having a permanent second cath lab in the hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">I will be brief. In terms of the programme for Government, Deputy Gino Kenny raised the issue of the provision of orphan drugs and drugs for rare diseases. In the Taoiseach's reply, he referred to establishing the efficacy of such drugs, but I remind him that, in some circumstances, there are only three, four or five patients affected by the disease in question. As such, establishing that type of information is next to impossible. We need to consider separately drugs for rare diseases, which affect approximately 0.05% of the population, and ultra rare diseases, which affect less than 0.02% of the population. If we do not, we will never get drugs that are badly needed for a very small population group.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> I wish to ask about the drug Respreeza, which we have discussed many times in the Chamber. The company has agreed to supply it for the next six months free of charge, but the HSE is now in a battle with the company about who will pay for the drug's distribution over those months. The H3N2 virus, or the so-called Aussie flu, is out there. If it comes to these shores, the Respreeza patient group will be extremely vulnerable. We need to get this issue resolved. I call on the Taoiseach to intervene with the HSE.</p>

Can the Taoiseach update the House as to why the Government permitted that 70,000 tonne beef offer to be made if it is opposed to it, given that the final agreement will have to be accepted by all countries? Is it the case that neither the Taoiseach nor President Macron put up any resistance to that at the European Council meeting or that they did not discuss it in any serious way at yesterday's meeting?</p>

          <p eId="para_325">Not really, but I am happy to answer briefly. President Macron and I are very much aligned on this issue. We both support Mercosur because free trade is, on balance, a good thing for the Irish economy, creating jobs and revenue. This deal will potentially be eight times bigger than the deal with Canada and, as such, it is something we should be positive about. We have a particular interest and concern, however, in respect of the beef sector, which could be adversely affected by this at the same time that it might also be adversely affected by Brexit. As such, President Macron and I agreed yesterday that France and Ireland would work closely together on this to ensure that we do not see our beef industry and farmers subjected to unfair competition and that environmental, welfare and other standards are at the highest level. As the Deputy is aware, international trade is a European competence under the treaties. It is part of what one signs up to when one becomes a member state that international trade is a competence of the European Union, not of national governments.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">The first line of the health section in the programme for Government refers to access to timely care, which is laughable in a context of waiting lists exceeding 680,000. In my constituency of Mayo, we are in the bizarre position that children cannot even get on to the waiting list for children's physiotherapy services itself. We have 662 children who quality for paediatric physiotherapy, of whom 270 are currently getting services, with waiting times of up to 137 weeks for treatment. I am quoting from the response I received on this. There are 392 children wait-listed due to staffing deficits while a further 97 children cannot even get onto the waiting list. I was told that any capacity available on the part of the remaining 2.8 whole-time equivalent staff is devoted to those caseloads left open by vacancies and that it is not possible to estimate waiting times for new referrals. We have the bizarre situation that we do not even have a waiting time for 97 children in one county. If we cannot even get to grips with the waiting lists we have, what are the Taoiseach's plans and those of his Minister for Health to deal with those children who cannot even get on to a waiting list?</p>

          <p eId="para_333">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_334">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to extend the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to inspect the accounts, books and records of persons in receipt of public funds, and to provide for connected matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The purpose of the Bill is to provide the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General with the power to audit any public moneys spent by an organisation, regardless of the amount. It is very important that the State's public auditor is able to chase taxpayers' money wherever it is spent. The Bill will not confer an obligation on the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit the accounts of those organisations, rather it allows his or her office to establish, where necessary, that the money was spent for the appropriate purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> Over the past 20 years, we have seen a massive expansion of Government funding for non-governmental agencies, especially in the health and education sectors. Billions of euro are spent every year on section 38 and section 39 organisations and we have seen a litany of scandals. While the vast majority of organisations have not been the subject of scandals and are very good at spending taxpayers' money, a small percentage of them have presented real difficulties. Our position is that if people in the private sector want to act the bowsie with their own money, it is a matter for them, not the State. If, however, organisations are misusing public money, even where their public funding component is below 50%, the State's public auditor should be able to chase the money. That is not the case at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> The Bill allows the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to follow public money only where it is provided to a public or private organisation. It does not mean he or she would be able to examine the way private money is spent but if any public money is spent, the office would be allowed to do so. In the spirit of accountability and transparency and at a time when we have had so many scandals in relation to the spending of public money, this would be a useful tool and power for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to have.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">I am very pleased to propose with Deputy Cullinane this simple but important Bill which could, if enacted, strengthen good governance, accountability and the public interest within all organisations in receipt of public moneys. I see no reason it would not be supported by the Government or, indeed, everyone in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for some years, I have seen at first hand the enormous value of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts have exposed poor governance in various organisations in receipt of very substantial amounts of public moneys. Oversight keeps organisations right, be they large or small. The State has a particular responsibility to ensure that all public moneys are spent appropriately and for the maximum benefit of the people. It is, after all, the people who entrust the Government of the day to collect and administer their moneys for the collective benefit of all. That is why the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts is central to the oversight of general public administration. By chasing the money, people can be assured the necessary checks and balances are in place to protect their money and the public services on which they rely.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Under existing legislation, the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot always follow the money. This restriction is imposed on him or her by law and by us as politicians, and it simply makes no sense. It has only served to undermine the public's confidence in the much needed services sections 38 and 39 organisations deliver on behalf of the State. Our most vulnerable people rely on these services and they might not otherwise be available to families, be they in mental health, disability supports, workplace training or, indeed, rehabilitation. The Bill seeks to set this wrong to right. It enhances the principle that all public moneys be subject to the same scrutiny regardless of the organisation's size or funding composition when in receipt of the public's cash. To complement the legislation, Sinn Féin also provided an additional allocation for the Comptroller and Auditor General in its alternative budget document to assist the office in the expanded role we envisage for it. The office is under pressure even as it stands.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> The Government must learn from the mistakes of the past. All of us from whatever party and, indeed, from none must enable the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to fulfil its role within the public administrative system. Departmental bodies such as the HSE must, in turn, address the shortfalls in their internal oversight policies and procedures. This is how we, as elected representatives, protect the public purse and deliver First World public services to the highest standards of delivery, accountability and oversight.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_348">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_349"> The 2017 national risk assessment was published on 29 August. This is the fourth national risk assessment produced by the Government. It aims to provide an overview of strategic risks facing the country. It is focused on the identification of risk and is not intended to replicate or displace the detailed risk management strategies across Departments and agencies in respect of individual risks. Instead, the assessment aims to stimulate consideration within Government, and more widely in public debate, on the strategic risks that face the country over the medium and long term. As in previous years, the national risk assessment was prepared in collaboration with a steering group of Departments and agencies. It follows an open policy debate organised by my Department and a process of public consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_350"> Since its inception, the process has highlighted a number of important strategic risks at an early stage. Indeed, a number of risks identified have since come to pass or become increasingly prominent in the intervening years, including withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. This year's assessment states that Brexit is an overarching theme that could have far reaching impacts on nearly all aspects of national life, while also noting the importance of keeping sight of our other strategic risks. Other risks identified include possible changes to US trade and tax policy, risks arising from continued housing supply constraints, climate change, technological risks, competitiveness pressures and changing demographics.</p>
            <p eId="para_351"> Many of the risks identified are being resolved through policies and actions in place or being developed by relevant Departments. Others are largely dependent on developments at international level over which we have little control. However, the purpose of this process is to encourage honest and open discussion about strategic risks facing the country, including in the Oireachtas.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_352">If one did not want to sleep at night, one should read the national risk assessment report, which outlines everything that could potentially befall us. The issue of Brexit is central to the assessment but changes to our climate have the potential for even greater harm. We have witnessed Hurricane Ophelia and the enormous damage that it did to our country, including the taking of three lives. Many parts of the country meanwhile are still cleaning up following Storm Brian. It is clear our weather patterns are changing and that reflects climate change internationally. We cannot individually hide from stronger and more violent storms and increased rainfall.</p>
            <p eId="para_353"> I am sure the Taoiseach will be aware that a court challenge has been lodged to the national mitigation plan. Friends of the Irish Environment claim approval of the plan should be quashed on several grounds, including that it fails to specify measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as it is required to do. They also claim that the plan does not comply with the requirements of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. Since the House has not even debated the mitigation plan, what is the Taoiseach's response to these charges? When will he afford the House a proper opportunity to debate the issue of climate change in general and, more specifically, our strategies to deal with it?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_186">
            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_354">I support the call for time to be set aside to discuss climate change and all the consequences it has for people on this island and worldwide. The Government could usefully set aside time to discuss the national risk assessment report. I would like to address one issue, which is Brexit. Research conducted by the European Commission's agricultural and rural affairs committee warns that a hard Brexit with no deal could wipe out almost 10% of the State's GDP and this will most severely affect agriculture. That is a more serious outcome than was previously envisaged by those who have spoken on this issue. Has the Taoiseach seen the report? If so, has he any comment on it?</p>
            <p eId="para_355"> Earlier this week, Theresa May told her parliament that no physical infrastructure would be imposed on the Border after Britain leaves the EU. I do not know how she can say that because if we do not have the type of deal Sinn Féin has argued for, which would provide for special status for the North within the EU, member states will enforce border controls and so on. Did the British Prime Minister give the Taoiseach in their recent 40 minute telephone conversation any idea of how Britain intends to achieve this?</p>
            <p eId="para_356"> Mr. Barnier's staff have started work on drafting a withdrawal treaty. Has the Taoiseach instructed our officials to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is included as an annex to such a treaty? Did he raise this at last week's Council meeting or at any bilateral meetings with other European leaders? Did he raise it yesterday with President Macron?</p>

            <p eId="para_357">The work of the emergency services and State agencies during the recent storms was incredibly impressive, as was the work of the National Emergency Co-ordination Centre. Given the Taoiseach has talked about how the structures worked well, I am sure he will agree that we should acknowledge the work of Deputy O'Dea who, as Minister for Defence, created the current structures and implemented the framework which is still in place today. I hope the Taoiseach's stated desire last July to rebrand the structures along the lines of the UK COBRA committee will be shelved because an attempt to centralise the spotlight goes directly against the lead agency principle, which is what is working. Will he outline to the House what changes, if any, are planned in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_358"> What is the status of the new framework document, which has been ready for almost two years but which has yet to be published? While the national risk assessment identifies climate-related events as an increasing risk, it has been consistent in pointing to cyber-related risks as posing the greatest threat to us. What measures are envisaged to take action in this area? For example, we have strict laws concerning election spending and activity. Given what has been evident in the US, France, the Brexit referendum and a host of small countries, has the Taoiseach initiated any work to protect the integrity of our own elections?</p>

            <p eId="para_359">I echo the previous three Deputies who have raised the problem we have in that we are identifying climate as a risk but any assessment of our response to it in either mitigation or adoption is not being taken seriously. I echo the calls for further debate in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_360"> I will suggest one other area which is missing from the document. The definition of risk, timescales and so on is dependent on the timeframe one is considering. However, it seems to me that we are facing an increasing risk in Ireland and across the world from the reduction of biodiversity that is occurring. It is a different risk and it may not be immediate but it is fundamental. We are seeing it in the loss of species in the seas, in the lost fertility of our soils and in the halving of the volumes of insect life in our country over the past 30 or 40 years. People might say that we can manage each on its own and that it is not a huge risk to the country but combined, when we continue to degrade our environment and allow it to get to a stage where it will not be able to recover, I argue it is the most fundamental risk. The climate issue is related because restoring wildlife will help us to manage climate in a variety of ways. Why is it that we do not include that sort of biological risk of the destruction of our environment, which is happening, included within the risks?</p>

            <p eId="para_361">I want to talk about the risk of fire. After the Grenfell Tower fire, much concern was expressed about the housing stock in this country. Kevin Hollingsworth, a chartered surveyor, stated that up to 40% of the housing stock built during the Celtic Tiger period was non-compliant with fire safety standards and compartmentation requirements to stop the spread of fire and there were promises of reviews of multi-storey buildings. I would like to know what became of all of that concern and when we will hear about these risks. I have pressed this issue on a number of occasions and I am getting slightly frustrated now. I have engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, on issues to do with the technical guidance documents dealing with fire safety and possible problems with them, and I think he is acting in good faith. However, we have been trying to get a meeting with officials at the Department responsible for the environment to discuss these issues and serious allegations about the defective nature of the fire safety regulations and compliance with fire safety. People's lives are seriously at risk. I have seen estates in Dublin which fire consultants tell me are an immediate and imminent fire hazard and where we could have repeats of the Grenfell Tower fire. I want that meeting with officials of the Department of the Taoiseach and the relevant Minister, be it Deputy English or whoever, to happen. We have been messed around for weeks. It is a serious, urgent and life-threatening risk if the scale of breaches of fire safety in residential buildings in this country are anything like what Kevin Hollingsworth says they are.</p>

            <p eId="para_362">On Storm Ophelia, I am advised this morning by ESB Networks that all homes and businesses have now been reconnected to the electricity network. I join with others in acknowledging the phenomenal work of the staff of ESB Networks, the assistance we received ScottishPower and others in Britain and from Électricité de France, EDF, and Réseau de Transport d'Électricité, RTE, in France, which also came to help.</p>
            <p eId="para_363"> I have no difficulty in acknowledging the role of the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, in establishing the Office of Emergency Planning, which showed its worth last week. I do not propose to change the approach fundamentally but we should always look at what was done well and what could have been done better after any major national crisis or serious event and make changes on foot of that review. Cabinet committee F, which is similar to the COBRA committee in the UK but not the same, is not designed to replace the Office of Emergency Planning but is something separate. It is an opportunity for Ministers, in the form of a Cabinet sub-committee, to get together with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and others to understand better threats such as terrorism or cyberattacks and consider what we can do to prevent those or prepare to manage them should they occur. We have only had one meeting so far and another one is scheduled to be held in the next few weeks. We have not considered the risk of outside bodies or entities trying to interfere in our elections and perhaps we should give that consideration given that it is a real problem and is happening all over the world now. I understand that it may even have happened in Catalonia recently, with external actors spreading fake news and things such as that. It should be a matter of concern for all of us.</p>
            <p eId="para_364"> I am aware of the court challenge to the national adaptation plan and the Government will respond to that challenge. I would welcome a debate in this House on climate change, the national planning framework and the capital plan. However, scheduling such matters is a matter for the Business Committee, of which I am not a member.</p>
            <p eId="para_365"> I have seen the latest reports on Brexit and how it may impact our economy. I am not sure we need another report to tell us that a hard Brexit would damage our economy. I think we all know that. The work that I am doing is trying to prevent it. We are doing everything that we can to prevent that outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_366"> I welcome Prime Minister's May's strengthening of her language in recent weeks ruling out any physical infrastructure on the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. That is very welcome. I said it at the dinner in Brussels and unequivocally restated it in the House of Commons. As is often the case with the statements from the UK Government, while the words are welcome and we agree with the sentiments, we need to see them backed up with the detail on how they can be written into international agreements and law, which is what is required. We do not quite have that yet, which is one of the reasons sufficient progress has not been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_367"> The Good Friday Agreement is always raised in meetings to do with Brexit. It was raised in my meeting with President Macron yesterday and it was raised at the European Council meeting last week. Whether it is necessary to include it as an annexe to the UK exit treaty is a different matter. It is already a recognised international agreement. I simply do not know at this stage if it would be beneficial to add it as an annexe to that treaty but I will give it further thought.</p>
            <p eId="para_368"> The risk to biodiversity can be considered for the 2018 national risk assessment. If Deputy Eamon Ryan would like to make a proposal or submission on it, I will make sure that the people in my Department who co-ordinate this will take a look at it.</p>

            <p eId="para_383"> Since the meeting on 15 September, the Government has announced a number of additional measures following the review of Rebuilding Ireland.

            <p eId="para_387">I understand that Cabinet committee D covers Irish Rail. Some people might be surprised that the next meeting of the committee is scheduled for 23 November given that there will be a national rail strike next Wednesday. It will be the first of five. The strike is being staged by a group of workers whose pay has effectively been frozen for ten years and who do a very good job.</p>
            <p eId="para_388">Irish Rail carried 43 million passengers in 2016, an increase of more than 3 million on the previous year. The problems in the company do not stem from the workers but from successive Governments. In 2007, the State subsidy for Irish Rail was €189 million. Last year, it was €110 million. That is a massive cut, in the region of 70%.</p>
            <p eId="para_389"> I was told this morning that the workers have been offered a pay increase of 1.75% but there are lots of strings attached. The first is that they would accept line closures and the second is that they would effectively refund their pay increase through forced redeployment, reductions in contracted hours, freezing of increments, etc. Some workers could have their pay cut by as much as €60 per week. The Taoiseach expressed concern about the effect of a strike on working people. There are two groups of working people involved here, namely, the commuters and the staff. By sticking to its policy of low investment in the company and low pay for staff, it seems that responsibility for the strike lies at the Government's door and that it is responsible for the difficulties faced by working people. Would the Taoiseach not consider convening a meeting of that Cabinet committee to ensure a decent pay increase for these hard-pressed workers?</p>

            <p eId="para_390">Does the Taoiseach have a definitive date for the publication of the capital plan? We should agree the national planning framework at least in tandem with, if not before, we allocate money under the capital plan. It seems we are now pushing back the date for finalising the national planning framework and I agree with that because there are many new submissions to come in. We need to get it right but it seems odd that we would determine the next decade of capital expenditure and then determine the national planning framework. Does the Taoiseach have a view on that?</p>
            <p eId="para_391"> The Taoiseach will recall that during our time in government I set a limit of 10% on the amount of money that could be allocated to public private partnerships, PPPs, in proportion to the overall capital budget. By their nature, PPPs are more expensive and it seems odd that we would opt for them if we can borrow money at a much lower rate on the open market now. We needed PPPs when there was fiscal constraint and we could not borrow sufficient money. I hear talk about loosening that and having more PPPs when, after we reach our medium term objective of a balanced budget in structural terms next year, we should be able to borrow significant moneys at a much cheaper rate. I would be interested in hearing of the Taoiseach's attitude to PPPs in the context of the next development plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_392">One very important part of our national infrastructure is ports and harbours. What is the point in the Government's passing legislation, such as the Harbours Act 2015, when nothing happens afterward? The Taoiseach probably helped to prepare the legislation given that he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport up to July 2014. The Act sets out future of ports of regional significance, including Dún Laoghaire Harbour, and this was supposed to reflect national ports policy. Two years on, however, nothing has happened to Dún Laoghaire Harbour. Under the legislation, responsibility for Dún Laoghaire Harbour was to be transferred to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_393"> I told the Taoiseach repeatedly while he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that there is a totally dysfunctional, out of control, unaccountable quango in Dún Laoghaire Harbour coming up with madcap plans that never materialise but cost a lot of money to dream up, such as giant cruise berths, which were shot down, floating pools, floating hotels and floating apartments. What is needed is for the harbour company to float off into history and for the harbour to be taken under the control of the people and the local authority, which will come up with plans that respect the unique heritage and importance of Dún Laoghaire Harbour and reflect the aspirations of people locally, instead of nothing happening. A lot of money is being wasted. There are major financial questions hanging over the harbour company after due diligence studies and risk assessments that go on and on but nothing happens. Will the Government play any role in expediting what were intended to be the consequences of legislation that was passed two years ago in respect of Dún Laoghaire Harbour?</p>

            <p eId="para_394">Has a Cabinet committee discussed the urgent need for investment in our wastewater and sewerage infrastructure? The wastewater treatment facilities in 50 of our large towns and cities do not comply with EU standards. These include the facilities at Ardee, Drogheda and Dundalk in my constituency. Untreated raw sewage is still entering the environment in 44 urban areas. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, warns that projects to deal with a high risk of pollution and a threat to public health have been delayed for at least three years. These projects include those at Ardee, Blackrock, Castlebellingham, Drogheda, Dundalk, Dunleer, Omeath and Tallanstown in County Louth. They are among 148 priority urban areas where improvements are required in order to meet the EU standards. This local infrastructure is failing because of the consistent lack of investment by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and, also, the Labour Party when it was in government.</p>

            <p eId="para_398">At the start of this year, the Taoiseach's predecessor told the House that the infrastructure plan was finished and ready to go. It was in an advanced enough state that the Taoiseach, during the leadership campaign, announced the figures with the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, smiling alongside him. Since then, it has been delayed repeatedly. Despite this, the medium-term capital investment figures in the recent budget were not changed. The delay is not about points of scale and substance, it appears to be purely presentational.</p>
            <p eId="para_399"> Last week, the head of the strategic communications unit announced that he would be running a campaign to sell the new infrastructure plan. How much will be spent on this and will the campaign be prepared before the Cabinet agrees the plan? The failure to deliver on capital plans is a recurrent problem with this Government. Every housing target has been missed and we discovered in recent days that work on 25% of the schools announced as beginning construction in 2015 has not started. Before the Taoiseach publishes any new plan, will he agree, or undertake to publish, a statement on the delivery of current targets? Not many statements have been made recently, although we heard for two years that the Government would build so many houses and schools. Could someone please analyse and compare what has been constructed with what was committed to, promised and announced?</p>

            <p eId="para_400">The Taoiseach will be aware that several schools, including some in our constituency - a number of them DEIS schools - effectively required to be rebuilt or remodelled under the schools building programme and, in particular, the schools refurbishment programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_401">The plans have been submitted. I understand that in many cases, contractors fell by the wayside given the collapse of the construction industry. Nonetheless, the delays are now running past a year and a half. I am really concerned about the future of some schools. In respect of an enormous number of recently built and extremely fine schools in Dublin west, teachers in long-standing schools are being left in the freezing cold with the rain coming in and no insulation. The Taoiseach referenced this during various constituency functions we have both attended. These schools are now two to three years behind the given date that was published in good faith. What is going on with regard to the schools building list? Is it an attempt by the Minister for Education and Skills to hold back money? Is it simply confusion in that Department so that they cannot get the schools we need built?</p>

            <p eId="para_402">Cabinet committee D mainly covers infrastructure but it also covers transport, which is a key part of our infrastructure. It is a Cabinet committee. Cabinet committees do not deal and never have dealt with industrial relations disputes. These disputes are dealt with by the Workplace Relations Commission and then by the Labour Court if a resolution cannot be found. It is correct to say that Irish Rail staff have faced a prolonged pay freeze for the best part of ten years and are now being offered a small pay rise. It is important not to forget that there are lots of people who did not have a ten-year pay freeze; they had very substantial pay cuts and will not see their pay fully restored until 2019 or 2020. Many of those people will be the passengers who are affected when the rail strike occurs and we should be cognisant of and sensitive to that fact because these people are not being offered a pay rise and will lose money by not being able to get to work that day. Obviously, it will impact on businesses as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_403"> There are many strikes in public transport in Ireland. There is a disproportionate number of strikes in public transport in Ireland relative to other sectors but they are always resolved whether they involve the Luas, Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann or previous strikes in Irish Rail. They are always resolved and after talks at the Workplace Relations Commission or on the recommendation of the Labour Court. Unlike other sectors, there seems to be a requirement that there be a few days of strike before an agreement is made, which is disappointing and unnecessary because I do not believe that the final agreement made by the unions and the employers would be any different if there had not been a couple of days of strikes on the bus or the railway before the agreement was made because strikes are ultimately futile. All they do is damage the companies concerned, cost the striking workers money, inconvenience passengers and cost other people too. I would much prefer to see industrial disputes being resolved in the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court without a strike just as they are in so many other semi-State bodies and so many other parts of the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_404"> There is no date for the publication of the new national development plan, although we are targeting the month of December. It is intended that the national planning framework and the ten-year capital plan should be done at the same time and agreed and published at the same time because they need to speak to each other.</p>
            <p eId="para_405"> I support public private partnerships, PPPs, in principle. I think they have worked well. Much of our motorway network was built through PPPs, as was the case with many of our new schools, which are very fine buildings. However, I do not think PPPs are universally good. I do not like the idea of people referring to PPPs for public infrastructure as though they are off-balance sheet. They are not. It is just that the cost is spread over 40 years rather than over three, four or five but they are very much on-balance sheet. It is not free money. It is money that has to come out of taxpayers' pockets and PPPs can be very expensive. Sometimes it is cheaper to borrow the money up front given that interest rates are so low rather than go for a PPP model but there can be advantages as well, not least the fact that the risk is partially shared by the private sector and that, therefore, spares the taxpayer some of the risk. Second, it is a bit like a mortgage. While it might be cheaper to buy a house up front, sometimes one just cannot do so because one does not have the cash so it makes sense in those circumstances to pay it off over 40 years in the form of a PPP.</p>
            <p eId="para_406"> I am not up to date with developments at Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. The plan was to transfer it to the local authority thus allowing it to be developed as an amenity for the area, which is the right future for that harbour. Some of the small harbours have already been transferred to local authorities, for example, Sligo and Wicklow. I am not sure what the reasons for the delay are in that particular case.</p>
            <p eId="para_407"> In respect of capital spending, I may have picked Deputy Micheál Martin up wrong but on budget day, the Minister for Finance did announce additional capital allocations to Departments for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. While it is always the case that some capital projects fall behind schedule, it is important to acknowledge that over the past five years there has been considerable progress in terms of our public infrastructure, much more so than people might have expected during a period when we had very little money to invest in infrastructure. Over 200 new schools have been built, which include many fine buildings in my constituency. A total of 67 primary care centres have been built, including three in my constituency. Having not built any new public hospitals in the best part of 15 years, as I speak, there are now three-----</p>

            <p eId="para_417">I will give the Deputy that one. It is a fine hospital. The point I am making, which is also the truth, is that we now have major new hospitals under construction, which is the big deal, quite frankly. I hope a fourth one will be under construction by this time next year, which would be the new national maternity hospital on the Elm Park St. Vincent's campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_418"> As the Deputy knows, Páirc Uí Chaoimh has been built and was officially opened at the weekend. Newland's Cross has gone - the last set of traffic lights between Dublin and Cork. The N11 has been upgraded and New Ross and Enniscorthy roads are under construction. The Gort to Tuam motorway, which is the single biggest infrastructure project in the west of Ireland, is now complete, as is Luas CrossCity, which will be opened to passengers in the next couple of weeks. That is the report on progress made so far but I will be happy to add to it and give some more detail at a later stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_419"> Unfortunately, the EPA report comes as no surprise to anyone in this House. There are 40 locations around the country where raw sewage and wastewater is still being released into our rivers, seas and lakes. This should not be happening in a wealthy modern Western country. Many of the problems highlighted in the EPA report stem from a long-term legacy of bad policy such as the fact that we failed to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, in part because it was funded by general taxation. One of the downsides of the abolition of water charges is that, once again, water and wastewater projects have to compete with health care, education and other projects for funding when they could have had a dedicated source of funding. Another factor was the very fragmented set up run by local authorities rather than a single utility model like the ESB or Bord Gáis Networks, which would have worked a lot better. It is now being put right. With Irish Water, we have a single utility model, which is very much the ESB model. It is a publicly owned utility with a national remit and expertise. So far, Irish Water's priority has been clean drinking water and a huge amount of progress has been made since 2014 when Irish Water was set up. The number of boil notices is down by 75%, 20,000 boil notices have been eliminated and 90 million litres of water is now being saved every day because of the first fix free programme so people can see the success Irish Water has had in improving our drinking water. Obviously, the next step will be moving to wastewater. At least five projects will be completed this year - Youghal, Belmullet, Rush, Killybegs and Bundoran. What is remarkable is the fact that there are still people in this House who oppose the Water Services Bill and still want to break up Irish Water.</p>
            <p eId="para_420">If there is one sure way of making sure we reverse the progress we have made in providing people with safe, clean drinking water, and making sure we get nothing done in the next number of years when it comes to wastewater and the discharge of raw sewage into our rivers and lakes it is to rip up Irish Water all over again. I would certainly encourage people who are opposing the Water Services Bill in the House and who still want Irish Water to be abolished to have some regard for our environment and public health and to drop their embargo on the Bill. </p>

            <p eId="para_435">I talked with the Scottish Government's Brexit Minister about four weeks ago. It was very clear he has done a lot of work on many scenarios and has issues with London. We should all acknowledge how the Scottish Government has approached this issue and how supportive it is of Ireland's agenda. During the consideration of the so-called Great Repeal Bill in the House of Commons, the SNP has been very active in building coalitions to try to protect and promote Scotland's interests. The most important of these amendments is one which seeks to ensure that powers removed from Brussels will be devolved to the devolved Administrations. This is absolutely vital to achieving a special deal for Northern Ireland. It is impossible to be sincere in saying Brexit is a huge threat to Ireland while also ensuring Northern Ireland is not at the Brexit negotiating table. In the absence of a Northern Executive, has the Taoiseach stated to Prime Minister May that we support the devolution of powers to the Assembly and the Executive?</p>

            <p eId="para_436">Recent analysis suggests Scotland would lose €30 billion as a result of a hard Brexit. It would be reasonable, given the size of the two economies, to suggest the Republic of Ireland could suffer a loss of approximately half of that in the event of a hard Brexit. Northern Ireland's losses could be proportionately as high and well in excess of €5 billion, perhaps up to €10 billion. In that context, did the Taoiseach discuss the likely implications of a hard Brexit for Scotland in the context of the figures suggested for Scotland and also the likely fall-out for the island of Ireland? Did the Taoiseach identify in his meeting with Nicola Sturgeon the key issues which both Scotland and Ireland, North and South, might agree on. Does he agree with the comments of his party colleague and now Commissioner, Phil Hogan, that we are on a cliff edge to a hard Brexit. The Taoiseach has indicated he does not share that view but come December, he has a very difficult decision to make on whether he, as part of the 27, will allow the next phase of talks to go ahead, notwithstanding the fact that at this point in time we have no clear ideas on the outcomes for Scotland or for Ireland, North and South.</p>

            <p eId="para_437">We all know the disastrous decision by the English Tories to call a referendum. The outworking of that referendum has placed a huge burden on people in Scotland, this State and the North and created very real economic, political and social challenges. Scotland, like the North, runs the risk of being pulled out of the European Union against its will. In the case of this island, it is against the will of the people in the North who voted to remain, against the will of the Oireachtas, which also voted accordingly, and the European Parliament. We have proposed that the North should be designated a special status within the European Union. The Taoiseach has yet to embrace that concept. The Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is proposing at the very least that the British State should remain a member of the Single Market and the customs union. That is good. Her support for Ireland on these issues is also very welcome. The Taoiseach will know the British Prime Minister has made it clear that devolved Administrations will have no part in the negotiations. The First Minister of Scotland is a friend on these issues. Did the Taoiseach also discuss the particular importance of the Good Friday Agreement with her and the threat posed by Brexit to this agreement? Did he seek her support on that? I noticed earlier that the Taoiseach refrained from saying he supported it as an annex to any deal put together to facilitate the British leaving the European Union. The best legal advice and the strongest position is to have it there as an annex. I commend that position to the Taoiseach. Did he discuss any of this with the First Minister of Scotland, particularly in the context of the future of the Good Friday Agreement?</p>

            <p eId="para_439">I will be as brief as I can. It was a real pleasure to meet and talk with First Minister Sturgeon. We had spoken on the phone previously but it is the first time we met. She is a very impressive person. She is somebody who is very direct and business-like. I was very impressed by her. We are aligned on many issues and I look forward to working closely with the Scottish Government in the months and years ahead if we are given the opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> Deputy Ryan asked a very valid question about the role and value of the British-Irish Council. I will attend my first meeting of it in a few weeks' time so I want to reserve judgment until I have come back from it to see what its value is. At the very least, it is an opportunity for the Taoiseach of the day, the First Ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - if the Executive was up and running - and the Administrations in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands to meet each other. We all have busy diaries and schedules. The fact we are required to meet each other at least once a year is probably no harm. Even that has some value, although the British Prime Minister does not attend or has only attended on one occasion. I will see how it goes and perhaps when we come back after that I will be able to give the Deputy a better view on its value as a body. We may find that post-Brexit it becomes more valuable or we may need to give it a new role, particularly as Brexit will affect Ireland and the UK differently and will also impact on the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man which are not in the EU but are bound by EU law in some way. </p>
            <p eId="para_441"> How powers are allocated between Westminster and the devolved Administrations is a matter for the Westminster parliament.</p>
            <p eId="para_442">It would not be advantageous to our national interests to try to tell the United Kingdom how it should allocate power between Westminster and the devolved parliaments. We have a particular role, obviously, regarding Northern Ireland, but that does not apply to Scotland and Wales.</p>
            <p eId="para_443"> It is not true to say that the devolved Administrations have no influence on Brexit; they do. They have influence through the Joint Ministerial Committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">Tá áthas orm seasamh os comhair an Tí le labhairt faoi chruinniú an Chomhairle Eorpaigh na míosa seo, a bhí ar siúl sa Bhruiséal Déardaoin agus Dé hAoine seo caite. Ar an Déardaoin, rinne an Chomhairle Eorpach plé ar inimirce, an Eoraip dhigiteach, cúrsaí slándála agus cosanta agus an caidreamh seachtrach. Ag bricfeasta ar an Aoine, phléamar todhchaí an Aontais Eorpaigh. Bhuaileamar i bhformáid Alt 50 gan an Bhreatain ina dhiaidh sin le dul chun cinn sna cainteanna maidir leis an mBreatimeacht a phlé.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> In advance of the meeting, along with the Dutch Prime Minister, I was invited to join the leaders of the Nordic and Baltic countries, who meet regularly ahead of European Council meetings. Ireland is not part of a formal group in the EU, but as a small northern European nation and a trading country with an open economy, we have similar positions to the Baltic, Nordic and Dutch Governments, particularly economic issues. I was very pleased to have been invited to attend their meeting and to have the opportunity to share our views, especially on the future of Europe debate and on Brexit. I was delighted to have received such strong support for our position from all the Prime Ministers gathered there.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> The formal meeting began on Thursday with an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Tajani, MEP. There was also a short discussion about natural disasters. I took the opportunity to inform leaders about Storm Ophelia. I suggested that flexibility in the EU Solidarity Fund might be a way to bring Europe closer to its citizens. I also thanked President Macron of France and the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, for the help we received from Scottish, English and French electricity teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> Migration was the issue for the first working session. On this, there has been a fall in the number of migrants coming from Africa and the Middle East to Europe. Crucially, there has been a significant and welcome decrease in the number of lives lost at sea. I drew attention to the distressing human rights reports from Médecins Sans Frontières on the reception facilities in Libya. I also raised the question of support for Africa more generally, and what needs to be done to remove the root causes of migration. I confirmed that Ireland would double its commitment to the EU Trust Fund for Africa over the next few years, taking it from €3 million to €6 million. France and Poland also pledged to increase their support for the trust fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> As I signalled here last week, the issue of Digital Europe was one of the most important agenda items from our perspective. The language we agreed for the European Council conclusions had been substantially proposed by Ireland and a group of like-minded countries. These include a high level of ambition for completing the digital single market, including the free flow of data and agreeing a future-oriented regulatory framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> There is a challenging timeline for agreeing proposals in this area, but we have to be ambitious if we are to deliver practical benefits for our citizens and businesses, and ensure Europe remains globally competitive. There was a good exchange on the issue of taxation of digital companies. I emphasised that in a globalised world, a solution on tax must be global in nature. </p>

          <p eId="para_463">I rewrote it somewhat this morning and so there may have been a delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> This is reflected in the conclusions we adopted. Without a level playing field internationally if Europe were to act unilaterally, we might end up handing an advantage over other non-EU economies. As Ireland has maintained on numerous previous occasions, the OECD is the best forum for dealing with this. That is why I asked for a reference to the OECD work in the conclusions ahead of any mention of the European Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> The Commission has also been invited to present proposals early next year but these will be for discussion and, as a taxation issue, will be subject to unanimity. A number of countries were very firmly of the view that taxation is and should remain a national competency.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> As I flagged in June and again last week, given the challenges we face there is an increasing focus within the EU on security and defence issues. Most of our partners want to press ahead with permanent structured co-operation, which is known as PESCO, and is provided for in the treaties. It aims to provide a mechanism whereby military crisis-management capabilities can be developed by member states in support of Common Security and Defence Policy operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Discussions on PESCO are ongoing, with some aspects of governance, capabilities and projects still to be settled. The ambition is to be ready to launch PESCO in December. Ireland has been taking a realistic and constructive approach to the discussions and we hope that we will be able to participate in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> We have a long-standing policy of military neutrality and of not joining military alliances. We also have constitutional guarantees which are reflected in the protocols to the Lisbon treaty. We will not, of course, do anything that compromises these positions. However, we are not a neutral country when it comes to issues such as human trafficking, terrorism or cybercrime. We are very much in favour of co-operating with EU partners on a range of security issues. We will approach PESCO and the other issues on the agenda in that spirit. The European Council agreed to have a fuller discussion and a progress assessment of PESCO and other security and defence issues in December.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> We had lengthy discussions on a number of external relations items mainly relating to Turkey, but also relating to Iran and North Korea on Thursday evening. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will speak about these in her remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> The evening session also included a presentation by the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, in which she made a number of positive points regarding the Brexit negotiations, including citizens' rights; the absolute necessity to protect the Good Friday Agreement; her wish to avoid any physical border on the island of Ireland; her recognition of the unique nature of Ireland as an island; her commitment that no member state will lose out or have to pay more into the current budget as a result of the UK leaving; and her intention that the United Kingdom should remain a strong security partner for Europe. Further detail is required on all these points but the presentation was welcome nonetheless and positively received.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> While trade matters were not on the agenda and were not discussed in detail, there was brief mention of the EU negotiations with Mercosur, as well as requests for Council mandates to open negotiations with Australia and New Zealand. These are likely to feature in future Council discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> President Tusk chaired a useful exchange on Friday morning on the future of Europe, based on his leader’s agenda. I thanked him personally for taking the time to speak with each of the 28 leaders individually in advance of the European Council. The general consensus at the breakfast meeting was that President Tusk’s proposed process is the right one. The debate should not be led by any one country, Prime Minister or president or group of countries, but should be done by the community method as 27. His plan envisages additional meetings at the level of Heads of State or Government. While this requires is a significant time commitment, it should provide the impetus necessary for decision making.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> As an issue, the future of Europe is at least as important for Ireland as Brexit is, because we are staying at the heart of the EU and we want to ensure it continues to work for our citizens. I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to take the lead role on this and to begin an engagement programme which will interact with citizens and civil society so that we can set out and discuss what we want the future of Europe to look like.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> After the discussions on the future of Europe, the European Council met in its Article 50 format to discuss progress in the Brexit negotiations. Michel Barnier reported on the recent rounds of negotiations on the withdrawal issues. As expected, he advised that there has not yet been sufficient progress to move on to phase 2 of the negotiations on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">In light of the good progress that has been achieved, however, we agreed that Mr. Barnier and the Council should start internal preparations among the EU 27 for the next phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> It is worth recalling that, for there to be sufficient progress, we do not need to see the three issues fully resolved, rather we need to have achieved a degree of progress that gives us confidence that the 27 can move to the second phase. As Deputies are aware, Ireland has worked very closely with Michel Barnier and his task force and we will continue to do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_477"> Our overall priorities are clear: to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects; to avoid any new barriers to trade or movement of people on our island; to maintain the common trade area and all the rights and obligations that follow from it; to have an effective transitional arrangement leading to the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK; and working for the future of a more integrated Europe with Ireland at its heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> Prime Minister May’s comments to the European Council, particularly in respect of rejecting any physical infrastructure along the Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland were very welcome. However, more clarity is needed on how this can be achieved. I will certainly urge the UK Government to provide more detail on how its stated commitments in relation to the withdrawal issues will be given meaningful effect, in order that sufficient progress can be made as soon as possible, and ultimately an agreement reached. </p>
          <p eId="para_479"> I look forward to hearing the statements from other party leaders.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">The Taoiseach mentioned that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will respond to the statements but I understand the Order of Business provides for eight ten-minute slots. I apologise, there will be questions as well. I call Deputy Micheál Martin.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_481">Last week's summit reached no major or unexpected conclusions. While it was an important summit, unfortunately, it was not decisive in changing the direction of the European Union on any of the topics it discussed. If the House looks back to the early months of the Taoiseach’s predecessor and his first summit meetings, it will find a striking similarity in the claims made about what had allegedly happened. Deputy Enda Kenny, the then Taoiseach, had, according to his staff, broken with his predecessor in a whirlwind of breezy informality, addressing colleagues without notes and facing down a dastardly attempt by President Sarkozy to undermine our corporation tax regime. Of course, the full details which emerged later came nowhere near supporting the spin. Six years later, the Taoiseach, according to his staff, broke decisively from his predecessor by being a steady force, addressing his colleagues without notes and facing down a dastardly attempt by President Macron to undermine our digital tax policy. We should also remember that there were a number of bilateral meetings at the Élysée after which the then Taoiseach, to use yesterday’s quote, hailed improved relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> An already defining problem with this Government is that it spends so much time hyping things which were happening anyway. Indeed, it has established a new unit and a large budget dedicated solely to presenting ongoing activity as news. When it comes to something as serious as European policy, this gets in the way of an honest debate about fundamental issues. Off-the-record briefings focused on giving the illusion of candour to a favoured few journalists actually reveals nothing and is more about short-term management of headlines than promoting the type of discussions we urgently need.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> What was important about last week’s summit is that it addressed two fundamental challenges for both Ireland and Europe, namely, managing a deeply damaging Brexit and reforming the future Union of 27. It remains the case that the Government has no stated policy on most of the issues which have now been placed on the agenda for discussion. It is purely reactive, responding to the initiatives of others and more concerned about what image it presents than having any real influence. Let no one be in any doubt, a policy will not magically appear because the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has been sent around the country to hold meetings promoted with the Government’s new corporate branding. In fact, it will have as little impact as when exactly the same tour was conducted by the then Minister of State, the former Deputy Lucinda Creighton, five years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> On Brexit, the Taoiseach’s policy has veered wildly in recent months and has increasingly been seen to be driven by his hyper-partisanship. He has already established himself as more tribal in his core political instincts than any predecessor in recent times. This was one of his core pitches to his parliamentary party colleagues during the recent leadership election. He is breaking new ground with the regularity on which he tries to make puerile debating society points against others who have consistently sought and promoted a pro-European consensus among democratic and non-extreme parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> When we last discussed Brexit here the Taoiseach insisted that he would not seek a special deal concerning Northern Ireland because he was not prepared to contemplate failing in achieving effectively a free trade area that also covered east-west trade. He also justified the decision not to consider alternative scenarios. Yet three days later he went to Derry and explicitly said he was preparing for other circumstances, that he would seek special solutions for Northern Ireland and was very much planning for what to do if the UK-EU free trade area was not attainable. These lines were delivered with a breezy indifference to the content or tone of what he had been saying in the Dáil. The core of this point is that he either wants a constructive Brexit process and will change his approach or he can continue with a strategy which is failing to put in place the foundations for a broad agreement and consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> The Taoiseach has said repeatedly that briefings are available to pro-EU parties on the negotiations. So far we have yet to be told a single substantive piece of information which was not already in the international media or announced by a member of Government. Unless we begin seeing some element of candour, the only conclusion we can reach is that Ireland’s preparations are as incomplete as many fear and its negotiating stance is as incoherent as the Taoiseach’s various pronouncements since August.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The conclusions of the summit on the Article 50 negotiations are reasonable. Given that the May Government is unclear in what it is seeking or offering, there is no real basis for moving to the next stage. The next six weeks will be a moment of truth on whether it is willing to become more specific and to do the hard work of acknowledging that the European Union has a right to determine its own interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> We strongly welcome the communiqué’s statement that the EU 27 are committed to "to flexible and imaginative solutions [reflecting] the unique situation of Ireland". This is language which is very different from what the Taoiseach said here two weeks ago. The obvious and immediate problem is that there is zero evidence that our Government has developed any proposals for "flexible and imaginative solutions" - in fact, until 12 days ago it was the Taoiseach’s stated intent not to look for any such solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> As Fianna Fáil has pointed out repeatedly, there is only one credible way of fully addressing the need to ensure that this island as a whole retains access to the customs union and Single Market, while also leaving the constitutional status of Northern Ireland unaffected. This is the development of a special economic zone. It is long past time that we tabled this as a proposal and started working on specifics. </p>
          <p eId="para_490"> It is noteworthy that the person chosen by the Taoiseach to head the new strategic communications unit announced to the Public Relations Institute of Ireland - a body until recently headed by another of the Taoiseach’s advisers - that next year he will be launching a campaign on Brexit. Consequently, before our policy is fixed and before any direct aid is planned for most businesses being hit by Brexit, the marketing campaign for Government is already funded and planned. This says a lot about priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> The Taoiseach is reported to have made comments concerning people in Northern Ireland choosing Irish passports. The reports suggested that he had used a form of words which implied that this is an issue principally for the Brexit implementation period. This may have been misreported, but the Taoiseach should use an early opportunity to clarify that he is not trying to introduce a new understanding of the Good Friday Agreement in this area similar to his incoherent comments on the majorities required for implementing constitutional change under the agreement. To be clear, the core of the agreement is that Northern Ireland residents maintain a permanent right to Irish and therefore EU citizenship. The very point of the detail of the text is that people are not forced to choose a fixed identity and that their rights do not change based on their identity. As I said soon after the referendum last year, it is Fianna Fáil’s absolute position that we will not support any deal which infringes on the core and permanent citizenship rights of persons ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> As a related point, the common travel area has been supported in principle by both sides in the negotiation and the bulk of its details will be separate from any Northern Ireland-specific provisions. We need to see evidence that proper preparations are under way to define and legally underpin the common travel area when Brexit is finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> The summit agreed a list of topics and dates for discussions on the issues of eurozone reform, migration, internal security, trade and the future financing of the European Union. This is President Tusk’s initiative to try to put some shape on a very disorganised series of initiatives concerning the future of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">We welcome this agenda but it is important to realise that there are certain problems with what has been proposed. At the most basic level, far too little work has been done on the specifics of proposals and on defining the realm of what is and is not achievable through legislation that falls short of a treaty. Conducting discussions in the absence of a model of what is proposed and a study of what its impact might be is foolish. In the past, the approach to major reforms was to empower a group to study specific problems and propose options. Each of the major reforms of the Union has proceeded in this manner. The objective was to try to stop a process that did not encompass both analysis and negotiation. Such an approach needs to be adopted now.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> The issue of the digital economy, which was discussed last week, is a very good case in point. It is entirely legitimate to be discussing how to ensure fair taxation of online commerce. What is not legitimate is to push for decisions in the absence of the most rudimentary work on the impact of measures on individual states, businesses and the Union as a whole. The final wording of the communiqué was well signalled in advance of the meeting. Given the lack of preparatory work on legal, political or economic matters, it is arguable that the discussion should have been postponed. The proposal that action be taken only in the context of cross-OECD work is exactly the proposal adopted on wider issues six years ago. Ireland should join others in insisting that before the Commission returns with any proposal early next year, it should circulate a full economic impact study. Let us have a fact-based debate and not one driven by one-sided advocacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> Fianna Fáil welcomes the Council’s decision to reaffirm its support for the internationally agreed Iran nuclear deal. Fundamentally, there was no innocent purpose behind Iran’s nuclear effort. However, the deal reached after years of negotiations is a fair one that promotes security and offers the hope of Iran being more open to constructive international relations. The decision of the US President to refuse to certify the deal is dangerous, particularly in light of the fact that we need some process for de-escalating the current proliferation. We should join our European colleagues in calling for the US Congress to maintain the deal and avoid an escalation at such a dangerous moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> We should also note events yesterday whereby Russia vetoed a renewal of the UN’s independent investigation into chemical attacks by the Syrian Government against the Syrian people. Not only did Russia veto the renewal, it also attacked the clear findings of the most recent report about how a Syrian air force plane dropped chemical weapons on one village, resulting in 80 people being killed and many more being maimed. It is a deeply disturbing moment in world affairs when the covering up of war crimes receives so little attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> In the context of migration, the summit marked no major move forward. We continue to support the principle of solidarity between members and we call for a significant expansion in support for humanitarian and development efforts. The reason so many have risked so much to reach Europe is a lack of hope. The only way this can be provided is to be far more ambitious and generous in terms of aid. Far too many things are compared to Marshall aid, which rescued democracy in Europe after the Second World War. However, we need something of this magnitude to help countries throughout the Mediterranean. Millions of people remain stuck in camps and are denied the basic opportunities to provide for themselves. Before the crisis surges yet again, we need to be looking at far more radical action.</p>

          <p eId="para_499">Beidh mise agus an Teachta David Cullinane ag caint ar an ábhar sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> During statements in advance of the European Council, I raised a number of very important matters with the Taoiseach, including Brexit, the plight of Ibrahim Halawa and the ongoing political crisis in Catalonia. Thankfully, there has been good news on one of those fronts. Ibrahim has returned safely to Dublin and I am sure we are all delighted with this development. It is important now that he has the proper supports available to him in order to begin the process of rebuilding his life. Tá go leor oibre déanta ag a lán daoine ar son Ibrahim. Tá sár-obair déanta go háirithe ag an Cheann Comhairle. Tá muid fíor-bhuíoch as sin. Tá mé fíor-chinnte go bhfuil Ibrahim agus a chlann an-sásta agus buíoch as sin fosta. On my own behalf and on behalf of Sinn Féin, I extend céad míle fáilte abhaile to Ibrahim and wish him well as he returns to his family and friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> I raised the matter of Catalonia with the Taoiseach previously and am going to raise it again today. On Friday, the Spanish Senate will sit to debate and approve the use of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution to suspend the administration in Catalonia, as proposed by the Spanish Government. This is a retrograde step, not least because it is a rejection of the call for dialogue and mediation from the Catalan leadership. So far, the Spanish Government has refused to engage in dialogue with the Catalans. It is saying that they have to acquiesce to preconditions, including an acceptance that talk of independence is illegal. This is the wrong approach and I make no apologies for saying so, as I did yesterday evening. We know this from our own processes on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> When I raised this matter with the Taoiseach last week and before that, he advocated dialogue. He said that dialogue was the way forward and he also volunteered to raise the imperative of dialogue directly with the Spanish Prime Minister, alongside his stated concerns about the behaviour of the Spanish police. In his statement today, unless I missed it, the Taoiseach made no mention of this. I would like to know whether, in keeping with these commitments, the Taoiseach raised these issues at the European Council or directly with the Spanish Prime Minister. The Spanish Government justifies its refusal to embrace dialogue on the premise that these issues are an internal matter for Spain. That is exactly the attitude adopted by the British state for decades in order to prevent scrutiny of British rule on our island.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> I also note the comments of the Fianna Fáil leader in respect of Brexit. It is indeed the biggest issue facing the island over the coming years, although it took the Fianna Fáil leader a wee bit of time to come around to that perspective. It has been acknowledged by the Oireachtas that a special designated status for the North within the European Union is the way forward. Fianna Fáil voted for that, but is it really the party's position? At Fianna Fáil's recent Ard-Fheis, members voted for an electronic border. That is really ingenious. We would have a toll system operating in the same way as that which operates on the M50. That is great news for the people in the Border counties. I also note the comments of a Fianna Fáil councillor, Emma Coffey, who comes from my constituency. She called for a hard border to be implemented. Her statement goes on a bit about the economy and then she argues that a hard border is needed "to protect the influx migration entering Europe" through "my country, Europe's back door." What is the Fianna Fáil position on this very important and critical issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_511">It must be noted that there are hundreds of Border roads, that there are tens of thousands of people who would be affected and that the Border has been in existence for nearly as long as Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. What have they done about it? We all know that a European frontier would disrupt the social, economic, political and cultural fabric of our island. The only workable solution is to follow the lead that has been given by people in the North, which was to say, "No, we want to stay within the European Union."</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> According to his video, the Taoiseach enjoyed his visit to Paris yesterday. Some time ago, I raised with him the recent call by the French President for increased and accelerated EU integration, tax harmonisation and further military co-operation across the Union. There was a very worrying statement yesterday from the European Commission to the effect that it wants to turn its proposals on some of these issues into law and into practice, including a plan to create a permanent European Minister with responsibility for the economy and finance. These reflect the federalist dream but that is not what people on this island want. We look to the Taoiseach to reject these proposals and to push for proper democratic reform in pursuit of a European Union that delivers for citizens, that is social and that respects the primacy of its member states.</p>

          <p eId="para_513">I will confine my remarks to Brexit and the lack of progress by the European and British negotiators recently in respect of the critical issue of Ireland. My understanding is that some progress has been made on the common travel area, which I welcome. It is the only area in respect of which there is an agreed principles paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">That is progress, but there will be issues arising in regard to the rights of EU nationals who are not Irish citizens. While this will be a concern for some people, it is a step forward that at least on this issue there appears to be agreement. However, there is no agreement on the issues of the Good Friday Agreement and the Border. The Taoiseach knows that the Good Friday Agreement is incompatible with Brexit. The Good Friday Agreement is an international document. It is a complex document in many respects because it is underpinned by Irish law, British law and European Union law. If the North is taken out of the customs union and the Single Market against its will, and if the Good Friday Agreement is taken out of the European Union, in terms of the protections of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights, it would be a clear breach of the Good Friday Agreement. All of these are very important issues. One of the proposals put forward by Sinn Féin is that the Good Friday Agreement would remain within the European Union and that it would be attached as a protocol or an annex to the eventual withdrawal agreement to ensure it continues to enjoy the full protections and legal underpinnings of the European Union. This is the only way in which we can protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. Is this also the stated position of the Irish Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> There also has been no movement on the Border issue. I am concerned about the speech of the Prime Minister, Theresa May, in Florence, which was welcomed by the Irish Government and spoke of no physical border infrastructure. As the European Union has stated that it wants to protect the integrity of the customs union, the danger, if there is no physical border infrastructure, notwithstanding Fianna Fáil's reference to an electronic border, which is completely bonkers, is that responsibility for checks in terms of regulation and standards will be on businesses, farmers and so on, thus creating more bureaucracy and increased costs. The only way that we can square the circle of no Border of any kind, be it checks or inspections at business level or any physical infrastructure, and protection of the integrity of the customs union is for the island of Ireland, including the North, to remain in the customs union. While Britain remaining in the customs union would be the best outcome, if that is not possible and we can find common cause with people in Britain, will the Taoiseach support the North remaining in the customs union and the Single Market because if it is taken out of the customs union and the Single Market, notwithstanding all of the geniuses that might come up with all sorts of different solutions, the reality is that this will impact on the movement of goods and services, which will be bad for the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Brexit is not good for Ireland. It is not what the people in the North voted for. It is not an Irish incarnation, it is a British one and we should not suffer the consequences. There can be no step backwards in terms of the Good Friday Agreement, no step backwards in terms of the Border and no step backwards in terms of citizens' rights. The best and only way to achieve this is to grant special status for the North within the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> What is the current position of the British Government? We still have not had any tangible solutions from it. Has the Irish Government been given any documents beyond what is already in the public domain, because we are very concerned that nothing has been put on the table by the British Government up to now in terms of actual solutions. </p>

          <p eId="para_519">The EU Council came to a number of important conclusions last week on migration, digital Europe, security and defence, external relations and Brexit. Since we last spoke on this issue, a number of significant developments have progressed. In his remarks prior to the Council meeting last week the Taoiseach spoke on digital Europe and the importance of delivering practical benefits to our citizens. For the vast majority of EU citizens the agenda of these meetings does not speak to the day-to-day issues that they face in their lives. That is why the agreement of a text on the European Pillar of Social Rights agreed at the meeting on Monday is a key event in the history and development of Europe. The European Pillar of Social Rights was first published by the Commission in March 2016. It seeks to enhance the rights of EU citizens across categories of equal opportunities, access to the labour market, fair working conditions, social protection and inclusion. In an uncertain age it is difficult to disagree with the assessment of President Juncker that agreement on the social pillar is necessary to avoid social fragmentation and social dumping in Europe. If we are to meet 21st century challenges, we must deal with strengthening the rights of our peoples. I understand the text will be signed by the Taoiseach at the Social Summit in Gothenburg in November.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> The Taoiseach will recall that I raised concerns with him and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, about Ireland's negotiating stance at the inter-institutional proclamation. The original Irish position had aligned us with countries such as Hungary which, in terms of its outspoken objections on the development of social rights, does not make a good bed fellow. I am glad that we dropped those objections. The principles and rights set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights should be implemented at Union and member state level, within their respective competencies and in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. It also states that this does not entail an extension of the Union's powers and that it is up to individual member states to ensure those new rights are practically implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> The three broad categories and the 20 specific policy areas highlight the work that Ireland and Europe has yet to do. For example, secure and adaptable employment is a critical challenge for our people. Many find that although they work they cannot plan adequately for the future owing to technological disruption and the gig economy damaging and delaying family information, house purchases, pension plans and the planning of their lives. On equal opportunities and access to the labour market, education, training and life-long learning are areas in respect of which Ireland must examine how it proposes to ensure that all its citizens can fully participate in our economy as it evolves and changes. Despite being on track to full employment, an objective of the Labour Party and Fine Gael in government, there is need to ensure that not only jobseekers but all of our citizens are encouraged to upskill and to seek work. On social protection and inclusion, child care and support to children is an area where Ireland needs to do more. We know this. While there were token measures in this regard in the budget, there was nothing significant to reduce the high costs faced by parents in the area of child care. I attended a meeting in my constituency on this issue earlier this week. As I said, the budget provided only token measures in this regard. We need to have a comprehensive plan for this area. If we are to put Europe at the heart of people's lives and experiences, the pillars of human rights and social rights are a lot more tangible to people than the issue of digital Europe or other concepts that do not impact on their prospects for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> I welcome the report that the Taoiseach expressed serious concern about the conditions faced by refugees in prison camps in Libya and the doubling of Ireland's commitment to the EU Trust Fund for Africa to €6 million. I hope these sentiments will be backed by enhanced efforts to ensure Ireland meets its commitments on accepting refugees. In its conclusions on digital Europe the Council declared that, "it is ready to do what it takes for Europe to go digital." Has there ever been a more meaningless statement? The Taoiseach met yesterday with President Macron. <i>Détente</i> seems to have been declared on the French proposal for an EU-wide tax on digital companies by the insertion of references to a global playing field. As already referenced, the Commission has been tasked now with bringing forward proposals by 2018. It will be interesting to see how this will fair, along with the proposed structure that might evolve for a digital tax. Obviously, it is one in which we have a very clear strategic interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Once again, the move towards Permanent Structured Co-operation, PESCO, on a security and defence system for Europe was on the Council's agenda. During the Taoiseach's meeting yesterday with President Macron was this issue and the President's proposals for an EU army and a shared defence budget discussed? As I said last week, once a military intervention force is created we are on a path to a different EU to the one Ireland envisages and signed up to.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Taoiseach reportedly said that Ireland is keen to take part in PESCO but will not make a formal expression of interest until the latter's full remit is clarified. It appears that the Government has concerns about neutrality and is unsure whether the State can join. The Taoiseach referenced that earlier but I am still not clear on his position. Will he clarify matters? Perhaps there might be a full debate in the House on future EU defence policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> A debate was held on relations with Turkey. The communiqué that was issued contains only a short sentence on the matter but the debate lasted three hours and took up most of the working dinner. Plans are being drawn up to cut aid to Turkey and it appears that the long-stated objective of eventual Turkish membership of the EU may be close to being abandoned. What are the views of the Taoiseach on that issue and where does Ireland currently stand in respect of it? He reportedly said that Turkey is no longer on a European path.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> I welcome the reaffirmation of European Union support for the Iran nuclear deal that other Members have mentioned and the strong statement made by the Council regarding North Korea.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> After another summit, we are no closer to an agreement. If anything, we are edging inexorably closer to a hard Brexit. Initial reports were positive but the leaking and spinning in respect of Prime Minister May's dinner with the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, confirms the lack of trust, with recriminations emerging from both camps. The Taoiseach said - he repeated it today - that three key issues relating to phase 1 do not have to be resolved but that sufficient progress has to be made for the talks to move to the next phase. A report published on <i>www.bloomberg.com</i> last week suggested that Ireland was considering seeking guarantees that no border would be reimposed on the island as a price for allowing Brexit talks to advance. What is the Irish position and was that request made?</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> The Council's Article 50 conclusions focus on convergence on principles and objectives regarding protection of the Good Friday Agreement. Unfortunately, principles and objectives are not sufficient at this point and concrete proposals are needed. The suggestions emanating from the European Council that, by December, discussions with the United Kingdom may be able to move towards the next phase are a cause of concern because, as I said at a meeting earlier, our leverage will be diminished once we move from the first phase. I do not believe Ireland can entirely rely on either the UK or the EU 27 to ensure that our interests are fully protected. The train is coming at us rather quickly. The British Government remains woefully incoherent. Focusing more on the individual components could soften the political sensitivity regarding, for example, the exit bill, but I have yet to hear proposals from either the EU or the UK on how structural and PEACE funding for Northern Ireland might be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> It would be great if sufficient progress on the three key issues could be made by December but I fear that will not be the case. If sufficient progress has not been made on the issue relating to Ireland by the time of the December Council meeting, then we must be prepared to say that we cannot allow matters to progress to phase 2.</p>

          <p eId="para_530">I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> The Taoiseach is once again walking out of the Chamber as a Deputy of the left begins speaking. That has become a consistent pattern. Apart from the high-flown rhetoric, the videos and the photo ops, the Taoiseach is not on the moral high ground in the context of looking for European allies and talking about the need to shape a new future for Europe because the priority of the Government seems to be to defend, at all costs - even against the opprobrium of the European Union - the tax evasion strategies of big multinational corporations. It is doing so to the extent that Ireland is now being threatened with legal action by the European Union over its failure to put the €13 billion owed to us by Apple into an escrow account pending the outcome of an appeal. That appeal might not even take place in view of the fact that the Government is backing up Apple and spending millions of taxpayers' money trying to ensure that the latter gets away with what was clearly tax avoidance. I have no doubt that the State was complicit in that tax avoidance, although that could be debated. However, there is no doubt that Apple and other big multinationals were and are engaged in aggressive tax avoidance and the Government is backing them against the European Union in order to ensure that they continue to get away with it and get their money back. That does not put the State on the moral high ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> One could contrast that with the vision of a social Europe often mobilised by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in an effort to get people to vote for various European treaties. The European Social Charter is a big element of that vision. On foot of the charter, people should not worry about the European Union just being a corporate military entity. However, this week, as well as being threatened with fines relating to Apple, there was a finding against the State by the European Committee of Social Rights, which stated that we are in breach of Article 16 of the charter because we have failed to provide adequate housing for local authority tenants. Twenty local authority estates took a collective action to the European Committee of Social Rights because of chronic damp, poor plumbing, raw sewage leaking into baths and sinks, a lack of central heating and other absolutely deplorable conditions in local authority housing. A huge number of people cannot get local authority housing but many who have are living in chronically substandard conditions. The Government has not set out a timeline for rectifying the appalling conditions that are doing very serious damage to the health of families and children and exacerbating medical conditions such as chronic pulmonary disorder, asthma and so on that have reached chronic levels among young people, particularly those living in older local authority housing stock. We would have faced worse sanction from the committee but for the fact that a Fianna Fáil-led Government opted out of Article 31 of the charter, which deals with the right to housing. How much difference might signing up to that article have made in the context of the current crisis? What is the Government going to do? Did it or will it discuss with our European colleagues the failure of the State to provide proper living conditions in vast amounts of local authority housing stock and the fact that Ireland is in breach of the European Social Charter? The Government is prepared to go to war with Europe to ensure that multinationals do not pay tax. As a result of the fact that they do not pay any tax, we have substandard housing - or none at all - for poor, vulnerable, less well-off people for whom the State is supposed to provide. The latter must be seen in the context of the fact that the European Social Charter is supposed to guarantee the right to decent housing for local authority tenants.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">We are in new territory in terms of the relationship of capitalist classes here with our so-called European partners and the relationship of the establishment here with that elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">It is clear that a section of the European elites wants to drive ahead with a capitalist integration process in respect of militarisation, the development of permanent structural co-operation, an EU military fund, common culture in the military, and capacity for independent European military action. It is integration on an economic level, including on the question of taxation. I note in this regard Mr. Juncker's remarks yesterday about bringing qualified majority voting into questions of taxation, which would include, on the one hand, a financial transactions tax and, on the other, the issue of corporation tax, and increased political integration, with the idea of an economic and finance minister for the European Union once again being raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The Irish establishment likes to portray itself as very pro-Europe and does not have a problem with the vast majority of this but it does have a problem with one crucial issue, namely, corporation tax. The Irish political establishment - Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour - have sold our status as an effective tax haven as a key part of Ireland's so-called offering to the world. The reality is that, post-Brexit, this is coming increasingly into the focus of other European powers and will lead to a relationship of tension. The remarks at the start of the Taoiseach's speech about the meeting with leaders of Nordic and Baltic countries were interesting. I just question the Minister of State whether it is the Taoiseach's intention to continue to attend those meetings in the future. It is clear the Government is looking around for allies in a post-Tory Britain scenario. It is also clear the Government's response to the European Council is to continue what it has been doing, which is to hide behind the OECD process and say the Government is in favour of dealing with the problem of the massive rip-off and robbery of public services around the world by big corporations, in particular big digital and Internet corporations, but it is in favour of the OECD doing so, in the hope that it never happens and to avoid taking action in terms of the European Union now.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> I noted with interest the reports of the Taoiseach's meeting with Emmanuel Macron yesterday. It is interesting from the point of view of relations between countries, etc., but also interesting politically. An element of the political strategy of Fine Gael could be summed up as the Macron or the Trudeau strategy, which is to get a new young leader to try to look socially progressive, with no substance whatsoever behind that, to repackage the same right wing, neoliberal ideas as new, modern, fresh, outward-looking, globalised, etc., and to bang on about being the new European centre, despite representing the continuation of the same old European right. I wonder whether the Taoiseach got an update from Mr. Macron on how that is working out for him, because it is not working out very well. His opinion poll ratings are the lowest for any French president at this stage of the presidential term. He is facing mass opposition to his so-called labour reforms, which will massively flexibilise the labour market in France, mass protests and mass strikes. I do not think it will go very well for the Taoiseach or for Fine Gael either.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> The differences are real. For all the talk of how well the meetings went, etc., it is clear that there are real differences in respect of what are referred to as multinational Internet companies and tax policy. Mr. Macron represents, along with Mr. Juncker, precisely that integrationist approach, which includes the question of taxation. We are not in favour of any policies being imposed on this country. We are in favour of a democratic discussion and debate and people in this country making a decision on what policies exist. That was our approach to all the austerity that was imposed. We do favour an increase in corporation tax. It is deeply ironic that the Irish Government and the establishment wrap themselves in the green flag when the interests of the big corporations are threatened.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> Finally, I note that President Macron is today rightly being described as the president of the rich in France because he has cut the wealth tax by 70% at the same time as cutting a €5 grant to students for their accommodation. Perhaps the media could take this from the Macron experience and apply it to our Taoiseach, who is also a Taoiseach of the rich.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">I had a read of President Tusk's statement of 24 October. He stressed the point that the leaders agreed on the previous Friday that the priority was unity among the 27 member states. His words were that his intention is to build on what connects, not on what divides. On the question of migration, the key message seems to be protection of external borders. I agree that there is a need for more support for those countries directly and immediately affected in this regard, such as Italy, Spain, Greece and Bulgaria, but what form is this support taking? That is the question we must ask. President Tusk referred, as the Taoiseach did today, to permanent structured co-operation in defence, PESCO. Alarm bells grow because that is not really the language we would expect when we talk about dealing with migrants, who are very vulnerable people coming from awful situations of poverty, hunger, conflict and displacement and, of course, we have an increase in the number of climate refugees now. President Tusk and the Taoiseach say they are supporting the big organisations - the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration and the World Food Programme - and I know they do good work, but it is the smaller non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that are at the front line of working with these people in very vulnerable situations that are not getting the recognition and support they need. We have discussed the so-called reception centres in Libya before, which we know are detention centres, and it is those smaller NGOs there that are giving us real information on what is happening. The Taoiseach said, and we hear this all the time, that we must tackle the root causes of migration, but that is more than just putting up a physical barrier so that migrants cannot move, whether internally in Africa or wherever or externally. It is a matter of examining the causes, and there is a need to monitor that and see what progress is being made. That is what the sustainable development goals are about, that if we eradicate poverty and hunger and the abuse of human rights, people will not have a reason to move.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> President Tusk discussed Brexit and, again, there was a call for unity among the 27 member states and he said it was up to London how this will end. His words were "good deal, no deal or no Brexit". He said the common interest would be protected by the EU 27 being together but I fear, as do others, that the smaller countries, especially Ireland, will not be as well protected as the bigger countries. I know that our officials, our Departments and other organisations have been working extremely hard in the lead-up to Brexit to try to plan for something they did not know would happen at all and then, when it did happen, did not know what form it would take. Of course, we still have a lot of vagueness about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> I return to Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, which reminds us that the EU was founded on values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, respect for human rights, including the rights of minorities. However, we see more and more issues in this regard and we have examples where the EU has been lacking and its voice is not being heard, or it is a voice that is only being heard and not being followed up with action. These are the issues that must be taken up, whether at the leaders' section or by individual Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> I wish to focus on one particular issue. It is a forgotten area and one that I hope can be discussed. I refer to the Golan Heights, which I know Deputy Brendan Smith raised. He is Chairman of the foreign affairs committee. We met a delegation, a human rights group in the Golan Heights, that pointed out the lack of EU statements on the Golan and the unavailability of EU funding. The funding is available for NGOs working in the occupied Palestinian territories but is not going across to the Golan. There are five remaining Syrian villages there. There is a general lack of knowledge internationally about what is happening to the people who are still left in those five villages in the Golan. We know Irish troops are deployed there but that is probably about as much as we know about the area. There is an EU-Israel Association Agreement council meeting which is about developing a broad bilateral partnership, dialogue, co-operation, mutual accountability and a shared commitment - I have read this in the blurb - to human rights and democracy, which includes the rights of persons belonging to minorities. The EU and its member states could speak about commitment here. We talk about the viability of the two-state solution but this area is not coming into it at all. We know the concerns about the expansion of the settlements. We know they are undermining the possibility of a two-state solution and that there are concerns over settler extremism and settler incitement. I am very aware of this because I have been there recently. The EU's funding is going into the occupied territories and Gaza. The EU-Israel Association Agreement is all about the occupied territories. There are references to Syria, Lebanon, Iran and the Arab minorities but there is nothing about the Golan, which has been taken over.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">They are caught in this no man's land between Syria, Israel and Palestine. If we are committed to defending human rights, there is a need to consider the people who are living there. As I said, we met them recently and heard about the situation on the ground for people there. Some 95% of the Syrian population was transferred or displaced, so there is only 5% left. A city and over 300 villages and farms were destroyed. There are 23,000 Israeli settlers living on these lands, with the remaining Syrian population in only five villages. There are plans for the construction of further settlements which are illegal under international law. It is a fertile land with plenty of water, but the Syrian population in those villages pay up to four times more than the Israeli population. Oil exploration is going on and we can wonder to whose benefit that is going to be. There are also the remnants of the landmines from both the 1967 war and previous wars. I hope this is an area that could be addressed when there is an opportunity to do so at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> One other question is that of multilateral EU funding and the lack of transparency regarding some aspects of that funding. While we know the total amount, there is a need for more transparency. We know about the European Development Fund and know that the EU development co-operation budget saw an increase, as did the European trust fund, but there are questions about exactly where all of this is going.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> We had statements on Catalonia yesterday and certain aspects are very clear. One is in respect of the Catalonian culture, language and identity. The second is an acknowledgement of the very heavy-handed tactics of the central government in dealing with the peaceful protests and with the democratic right to vote. The third is the need for dialogue to resolve these issues. The question is whether the EU will provide that space and support for the dialogue and engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> Last Sunday in Geneva, at the World Parliamentary Forum, there was a call for parliamentarians to support the establishment of the UN binding treaty on transnational corporations and human rights. This is very opportune, given our own report on human rights and business is coming some time in November. The EU has stated its commitment to human rights. The UN Human Rights Council established a working group to develop this legally binding international instrument on transnational corporations and business enterprises in respect of human rights. The aim is to put an end to the global loopholes so all companies are accountable when it comes to human rights and worker rights. This will be major because we see so much unregulated globalisation, especially in the poorest parts of the world. Again, will the EU be a supporting voice in this regard, given labour rights are being violated? The EU could be an active voice in this UN process. That would be part of the tax justice agenda in order to stop the illicit flows and profit shifting which deprive the poorest countries in the developing world of the revenue which they need for food and health. It is almost as if the EU is at times soothing its conscience in its development aid budget and not looking at the other aspects of tax loopholes and workers' rights. I see the next meeting of the leaders is about culture and education, which would be an interesting issue to debate here in the next while.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_547">I am pleased to speak about this interesting meeting. I note from the report by President Donald Tusk to the European Parliament following the meeting that he is “obsessed by unity". This is interesting. He must be having a very anxious time of it when we recall the recent outcome of the Austrian election. Austria now has a very young president who swept to power on a mandate of less Europe, not more. We see the recent events in Catalonia and the votes in the Lombardy region and Venice in the north of Italy, and we see the growing sense that, despite their best efforts, the people of Europe are rejecting outright the extreme federalism that is at the heart of the EU project. This is obvious and anyone who wants to see it can see it. This is happening for certain reasons, in particular because the EU is not listening in the first place - cluasa dúnta, closed ears. They do not want to hear what is going on. We have not been very good at communicating our fears from this side of the House. That is the situation as I see it. We are in the middle of Brexit and that is why.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> What else can Mr. Tusk expect when people see an increasingly centralised power emerging and their own local and cultural identities being submerged? It is interesting that the next meeting will be about culture and identity. We need to respect that, especially in our case, but in all other cases too. We had a debate last night at which the Spanish ambassador was present. I welcomed him and felt he should be entitled to be here without being lectured and verbally attacked. We have diplomatic people all over the world and we expect them to be received, listened to and respected in parliaments. Does Mr. Tusk think we are all obsessed with his narrow vision of unity? He must think that. We want co-operation and friendship between the states but the idea of ever-closer union has become a noose around the neck of national territories. They are getting a dose of that and they have not learned. After the banking collapse, they came in here, lectured us and told us what we had to do - they put us into straitjackets and kept us in those straitjackets. Why? It is because the then Taoiseach, Mr. Kenny, and the then Minister, Mr. Noonan, were ready to get into the straitjackets as if they were life-jackets, when they were anything but. They were straitjackets and we are still in them. With their fiscal rules and fiscal policy, we could only have a skift of snow to give out to everyone, and it went with the first ray of sunshine. We need some autonomy here, as do other countries, and we must be respected for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> As I said, we want co-operation and friendship between the states but the very idea of ever-closer union has become a noose around our neck and the necks of other countries. Can they not wake up and smell the coffee? This is what is happening. I note also that President Tusk gave a very mean-spirited and self-pitying account of all the amazing efforts he had put in to keep the UK within the European Union. If he had listened to the reasons and had less regulation, less intrusion and fewer penalties and threats, it would have been different. A carrot and stick is one thing but threats and bullying is another thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> Unfortunately, President Tusk said, “this was not enough for the Brits.” That is his wooing and his courtship. He must not have had much experience of courtship, like some of my colleagues might have had in the hills and glens and valleys. It is this kind of posturing that makes people extremely frustrated with our dear leaders in Europe. I say that tongue in cheek. They are not my dear leaders anyway, given the penury they forced us into. It is as if the ability of a sovereign people to determine its own fate is something that must be gifted to them. We are entitled to it and it is no gift of Mr. Tusk or any of his predecessors. We are entitled to our sovereignty. We fought hard for it, in particular the people of 1916, 1921, 1922 and 1923, my late father included. If they choose to seek another model of engagement with Europe, they are considered reckless, frivolous and not interested in courtship, like being refused a dance for the third time. The Minister of State might understand what I am talking about, although I do not mean that in any disrespectful way. We would all want to dance with the Minister of State, although she might not want to dance with us. The tunes might not be right or our moves might not be the best.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> This is patronising stuff of the highest order. I fear that if Mr. Tusk continues down this line, he will make it more difficult to achieve the beloved unity that he never tires of telling us he is obsessed with.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_552">I am sharing time, by agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> I welcome the outcome of the European Council last week which discussed many of the key issues for the EU at the moment, such as migration, defence, external relations and, of most interest to us, Brexit. The special European Council on the Article 50 negotiations showed the continued focus of the EU 27 in achieving the three key outcomes on financing, on our own Border situation and on citizens’ rights. These are three core issues and it is a pity that more progress has not been made yet. Achieving agreement here is vital before we can progress to talking about the future of the EU-UK relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> At the same time, we need to be ready and prepared for that next stage, so I also welcome the beginning of the internal preparations for those talks in the second phase by the EU 27. If these first phase negotiations have shown us anything so far, it is that preparation is fundamental.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> Alongside the Brexit negotiations, we must continue the work of the European Union in other areas. It is encouraging that the approach to the migration crisis is finally yielding results and delivering a lasting solution. This must remain a priority. It is one of the trickiest public policy challenges and the risks are high for the lives of the many people who get into boats on the Mediterranean. At the same time, countries around the Mediterranean are working hard to deal with the numbers arriving.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> While I cautiously welcome the ongoing work on the permanent structured co-operation on defence, we must take care. Ireland has a particular position on defence and we must be clear on what our role should be in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> I wish to discuss the digital Single Market. In order to be central to Europe's future, Ireland must lead. We have particular strengths in this regard. This week, I had the pleasure of meeting the Swedish ambassador and we discussed the benefits of digitalisation and the opportunities it presents. This is key to keeping Europe ahead of the curve and capable of competing with the rest of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> In continuing the pursuit of this agenda, I particularly commend the Irish involvement in the "Digital 9" group of member states. It is clear that the completion of the digital Single Market and the development of what many may call the fifth freedom, that being, the free movement of data, are integral to the building of this future.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> Overall, this seemed to be a workmanlike European Council that progressed the issues but made no major breakthroughs. I would like to see much more progress by the European Council in December.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> I wish the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, continued good work. She is performing well. She is also workmanlike with our committee, which I appreciate.</p>

          <p eId="para_561">The IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, and all other farming bodies are concerned about our €2.5 billion beef deal with England. That is how much we depend on the British market. If we were to lose that, it would be disastrous for the whole of the country, especially the western counties, of which County Kerry is one. Cow numbers will collapse. The bodies are asking that, before Britain exits the EU, Ireland be allowed to continue supplying beef to Britain. If we are not and there is a hard Brexit and large tariffs, it will be disastrous for the entire farming community.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> We watched and listened to Prime Minister May saying that progress had been made. We wondered what that progress was. I certainly did anyway on behalf of everyone whom we represent, especially the farming community, which is under significant pressure. Prices are dropping as we speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> Not for many years have farmers faced a winter like this one. They have been feeding cows and other animals for the past two months. That will make for a long winter before the animals can be put out to grass again in the middle of April or early May. That is more than six months, so we must be aware that there will be a shortage of fodder. On top of this, people are concerned about whether we will retain our British market. The farming organisations are asking that the market be assured before the UK exits the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> I am sorry for going over time by a bit, but my colleagues took some of mine.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">While a specific reference to Ireland in the conclusions of the 20 October European Council meeting is welcome, it is with growing alarm that we note a complete absence of detail regarding what the new EU external frontier will look like post Brexit. I do not know how many more times we will have to stand in the Chamber and welcome vague assertions that a hard border will be avoided. Detail and a plan are needed. Unfortunately, these seem to have been absent thus far, especially from the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> In her post-European Council speech in Westminster, Prime Minister May stated that significant progress had been made on Northern Ireland. She again committed to having no physical infrastructure on the Border. There is nothing new in this assertion, yet we still have no detail of how it is to work. Visualising how it could work is extremely difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> It has been more than six months since Article 50 was triggered and the withdrawal process began, yet the EU is still requesting that the UK "present and commit to flexible and imaginative solutions called for by the unique situation of Ireland". That this assertion on such a basic and fundamental aspect of the Brexit process still needs to be made six months after the UK began the withdrawal process is alarming.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> The unpublished internal Revenue Commissioners report that came to the media earlier this month paints a stark picture. I recognise the fact that the report dates from September of last year, but we must heed the warnings contained therein, given that not much has changed since then. Despite what is being said publicly, there is a view in Revenue that the idea of a frictionless border for trade is unworkable and naive. These are Revenue's words, not mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> Along with additional infrastructure such as storage facilities for goods at Border crossings, greatly expanded ICT capabilities and increased staffing at ports and airports, it is estimated that an external frontier would mean an 800% increase in the volume of customs declarations by companies trading with the UK. This would mean a significantly increased volume and complexity of paperwork for firms, many delays, additional costs and an inevitable knock-on effect on the wider economy, North and South. In 2015, goods worth almost €18 billion were imported from the UK and goods worth €15.5 billion were exported by Ireland to the UK. Revenue has stated that the administrative and fiscal burden on the companies involved cannot be underestimated. Any restriction on this flow of trade would have severe negative consequences for the entire island of Ireland. The impact of this could be catastrophic on particular elements of Ireland's trade. We are not being realistic about the potential damage that can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> While we all hope for the best, we need to do much more. We must prepare for the worst. This means having clear contingency plans in place. While I agree with the Taoiseach that it is not up to Ireland to design solutions for the UK, we must be prudent, which means being prepared for all eventualities. We do not share the belief of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, that preparing for the prospect of a hard border is a self-fulfilling prophecy. His suggestion is short-sighted and dangerous. It is critical that we have good contingency plans in place in the event of the UK exiting without a deal. This does not mean putting in place the investments that are referenced in the Revenue report, but it does mean having in place contingency plans for such facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Michel Barnier was not overly optimistic about the potential to avoid a hard border when he spoke to us in the Chamber earlier this year. Whether one accepts that there is potential to address the movement of people, he was bordering on the pessimistic in respect of the movement of goods. Of course, we share the hope that these issues can be resolved as part of a trade deal that may come after the Brexit negotiations have concluded but the pace of negotiations thus far and the ongoing wrangling over the divorce bill do not inspire confidence that a full agreement will be in place before 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> I welcome the progress on work to secure the common travel area. The flow of our people across the two islands must be allowed to continue uninhibited. The Government and the EU seem to have secured that, which is welcome. The question then returns to the free movement of people between the UK and Ireland and between Ireland and the EU. This stumbling block is one to which we seem to return again and again. Will Ireland be forced to act as a clearing house for fellow EU nationals entering the country to ensure that they do not attempt to travel to Northern Ireland or onwards to the mainland UK? What are the full implications of that? Will Ireland be centrally involved in the design of any such arrangements or will they be handed down to us by the EU? Will there be compensation for the considerable expenditure involved for Ireland where we have to man a border to monitor the movement of people within the EU or on entry to Northern Ireland and the UK? There are many unanswered questions on Brexit and there is a great deal of concern at a level of complacency on the part of Government. That needs to stop and we need to start to get real about this. The potential is undoubtedly extremely serious for this country, which is why it is important to develop confidence among people and the business community that, in the event of things not working out to Ireland's satisfaction, there are clear contingency plans in place which can be mobilised. There is a strong sense that we are not very well prepared at this stage and that we are engaging in wishful thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> In its conclusions on the meeting of 19 October, the Council welcomed the significant progress being made by member states to establish closer security and defence co-operation through permanent structured co-operation, or PESCO. It noted that this programme could be launched by the end of 2017. The Taoiseach has stated that he is open to Ireland participating in this new security arrangement. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister of State to clarify which aspects of PESCO they are open to participating in. It is important that we hear it. Our current remit within the common security and defence policy, CSDP, is limited to humanitarian missions, crisis response and peacekeeping. As it stands, PESCO alludes to closer co-operation with NATO and makes overtures on a defence industry Single Market. I urge the Taoiseach to stress Irish non-alignment in the context of the development of PESCO, thereby ensuring that our participation is limited to our current involvement with the CSDP.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">The Taoiseach met President Macron of France yesterday and it is reported that he agreed with the latter's proposal for democratic conventions on the future of Europe. I am not quite sure what that means, but the Taoiseach informed the House this afternoon that as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee would be making an announcement on how we can engage with citizens, civic society and businesses in this country to plan for the future of Europe. What is the Minister of State's thinking in that regard? As she knows, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, of which I am a member, is engaging with stakeholders and will produce its own report. It is very important to engage with the citizens of this country and such engagement should be much more than a box-ticking exercise to say we have done it. We must engage them. I ask what the Minister of State's proposals are in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> The French President also outlined that he wants a change in the way multinational tech companies are taxed. He wants their tax liability to be based on the place sales happen and not where they are registered. He also wants corporate tax harmonisation and a common tax base. Are we taking these proposals seriously? They challenge Ireland's long-standing corporate tax model and our industrial policy generally. Was there much discussion about this at the Council meeting, which the Minister of State also attended, and are we building alliances on this key issue for Ireland? As we plan the future for Europe, we must be conscious of the moves in that direction as regards corporate tax policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_579">Last week, I asked the Minister of State and the Taoiseach about the human rights situation in Turkey. Both indicated that they would look at the matter, specifically the first hearing in the case of ten human rights defenders from Amnesty International, the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly and other entirely peaceful NGOs and civil society actors. These people have been arrested and charged on absurd grounds by the Turkish Government. The hearing is taking place today and there were hopes that there would be observers from the Irish consulate. The request was made by some of the human rights organisations and I passed it on in the House last week. Has the Government acceded to that request and what is it doing to ensure that human rights organisations are not the victims of the Erdogan Government's horrendous purge of all opposition, dissent and criticism from anybody it does not like?</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> Beyond that particular case, what are the Government and the European Council saying about what is going on in Turkey, which is beyond belief? There are 50,000 people in prison and 150,000 under investigation, including teachers, journalists, civil servants, trade unionists and MPs. People have been interned without trial. It is the kind of thing one would expect to see in a horror movie. The Turkish Government seems to be able to act with impunity and one has to ask whether the EU-Turkey deal, which allowed the European government to outsource the issue of Syrian migrants fleeing the disaster in their country, is causing us to be quiet about what Turkey is doing internally by trampling on human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> Have the Minister of State or the Taoiseach had discussions with our European counterparts on the damning ruling of the European Committee of Social Rights on the inadequate standard of local authority housing for thousands and thousands of local authority tenants who are living in chronic conditions in damp and substandard accommodation and what are we going to do about it?</p>

          <p eId="para_582">I also met some members of the group highlighting the trial of the ten accused in Turkey. Another person has been put on trial in the meantime. That is only the tip of the iceberg regarding the clampdown on civil society and the effect on the education system in Turkey, particularly when one considers that a huge number of teachers have lost their jobs and many are in jail. Has there been progress in addressing that issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> I thank the Minister of State for the breakdown she sent me in reply to a question I asked last week about funding going to Libya. As I said then, there are large sums going into the European Development Fund, the development co-operation budget, the trust funds, etc., but where exactly is it going thereafter? This issue has arisen in other places.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> The next meeting will be on culture and education. Has the Minister of State an indication of what will be the parameters of that meeting and what might be included?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Helen McEntee)<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_585">I will make my contribution and then deal with the questions. I accompanied the Taoiseach to Brussels last week for the October European Council meeting. As he indicated, I will focus my remarks on the external relations items that were discussed on Thursday evening last. These included a wide-ranging discussion on EU relations with Turkey. Turkey retains candidate status and, although we cannot ignore the ongoing restrictions on fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression, a policy of constructive dialogue - keeping all available lines of communication open – remains in the best interests of the EU and the people of Turkey. We will continue to urge Turkey to fulfil its obligations as a candidate country and hope that policies which undermine democracy, human rights, the rights of minorities, including the Kurdish minority, freedom of expression, including media freedom, and the rule of law will become things of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Turkish accession is not an immediate prospect in the current climate, but the EU will continue to extend the hand of friendship to all Turkish citizens. The long-term welfare of all these citizens lies at the heart of EU relations with Turkey and this critical engagement is particularly important now. We must be candid with our Turkish friends. We will continue to encourage them to return to European values and to ensure that basic human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected. It is important to note that, thanks in large part to the efforts of Turkey, there has been a significant reduction in the number of migrants losing their lives in the Aegean Sea. Turkey remains a front-line state in the migration crisis and is host to approximately 3 million Syrian refugees. The EU will continue to assist in this formidable task.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> The European Council also discussed Iran in light of President Trump's decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA. France, the United Kingdom, Germany and the European External Action Service, EEAS, all gave their strong support to the JCPOA, and confirmed that it continues to function. This is a key element of the nuclear non-proliferation global architecture and is crucial for the security of the region. The 28 member states have reaffirmed their commitment to all parts of the JCPOA and to its continued full implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> There was also a brief discussion on the situation in North Korea with partners expressing concern at the alarming rate at which North Korea has progressed its nuclear and missile programmes. Ireland, together with its partners, believes that the EU policy of critical engagement with the Government of North Korea remains the best approach. We will continue to combine pressure with sanctions and other measures, while keeping communication and dialogue channels open in the hope that the situation will cease to escalate. The EU is united on its position. North Korea must comply fully with international obligations, abandon its programme of nuclear weapons development and engage in meaningful dialogue with other stakeholders to bring about stability and peace to the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the Turkey issue with me last week and she should have received a reply because we looked into that. There is no official currently at the trials. My understanding is that an attempt had been made in a similar circumstance previously, although it was not an Irish national who was on trial, and that was not allowed. However, we have officials monitoring the trials closely. Any attack on a member of Amnesty International or somebody of that stature is something we need to keep a close an eye on and we will follow this. We said at the previous Council meeting that pre-accession funding to Turkey must be reassessed in respect of where it is going. We have suggested that it could be sent-----</p>

          <p eId="para_591">No. It is my understanding in a previous scenario similar to this there was not an ability for an Irish official to attend. A similar circumstance arises now. However, officials are monitoring the situation and will continue to look at it closely.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> The Deputy asked what we are saying about Turkey. We have been asking that pre-accession funding to Turkey be reassessed and that it be sent to civil society organisations but no decision has been taken on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> With regard to taxation and the digital economy, the Taoiseach made it clear that it is very much our view that work is under way by the OECD, which is taking a global approach to this issue. Our position is clear - obviously France has a different position - which is that this issue should be examined solely through the EU. While a Commission report is due to come out in the new year, we have been clear that wording particularly focused on the OECD report and the global approach should be clearly stated in the Council remarks following last week's meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> With regard to democratic conventions and the future of Europe, we agree there should be a unified position on this and that we should work together moving forward. However, at the same time, there have been a number of different proposals around how this should work. Last week, there was a conclusion based on a proposal by the Council President, Mr. Donald Tusk, that the Council would take back membership of the future of Europe debate and that it would happen on a phased basis over two years with a number of position papers and the process developing over time. We very much feel that citizens have different issues and they need to be dealt with differently. On 15 November, we will officially launch the future of Europe civic dialogue in Ireland. We plan on holding a number of regional debates with citizens. We plan on engaging with our educational bodies through our universities, colleges, primary and secondary schools. We will have focused stakeholder engagements and we will be supported through agencies such as European Movement Ireland and the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA. There will be further work and progress on that specifically with Oireachtas Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> A number of questions were asked about PESCO. The issue was raised with President Macron yesterday but not specifically in the context of his proposals. There are ongoing discussions about the specific wording and that will be finalised in the November meeting of the FAC before being brought forward to the European Council. We would like a scenario where all member states are involved but we are clear that there cannot be any impact on our neutrality and there cannot be anything that would contradict the treaties to which we have signed up. Anything that is proposed will have to come back to the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> I was asked whether the Catalonian issue was raised with the Spanish Prime Minister. My understanding is that the Taoiseach did not get to speak to him directly but he spoke to officials and representatives. We reiterated our support for the territorial integrity of Spain and our respect for the rule of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> With regard to the agreement and the social pillar, it will be signed at the social summit. Obviously, this is not a legally binding document and the reason for the delay is that we wanted to be sure of what it was we were signing up to but that will go ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> On the question of whether sufficient progress was made on the Irish issues in the Brexit talks and specifically on the Border question, a commitment has been given by the UK Government that there will not be any physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland. We also know, however, that they are claiming they will leave the customs union and the Single Market and, therefore, we need a roadmap as to how that will work because our preferred route is that the UK would stay within the Single Market and the customs union to ensure that we do not need physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Our focus will continue to be on tackling the root causes of migration and continuing our naval efforts to ensure those responsible for people smuggling are stopped. Our inclusion in Operation Sophia and our naval efforts overall have saved the lives of more than 40,000 people. When it comes to the trust fund on migration, the annual report on the fund's implementation last year showed progress in addressing root causes, which are destabilisation, forced displacement, and irregular migration by promoting equal opportunity, security and development. More recently, we have given a commitment to double our allocation to the emergency trust fund for Africa. Decisions on where this money will go have not been finalised and we are saying that we need to focus any response to the crisis where we use money of this kind on the long-term drivers and what will best address the root causes. Perhaps we could follow up on the Deputy's suggestion that this would be laid out in detail and made clear to and available for individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> With regard to the British beef market, we are talking about trade, which is extremely important. When we talk about our key objectives in terms of citizens' rights, the Good Friday Agreement, protecting the common travel area and lack of infrastructure, protecting our trade between Ireland and the UK is also a key priority. Any future arrangements and agreements will be dealt with in phase 2 and the agricultural sector will come under that.</p>

          <p eId="para_601">It is also reported that a process for reallocating the two EU agencies was agreed at the summit. I refer to the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority. According to press reports, there was extensive lobbying at the summit <i>en marge</i>, and the Taoiseach was involved. I understand that a decision will be taken on the relocation of these agencies next month at the General Affairs Council and that it might involve a vote. Can the Minister of State assure us that Ireland's case with regard to these agencies is being put forcefully? Will the Minister of State report on our lobbying as regards those two agencies?</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> At the Tallinn digital summit last month, the need to complete the digital Single Market within a year was agreed. It was also agreed that the EU should be the global leader of the digital economy. This means having the EU Single Market freedoms go digital. This is in the interest of businesses and citizens and it is important for us to meet the challenge. As the Taoiseach said earlier in the House, it is challenging but it is essential for our economic growth and to putting Europe to the forefront of the global economy. Will the Minister of State assure us that Ireland is to the forefront in meeting the challenge? Given our unique circumstances and with so many corporations involved in the area here, it would benefit Ireland and I hope that all 27 of us can meet the challenge.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">I assure the Deputy that we are putting our best foot forward in both bids, namely, the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency. We feel that we have two credible bids. We are realistic, however, and we will most likely not get both although we feel that we have the ability, infrastructure, proximity and the capability to house both of them. At the moment, we are working and engaging with other member states and looking to see what is our best possible outcome. We will continue to work on those two credible bids until the vote in November.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> On Tallinn and the digital summit, the Estonian Presidency has put forward an ambitious target and deadline with regard to the digital Single Market. We consider it important that there is an ambitious target and that we try to stick to it. The Commission has put forward a number of papers on cybersecurity. We also know that the free flow of data is important. We support all the work that is being done and will do what we can to ensure that it moves along as quickly as possible. Any barrier to doing business online is a barrier to development, growth and jobs. We see that clearly.</p>

          <p eId="para_605">I want a bit of clarity on the Turkey issue. The Minister of State said there were other similar cases where we were not able to send observers to court hearings. I find that response slightly disturbing. This country, which is a candidate member of the European Union, is engaged in a purge of Stalinist proportions against all of its opponents, civil society, trade unionists, journalists, MPs, Kurds, leftists - you name it - and other Islamic factions. What is going on is horrendous but the Minister of State is telling us that we cannot even send along our diplomats to observe court hearings to see if fair procedures are being followed. I find it quite disturbing that, in terms of absurd trumped-up charges being levied against leading representatives of Amnesty International, we cannot even attend the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> I know the Minister of State had a long list of questions to answer. However, I did not catch it if she responded to the question on the European Committee of Social Rights and its ruling on the damp conditions and inadequate standards in local authority housing. What does the Minister of State know about it and what will we do about it?</p>

          <p eId="para_608"> On the current trial, as I clearly stated, we do not agree with a lot of what is happening in Turkey. We believe that we need to keep the lines of communication open.

            <p eId="para_612">38. <b>Deputy Thomas Byrne</b> asked the <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b> his views on the widespread dissatisfaction with the progress of many school building projects, including many on a list published in 2014 for construction in 2015 which have not yet commenced, and the slow progress on the subsequently announced six-year capital plan for schools.

            <p eId="para_613">This important question relates to the progress, or lack thereof, of the schools building programme. I started with the list published just before Christmas on 18 December 2014 for schools that were going to construction in 2015. Approximately one third of those schools have not yet started. That is the tip of the iceberg. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

            <p eId="para_614">I am glad to be able to reply to this question. We have set out the Department's capital investment programme for 2016 to 2021, which details various school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process.</p>
            <p eId="para_615"> We are building more schools and providing more additional school places than ever before. This reflects the priority which the Government is putting on education. We have doubled the number of school places being provided from 8,900 in 2010 to 18,000 in 2017. We have also increased the number of school completions from 25 in 2010 to 50 in 2016, with an expected 46 schools this year. </p>
            <p eId="para_616"> In 2017, more than 80% of the capital allocation in respect of the school sector will be expended on the delivery of large scale projects and the additional accommodation scheme. It is expected that this expenditure level will be maintained in 2018. Since 2011, 170 new schools have been built, with 120 major projects. They represent more than 100,000 school places. </p>
            <p eId="para_617"> In the case of the school projects announced from within the multi-annual programme for 2015, 64 school projects have either been completed, are on site or are in advanced architectural planning. The remaining six school projects announced for 2015 have not advanced as the Department expected due to difficulties with acquiring sites and issues arising in the planning process. The Department is in ongoing liaison directly with each of these schools with regard to the ongoing progression of their projects into the architectural and planning process. </p>
            <p eId="para_618"> These issues are, in the vast majority of cases, completely outside the Department’s control. The Department seeks to progress all school building projects to completion as soon as possible and works towards this objective in all cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_619"> Following the capital review, additional capital funding of €332 million will be available to the schools sector, primarily from 2019 onwards, boosting investment in our primary and post-primary schools infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_620">The Minister is trying but failing to spin the situation by mixing up architectural planning with construction. He knows that building is different from planning. What was promised in 2014 was not that the schools on that list would go to architectural planning but would go to construction, that is, that building would start. Approximately 26 schools were promised they would go to construction in 2015 but that have not been started yet. It is a nonsense to say they are in architectural planning because the assumption was that they were well planned in 2014 when the Department and the Minister's predecessor announced they would be built commencing in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_621"> The Minister has also muddied the waters in respect of the capital plan from election year 2015 to 2021. That is another project in the realm of fantasy. There has not been a word about several schools such as the Mercy convent in Navan or Ard Rí community national school. What does the Minister have against special schools? Special schools around the country seem to be falling well behind, including St. Mary's and St. Ultan's in Navan, St. Ita's in Drogheda, a school in Enniscorthy and several in Stillorgan in south County Dublin, adjoining the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor. They have been left by the wayside. The Minister is mixing up the idea of building which the Government committed to. Does the Minister have enough money to build the projects the Department has already committed to building? </p>

            <p eId="para_622">The way we plan is to have several school projects at different stages in the architectural planning phases from the initiation, design, detailed architectural drawings, approval, evaluation, tender and on into construction. That is a pipeline and the Department works to the best of its ability to keep them all moving. We use every cent we get. We have drawn down an additional €100 million because of the quality of our planning and capacity to deliver. That does not mean that every school that wants a building will have it built the moment it wishes for it. There is a planning process.</p>
            <p eId="para_623"> We are put to the pin of our collar to meet the demographic growth, 80% of our money is going to build 18,000 new places, most of which are entirely new. There is expansion. We are meeting the demographic challenge of providing well over 100,000 additional school places. We are delivering those.</p>
            <p eId="para_624"> I fully recognise that in the case of announcements made about 70 projects which it was hoped would go to construction, that did not prove possible. They may have been over-optimistic as to whether they could be delivered in the time available. I can, however, show that the money devoted is delivering more and more school places every year. They are expanding the number we deliver and we are drawing down an additional €300 million in the new capital allocation to maintain that progress. It is putting a strain on funding to meet what we are very fortunate to have, a demographic bulge in our school population. </p>

            <p eId="para_625">The question is not whether the Minister is facing the various challenges he has listed but whether he is facing the challenge the Department set itself by saying that these projects would go to construction in certain years and that has not happened in many cases. This is a fantasy list and it dates back three years. The pre-election capital plan is in the realms of even greater fantasy because very few of those projects have been built. Does the Minister have enough money to build what he said he would build? I did not ask whether he is meeting the demand or facing the challenges. We know and accept that. Does he have enough money? Is he going to his Cabinet colleagues and the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform to ask for the money? I suspect that if the Department's building unit were a private company he would be seeking an examinership procedure because he has entered into so many commitments for which it does not have the money. The Department's commitment to building these schools in a particular year has not been complied with. The Minister needs to go back to the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to ask for a substantial increase in funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_626">I was not in this office in 2014 and cannot say why these projects were put on the construction list but every one of them is being progressed. The Deputy can see that in my reply. As he rightly says, some are at an earlier stage than would have been expected when they were put on the list in 2014. The reason for that is often planning or site difficulties. They were not due to an unwillingness to progress these projects. There is never an occasion in the Department of Education and Skills when money is returned to the Department of Finance. Most Departments return money at the end of the year unspent because they do not have a supply chain like our pipeline that ensures the money and projects are delivered. We can stand over the quality and numbers of our buildings. We are meeting the demographic trend. Of course there are people who would like to see it happen faster.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">The major project for St. Patrick's special school, Enniscorthy, which will provide replacement facilities for the school, is included in the Department of Education and Skills's construction programme. The project will provide for 20 classrooms and will include such facilities as special teacher rooms, multi-sensory, physiotherapy and occupational therapy rooms and a nurse's area and the provision of ball courts, external dining area and a garden play area.</p>
            <p eId="para_630"> As a replacement project, this school project was not initially included in the Department's five-year construction plan, due to the focus in that plan on providing additional accommodation in areas of significant demographic growth. In 2015, the project for the school was brought into the programme and has been advanced within the architectural planning process since.</p>
            <p eId="para_631"> While it would have been expected that this project would have progressed more quickly, it was delayed due to departmental revisions to its technical guidance documents and owing to staff changes internally. In July 2017 the stage 2b, detailed design, was approved and a process to carry out a short-listing of suitably qualified building contractors and subcontractors was commenced. The relevant short-listing contract notices were posted to the Official Journal of the European Union, OJEU, and the Government's eTenders website on 27 September and 8 October, respectively. This process encountered a short delay due to the revisions to the technical guidance documents, arising from changes to the public works contract which came into effect this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_632"> My Department is fully committed to the delivery of this project and will appoint an external consultant architect to oversee the project when it progresses to construction. It is anticipated that following the tender process to appoint a building contractor, this project will go on site and commence construction in the first half of 2018.</p>

            <p eId="para_633">I welcome the Minister's reply. I visited the school when it was giving July provision for students with autism. It is doing tremendous work. I question the health and safety of the building and classroom conditions. The classes are in prefabricated buildings. There is a lot of damp in the building. These children have very particular needs. Some need to be isolated for part of the day because of the risk of infection. It is unacceptable that children with those needs are asked to be in that kind of environment day in and day out and that staff have to deal with that. There is no outdoor space. There is chaos when buses come to collect students. I welcome the plan to have this done by next year but the school should be in that building now. It should have started there last September. I hope the Minister will keep this high on the agenda and that there will not be any more delays and that the school can look forward to having this building next year because it is long overdue.</p>

At the time the Department wanted to make sure that it was designed in-house to ensure that we had the internal expertise for the construction of special school projects of this nature.

            <p eId="para_638">This is an interesting issue. The Minister pointed out that he was not Minister for Education and Skills when the last list regarding school buildings came in, and I accept that. I certainly was not in any position of influence when this matter first arose, which is probably some time around 2009 or 2010 so I will give the Minister leeway on that one if he gives it on this issue. I am raising this issue in good faith because the pupil-teacher ratio seemed to be larger in the commuter belt in particular and high-growth areas than in other parts of the country. Many people put that down to a preponderance of small schools but when I looked at it, it turns out that the pupil-teacher ratio is effectively worse in terms of the staffing schedule in larger schools, which are predominant in the area in which I live and my constituency and possibly the Minister's constituency. Has the Minister any thoughts on this? Can it be changed without causing huge disruption, particularly in the context of the welcome commitment to reduce the overall pupil-teacher ratio next year?</p>

            <p eId="para_639">I can see what the Deputy is saying but this has a historic and justifiable basis. The staffing schedule is an allocation mechanism that uses enrolment bands to determine the number of classroom teaching posts allocated to a school. This is a long-standing arrangement for allocating teaching posts to our primary schools based on their respective enrolment and I have no plans to make changes to this practice, which is well settled in the school system.</p>
            <p eId="para_640"> There is a bias towards small schools in the staffing schedule in policy terms to reflect the fact that small schools have particular challenges teaching across a number of class groups. In larger schools, teachers are usually assigned to single class groups.  Budget 2017 introduced added protections for small schools, in particular, a capacity for one-teacher schools to apply to the staffing appeals board for an extra teacher where the single teacher has pupils across six or more class groups. </p>
            <p eId="para_641"> The staffing schedules operate in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location. For the 2017-18 school year at primary level, it operates on the basis of one classroom teacher for an average of every 27 pupils.  With the allocation ratio set at 27:1 for this school year, the classroom allocation ratio, when measured at the mid-point of the bands for schools, generally is 27:1. It is lower in smaller schools.  </p>
            <p eId="para_642"> Budget 2018 includes a further one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level. This measure will further assist all schools at the upper end of their individual respective bands. This budget measure delivers on a commitment made in the confidence and supply agreement and programme for Government to reduce primary schools class size. One can see that with small schools, it is a case of two teachers at 19 so that is nine children per teacher. That is the base. When one starts at that, it is equitably built up from that base. It provides really small schools with that higher level of staffing. It would be very difficult to go away from that principle.</p>

            <p eId="para_643">I again acknowledge the change to the pupil-teacher ratio from next to the lowest ever. It was an example of mature politics. We can shout and roar across the Dáil Chamber but when we work together, put our case on the basis of what we have done in the confidence and supply agreement and work professionally, as the Minister and I have done, we can actually achieve and change something. I am not speaking against small schools in any way. We will be the first to defend them if we have to. However, there is an issue in larger schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_644"> We are building bigger and bigger schools all the time. Realistically, the Minister will not be establishing new schools with two or three teachers. He will be establishing new schools with at least two streams and at least 16 teachers plus principal. In many cases, the numbers will be bigger. There are anomalies on the staffing schedule for ordinary schools and indeed Gaelscoileanna. In respect of a principal plus seven-teacher school up to a principal plus 16-teacher school, an increase of 26 pupils is required to get the additional teacher. A principal plus a 17-teacher school needs 37 pupils to move up that ratio and get the extra teacher so it does press the school hard. When one sees the headlines in the newspapers that the largest class sizes are in Meath, Kildare, Dublin, particularly suburban Dublin, and suburban Cork, this is the reason for it. Could it be looked at? Obviously, it will be in the context of financial and budgetary pressures and we have already taken one significant step so I am looking ahead. Is there a way of saying that a maximum class size should be this and we would not allow it and would not give the schools discretion to have class sizes bigger than a certain size, possibly 30?</p>

            <p eId="para_645">The system, which includes all parties in the House, certainly Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, has been designed to protect small schools. They have a lower retention point so the system protects smaller schools from the loss of their teacher as well as providing a better ratio in the structure. This is deliberately designed to defend the rural school which is trying to cater for multiple classes. There are some mitigating factors. For example, the walking principal comes in at the size of 177 and larger schools with five special classes get an additional post so there are compensating points.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> While I am open to looking at individual initiatives that deliver better outcomes, this system is tried and tested. I took the trouble to look at what is the average school size in the Deputy's county. It is 235, which is considerably larger than other smaller counties and counties that have suffered population decline. That has been done for good policy reasons. While my county of Dublin is even worse in terms of the average size of schools being larger, the policy is reasonably founded and I am content to leave it as it is. I will listen to debate in this House if compelling points are put forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_650">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to clarify the situation. My Department is preparing a circular that will provide guidance to ETB post-primary schools on the arrangements that should apply in future for students who wish to opt out of religious instruction or worship. The schools to which the Deputy refers are multidenominational schools and as such are required to provide for religious instruction according to the profile of the students who attend the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> It may have been reasonable when the schools were established for a school to assume that its pupil population was predominately Catholic and to make arrangements for religious instruction and worship exclusively on that basis. Historically, some ETB schools also made provision for religious instruction required for pupils from local Protestant communities. Depending on their future pupil composition as multidenominational schools, ETB second level schools may have to make provision for religious instruction for those from other minority religions should it be required. </p>
            <p eId="para_652"> It is important that schools consult with parents and in the case of pupils who have reached the age of 18, the pupil, to find out what their wishes are in respect of participating in religious instruction and worship. This practice should also apply to the parents of pupils already enrolled in the school and not just those seeking admission for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_653"> Schools engaging with parents, or pupils where appropriate, must at the outset of the school year clearly indicate what arrangements are in place for those who choose not to participate in religious instruction.  The outcome of this engagement should be integrated with the school's processes for establishing subject choices generally. Instead of waiting for a parent to request a withdrawal and then having to make alternative arrangements for the pupil for the class periods concerned, pupils who do not chose religious instruction should be timetabled by the school for alternative subjects.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">Societal change with a decrease in religious belief and practice requires a change in school practice and the circular will address how those who wish to withdraw must be catered for in future. I expect the circular to issue later this year. It will also apply to community schools, in all of which ETBs are co-patrons.</p>

            <p eId="para_655">An opt-out is not enough and neither are guidelines on an opt-out because it is a question of what ethos schools have. The CEO of the ETB in Tipperary told ETB school principals that the Christian belief, ethos and spirit of their schools was Catholic and this needed to be addressed in all policies. She recently stood over that claim. The Minister needs to respond to it and clarify whether it is the case. I have a copy of the religious education policy of the Central Technical Institute which is also an ETB school. It states the ethos is Christian and Irish and states: "Our community is a part of the wider community primarily composed of Roman Catholics, and the majority of our students are Roman Catholic, and the ethos of the school reflects this." It continues: "Faith formation is governed by the majority religion, 90% of the pupils being Roman Catholic." It is fair enough if there is religious education but it cannot be faith formation. There cannot be compulsory religious education that in reality is about Catholic faith formation.</p>

            <p eId="para_656">The statement the Deputy is citing was made in 2015 and it was made very clear at the time by the then Secretary General that it did not accord with policy. I have clarified in my statement, not only here but on a previous occasion, that it is inaccurate. The schools to which the Deputy refers are multidenominational and there will be a circular to make that absolutely crystal clear. That does not mean they are non-denominational. They will accept people of religious belief, of different faiths and of none. They must plan for the wishes of parents and pupils to ensure their timetable reflects those wishes. That is the multidenominational provision we are making. Multidenominational does not mean those of Christian faith are not welcome in the school. They are absolutely welcome but so also are those of other faiths and none. The imperative is to accommodate all of them.</p>

            <p eId="para_657">To clarify, a non-denominational school would not be a school that refuses to accept religious students. It is a school that does not have a religious ethos and one to which all people are welcome. It could include religious education but would not have the character of faith formation. Does the Minister agree there is a problem that a Roman Catholic diocesan adviser was assigned to that particular school's religious education policy and has been involved in decisions on the school?</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> On the opt-out, does the Minister agree that religious education cannot be faith formative? There should not be faith formation in these schools. Religious education and talking about different religions is fine but for State schools to be involved in faith formation is wrong and an opt-out will not deal with it. When it comes to the opt-out, it has to be a non-coercive opt-out. It should not be an opt-out that effectively punishes the students by putting them to the back of the class and not allowing them to do any other work. They should not just be sitting there listening to the lesson. They have to have a real, meaningful alternative.</p>

            <p eId="para_659">There is a debate within the ETBs about whether faith formation should occur within the school or not. Recently the ETB group has indicated it would move to a position where faith formation would not be during school hours. ETB schools at primary level, the community national schools, welcome and celebrate all faiths. It is not that they leave religion at the school gate and wish to keep it there; they celebrate all faiths. The trend is clearly that over time faith formation would move out of the school. That has been indicated by the ETBs as the direction. They have to complete their consideration of the issue. It is an approach I favour.</p>

Will the Minister address the working conditions of English language teachers in private schools? There are approximately 120 of them. Will he lay down standards in the industry that do not only adhere to basic employment law but exceed it to ensure these wealthy schools treat teachers as any worker would expect to be treated? Will the Minister legislate for zero-hour contracts to be banned and provide that a high percentage of teachers must have permanent contracts, that all schools must have a proper salary scale which reflects service and experience, and that all schools must pay sick pay, for all hours worked and overtime?</p>

            <p eId="para_662">The majority of English language schools in Ireland are privately run.  The relationship between teachers and private providers of education is based on a private contract. Issues relating to working conditions are a matter between the two parties and do not come under the remit of the Department.  There is an extensive range of legislation in Ireland which protects the employment rights of workers, including English language teachers, to employment contracts, payment of wages and related matters. It is the responsibility of the employer, in the first instance, to ensure their employees receive their employment rights. Where an employee considers his or her rights have been breached, he or she may bring a claim under the appropriate legislation to the Workplace Relations Commission. The Workplace Relations Commission has a range of services available including adjudication, inspection and advisory services. There is also provision for the negotiation of sectoral pay agreements and having those registered with the Labour Court. </p>
            <p eId="para_663"> In May 2017, when I was in my previous Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, on my proposal the Government approved the drafting of legislation to meet the commitment in the programme for Government to address problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and zero-hour contracts and to strengthen the regulation of precarious work. The draft legislation has been subject to a detailed dialogue process with ICTU and IBEC over a period of several months. The Bill is being drafted and it is intended to publish it before the end of the year subject to Government approval. </p>

            <p eId="para_664">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. The Government keeps coming back to us and saying there is the Workplace Relations Commission process. The Minister of State knows that some of the issues that affect teachers in the sector, such as bogus self-employment, the absence of employment contracts and paying less to non-native teachers, breach legislation and can be tackled through a third party although it is virtually impossible to do so because of the precarious nature of the work. The most prevalent issues are completely legal although they are wrong. They are things such as maintaining all teachers on fixed term or zero-hour contracts, not paying for non-contract hours worked, not paying sick pay, taking an anti-union approach, allowing a fixed term contract to expire in December and rehiring in January to avoid holiday pay and having no salary scales. None of those things is illegal because of the terrible employment legislation we have in this country. Those workers, through Unite, are looking for an SEO to be put into the qualifications and quality assurance (amendment) Bill. The Minister should at least meet the representatives of the unions.</p>

            <p eId="para_665">I thank the Deputy. She has raised the issue numerous times in the Chamber. A core component of the Government's future policy for the English language sector will be the introduction of the international education mark, IEM.  It is the intention that the regulations governing the IEM will include a requirement that all obligations concerning national employment legislation are complied with by education and training providers seeking to access the mark. The necessary legislation to facilitate the introduction of the IEM is being progressed through the Department of Education and Skills.  This legislation will also provide Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, which will manage the IEM, with additional powers to examine the bona fides of providers, including English language education providers. </p>

If things are being organised in the background as the Minister of State has said, it would be an opportunity to talk to those workers and their union about what protection could be offered to them. The first thing the Minister and Minister of State should do is meet representatives of Unite and the workers themselves. They have not done so; they have already met representatives of MEI, but have not met the people most affected in the workplace. I appeal to the Minister of State to meet them and we can relay that information on to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">I ask the Minister about the impending industrial action by special needs assistants who have voted by 97% for industrial action. I understand it relates to the allocation by the National Council for Special Education. For four years in a row it has been very late - up to July - in allocating which schools would get how many SNAs etc., which obviously has a hugely disruptive impact on the schools, but particularly on the SNAs who do not have a guarantee of work or where they will be working and whether the issues can be resolved.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_673">It is a good opportunity to clarify the matter. IMPACT’s decision to ballot its members on industrial action at this time is surprising in light of a development over recent months. When I announced the appointment of an additional 975 SNAs for allocation to schools between September and December this year, I recognised that we needed a better system for allocation in future years. At the time I said that I hoped to have a more robust system using the National Council for Special Education prediction models to inform the normal estimates allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_674"> As a Government we have managed to achieve that. As part of a package of education measures in the recent budget, I announced that almost 1,100 additional SNA posts will be available for allocation to schools in 2018, more than 960 of which will be allocated from September 2018. Under the old model, this decision would have been made in mid-2018. Making that decision now will facilitate earlier allocations of SNAs to schools for the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_675"> There have been very substantial year-on-year increases in SNA posts in recent years. The most recent budget announcement will bring the number of posts to more than 15,000, an increase of 43% since 2011. Mechanisms have been introduced under the Haddington Road Agreement that give SNAs greater stability in their employment and these continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020. A comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, currently being undertaken by the NCSE, includes IMPACT as part of the consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> It is disappointing in light of these developments that industrial action is being contemplated which would have a detrimental effect on children with special educational needs who depend on the care support provided by SNAs in order that they can participate in education.</p>
            <p eId="para_677"> While a decision on industrial action is a matter for IMPACT, the union is a party to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which contains clauses on industrial harmony. The union will be aware of commitments and potential implications in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_678">I thank the Minister for the answer. I fully support the SNAs in the action they have voted for and are contemplating. It is not acceptable for them not to know if they have a job to return to and they are unable to apply for redeployment in the event that they do not. What they are requesting is very simple. I ask the Minister to give the simple commitments that in future SNA allocations will be announced in sufficient time, which means no later than May, to allow the supplementary assignment panel and distribution of available hours to serving staff to operate to full effect. That seems very simple and would allow people to be able to plan their lives. Can the Minister give that commitment? They are also looking for arrangements in respect of job security on a par with teachers and other public servants and an agreed procedure for dealing with SNA grievances.</p>

            <p eId="para_679">That is why I am a bit surprised. The announcement I made in the budget was to allow the NCSE to make that announcement. In previous years the NCSE did the evaluation and then had to await a Government decision to approve the sanctioning of the money. Now we have sanctioned the money in October for next year, meaning it is in a position to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> There is a grievance procedure which to my knowledge is working satisfactorily. In addition a panel system was introduced in 2013. Prior to the introduction of that panel, a substantial number of SNAs, approximately 400, were being made redundant each year because the children for whom they were caring no longer needed those supports in the school and only 10% of them were getting redeployed. Under the panel we have introduced, fewer SNAs are losing their posts - about 54% got new posts and others having gone on the panel opted for redundancy. We have been acting under the existing agreements to meet the issues raised by IMPACT.</p>

            <p eId="para_681">If the Minister can give a commitment that this is resolved once and for all and it will not be happening again after happening for four years in a row, I would say that SNAs would be relieved to hear that. For the past couple of summers I have been contacted by school principals and SNAs affected by this.</p>
            <p eId="para_682"> On the more general issue of allocation of SNAs, I welcome the increase in SNAs. It is largely keeping up with demographic changes and increases in the number of children with special needs. Over the summer, some worrying kites were flown about the special education needs budget being too large. Thankfully the Government pulled back from making any cuts. With that background, there is rightful concern that the Government may attempt to cut back, which would be completely unjustified.</p>

            <p eId="para_683">I am pleased to tell the Deputy that we meet SNA requirements far beyond demographic needs. The demographic needs would be of the order of 2% or 3%. Since 2011, we have increased the number of SNAs by 43%. For example, at second level we have quadrupled the number of special classes for children with special needs. We have also massively expanded them at primary level. This has been an area of very significant expansion of provision. I am very proud we are in a position to do that. Obviously we need to ensure the service meets the needs of children and that is why a review is being undertaken. It is an area of high priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_685">My question relates to voluntary contributions and what we are now hearing are being deemed as registration or re-registration fees. Particularly at second level, parents are being asked to pay a re-registration fee if they are interested in continuing their child's education at that particular school. Unfortunately it is on the increase. I ask for the Minister to comment on it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_686">Registration fees are absolutely illegal; that is very clear. Schools may seek voluntary contributions in recognised schools provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition and that a child’s place in the school or continued enrolment is not dependent on a willingness to make a contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> The manner in which voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management. However, their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> A school may seek payment to cover the cost of photocopied or other such learning materials where the amount sought by the school is consistent with the costs involved and the level of materials provided. It is also permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extracurricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether to participate. No charge may be made, however, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum, or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 clarifies this by prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions as part of the school admission process or for continued enrolment in the school. As the Deputy is aware, that Bill will soon proceed to Report Stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> I am very conscious of the burden which can be placed on parents by the costs associated with school attendance. That is the reason I issued a circular to schools requiring a keen cost approach to the selection of items which could impose costs and requiring consultation with parents on the elements that can create costs. My colleague, the Minister for Employment and Social Protection, also made provision this year for a 25% increase in the back to school allowance and a significant expansion in school meals programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> The parents and students charter, legislation on which is currently before the committee for prelegislative scrutiny, will require schools to publish data on what voluntary contributions are used for.</p>

            <p eId="para_692">I thank the Minister for his reply. Unfortunately, that is not the experience of most parents sending their children to school. There is considerable pressure on parents to pay the so-called voluntary contribution and, in some instances, schools are starting to call them school bills and making it very clear that the contribution is not voluntary. There is a good deal of pressure in terms of texts, emails, phone calls, letters and some schools even have incentives whereby if parents pay the full amount by a certain date they will be in with a chance to win a prize in a raffle or something like that. That places a great deal of pressure on parents because children are coming home from school and they do not want to be the child who is different. I have considerable sympathy for the schools because they are stretched. They are trying to come up with a way of subsidising their income but, unfortunately, it falls back on the children because some schools penalise them by not allocating a child a locker or not giving a child a school journal or homework notebook - items like that which are handed out. Some schools are brilliant and they handle it very well but others schools do not handle it well. The only ones who are paying the price for this are the children. There is nothing worse for a child than going to school and feeling they do not have the money for this and that they are going to be different. That puts a great deal of unnecessary pressure on children.</p>

            <p eId="para_693">I hear what the Deputy is saying. I strongly believe that the provision of a parents and students charter, which will require much more sharing of information, consultation and collective decisions on school policies by the body of parents, will be a very significant step forward. That will greatly help the channels of communication and make sure that the misunderstandings, to which the Deputy has referred, do not occur. I say to the Deputy and to anyone else that if an impression is being created or children are being told they cannot participate in programmes that are core to the delivery of subjects, part of the school curriculum or part of the activities that every pupil is expected to participate in, they should complain about these impositions. We will certainly investigate them if they are brought to our attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_694">I suggest that the circular be reissued to schools or that schools are reminded of this. Barnardos undertook research into this recently which shows that 56% of primary schools and 69% of secondary schools, which is a very large number, still have a voluntary contribution. I understand it is illegal. I am not saying the message is not being passed on to schools, but they are not picking it up. Much of it comes down to funding. We cannot get away from the fact that schools experienced many funding cuts in recent years. I urge that the circular be reissued to schools. If a charter is to be put in place, that will be welcome. We talk a good deal about mental health and children's mental health. It is very difficult for a child to go to school feeling different because there is something for which they cannot pay. We should be trying to avoid that situation at all costs for children.</p>

            <p eId="para_695">I wish to clarify that voluntary contributions are permissible but compulsory ones are not. That is the distinction. The way in which voluntary contributions are collected is a matter for the school management. As I said, and as I believe the Deputy accepts, if parents are greater partners in the development of policies in this area, we would have more confidence that they would be administered in a way that is sensitive to all parents' needs. That is the reason I am keen to push ahead with the concept of a charter.</p>

We are well on track to deliver those in accordance with the needs. That creates pressure on our budgets and 80% of our budgets have had to be devoted to the provision of additional places. The rate of provision is a substantial 14,000 to 15,000 new places every year and about 4,000 replacement school places. That is double what was occurring in 2010 and it has been steadily increasing.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> In the recent review of capital funding, we got an allocation of an additional €322 million for the school sector. That will allow us to sustain the progress in this area. To give the Deputy an example of the delivery, we have had 170 entirely new schools since 2011 and 120 major expansions. We are making a very substantial investment right across the country. That is happening in light of our having a growing school population. Initially, the focus was very much on the primary sector but now it is moving into a very expanded programme at second level.</p>

            <p eId="para_700">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. What is the degree to which his Department can avail of modern building techniques with a view to making economic sense and also having regard to the need to ensure buildings are of lifetime duration rather than the temporary prefabricated buildings to which we had become accustomed over the years? What is the degree to which he expects that modular building programme to develop over the next number of years?</p>

            <p eId="para_701">The Deputy has probably visited a number of sites. We are building phenomenal schools. They are impressive buildings. We have been using not only the build model by the Department through direct acquisition of design but also public private partnerships. Different approaches have been used. The Department is very much on top of modern building methods. That is not to say we cannot improve. One of the sectors where we have had least productivity growth in recent years has been in construction, perhaps for understandable reasons. With the advent of technology, no doubt there are new opportunities. They are certainly opportunities to become much more efficient, energy efficient in particular. My Department is very alert to the obligations of moving towards highly energy-efficient buildings in its programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">We had an earlier debate on this. We have a pipeline system and when cases are deemed urgent, they go into the pipeline. That can be a frustrating process. Site issues, planning issues and design issues can arise. We have probably 100 projects on the go all the time and many in the pipeline coming through. We can get instances such as the one we spoke about earlier where we can get hiccups in the process and something that would be perceived as urgent is nonetheless delayed for planning or site reasons. We do the very best to avoid that. We make sure that not a cent is wasted. We never give money back to the Department of Finance unspent at the end of the year because we make sure we have enough projects of a quality, that are well designed and shovel ready to make sure we spend every penny we get. I am confident the system works, but that is not to say I will not be looking to see if can we improve it as we move ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_705">Is the Minister considering increasing the number of schools that offer the international baccalaureate? There is a call for that in some instances because, with new foreign investment here and international offices being set up, people may be looking for an international school. There is one such school in train, as I understand, and a second school is seeking a site in order to be able to provide a secondary school option. I am keen to get the Minister's views on this matter. I will then come back in to explain my own thinking as to why it might make sense.</p>

            <p eId="para_706">The Deputy probably knows my reply already. An international school providing the international baccalaureate would not be a recognised school for the purposes of funding by my Department, as it would not teach the Irish curriculum. All State-funded schools follow the curriculum as established by the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> I understand that a small number of schools, possibly four, offer elements of the international baccalaureate currently, with none offering the entire curriculum from four to 18 years of age. I am aware of plans on the part of private providers to develop new schools which offer the international baccalaureate. These providers are not eligible for, nor are they seeking, funding or quality assurance from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_708"> I have no plans to devote resources from the education budget for the provision of the international baccalaureate. However, as a general principle, and in support of our international education strategies, my Department is broadly supportive of the value and role of international schools in addressing the need to provide education for children of internationally mobile parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_709">I understand that the Minister cannot be supporting a private system. We have need for a public system as well. However, perhaps there are ways the two could be combined whereby we could possibly co-locate. A school that has been under-utilising its facilities might be able to co-locate with a new international school to allow it be established. One of the reasons I would support such a move is that I would like to see some greater options here and, perhaps, greater impetus in the reform of our junior certificate and leaving certificate systems. The introduction of schools offering the international baccalaureate might actually provide this. It might give us experience of other exam mechanisms and techniques and other learning mechanisms. As a parent of four children who are now going through the education system, it does not seem that the system has been reformed at all in the way we were promised it would be. My children are doing the same "murder machine" trick of learning things off and spouting things out. The advantage of us having a cadre of schools here offering the international baccalaureate would be that it might help us reform our system, which, I believe, is badly needed.</p>

            <p eId="para_710">I agree that we should always consider reform and that is the reason we said that, within a decade, we would have the best education training service in Europe. We are looking at exemplars of good practice using bodies such the OECD, etc., to examine what we are doing and identify where we might make improvements. I do not think we need to establish baccalaureate schools for us to hold a mirror up to ourselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> I take the Deputy's point about the slow pace of reform. As he knows, the junior cycle is the first significant step in changing the way in which we assess pupils. Although it has met with considerable resistance, I think it is now being rolled out and is proving itself. I hope that confidence in the junior cycle will build, in time, to a point where we will be in a position to examine whether further reform further up the cycle can arise. However, I am also conscious that the leaving certificate attracts huge public confidence in respect of being fair, objective and so on. We are open to good exemplars of better assessment and teaching methods. Recently, I met representatives of Atlantic Rim Collaboratory, ARC, including those from Scotland, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Ontario. They are doing very exciting things from which we are learning. We are trying to test our model against good practice elsewhere.</p>

            <p eId="para_712">A primary school offering an international baccalaureate programme is co-located with a public school in Synge Street. Would the Department meet the backers of that project to see if something similar might be possible at second level? It is not taking from the public system. The two working together could provide a model. That would be our own example of being connected to what is going on in terms of the international baccalaureate, which should and could be of real use not just for the business community but for our entire education system.</p>

            <p eId="para_716">For clarification, those jobs are at both primary and second level. I am pleased that I have been in a position to significantly expand the recruitment of teachers. Some 2,300 new teachers were recruited in 2016-2017 and 2,900 will be recruited in 2017-2018. That figure of 2,900 is 21% more than the number announced in budget 2017. All of the 2016-2017 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete. We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.</p>
            <p eId="para_717"> Overall, the number of graduates emerging from initial teacher training at primary level is approximately 1,750 and that at second level is approximately 1,500 per annum. I am aware of certain reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level and in a number of particular subjects at second level. There are difficulties in developing a reliable model of teacher supply at second level, which was recognised in the work of the Teaching Council. This is because teaching is competing with many other sectors for graduates in areas such as maths, science, and Irish.</p>
            <p eId="para_718"> I have taken some immediate initiatives to ease some of these pressures. Some have been in respect of retiring teachers who remain eligible for periods of more than five consecutive days if they continue to be registered with the Teaching Council. I have also increased the limits for employment while on career break at post-primary level to a maximum of 300 hours in a school year and to a maximum of 90 days in a school year at primary level. The matter of the employment of bachelor of education and professional master of education students in limited circumstances on a short-term basis is still under consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> I have also taken particular subject area initiatives such as increasing the number of students admitted to St, Angela's, Sligo, to follow the home economics programme, which is one of the areas of tightness, with further expansion in future years. As part of the policy on Gaeltacht education, I have made funding available for the provision of two additional posts to the máistir gairmiúil san oideachas - professional master of education programme - in NUI Galway.</p>

            <p eId="para_720">The extra teachers are extremely welcome. I want to give an example from recent experience. I chair the board of management of a primary school. Due to career breaks and maternity leave, we have had quite a number of vacancies to fill. We spent a full day last July, another half day in August and another period two weeks ago interviewing, yet we still have a substitute maternity leave post that we cannot fill. We have had to resort to unqualified teachers. As the Minister knows, they can only work for five days at a time. This means that the class in question will be getting a different teacher every five days. I totally understand that we do not want unqualified individuals teaching in schools because it would have a disastrous effect on the quality of teaching. However, this is an exceptional circumstance and, no matter what the rule or regulation is, there has to be some space for particular circumstances that arise. We can certainly document our efforts to get somebody, which have been unsuccessful to date. I ask for the Minister to allow for some space to manoeuvre in these situations.</p>

            <p eId="para_721">There is no doubt that recruiting 5,000 teachers over two years puts some pressure on the system. We are successfully filling those posts, however, and are making provision to ease the pressure where pinch points occur. I am also sitting down with my Department to look at other potential initiatives, particularly in some of the areas, such as STEM and languages, in which we are experiencing pinch points. We are very definitely competing with other growing sectors that are demanding maths, physics, STEM and so on. I am looking to see if we can take targeted initiatives to attract more of such graduates into teaching.</p>
            <p eId="para_722"> We will have 1,750 teachers qualifying at primary level this year. The recruitment plan next year is for 650.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">There will be considerably more headroom for recruitment next year than was there was in September last.</p>

            <p eId="para_724">There is a particular difficulty at primary level. Irish teachers are in high demand in other countries and they now have opportunities to work abroad, particularly in the Middle East where salaries are higher. A significant number of teachers are away in any given year. I do not believe it should be the responsibility of the voluntary management boards to make a decision in this area. There is need for a conversation between the Department and the unions on the maximum number, proportionate to the number of teachers in a school, that can be on a career break in any given year. Some schools have brought in their own quotas but I am not sure if that is the correct way to go. This exodus needs to be addressed because it has an unsettling effect on the children, whose interests are primary.</p>
            <p eId="para_725"> Another issue is Garda vetting, which can sometimes be complicated for teachers. It would be helpful if it could be simplified in some way.</p>

            <p eId="para_726">The Deputy is right that under the current system it is up to the local authority to decide on employment policies of that nature. I will ask the Department to look at the issue. In regard to Garda vetting, to be fair to the various management bodies they have made a big effort to streamline the process. The Teaching Council has also done a lot of work to try to streamline it. Of late, I have not been receiving the level of complaints I was receiving previously. I hope it is working itself through.</p>
            <p eId="para_727"> On the issue of salaries, we have made significant progress in closing the gap that existed. Talks in this area are ongoing. Hopefully, across all of these initiatives we can ease the pinch points that the Deputy points to.</p>

            <p eId="para_730">My Department works closely with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major residential developments and requests sites to be reserved for school purposes, where necessary, to ensure as far as possible the timely delivery of any required education infrastructure in the future. </p>

            <p eId="para_734">I thank the Minister for his reply, which in some regards is the traditional reply that when the houses are built and people are occupying them the schools will follow. This has been the traditional model in the greater Clondalkin-Lucan area and it has imposed considerable hardship on new communities. The difference with this model is it is a strategic development zone, where infrastructure is to be provided in tandem with the housing development. We need to move away from the traditional problems we experienced in the past. Rather than waiting and doing an analysis on new population schools must be provided in tandem with the housing development. One of the schools identified has been built and is currently occupied and reaching capacity. It is important to recognise the location of Clonburris. It is straddled between Clondalkin and Lucan, an area which has seen significant population growth. Many of the existing schools in these areas have no spare capacity and so it is really important that the Department's plan is dovetailed to meet the strategic development such that there are no gaps. We should not wait until the population is in place to address the educational needs of the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_735">I take the Deputy's point. Obviously, we do not build schools and wait for the population to arrive. We cannot afford to do that. Deputy Durkan asked earlier if we are able to meet the pressures of an expanding population. What we have is a just-in-time policy. This policy has been around for years. That does not mean that policy does not closely monitor demographic trends. Issues such as births and local authority information are used to identify where we need to anticipate provision. The system is working. As the Deputy said, there are already new schools in the area and we are planning to provide further schools. I will ask my Department to look specifically at how it is anticipating provision and the timing of investment in this area. We do not have the luxury of a build and they will come policy. We have to take account of birth rates, recognising that in three or four years times those children will be hitting the primary school system and that is when we need to have the places available.</p>

            <p eId="para_736">There are no birth rates to take account of because this is a brand new town. It is a greenfield site on which there will be approximately 8,500 housing units. The schools will have to be built just in time, not afterwards, or there will be no school in the area for children to attend. This is a big development. I appreciate the Minister's undertaking to look at the issue. For this scale of development to occur, the infrastructure must be provided in tandem. This has to be a phased development. We cannot have thousands of houses built and a decision to build a school and it appear three years later. That will not work. It will put a stop to this housing development.</p>
            <p eId="para_737"> As the Minister is aware the already huge population of Clondalkin, Adamstown and set to increase by 20,000 following the completion of the Clonburris development. Has consideration been given to the provision of a third level institution in this area?</p>

            <p eId="para_738">The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has responsibility for third-level provision. As the Deputy will be aware, what we need to do is consolidate the institutions of technology in Dublin into one strong technological university that has the capacity to span all of the needs of the city. Small stand-alone third-level institutions is the direction we have been taking. We need strong institutions. While I am not ruling the idea of new colleges in the future, the trend in recent times has been to strengthen the institutions we have and grow from the existing base. That is only a general comment.</p>
            <p eId="para_739"> The point made by the Deputy is a valid one. We do look at the type of occupancy that one would expect in see in developments as they come on stream. That is factored into the plan. It is not a case of looking in a rigid way at the birth rates. Given these types of developments are going to become an increasing feature of integrated planning, which we will have to adhere to if we are to meet the ambitions of the national framework, I will ask my Department to take a fresh look at how we deal with the education planning of SDZs because I think the issue warrants attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_742">The terms and conditions of employment for SNAs are outlined in their contracts of employment.  These contracts were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant trade unions representing SNAs, IMPACT and SIPTU, prior to their introduction in 2005. The agreement reached between the parties found expression in the two circular letters issued in 2005 detailing the contracts of employment for SNAs.</p>
            <p eId="para_743"> The contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant departmental circulars governing special needs assistants, which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs. From time to time, these circulars are amended and new circulars are issued by my Department. </p>
            <p eId="para_744"> In addition, my Department has implemented a nationally agreed set of grievance procedures for SNAs which can be invoked by an SNA, with an employer, to deal, where appropriate, with issues such as school rules, policies and procedures or practices. Department of Education and Skills, DES, circular 72/2011 - Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures for Special Needs Assistants in Recognised Primary and Post-Primary Schools - refers. </p>
            <p eId="para_745">If, upon conclusion of the grievance process, the grievance remains unresolved, the SNA may refer the matter to the Workplace Relations Commission through the normal dispute resolution channels.</p>
            <p eId="para_746"> As is the case for certain other employees, SNAs have the right to submit or refer complaints in relation to contraventions of or disputes relating to entitlements under employment, equality and equal status legislation to the Workplace Relations Commission for resolution and agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_747">Are the special education needs organisers, SENOs, who oversee special needs assistants responsible for them? Several people have contacted our office about an anomaly in the sector whereby many who have been in a job for quite a long time but whose hours might have been reduced are penalised if they get work in another special needs role because they are unable to carry forward their yearly increments. If a full-time role comes up in a school, those who have been trainees there for several years are able to get that role ahead of those in an existing position in the school. Should the SENO or the school principal and the board of management be the first point of contact for special needs assistants? Which is in charge on this issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_748">The school is the employer and the SENO is an adviser who helps assess children's individual needs. SENOs do not have a role in the deployment of SNAs. As I said in reply to Deputy Paul Murphy, a panel is in place that has resulted in a substantial improvement in the successful placement of SNAs who have to move from a school because of a changed needs profile. The number getting a successful placement has increased from 10% to 54%. The panel arrangement also provides that if additional hours come up, a person with reduced hours gets preferential access to them. The existing procedure through the panel arrangement makes provision for the concerns the Deputy has outlined. If she wishes to send me details of a particular query I will have it clarified for her.</p>

I might submit further details to the Minister's office but there seems to be a difficulty on that issue.

If the Minister cannot clarify that now, I will submit it to his office at a later stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_752">The question is similar to that asked by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan. I am pleased to have been in a position to significantly expand the recruitment of primary teachers, with 1,093 new primary teachers recruited in 2016-17 and 1,160 in 2017-18. The 2016-17 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete. With regard to the 637 primary posts announced in budget 2018, my Department estimates there will be approximately 1,750 new primary teachers next year, which is sufficient to meet the requirements of the system while taking into account anticipated retirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_753"> I am aware of certain reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level, including in the cases referred to by the Deputy, and have taken a number of steps to address them, as I earlier outlined.

            <p eId="para_754">I do not wish to be alarmist but there is an emerging crisis in the primary education system. The lack of substitute teachers has led to the traditional student-teacher model becoming quite dysfunctional. On eight occasions there were no teachers to supervise classes in Adamstown Castle Educate Together school in Lucan, which is in my constituency, and that meant classes were put together and students lost out. The Minister is probably cognisant of the emerging crisis but it could get worse.</p>

            <p eId="para_755">Substitute posts can be difficult to fill. If a very short-term substitution for a person pursuing other interests needs to be filled, potential applicants may be more interested in a long-term placement. As part of the negotiated agreements, we shortened the period whereby people can get contracts of indefinite duration or a permanent post. Strong career opportunities are offered by the increase in the number of permanent full-time positions at the current rate of over 1,000 per year. That puts some pressure on availability for substitution, which is why I have made some changes in respect of those on career breaks, the recently retired or others who could take up some hours when they become available. There will be 1,750 new primary teachers next year, 630 of whom are being absorbed in net new intake. The Department believes that intake when balanced with the number of retirements will be sufficient to meet the needs in the sector. I continue to examine the issue and will discuss concerns arising in the area with various stakeholders. Analysis has to be based on more than anecdotal evidence; we have to look at detailed statistics on the nature of the problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_756">It is more than anecdotal evidence. The chairwoman of a group representing principals of primary schools in Dublin 15 wrote an alarming letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>, the first few sentences of which stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_757">We have collated the figures for the month of September 2017 alone and they make for disturbing reading – the number of school days when substitute teachers were not available to cover absences in Dublin 15 during September 2017 was 546. As a result, classes are divided and children are being sent to other available classrooms, often at short notice, resulting in disruption and overcrowding in those classrooms. The education of all concerned is significantly compromised on these occasions. Often, special education teachers are required to suspend their support timetables to teach mainstream classes, thereby depriving the most vulnerable children of their vital supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">The principals of schools in Dublin 15 hold a different view to that of the Minister. There is an emerging crisis in regard to substitute teachers.</p>

            <p eId="para_759">Absences occur for various reasons such as sickness or in-service training. The level of absences requiring substitution noted in that letter are very high. There may be a need to examine how we schedule activities in order that strain is not put on schools during certain months of the year. The Deputy has indicated it can be a particular problem during September. I will examine ways to plan a better spread of in-service training days, which might cause a considerable number of absences at the same time and consider if there is a better way to reduce the pressure that gives rise to the need for substitution.</p>

The Minister knows there is a background to the issue and that the Dáil debated having a full review, as was promised from the beginning. He is also aware of the upset among applicants to Caranua.

            <p eId="para_762">The review under way is confined to the issue of eligibility to apply to the organisation for support.</p>
            <p eId="para_763"> The terms of reference of the review of eligibility, a draft of which was published on my Department's website earlier this year, provided for an initial phase involving a review of Caranua's expenditure to date and an estimation of the projected expenditure, taking into account applications on hand and anticipated further applications together with an estimation of any possible underspend of the available funding. This initial phase of the review is now at an advanced stage and I hope to receive a report on it shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_764"> If the findings of this initial phase indicate that an underspend of the €110 million in funding available to Caranua is likely, a consultation process will then be initiated with stakeholders about an expansion of the eligibility criteria, including identification of the groups that could be considered for inclusion in any expansion. The consultation process would seek to identify possible arrangements for verifying eligibility, resource implications and related issues. If the findings indicate that an underspend was unlikely, the review will conclude at that point. It should be noted also that any proposal to widen eligibility would require legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_765"> It is worth noting that to date Caranua has received 6,000 applications and expended some €66 million in support of over 4,000 applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_766"> The Deputy will recall the debate in this House in May on a Private Members' motion in her name and that of others relating to Caranua's operations. The amended motion accepted by the House called on the Government to take a number of specific actions regarding Caranua. In response, Caranua has advised that it is reviewing its customer charter in consultation with stakeholders with a view to making data available on whether targets for responses to phone calls and correspondence are being met. Data on feedback and complaints received are also to be made available. Caranua is also working to increase the level of face-to-face engagement with applicants. It is doing this through scheduled face-to-face meetings in various venues in Dublin and in the regions. It should also be noted that the recent move by Caranua to new office accommodation will facilitate a greater level of face-to-face engagement with applicants than had previously been possible. Finally, I understand that Caranua is working to enhance the level of statistics it provides to my Department and to the public on waiting times for processing and communicating decisions.</p>

Over a month later he is telling me the same thing. I do not wish to argue with the Minister at all, but he must place this question and answer in the context of people who are extremely upset. My office is in constant receipt of urgent representation from applicants, as I am sure are other Deputies' offices. One applicant rang my office today to confirm that he is on hunger strike along with a number of other people, such is their dissatisfaction with the service. The reason I used my Private Members' time on this matter was to indicate to the Dáil the level of dissatisfaction with it, the lack of monitoring by the Department of Education and Skills over it, a list of contracts that had never been sanctioned - it looked like they were sanctioned retrospectively - and many other issues that we raised in the Dáil. We appealed to the Minister to carry out a full review. Not alone did he not do that, but the limited review he is carrying out still has not been completed. May I have a date?

The reply to the Deputy's question states that I hope to receive the report shortly. I presume that represents very considerable progress on the work but I am also pointing out that since our debate earlier, there have been significant efforts and work by Caranua with my Department to ensure that the procedures regarding customer service support are improved. The very issues that were raised here about delays, face-to-face time and the ways in which issues were being handled were issues of particular concern. The Department and Caranua have been taking steps to address these, and I hope people are seeing some improvement as a result. There is an appeal process. We will monitor the level of appeals and complaints that occur in an attempt to make sure that the changes being made are being reflected in better performance regarding those very sensitive areas. I hope there is improvement being reflected in the efforts being made in the experience of those dealing with Caranua.</p>

I absolutely understand the sensitivity of the work that is involved. These are people who have suffered hugely at the hands of institutions and the State and we must deal with them very fairly. At the same time, I also realise the constraints on a board such as Caranua's, which must comply with what has been decided by the Legislature and the framework within which it must administer its decisions.

            <p eId="para_777">The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached in September last year will see pay rises of between 15% and 22% between €4,600 and €6,700 for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_778"> The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale. This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced services for children with special educational needs, disadvantaged schools, growing schools and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_779"> In education there is a well-established increment system, and teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from €33,800 to €61,950 depending on the date on which the individual began teaching. Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_780"> I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance they set out to achieve. However, any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. The recently concluded Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision regarding new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post-January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the agreement. An initial meeting on new entrant pay under this process took place on 12 October 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_781"> The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_782"> The new Public Service Stability Agreement would also bring undoubted benefits to young teachers. In January 2018 a newly qualified teacher straight out of college will earn €35,958. In October 2020 a newly qualified teacher straight out of college will earn €37,692. This is a very competitive graduate salary.</p>

            <p eId="para_783">It is important not to confuse this issue with the whole question of incremental pay scales. We are talking about a cohort of teachers who are starting on a lower salary than their colleagues started on, which means that, over the course of their teaching career, they will be substantially penalised as a result. There is a significant sense that younger teachers who have come in are being less favourably treated and this is simply not fair. There is also a strong sense on the part of members of teacher unions that they cannot continue to tolerate a situation where they are working alongside younger teachers who are very clearly being discriminated against. There is now a strong sense of solidarity among the teaching profession and that sense is not going to change. There is a strong sense that people have been badly treated and left behind, which is having a very negative impact on morale. The Minister needs to take action on this earlier than he has set out.</p>

            <p eId="para_784">To repeat what I said in my reply, the public service pay agreement has embraced this issue and it has put in place a process which has not been left for 12 months, as was provided for in the agreement, because the process has already started on 12 October 2017. This issue is being taken seriously. It is worth reflecting on how this came about. Back in the midst of the crisis, there was an agreement to continue recruiting teachers at a time when the State was under huge financial pressure. The deal that then emerged was to recruit at lower pay. As the Deputy rightly said, that has given rise to anomalies. Many teachers were recruited in those difficult years who are on those lower scales but we have used the flexibility of the agreement to negotiate substantial improvements for them and a process is now in place. When it came to the recent agreements, where some €900 million was on the table to be negotiated as a settlement with the public service unions, the negotiations resulted in an agreement that did not address this particular way immediately but, instead, put this process together. That was openly negotiated between the two parties. I appreciate the teacher unions are not happy with the outcome but we have a process in place and I hope the unions will engage actively with it because in time, it hopefully will make progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_786">I thank the Minister for attending to deal with this matter. I put down a number of questions to the Minister yesterday on related issues. In regard to a set of questions on contact centres, she stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_787">My Department is committed to supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children, and the effective functioning of families. We recognise that the dynamics of domestic violence and the safety needs of both children and non-abusing parents must be considered in making appropriate arrangements for children's contact with abusive parents in the case of family breakdown.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_788"> I wish to acknowledge the valuable work of the child contact centres which were set up under a pilot project operated by Barnardos and One Family ...</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_789"> I understand that officials from my Department are shortly due to meet with officials from the Department of Justice and Equality to discuss the potential for establishing child contact centres on a national basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">As I stated in correspondence with the Minister, this relates to a contact centre at Togher Family Centre, of which I am a voluntary board member, although I raise this as a public representative for the constituency. The family centre has for some time been operating a contact centre. There are very few such centres in Ireland and there is considerable desire, as noted in the Minister's parliamentary question response, to see this expanded upon and this was also referenced in the pre-budget submission of the National Women's Council of Ireland. It is important that, where such services are being provided, they are adequately funded.</p>
            <p eId="para_791"> Togher Family Centre began offering the service in 2012 and has gone from 76 hours of access then to 759 hours of access in 2016, and with 671 hours so far this year, it is likely to surpass that level of access. The need for this service is very clear. It has made an enormous contribution to families throughout Cork city and beyond, and has done so largely at the cost of the board and of the centre itself. While there is some staff funding from Tusla for cases of children in care, this will now be on a case-by-case basis, which is not sustainable, and there are other families who require the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_792"> I want to particularly dwell on that point. The Minister will be aware I have received correspondence from a number of practitioners in family law who are very concerned about the fact this service may no longer be available in regard to court referrals. Judge Con O'Leary, a prominent family law judge in Cork, who I believe has written to the Minister, is also concerned about this issue. The key point is that the service has been used productively and in a way that has been of great benefit to families who were referred following family law cases. The current situation is that funding is only available for Tusla referrals. Obviously, that may be the sharp end of the wedge but there is clearly a greater need. This excellent service can offer enormous support to families in trying to rebuild relationships, which is a core aim of what Tusla is about in terms of supporting families, and it can do so in a way that allows for supervised access in great comfort. I should add it is a beautiful facility. While I recognise there is funding for Tusla referrals, the lack of funding for court referrals is a problem and is an issue the Department should address.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Katherine Zappone)<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_793">As the Deputy is aware, Togher Family Centre is a voluntary, community-based project located in the heart of Deanrock estate, Togher, Cork city. The centre is located in a house which has been extended and modified to meet the highest standards of health and safety. I understand the project developed from a long-established, community-based pre-school facility. Togher Family Centre provides services and supports to families and individuals in the Togher area and beyond. These include: early years education, integrated support and early identification of need; family support services; family access services; adult education; and early intervention youth work.</p>
            <p eId="para_794"> The Togher Family Centre provides an excellent service in line with the principles of Tusla's partnership, participation and family support programme. It receives funding from my Department for its early years education under the ECCE scheme. Funding is also provided by my Department, through Cork ETB, for its early intervention youth work. I understand it also receives funding under the school meals programme. Tusla has advised me that it provides annual funding to the centre through the grants register mechanism. The core budget funding in 2017 was €144,060 and this amount has been supplemented recently by an additional amount of €26,000. Tusla has increased the centre's core budget for 2018 to €177,000, which is an increase of almost €33,000 over the core funding provided by Tusla to the centre in 2016 and 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_795"> As one element of the services provided, the centre has developed an access centre, which provides a suitable access facility while mentoring parents and improving parenting practice. The access centre was set up in these new premises with funding from Tusla in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">It prioritises services to its core group of users, those being, the children in care and their families, who are clients of the local south Lee social work department.</p>
            <p eId="para_797"> The family access programme provides a safe, neutral and child-focused setting for children to visit their non-custodial parents. All visits and exchanges take place under the supervision of trained staff. The Togher Family Centre can arrange for supervised access through referrals from the Child and Family Agency. Supported or fully supervised access is offered, depending on the needs of the particular family. I understand that the access centre has experienced considerable demand from the family law courts in recent times and has, where possible, provided supervised access for referrals from the courts, a matter to which the Deputy referred. However, it is important to reiterate that the core work of the centre is focused on referrals from Tusla and it is not always possible for the access centre to satisfy the increased demand from private law referrals.</p>
            <p eId="para_798"> I assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children and the effective functioning of families. We recognise that the dynamics of domestic violence and the safety needs of children and non-abusing parents must be considered in making appropriate and safe arrangements for children's contact with parents in the case of family breakdown.</p>
            <p eId="para_799"> I take this opportunity to advise the Deputy on the provision of child contact facilities generally, a matter that he referred to in terms of the pilot project developed by Barnardos and One Family, which operated a child contact centre from October 2011 to 2013. The pilot served families in private and public law proceedings and operated in three locations in Dublin. The evaluation of the pilot recommended that such centres be rolled out nationally. As to further action, officials from my Department are shortly due to meet officials from the Department of Justice and Equality to discuss the potential for establishing child contact centres on a national basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_800">Under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, the Child and Family Agency has a general duty to provide child care and family support services and may make such provision as it considers necessary or desirable under section 69. This is a perfect example of the type of body that would be considered a family support service.</p>
            <p eId="para_801"> In terms of child contact centres, the Minister stated that the pilots referred to, which were in the Dublin area, related to children in care and-or whose parents were separated. She stated, "The pilot served families in private and public law proceedings and operated in three locations in Dublin." I take it from this that some of the cases that the family centre dealt with following referrals from the Courts Service were the same kinds of case dealt with by the pilot schemes in Dublin. It appears that the evaluation of the pilots was favourable. Will the Minister confirm whether I am correct in saying that? In light of the positive evaluation and the fact that the Minister is looking to roll this out nationally, will she consider it in this context?</p>
            <p eId="para_802"> The court referrals part of the service will probably draw to a close before the end of the year because facilitating it will not be possible in the context of current funding. I understand that a request for funding has been made. Will the Minister consider it? Does she believe that the future of these child contact centres must involve a portion of court-referred cases as well as Tusla's directly referred cases? It is a core part.</p>
            <p eId="para_803"> I should emphasise that this is essentially a regional service. It does not just serve Cork city, but the whole of County Cork and beyond, because there are no other services of its kind in the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_804">I was struck by the fact that one of the objects of the Togher Family Centre's mission is to deliver "exceptional Early Years and Youth Services where the voice of the child is encouraged, heard and respected". This undoubtedly underpinned the development of the access centre, which was innovative. Through Tusla, my Department supported its establishment and additional funding has been provided to it to support its excellent work.</p>
            <p eId="para_805"> Regarding moneys to support services for court referrals to the access centre, which is the specific issue that the Deputy has raised, my colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality and I have an open mind about the positive aspects of the evaluation of the pilot projects. I acknowledge the excellent work being done in the community centre that the Deputy identified. Officials from my Department are meeting officials from the Department of Justice and Equality to discuss the potential for establishing these centres on a national basis. I must wait for recommendations stemming from that meeting or series of meetings before I can make any decision on the centre in question, but we have provided it with additional funding for 2016, 2017 and 2018.</p>

            <p eId="para_806">I acknowledge that the Minister for Education and Skills has attended to take this Topical Issue debate. As he knows, the case of Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna in Knocklyon in my constituency of Dublin South-West dates back more than 20 years. I was elected as a councillor in 1999. A few years later, the question of a permanent site and school became a live issue. Scandalously, the complex and tedious transfer of title - I was involved in that as a councillor - has taken close to 15 years to resolve. To put it in context, four chief executives of South Dublin County Council passed through office in that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_807"> It is important to state that the issue of title is not the Department's fault. Until recently, the Department was reasonably powerless to advance the project of a state-of-the-art school for the pupils of Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna. The complex work has been handled, though.</p>
            <p eId="para_808"> I invite the Minister to visit the existing school and see the conditions in which its pupils, teachers and ancillary staff are housed. It is a tribute and testament to the commitment and vocation of the school's teachers and other staff that education of the highest standard is offered at Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna. They have operated out of prefabs for 21 years. They have had to repair roofs and ceilings as a result of fungal infections. The school has 245 pupils and a toilet facility is shared between 60 of them. As the Minister will have heard in media reports, the water tank freezes in winter, which means that there are no proper bathroom facilities for children. Rain means that no physical education can take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_809"> In 2015, the Government stated that no school would have a prefab for more than two years. Given that a quarter of schools that were due for construction in 2015 are still waiting for work to begin or their projects to go to tender, will the Minister consider fast-tracking this school project as a matter of urgency? In the intervening 15 or 20 years, the building projects at every school within a few square miles of Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna have been completed or are under way. St. Colmcille's, the local community school, has been built and expanded. Sancta Maria College, a local post-primary school, got a brand new building in that time. St. Colmcille's junior and senior national schools, the largest primary school project in the country, were finished some years ago. Firhouse Educate Together got a new school building and the new building for Gaelscoil na Giúise, which arrived on the scene many years after Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna, is under construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">Gaelcoláiste na Phiarsaigh, a post-primary school, has been facilitated locally also and the sod has recently turned at Kingswood community school. The Department is also looking out for a school for Firhouse Educate Together post-primary school and has advanced school projects in Citywest. Does the Minister agree that the almost unique circumstances surrounding the wait for the commencement of this building project, including design and planning, means the process of commencing the project for a new school should start immediately? Will he commit to prioritising the advancement of the school project to ensure that a school of 21st-century standards will be constructed as soon as possible and that the project commencement process will start as soon as he can make it happen?</p>

            <p eId="para_811">I thank Deputy Lahart for raising this. He has more than eloquently outlined the history of Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna, which has been on the Department's six year programme. As he outlined, the Department has been working with South Dublin County Council to acquire the site on which it is currently located in temporary accommodation in order to facilitate the permanent building. Agreement in principle in respect of the proposed acquisition was reached in 2006 and a section 183 disposal to the Department of Education and Skills was approved by South Dublin County Council in February 2007. However, there were title issues with a small portion of the property which needed to be rectified by the council in order for the project to progress. Council officials endeavoured to rectify the title issues on this portion of land over a number of years in order to enable the disposal of the full site. In order to rectify the matter, the council proceeded with a compulsory purchase order process to allow the side acquisition to progress. The order was confirmed in May 2016 and a vesting order was subsequently made, with the land vesting in South Dublin County Council at the end of June 2017. The local authority was then in a position to commence the conveyancing process to convey the site to the Department. Draft contracts in respect of the transfer were received in September and my officials have been liaising with local authority officials with a view to advancing matters since then. While due diligence must apply in relation to the legal site transfer, the Department is not aware of any specific issues at this time which would impede the site acquisition.</p>
            <p eId="para_812"> It is intended to progress the project to architectural planning shortly, with a view to running the design stage in parallel with the completion of the conveyancing process. My Department is working to ensure that a new building for Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna is delivered as soon as possible. Running the design work in parallel will ensure there is no unnecessary delay from now on.</p>

            <p eId="para_813">I welcome those initial comments and the Minister's confirmation that the project will proceed to architectural planning and design stage. Can he provide me with a date as to when the architectural design stage will begin or, if he cannot commit to one now, come back to me in writing? I would be very grateful if he could.</p>
            <p eId="para_814"> Does the Minister agree that it is unacceptable and continues to be a scandal that children are educated in substandard conditions? Does he agree that it is in the interests of justice that every effort is made to fast-track this? I ask if the Minister can commit now or in writing to finding a fast-track route for funding in particular given that some projects for which funding was committed have not even commenced the planning application stage. I assume the Minister's party colleague in the constituency and, indeed, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, have highlighted the importance of the project at party and Cabinet level. How long will it take to get from architectural planning and design stage to the submission of a planning application to South Dublin County Council?</p>

            <p eId="para_815">I confirm that Deputies Colm Brophy and Katherine Zappone have been on to me about this project, the frustration around which I can understand. Its history has been very difficult. It is the Department's intention to initiate architectural planning for the building project in conjunction with the completion of the site acquisition process. That suggests no undue delay will occur. I presume there will be some procedural steps to select a team. I will seek clarification in writing for the Deputy as to exactly what the next steps will be.</p>
            <p eId="para_816"> There is a recognition that we want to move this project along in light of the history and the need in the local area. I will let the Deputy know if there is any additional clarification. I make the point that one can never anticipate in advance if a particular project will be prioritised and completed by a certain date as one does not know what site conditions will be or what planning conditions will be attached. All of these issues may arise which means one can never stand up and say it will be done by a certain date because something will jump out of the ground to prove one wrong. From the Department's point of view, however, this is a priority and we will do our level best to ensure that it runs smoothly from this point on.</p>

            <p eId="para_821">I thank the Acting Chairman and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for giving us permission to raise this matter. It is a cross-party group and one which might not come together on many other subjects. It is appropriate that the Minister for Education and Skills is taking the matter because he will have good knowledge of it also. It is about valuing the work of community employment schemes, as we all do in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_822"> Community employment schemes do superb work the length and breath of this country but they are absolutely dependent on the quality of their supervisors for the skills imparted to participants and the benefit for the community through the sponsor. For many years, supervisors have been left in abeyance in relation to their pension entitlements. In 2008, the Labour Court decided that supervisors should have received pension entitlements and FÁS put aside €10 million to put a pension scheme in place. Since then, however, nothing has happened and supervisors, many of whom have retired, are getting incredibly frustrated and feel completely abandoned by the system. They are being abused in terms of their relationship with the local community which is being exploited by forces unknown which know they will not walk out on their local communities. Their commitment to their schemes, which goes way beyond normal employment hours, is phenomenal but it is not being recognised.</p>
            <p eId="para_823"> I understand that there is a meeting next week of the high-level forum. I also understand that former Deputy, Jack Wall, designed a pathway to a resolution for this, although Deputy Penrose might know more about that. Why have we not proceeded with that pathway and why have we not shown these individuals the respect that we all have for them? Why does the State not show them the respect of rewarding their lifetime effort with a decent pension and a recognition of the benefit they have given to many generations, in some cases, of participants and to their local communities? This is why the cross-party group has come together. There are many other Deputies who would like to be associated with this. The Minister and Deputies Gallagher, McConalogue and Scanlon approached me today. We could have got 159 Deputies to come in behind this. We need it resolved and we want an update from the Minister this evening about next week's meeting.</p>

Critical to the success of community employment schemes nationally are the 1,250 supervisors who manage local projects on a day-to-day basis. These supervisors mentor, identify and source relevant training for participants and encourage progression to the workplace. Their work in all communities cannot be underestimated.</p>
            <p eId="para_825"> Unions representing community employment supervisors took a case to the Labour Court ten years ago seeking the provision of a pension scheme. The Labour Court recommended that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced. Not surprisingly, the workers concerned had a reasonable expectation that a pension scheme would be in place by now. Almost 250 supervisors have since retired with no pension provided. This year, between 30 and 40 supervisors will retire, again with no pension provision in place. After the decision was made, an initial capital sum of €10 million was identified to establish a pension scheme covering the period 2009 to 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">With the economic crash hitting Ireland at the time, the capital sum was then used to address other issues. While Ireland's economic fortunes have greatly improved, the community employment, CE, supervisors recognised the ongoing constraints relating to the country's fiscal position. In this context, they are open to making a contribution to their pensions, despite the fact that the original understanding was the pensions would be provided on a non-contributory basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_827">I commend all the Teachtaí Dála whose names are associated with this matter and the many others who did not have the opportunity to contribute but who support the thrust of the debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_828"> I have met many CE supervisors and assistant supervisors in Waterford on a number of occasions over the years. I also met a national group of supervisors that has been campaigning for justice in this area for years. I imagine the Minister has met that group or is at least aware of its concerns and, therefore, of the background to this matter. He will also be aware that the Labour Court made a recommendation on this issue on 1 May 2008 and the supervisors and assistant supervisors want it implemented. I do not believe that is unreasonable. The supervisors and assistant supervisors have a clear pay link with managers, instructors and administrative staff in community training workshops and they are seeking a defined pension scheme similar to that which applies to these grades. What happened to them was a double injustice. It was complicated by the fact that in December 2007, the Public Service Benchmarking Body did not grant a pay increase to the majority of public servants because of the value it placed on public sector pensions. These supervisors and assistant supervisors received no pay increases at the time, even though they were not in receipt of pensions. They did not receive pay increases on the basis of the assumption that they were in receipt of pensions, which was not the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_829"> The unions accepted that while FÁS was not the direct employer of supervisors and assistant supervisors on CE schemes, because it was the funding agency, they had a claim for a defined benefit scheme. The Labour Court agreed and my simple message to the Minister and the Government is to please implement the Labour Court recommendation, accept the logic and justice of this position and do what is right for these people.</p>

            <p eId="para_830">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving us the opportunity to discuss this matter and I thank Deputy Calleary for organising the debate. I have been involved with a CE scheme since 1988. I recall meeting Mr. Ruairí Quinn, the then Minister for Labour in 1990. There are huge issues with these schemes and I have called for decades for an audit to be done as to their value. As Deputies Calleary, Butler and Cullinane said, the schemes are no good unless they have good, competent supervisors. His or her role has changed fundamentally in the past 30 years. It bears no relation to what it used to be. There are numerous health and safety and other regulations and they have many agencies to deal with. They first have to deal with the voluntary board of directors whom I must salute as well for doing good work. They then have to deal with all the constituency organisations. My local scheme looks after Ballymacarbry, which is in Deputy Butler's constituency, as well as Newcastle and Ballybacon. Everything from graveyards to schools to GAA fields, community alert schemes, home care, a naíonra and a child care facility is looked after in these three parishes and communities. I could go on forever.</p>
            <p eId="para_831"> The supervisor is pulled and dragged every day by this, that and the other, apart from the all the agencies and regulations he or she has to deal with. I respect that this has to be done and that every penny must be accounted for. However, they have been abandoned. Many schemes have been amalgamated and supervisors have lost their jobs but they do not have any pensions. We need to recognise their work and salute them because they are filling in for the county council and the HSE as regards visiting the elderly, providing home help and so on. They are the real champions and 99.9 % of them do a tremendous job. Any of them who do not are weeded out.</p>
            <p eId="para_832"> These people are being abused and misused by the State. They are entitled to some recognition for the valuable service they provide. The most important job they have, especially in these times when there are such mental health issues, is to look after the well-being of all participants on their schemes - and sometimes their families - to ensure that they are in a safe environment where there is no bullying or racism, that the regulations are observed and that the everyday human issues they face are dealt with. Many of them, including our local supervisor, do this diligently. We need to recognise this and not hide behind red tape any more.</p>

            <p eId="para_833">I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the plight of CE supervisors and assistant supervisors who have, notwithstanding the 2008 Labour Court hearing, been denied the import of the recommendation made, which was that an agreed pension scheme would be introduced for them and would be funded by FÁS, the recognised funding agency at the time. I recall meeting supervisors and assistant supervisors from the midland counties and their trade union representative in Rochfortbridge, County Westmeath, two and a half years ago. They were disappointed, angry and annoyed about the failure of the State to engage in a constructive manner in respect of the Labour Court recommendation. The court is an essential part of our industrial relations resolution machinery and they were disappointed, disenchanted and irate that they were being left in the lurch.</p>
            <p eId="para_834"> We are all aware of the importance of CE schemes through the country and the role they play in environmental enhancement and refurbishment in towns and villages. We have all witnessed, as I did in my own village of Ballynacargy, the annual increase in points in the Tidy Towns competition. Much of this arises from the contribution of Tidy Towns associations and the participants in CE schemes who take great pride in their work. CE schemes act as a stepping stone to regular work for some. There are 25,000 participants on schemes currently working with crèches, community halls, GAA and soccer clubs, Meals on Wheels schemes, Tidy Towns association and looking after the maintenance of green areas, as Deputy McGrath said. Critical to the success of the operation of CE are the 1,250 supervisors and assistant supervisors who manage the local projects on a daily basis and ensure the objectives of each scheme are achieved. This involves a plethora of bookkeeping, record-keeping and general management expertise. Since 2008, more than 250 supervisors have retired and, notwithstanding their expectation, no pension scheme or gratuity was provided. The Department is not looking to a create a precedent and a scoping exercise is being explored to see what can be provided but the community sector high-level forum, which was established in 2015 on foot of a recommendation by Mr. Kieran Mulvey, has been an abysmal failure. I understand the most recent meeting on 7 April 2017 broke up in disagreement because it is the equivalent of having talks about talks instead of confronting the issue head on and achieving a just and fair resolution for the supervisors and assistant supervisors. They will all be retired and they will get nothing until they qualify for the old age pension.</p>

            <p eId="para_836">It is unfortunate that the Minister for Finance is not present, particularly in light of the level of interest among Members in this topic. It is unusual that no Minister from the Department of Finance is present and that is regrettable.</p>
            <p eId="para_837"> We are all too well aware of the important twofold role CE plays in supporting people, mainly from disadvantaged areas, to get back into the workforce through providing education and training opportunities and getting them to a point where they are work ready and in providing critical community facilities and services for people - whether they relate to the environment, child care or the elderly - that would not be provided otherwise if CE was not in place. The role of the CE supervisor is critical to the success of all those efforts. It is a challenging and responsible job and we should respect those who do that work.</p>
            <p eId="para_838"> Almost ten years ago, the Labour Court made a clear ruling that these people needed to be treated fairly and have pension provisions made for them in view of the responsible work they do. Subsequently, we had the economic crash and the extraordinary flexibility shown by unions and CE supervisors was exceptionally generous. They recognised that circumstances had changed and there was a need to pull back on that in spite of the fact they had an open-and-shut case, funding had been set aside and a full scoping exercise had been carried out by FÁS. We need a commitment from the Minister, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, regarding the full implementation of the then year old Labour Court ruling. That is why we are here. It is now time to deliver on that undertaking that was made almost ten years ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_839">I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. This is unusual in that I am not sure I have before seen such a consensus across a number of Members of the House on a Topical Issue. I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who is unavoidably unable to be here, but I think people recognise that he is dealing with particular issues of significant urgency at the moment. I am, therefore, taking this matter on his behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_840"> I have seen throughout my fairly lengthy political career the benefit of the role of the community employment, CE, scheme. It has been a huge support for many communities at a time when neither the State nor the commercial sector could fulfil certain needs. It has also been a great opportunity for progression for many of those who participated. It gave them a chance to do useful work as well as access to training and skills. I, therefore, acknowledge the combined support of the House for the work it does.</p>
            <p eId="para_841"> The position is that, following a meeting with the trade unions SIPTU and IMPACT in late 2015, the community sector high level forum, which had ceased operation some years earlier, was reconvened by the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in order to fully examine certain issues pertaining to the community employment sector, having regard to the consequences for costs and precedent. The community sector high level forum is chaired at assistant secretary level by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The membership also includes a number of other Departments, namely, the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Health, Education and Skills and Housing, Planning and Local Government, as well as the agency Pobal and IMPACT and SIPTU, the two unions which represent the community employment scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors.</p>
            <p eId="para_842"> An issue which has been under discussion by the forum relates to community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors who have been seeking, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme. This Labour Court recommendation was issued on 22 July 2008 following a hearing on 11 July 2008 in relation to a claim on behalf of community employment scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors, as supported by their unions. FÁS, the then funder of the community employment schemes, was not a party to the Labour Court hearing on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_843"> At the most recent forum meeting in April of this year, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform outlined its intention to conduct a detailed scoping exercise in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of the issues under consideration. In considering the particular matter referred to, regard must be had to the costs and precedent of such an arrangement, were one to be created. This exercise is currently being progressed and will be completed shortly. The next meeting of the high level forum is on 2 November and the results of the scoping exercise will be made available to all members of the forum on that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_844"> It continues to be the position that State organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and that it is not possible for the State to provide funding for such a scheme. The employees in question are, or were, employees of private companies, notwithstanding the fact that the companies concerned are, or were, reliant on State funding. In considering the matter, regard must be had to costs and the precedent of such an arrangement, were one to be created, given that the individuals employed in that sector are not employed by the State, even if many of the services they provide are funded by the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_845">That is an enormously frustrating response as it is the same response we have been getting for two years now. One, therefore, gets the impression from the response that the forum established by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, has not achieved anything. Deputies have mentioned supervisors who have since retired. The first person to raise this issue with me has passed away - I am sure there are many others - and his family has been left without the benefit of a pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_846"> This weekend last year, the Tánaiste made a statement on a Labour Court recommendation relating to the Garda and referred to "the Government's long-standing respect for the rulings of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State". That is how she defined the Labour Court and its rulings, and properly so, yet, on this occasion, the Government is ignoring the findings of the Labour Court - the independent industrial relations body of last resort of the State. A pathway on how to avoid relativity issues and other issues the Minister has mentioned was laid out but it seems it is being ignored. If we have to come back again on a cross-party basis, we will, but I ask the Minister to communicate to the Minister for Finance and the forum the cross-party support within Dáil Éireann for this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_847">I, too, am extremely disappointed with the answer. The CE supervisors have experienced incredible frustration with the extreme slowness in resolving this situation. They have been extremely frustrated with the time taken to get the high level forum up and running. I understand that the forum met only four times since it was established in 2015. As the Minister is aware, another meeting of the forum will be held on 2 November. It is essential that a clear pathway is identified to finally recognise the Labour Court's recommendation that an agreed pension scheme, which would be funded by the recognised funding agency, should be introduced for the supervisors and assistant supervisors. It is ironic that the Government, which on numerous occasions has laid great store in the need for unions to accept and adhere to Labour Court recommendations, is itself refusing to commit to implementing this particular recommendation.</p>

            <p eId="para_848">The last part of the Minister's response sums up the problem. This does not relate to CE workers alone, although these supervisors are at the heart of this particular Topical Issue. We are increasingly seeing an outsourcing of State work to private companies. These are almost fully grant-supported by the State, yet the terms and conditions of employment for those who work in the companies are different from those of public sector workers. They also do not have the requisite pension entitlements. This is unfair on those workers and they are being penalised. I, too, am concerned about what I am hearing with regard to the high level forum and what might come back from it. The response is pretty much the same to that of the past two and a half years. This response is teeing up a response that there is nothing which can be done as it would create a precedent and the organisations and the State cannot afford to cover the costs. That is the writing on the wall. It is deeply cynical and disappointing. We will await the report but we will be back. The Labour Court recommendation should be implemented in full.</p>

Any one of us who is worth our salt in the community have been impressed by the CE schemes. However, it is a poor relation and is considered cheap labour for the Government. These supervisors need to be supported. Some 250 members have retired since 2010 and many have died, with their families left without any semblance of a pension in recognition of their work. I am not asking but demanding that the Minister for Finance sit up and pay heed to the Labour Court, which has made the decision that they must be supported in some way.</p>
            <p eId="para_851"> Turas Nua, a private company, is one of the new groups tormenting people and driving them to all kinds of distraction. CE organisations nurture them and look after their bodily and mental well-being and look after the communities. Tidy Towns committees and others are of the people, from the people and by the people. They are the very essence of Ireland. Take them out and Ireland will stop because they are running so many institutions, including GAA fields and soccer pitches. They are involved in sport for health and provide all kinds of assistance to people. They are at the front line. Please acknowledge it and do not have us back here on an all-party basis. We will come back on an all-party basis and keep at it until we get due recognition for our excellent team of supervisors.</p>

            <p eId="para_852">It is grossly unfair that those people will be reduced from earning a living to being dependent on social welfare and the old age pension. I have no doubt that, if the Government side engaged constructively with the trade unions, SIPTU and IMPACT, it would find willing partners who would work might and main to get a reasonable resolution that takes cognisance of the issue involved and, in particular, the country's ongoing tight fiscal situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_853"> The Deputy is right that there was a pathway towards dealing with the issue in terms of gratuities, etc., which would be paid, but it would recognise that a precedent would not be set. Let us have a formal commitment to set about implementing the Labour Court recommendation of 2008 and demonstrate that the Government respects the ruling of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort of the State. These supervisors have waited patiently for justice on the issue for the past nine years and we should allow them have it. Let us stop hiding behind the fig leaf that they are not employed by the State. In some local authorities, some CE supervisors did get pensions. Local authorities were in a position to provide them where they were engaged with the local authority. Therefore, let us stop this nonsense and get to the root of the problem. Former Deputy Jack Wall had a pathway to work with Jack O'Connor then. Let us implement that and it would solve the problem.</p>

It represents a very significant departure from standard practice where the Government accepts and adheres to a recommendation of the Labour Court. The Minister is welshing on an earlier agreement. That is the only way to describe it. The principles involved in this were accepted and established in 2008. Bringing in the question of these people not being direct State employees is really a distraction. The ruling was in respect of FÁS needing to provide the funding necessary for the pensions, the successor organisation to FÁS is SOLAS and it should be doing it. The high level forum is not working. It is seen as merely a talking shop and a way of putting this issue on the long finger.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_912">— reaffirm its commitment on the pay cap in place for banks and the ban on bonuses."</p>
          <p eId="para_913">I want the Minister of State to imagine a scenario where he loses his home, the home in which he spent the most precious moments with his family and the home where he has so many happy memories and some not so happy memories, and he loses that home not because of anything he or his family did wrong but because the bank took his money and denied him the ability to pay his mortgage. That is the reality of the issue we are raising tonight regarding the tracker mortgage scandal. This is a human story. It is not a story about account numbers, populations or cohorts of customers. It is about people - real people. It is about the cases of self-harm, the mental stress and anxiety, the lost memories, the things people could not afford to do for so many years, the people who suffered strokes and the families that decided they could have no more children. These are just some of the examples of the real-life consequences people caught up in this scandal have had to deal with over the past ten years or so. It is about the people we represent in this House. The onus is on us to put their interests first - ahead of anybody else. The truth is that thousands of people - an unknown number if truth be told - have been living with this nightmare for up to a decade and longer. The Government cannot compensate them. That is the reality. How can it compensate people for those consequences? It simply cannot do it but what it must do is do its best to right the wrong and make sure they get the justice they deserve. </p>
          <p eId="para_914"> Against that harrowing background, commercial banks in this country have threatened the Central Bank with legal action for doing its job and endeavouring to protect consumers. God knows, the Central Bank could have done better in all of this as well. There is no question about that. As we debate this issue tonight, the stark reality is that at least 75% of the people caught up in this have not got their money back. Their own money has not been repaid to them by the banks that took it from them. That is the situation tonight. With all the hand-wringing and all the tough language from the Government, people are still out of pocket and have not been given their own money. </p>
          <p eId="para_915"> The truth is that the Government has been incredibly slow to wake up to this problem and indeed to its scale. The response today from the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Government is not adequate. The bankers who caused this will sleep well tonight - there is no question about that - but the people whose lives they have devastated in some cases will continue to have sleepless nights because their nightmare continues. That is the reality I want the Minister of State and everyone in government to accept. Looking at all the statements from the banks, the Minister and the Central Bank, I have no confidence that we will not be here this time next year still dealing with the fallout from this issue. The truth is that no deadline has been imposed for the repayment of people's own money. In a statement today, Ulster Bank told us that it could be up to the middle of next year, June 2018, and that is for the customers who have been identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">They are the mortgage customers whose account numbers they have. They know who they are, how long they were overcharged for and how much they have been overcharged by, yet we are being told they may have to wait until next June before they get their own money back.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> The banks' actions have been reprehensible in creating this problem in the first place and in their handling of it over the past ten years or so. The Central Bank has told us as much. The banks have failed to identify customers which the Central Bank knows have been affected by this issue. The Central Bank has told us it had to repeatedly challenge the banks on the scale of redress and compensation to be paid to customers caught up in this. That is the reality. The banks have not been open, transparent or upfront in their dealings in this issue. They have had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, every step of the way to ensure people got their money back. Above all else, what I really want to know is - it is a question for the Central Bank as much as it is for the Minister of State and the Government - will there be accountability at the end of this? Will we ever find out how this scandal happened? I am not so sure we will because the Central Bank has concluded an enforcement investigation into the first part of this which concerned Springboard Mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> The Central Bank found Springboard Mortgages was wrong. It caught it out, reprimanded it and fined it €4.5 million. We might as well be fining ourselves. I do not say that because we own shares in the banks. I say it because it is fining the customers because that is ultimately where fines are collected and paid. In that case, up to €68,000 was taken from individual customers. There has been no individual accountability for it. That is the investigation that has been concluded. If it is a taste of what is to come with the other ten lenders caught up in this, it is just not good enough that at the end of this, we will not know the simple truth. We will not know the answer to the simple question: how did it happen in the first place? I do not believe for a second it was all an accident. I do not believe that all the banks happened to make the same mistake around the same time in a way that cost their customers money but was in the financial interest of the bank. It would stretch the credibility of any person in this country to believe that to be the case and I certainly do not. </p>
          <p eId="para_919"> What could the Minister have done? He could have said today that the Central Bank will be given whatever resources it needs to deal with this, not the paltry 26 people it currently has working on it compared with the 1,000 people it has working across the banking system. The Minister could have said fitness and probity powers would be invoked under the 2010 Act. It is an issue that needs to be addressed. He could have made it clear that in the State banks, in which we have shares, that he is prepared to vote against the reappointment of directors at the next AGM and against their remuneration packages. He could have said that but he did not. The Minister made no comment in his statement about the repossession proceedings that are ongoing for customers still caught up in this. The policy is they are not to be pursued but I do not believe that is happening. The Minister could have said he will introduce legislation for class actions. That has not happened. He could have said there will be a completely independent system of compensation set up at arm's length and completely removed from the banks. That was not said and it is not happening. He could have said that those who lost their homes because of this will be given a replacement house. They have not. He could have put a firm deadline on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> There are so many things I could touch on. There is the prevailing rate issue of the 3.67% customers in AIB and the 3.25% customers in Permanent TSB. That issue needs to be dealt with. There is no mention of the staff working in the banks who are also affected by this. It has been reported there are up to 2,000 in Bank of Ireland. There is no mention of the pre-2006 customers who feel they are being denied justice at this point in time. There is no mention of the customers who have yet to be contacted. It is part of a pattern by the Government. I will revert to that later on but it is part of a pattern of deference to the banking system and the institutions that in recent years have not served us well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jackie Cahill<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_921">The banks cannot be trusted to act honestly or fairly with their customers. If any proof was needed, the tracker mortgage scandal of recent weeks is that proof. However, it is only the latest in a long line of misconduct. Fine Gael, in government since 2011, has allowed the banks to have a veto on family mortgage arrears. The damage to people's health and to families caused by the callous attitude of the banks is immense. Therefore, the removal of a bank veto, which is included in my party's Mortgage Arrears Resolution (Family Home) Bill must be introduced in legislation as quickly as possible. I urge Fine Gael not to try to block or delay it.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> A greater scandal occurred when the banks sold distressed mortgages to predatory vulture funds at a discount price. It was an effort by the banks to offload their responsibility when they clearly know that eviction and resale is the business model of these vulture funds. Vulture funds are operating without regulation, which is unbelievable. A penal stamp duty on the sale of mortgages by the banks to these vulture funds would put manners on both parties and send the vulture funds packing. Deputy Noonan, as Fine Gael Minister for Finance, considered the natural order of things was that vultures should clean the carcass of the recession. That Government had a significant majority with the Labour Party and allowed banks to ride roughshod over the people. The Dáil is a different place since February 2016. This Fine Gael Minister will not be allowed to take the same right-wing attitude when it comes to dealing with the banks. The Dáil will not allow the vulture funds to go on unregulated. The Dáil will not allow the banks to veto efforts to resolve the family mortgage arrears crisis. It will force the banks, kicking and screaming if necessary, to refund the money stolen by them from tracker mortgage customers. It will finally put manners on the banking sector and make it realise it is not outside the law. </p>
          <p eId="para_923"> There are many who say that all the main parties in this House are the same, but it is not so. Between 2011 and 2016, Fine Gael operated a right-wing, conservative, market forces type attitude towards the banks without a murmur from the Labour Party. Since February 2016, my party has put forward a different vision for managing the banking sector, a vision in which the banking sector must be strictly regulated and forced to obey the laws of the land. It must not be allowed to have a veto over the people. Since the banks were bailed out, they have acted in a treacherous way towards this country. The people will judge harshly any party that tries to block the rebooting of the banking sector.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBrowne" eId="spk_408">
          <from>Deputy James Browne<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_924">I thank Deputy McGrath for bringing forward this motion and for his determination in this area. The latest tracker mortgages scandal exposed shocking abuses in the banking sector but few are surprised. The banks all acted against the consumer at the same time and in the same manner. It was clearly not a coincidence but systematic, systemic and designed to stigmatise customers. The Government has until now adopted a hands-off approach and it is inexcusable. The Central Bank and the Department of Finance have been aware of the banks' behaviour over a number of years yet only chose to act after the finance committee gave them no choice. The Government has on occasion suggested it is merely a cultural issue but when one deliberately and wrongly takes someone else's money without his or her consent, it is not a cultural issue, it is simply theft. </p>
          <p eId="para_925"> The banks' reckless and calculated behaviour has endangered lives and caused huge distress to families in Wexford and across the country. I have dealt with constituents who have suffered suicidal ideation as a result of the relentless pressure they have been put under. Up to 30,000 customers have been affected by this. That is 30,000 families and potentially well over 100,000 people. The banks did what they liked while they waged psychological warfare on their victims who were their customers. With this in mind, more needs to be done to help those who have experienced mental ill-health as a result of the actions of financial institutions. In 2011, the Mental Health Commission produced a report entitled The Human Cost. It recommended that financial institution staff receive training on dealing with vulnerable customers. On numerous occasions I asked the Minister for Finance about the implementation of the Mental Health Commission's report. The Minister consistently answered that it was none of his responsibility and consistently refused to give an answer. According to the HSE's national office of suicide prevention, a day-long programme was provided in June 2013 but fast forward four years and there is little sign of any progress. I ask the Minister to ensure it will now become mandatory for the recommendations from the Mental Health Commission to be imposed and that those working at the higher level of financial institutions be given training on how to deal with vulnerable customers.</p>

          <p eId="para_926">What we have seen in recent days is a complete charade with banks trooping into the Department of Finance and effectively pulling the wool over everybody's eyes again. Deputy Michael McGrath is right in saying they will sleep soundly in their beds tonight. Unfortunately, the thousands of people who have been affected by the banks' reprehensible treatment will not sleep soundly and their nightmare will drag on. Let us call it for what it is; we have seen institutional theft on a grand scale being perpetrated for many years with the Government standing idly by.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> Why did the Government not offer a suite of measures to deal with the issue and make the decision makers in the banks personally liable for their decisions? Unfortunately in our clinics through our work as constituency public representatives we have all witnessed the havoc this has wreaked on so many people's lives. Grown people have been crying in our clinics and constituency offices because of the treatment the banks have handed down to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> All we hear is that it is a cultural problem. It is far greater than a cultural problem. There is a serious problem with the State and the Government dealing with white-collar crime. Let us call it what it is, white-collar crime. We saw the collapse of the Anglo Irish Bank trial and the complete abdication of resourcing of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Moreover, the Central Bank does not have the proper powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> The people want to see the Government standing up and being on their side. I compliment our spokesperson and Deputy McGuinness on their work, along with Deputy Pearse Doherty and other members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, who brought it to the fore. It should not be necessary to bring in members of the public and for them to have to detail their experiences at an Oireachtas committee for this issue to be sorted out. We want to see it sorted out in a timely fashion. If it is not sorted out by Christmas, we will need to come back and deal with the suite of measures Deputy Michael McGrath has detailed in tonight's Private Members' motion and make bankers criminally liable and culpable for the decisions they made which have wrecked people's lives.</p>

          <p eId="para_930">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very serious issue. I commend Deputy Michael McGrath on tabling another excellent motion, highlighting the problems nobody seems to be addressing. It is putting untold unnecessary pressure on families and people in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> There is only one word to describe this; it is absolutely outrageous. It is a scandal of the highest level. The banks and bankers have wrecked families' lives and driven them out on the street and they do not appear to give a damn. They have got away with it and we are depending on the Central Bank to hold them to account. We know the Central Bank has failed us in this situation. The people who made the decisions and signed off on this are known and can be found out. What will be done? Will these people be brought to justice? Will they be highlighted? Will they be chased in the way that they chase people who miss one month's repayment on a mortgage or chase businesses to take back their small well-serviced overdrafts? Those businesses have been the lifeblood of the economy over the past ten years and give the Government the money to deliver the front-line services.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> That is what is happening in reality. If we want to go to the Central Bank and pretend everything is good, we are not in the real world. There is a major systemic problem here. It needs to be dealt with and the Government must lead. The tail can no longer wag the dog, as is happening. These people must be brought to account and justice must be done because this is scandalous. Families have been destroyed. I was concerned when I heard the Taoiseach today speak of the Central Bank taking advice from the Central Bank. The Central Bank was the very bank that gave the Government advice last year when Deputy Michael McGrath wanted to introduce a Bill to help put €250 a month into people's pockets which was unfairly taken from them by the commercial banks because the variable interest rate is 1.5 to 1.7 percentage points higher than other European countries. However, the Central Bank advised that we could not do that and the Government resisted it. While I do not like saying it, how can we rely on the Central Bank and perhaps elements within the Government to deal with this comprehensively and get the people properly compensated? It is wrong; it is a scandal.</p>

          <from>Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_933">The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy is in the House. It is regrettable that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is not here. It is also worth noting that not one other Fine Gael Deputy is here to support him on this hugely important issue that impacts on people from all parts of the country. I could not have heard a more compassionate introduction than I heard from Deputy Michael McGrath. I commend him on all his work on the issue. He is right; it is about real people on the ground. I want to talk about some constituents of mine in Kildare South, who have been very seriously impacted by this.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is welcome to the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> One couple, let us call them Tom and Mary, have been waiting for six months for clarification from their bank. They have struggled over the past ten years to pay their mortgage with the repayment at times being more than 50% of their net income. Their level of repayments has hugely impacted on their lives in a very negative way. It has impacted on their work prospects and their mental health. They have small children and often they were two pay packets away from having their home repossessed. They have suffered enough and it is about time the banks were forced to repay the money that was stolen from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> Another young man, Derek, is in a similar situation. He has had practically no disposable income for the past six years. He and his partner have not been able to afford to get married or start a family. He has fallen behind in utility bills and is not able to afford coal or other fuel during the winter. He cannot afford to pay the Revenue Commissioners and has received threats of court action and sheriff repossession. This period has involved stress, worry and ultimately depression for him and his family. There are many more like him and the story gets worse because many have lost their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> Fianna Fáil supports people like Mary, Tom and Derek, who have been denied their contractual rights by banks. We call on all the banks to identify all the customers affected to instantly restore all affected customers to their tracker rates and most importantly to pay redress and compensation to all. This is nothing short of a scam and it is a national scandal. It is illegal and immoral, and we demand action now.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_948">“— introduce a helpline in the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Services Ombudsman to assist bank customers in relation to tracker mortgages; and”</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_949">and replace with:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_950">“— ask the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Services Ombudsman to consider introducing a helpline to assist bank customers in relation to tracker mortgages; and”</p>
          <p eId="para_951">I am coming at this from a funny sort of space. I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach when the matter was raised initially. I compliment the members of the present committee and the equivalent committee in the previous Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_952"> I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for raising this very important issue in the House this evening. As the Taoiseach recently stated in this Chamber, the behaviour of the banks over the tracker mortgage issue has been scandalous. This scandal should never have happened and the Government is determined to ensure that it should not be repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> The Minister for Finance has now met the chief executive officers of the main banks, namely, Bank of Ireland, AIB, Ulster Bank, Permanent TSB and KBC. As Deputies will note, all five banks have now made statements unreservedly apologising for their behaviour. This, however, is very much a belated development and on its own will be worthless.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> The top priority now for the Government is to ensure that all affected customers are identified and crucially, that the wrong is put right through the payment of appropriate redress and compensation. Let me be very clear on behalf of the Government: the time has now come for the banks to move urgently on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> For the record, here is the position after the Minister met the banks. AIB is now committed to the payment of redress and compensation to more than 4,100 of its customers before the end of this year. Bank of Ireland is now committed to the payment of redress and compensation to 4,300 of its customers before the end of this year. Permanent TSB is now committed to the payment of redress and compensation to almost 2,000 customers before the end of this year. Ulster Bank is now committed to the payment of redress and compensation to 1,000 customers before the end of this year. KBC also expects to pay the majority of its almost 500 impacted customers this year. All banks have committed to resolving and completing payments to outstanding impacted accounts in 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">The Government has also determined that a range of follow-up actions must be pursued to ensure banks stand by these commitments. Crucially, they must now actively and constructively engage with the Central Bank and provide all the information required by and within the timelines set by the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_957"> The Minister for Finance has asked the Governor of the Central Bank to provide him with a progress report by December, in particular, on whether the banks have made acceptable and sufficient progress in line with the commitments they announced today. Let me be clear to Members: if banks do not meet their new requirements, other issues will be brought to the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> Turning to the motion before the House this evening, first, I wish to state the Government very much agrees with the sentiment and substance of the motion tabled by Deputy Michael McGrath. While the Government has tabled an amendment to the motion, it is only seeking to make some very small adjustments to the motion; none of these it is suggested will detract in any substantive way from the initial motion. </p>
          <p eId="para_959"> In total, the Government is proposing three minor amendments to the original motion. In indent number one, under the heading "calls on the Central Bank of Ireland to:", the Government proposes to delete the words "the Government" and replace them with the word "it". The purpose of this change is to make clear that the reference is to the Central Bank. It is considered that it would be more appropriate to refer to the Central Bank in this particular context, given that the Central Bank is independent in the performance of its supervisory and regulatory functions in regard to regulated financial service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_960"> The Government is also proposing some minor amendments to both the fourth last and second last indents of the motion. In the fourth last indent, the Government is proposing to replace the current sentence to provide that consideration will be given to strengthening consumer protection laws, if necessary. As Deputies may be aware, the Minister’s recent statement indicates that he has made a formal request under section 6A of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, asking that the Central Bank prepare a report on the current cultures, behaviours and associated risks in the banks. On foot of this report, the Government will consider and determine whether any additional legislative and regulatory changes are needed that would enhance accountability in the banks and ensure customer interests are prioritised. The Government is of the opinion that this will be a better time and context to consider legislative amendments which may better assist the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in fulfilling their roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> The final amendment being proposed by the Government seeks only to recast the motion to request that the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Services Ombudsman consider introducing a helpline to assist bank customers in relation to the tracker mortgage issue. Having regard to their respective independent statutory remits, it is considered that this would be a more appropriate formulation of the understandable desire to help provide more assessable information to impacted, and potentially impacted, tracker mortgage borrowers regarding the status of their complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> While it is important that this House raises and discusses issues of very significant relevance to the public, and in particular on matters which have wrongly and adversely impacted on some households, it is also important to recognise the work the Central Bank has already done during the course of the tracker investigation. Since 2010 the Central Bank has been dealing with mortgage lenders on tracker mortgage-related issues. The Central Bank had identified and pursued issues in relation to transparency with specific lenders regarding their borrowers who opted to switch from a tracker rate or who had a right to revert to a tracker rate after the end of a period where their mortgage rate was fixed. Individual cases were also presented to the Financial Services Ombudsman and that office was making determinations on those cases, some of which were also coming before the courts. Also, due in part to these developments, the matter was coming to greater public attention more generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_963"> Having regard to such developments, the Central Bank issued a public statement in October 2015, which indicated that it had commenced a systems-wide examination of tracker mortgage related issues, which covered, among other things, transparency of communications with and contractual rights of tracker mortgage borrowers. This examination has turned out to be the largest review ever carried out by the Central Bank on its consumer protection side. It covered 15 mortgage lenders - 11 of which it has transpired have issues to address - which may at any time have sold a tracker mortgage product to a consumer borrower, and required the review of over 2 million mortgage accounts. It covers both banks and other regulated lenders and includes lenders who are no longer providing new mortgage credit. It also covers mortgages which have been redeemed or instances of tracker mortgages which have been transferred to another creditor.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> The examination has required all lenders to examine the extent to which they have been meeting not only their contractual obligations to their tracker mortgage customers but also compliance with their obligations under the Central Bank’s consumer protection code and other consumer protection regulatory requirements in their dealings with their customers; in particular in the way material information was or was not provided to their customers to enable them make an informed decision on the options available to them regarding their mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> However, matters are now coming to a head and the process of the payment of compensation by all the banks will now intensify. Nevertheless, what has been clear now for some time is that mortgage customers have been treated disgracefully by mortgage lenders and many of them have incurred considerable loss or even greater harm, in particular those who have either directly or indirectly lost their homes due to these harmful actions by lenders. Sadly, some of the harm done to customers at this point is irreparable. I believe that all parties in the House are in agreement that the banks' behaviour has been completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Michael McGrath, the other Deputies in the House, the members of the Oireachtas joint finance committee and also those people outside this House, who participated in the previous Oireachtas and who are no longer members of the committee, who have over a long period sought to bring this scandal to public attention and to ensure that the harm caused to those many impacted borrowers would be recognised and, as far as possible at this point, put right. This work has demonstrated a high level of public service and for that I thank those members and former Members of the Oireachtas. </p>

          <p eId="para_970">I welcome the motion tabled by Deputy Michael McGrath. I commend him on using his party's Private Members' time to raise this issue. I also would like to move my party's amendment, which would strengthen the motion. It is important that the House would speak with one voice on this issue. The House spoke with one voice on this issue previously. It was on 24 January 2017 when Sinn Féin used its Private Members' time to bring forward a motion on tracker mortgages. At that time we called for a firm deadline to be put in place where everybody affected would be compensated and redressed. That never happened. That motion called for legislation to be introduced that would examine individual accountability within the banks. That never happened. The motion called for many other things to be done that simply did not happen. What happened over that period is that the Central Bank, instead of imposing the firm deadline it originally put in place in terms of the banks, decided to extend it by a year. Nine months ago I sat in that chair and questioned the Taoiseach. I told him he needed to bring in the State-owned banks. I said then that there were more people outside this House who lost their homes than those who were sitting in the Chamber. We could imagine that if one of us had lost our home, far more political attention would be focused on that issue. This is not something the Minister just found out about last week or last month. He has known about this for years and years. His Cabinet colleagues have also known about this for year and years. He, like me, has been getting the letters, as Deputy Michael McGrath and other Deputies have recited in this Chamber, about the hardship and the pain suffered by these people. It was not only about losing their homes as some lost a lot more than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Children lost their childhood. People lost their mental health. Parents are telling us that the additional classes they needed for their child with autism did not happen. Children's development was delayed as a result of this. The Government knew all of this and it did nothing. In 2013 I started questioning the banks about the tracker mortgages. I directly asked the chief executive officer, CEO, of Permanent TSB what was going on with moving customers off tracker mortgages. He looked me in the eye and told me it was not happening. I knew it was because just a couple of weeks earlier, I had sat in the kitchen of personal friends whose home that same bank - that same CEO - tried to take from them. By how much were they in arrears? Less than €400. That is a bank that the Minister's Government owned at the time. Within minutes of seeing their contract documents, it was easy to identify that they should have been on a tracker rate. It said so in black and white: "Special condition No. 6," meaning they would revert back onto a tracker rate after the period of the fixed contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> The Government did nothing. Four years on, that issue is still not addressed. The family had to deal with the internal complaints procedure, listen to people deny what was written in black and white, and had to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman where their case could not be dealt with because the bank the Government owned was appealing a similar decision all the way to the Supreme Court - with no action from the Government. Finally, when the bank held up its hands and said it was wrong and that it had stolen about €30,000 from the family, they were put back onto the wrong rate. The Minister's statement today did not mention that. He was completely silent on the fact that victims of the tracker scandal are being put onto the wrong rates. His statement did not mention that there is inadequate compensation. Does he think it is right or appropriate that people would get compensation in the region of €2,500 to €3,000 who had so much taken from them over a period of six or seven years, along with all the hardship they had to go through and everything that was robbed from them, not just financially but everything else? It is pathetic. The Minister did not even address that with the CEOs of the banks. Nor did he address the question of who made the decisions in the banks. It was pointed out to them by the customers that they were taking the money unlawfully. It was definitely escalated to a higher level and people in senior management definitely made the decision to hold firm. Who is accountable and when is the Government going to hold the individuals accountable?</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> We had the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, going on RTÉ radio today and telling us that on top of the 13,000 known and 7,000 historic cases, there is likely to be another 7,000 cases. When are those individuals going to receive their compensation and redress? Has the Central Bank told the Minister that it is changing its position? Its officials told us in the finance committee that if the banks do not agree to compensate and redress these individuals, the Central Bank will signpost them to the Financial Services Ombudsman or the courts. That is a pathetic response from the Central Bank of Ireland. It has the powers to take the institutions to court and should not be passing the buck and asking individuals, the victims in this case, to take the risk of challenging major financial institutions, some of which are State-owned, through the courts process. I listened to the Minister of State's interview. He said he noted that the banks have met the demands of Government. Was it his demand that, out of 3,500 Ulster Bank customers who are already identified - of whom 2,000 were identified this time last year because they told the finance committee that - some 2,500 would not get any compensation or redress in 2017? Was it his demand that many of them will have to wait until the middle of next year? Is that what he signed up to? For AIB it is expected that there are 450 other customers who have not been identified and who will not get redress or compensation in 2017. It will be up to the end of March 2018 before that issue is sorted. It is the same for the 600 in KBC. How the hell did the Government sign off on that? The banks are playing the Minister for a fool. What has been decided? What is the big action of the Government? The Minister is going to commission two reports. This was the biggest bank robbery in the history of the State. Families and lives were destroyed and the response is not up to the mark.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> We have proposed an amendment to the motion. The Minister needs to get real about this issue. The House needs to speak with one voice on it. We are asking that there be a weekly report on the number of customers who are going to be compensated and given redress. I mean proper compensation. We ask that the Law Reform Commission's report from 2005 be implemented, something I have been raising for quite some time. That means changing the orders of the courts and introducing the legislation that was produced over a decade ago to allow for class actions. There is no doubt that hundreds of victims are going to take the banks to court. They know fine will they are not going to get accountability from Government circles or the Central Bank. Indeed, the Financial Services Ombudsman in previous times also let those customers down. </p>
          <p eId="para_975"> We also want to make sure that the individuals who are restored on the tracker rate are restored at the appropriate rate. Members had an opportunity to speak with one voice last time but unfortunately, the amendment from Fianna Fáil deleted my original motion, which called on the Central Bank, the Garda and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to co-operate with a view to establishing whether individuals and corporate entities could be held accountable for their part in this scandal. That was nine months ago. Maybe the words of the victims will let this House agree that it is now time we got all of the agencies of the State working together to make sure there is individual accountability. One thing is sure, because we will not rest until it happens, and that is the tracker mortgage scandal will be dealt with. However, this scandal will replicate itself in a different guise unless we hold individual bankers accountable. What type of country are we living in, if the Minister or the Government thinks it is okay that bankers stole €500 million from their customers' accounts yet not one of them will go to jail or lose his job?</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> I know the Government has made a political decision. The temple was raised so high that the Government had to be seen to be acting. It pulled the banks in eventually and they told the Minister the timelines for how they are going to deal with this issue, and the Minister accepted that. Most of the information he has put in the public domain today is information we elicited from the banks a month ago. Permanent TSB told the finance committee last month that all of its customers will be restored and compensated before the end of the year. There is no news there. Ulster Bank told us that it will be the middle of next year. Bank of Ireland told us that redress and compensation will begin shortly. We knew Ulster Bank was up and running. Yet the Minister goes on RTÉ and says the Government is accepting that, because of IT problems, 2,500 customers whose accounts, as Deputy Michael McGrath said, the banks have and about whom they therefore know, whose money they are meanwhile unlawfully holding, will not get the money back until 2018. It is not acceptable. I will rest it at that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeadarToibin" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_977">I will raise one case which is useful in respect of what is happening here. A family in County Meath bought two houses in 2006 as part of their plans to provide for their pensions. The mortgage was contractually to revert to a tracker mortgage after two years. In 2008 this did not happen and the bank started to overcharge. The bank charged the family to the tune of €31,000 over the correct amount in that period. The differential on a monthly basis was about €500 extra, or about 37% more than should have been charged.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">The family scrimped and scraped and managed to pay that mortgage from 2008 to 2013 but then the family broke and they went into serious arrears through no fault of their own. The bank threatened the family with receivers and forced them into a sale of those houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> This family comprises four young children. They suffered unimaginable stress and also feared that the family farm would also be forcibly sold. The houses were emptied of their tenants and the sales process was brought through each stage only to be stopped at the final stage because the bank felt that the amount that would be achieved from the sale would not be sufficient to cover the loan. At that point, the bank forced the withdrawal of those sales, the houses were left without tenants and the bank went silent. It made no contact with the family for 18 months. The houses remained empty for two years. Two years of rental income was lost to the family due to the forced sale process being cancelled and the subsequent of silence on the part of the bank. What has happened since? The family has been offered compensation of €3,567 plus some interest with regard to the overcharged amount, bringing the compensation to just over €6,000. The forgone rent in respect of the two houses for two years does not figure for this bank. The nine years of serious stress and anxiety between 2008 and the present day does not figure either.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> This nightmare is not over for this particular family. They are still in arrears as a result of what happened to them. The family recently tried to trade in their old broken-down car for a newer second-hand car but when they tried to get finance for it, they were told they could not get it because they have a bad credit rating because they are in arrears, arrears which they are in through no fault of their own. The family is confused. They do not know whether to follow the appeals process or go to court or what the Government proposes to do to fix their situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> The banks in this State are a law onto themselves. I believe that Fianna Fáil and this Government have overdosed on undue deference to the banks for years. They have maxed out future generations of the Irish people on bank-related debts. The banks are still refusing to deal with tens of thousands of people in mortgage distress. Today, we heard that they are rejecting almost half of the personal insolvency proposals put to them. The Government allowed banks to sell to vulture funds properties that they would not sell at the same price to people living in those houses. It refused to create a public banking sector or to allow the credit unions into the community banking sector. The Government has spoken about a pillar banking system. In reality, what we have is an oligopoly banking system that exists to protect the profits of those particular banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> The Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, mentioned culture. In all of the examples that we have discussed, nobody is being held to account. Not holding people to account creates the culture of unaccountability. This crisis is a function of the culture of unaccountability in the banks. What is really going to hurt people at the back of this latest scandal is the fact that the banks will not pay for this scandal. The people who will pay for it are the same people who are watching this debate, the people who have variable interest rate accounts with the banks. Given the manner in which the Government is proceeding on this matter, it will be variable interest rate account holders and not the shareholders, dividend recipients or staff of the banks who will pay for this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_418">
          <from>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_983">The Labour Party is supporting the Fianna Fáil motion in general but we believe the actions of these now profitable banks needs to be recognised and punished, which the Central Bank will do in part. However, because of the historic losses of the banks, many of them will not pay corporation tax for decades. It was for this reason the banking levy was introduced in 2014 at a rate of €150 million per year. Allied Irish Banks, AIB, and Bank of Ireland will likely record profits of more than €3 billion in 2017. Increasing the total levy to €300 million would be a clear sign that this behaviour will not be tolerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> The Labour Party is also concerned that AIB may have lowballed the number of those impacted, coincidentally in advance of its flotation. We need to know the total number of mortgage accounts impacted. It is clear that the tracker mortgage scandal has caused huge distress to thousands of families across Ireland, with 13,000 customers already identified and that number expected to increase. A total of 102 houses and apartments were repossessed as a fall-out from this scandal, 23 of which were family homes and 79 of which were buy-to-let properties. Simply put, 23 families were put out of their homes as a result of what can be only reasonably be described as malpractice on the part of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_985"> As the Central Bank has made clear, only 25% of those affected have received redress or compensation. The behaviour of Irish banks shows that no significant cultural change has occurred over the past decade. Despite major reforms, Irish banks still do not fear the law or the regulator and they remain contemptuous of customers' rights. While the Minister has spoken to the banks this week, it is simply not good enough that the tracker mortgage scandal is still unresolved. The belief that these type of chats will resolve the issue is misplaced. The Minister has said that he is disappointed and that the banks have let themselves down. Let us be clear - these are not naughty school children, rather they are major businesses that have removed contractual rights from their customers. Some of these institutions are in majority State ownership. This is not acceptable behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> Today, all five banks made statements unreservedly apologising to their customers who have been adversely and shamefully impacted by the tracker mortgage scandal but it has taken years to get to this point. We now need to see full transparency on the part of the banks concerned in regard to the number of customers affected in each case and clear explanations about what happened in those cases and, critically, who was responsible. We also need each institution to provide a schedule as to when customers will be compensated and the specific individual issues resolved. This should be completed by Christmas at the latest. To be clear, everyone affected should have received their compensation by Christmas. Full transparency is essential. </p>
          <p eId="para_987"> It is clear that this behaviour has been endemic across a number of banks but we have yet to be told why it happened. To the outside observer, the pattern of the scandal would indicate an organised conspiracy to remove contractual obligations from customers. In effect, many people were forced to pay more than they should have and at least 23 families have lost their homes. This is tantamount to an organised cartel among most, if not all, of the banks. Competition authorities in Ireland and Europe need to address this matter robustly and to gather the necessary information.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> We are told that the Central Bank is meeting the Garda. If this is so, it can only be because someone suspects that a crime, or crimes, have been committed. If so, it is the first duty of the Central Bank to do all that it can and should do to assist the Garda in carrying out a comprehensive criminal investigation so that any and every wrongdoer is brought to justice. It is our judgment that the banks, which have benefitted from the extraordinary support and benevolence of the taxpayers of this State, have once again perpetrated a gross act of betrayal on the Irish people. As has been said, this is not the first time this House has debated this issue. While many Members of the House have been raising it for many years, it was the bravery of particular mortgage holders who brought it to public attention. The distress they faced, and their bravery in fighting for their rights, must be recognised by this House tonight. It should be a marker in the sand that this type of scandal can never happen again.</p>

          <p eId="para_989">I am sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p>
          <p eId="para_990"> I want to start by quoting from an email I received from a woman named Caitríona. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_991">We fixed our mortgage in August 2007 for three years, and it clearly stated on our fixing contract from Ulster Bank that we had the option of returning to our tracker rate upon the expiry of the fixed period. As happened many others, of course, this was then denied to us in 2010 and Ulster Bank from that point on have overcharged us to the tune of hundreds of euro a month. For example, in 2016 they were charging us 4.1% when our rate ought to have been 0.75% ... Finally, in February this year ... they put us back on the right rate. However, they still are holding on to tens of thousands of euros of our money and our lives are on hold until we know how much of our money they are going to return to us, and when. During the years in question, our two children were born and they are now aged 8 and 6. They have never known a time when we have not been battling with the bank and stressing to the hilt about trying to get our situation resolved. In order to make ends meet during these years: we have taken long term students in to live with us to help pay the bills; we have stopped paying into our pensions ... we poured every single penny of our life savings into the punitively high mortgage in order to bring down our outgoings.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">They have never missed a payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> There are worse situations than that, such as those involving people who have lost their homes. There has been a devastating impact on tens of thousands of people. The Government, the Central Bank and the banks say it is disgraceful, outrageous and a scandal. It is all of those things but it is more than that. It is not just a scandal, it is a scam perpetrated by those at the top of the banks upon their own customers in a very conscious way. Bertolt Brecht said that bank robbery is an initiative of amateurs and that true professionals establish a bank. That is what happened here. It has happened repeatedly in this country over the past several decades. Scams, robberies and cons have been perpetrated by banksters on ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> We are told that the banks are going to apologise and come back and it will all be sorted by Christmas. However, one has to consider what went on. It was not an accident. It was not by accident that the banks all decided at the same time that people would not get the tracker rates to which they were entitled. It was a calculated decision by those at the tops of the banks in order to lower the size of their tracker loan books. It is a decision that must have been taken by senior management and appears to have been taken in a co-ordinated, calculated way that indicates the existence of a cartel or conspiracy between the banks. It points to the need for a criminal investigation into both those aspects. When asked about the seeming cartel nature of what happened, the Central Bank last week said it was a question of culture, that all the banks have the same horrific culture, which they probably do, and therefore all happened upon the scheme at the exact same time. That stretches belief and unless such culture operates by telepathy whereby they all decided to implement this scam at the same time, it raises very serious questions. A criminal investigation into the defrauding, scamming and conning of bank customers is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> We are told it will all be sorted by Christmas but I am sceptical of the good faith of the banks. Members of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach were told by the banks over a year ago that it would all be sorted by Christmas 2016. If the banks can avoid having it sorted, they will.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> The Minister is now threatening to use our ownership of AIB and Permanent TSB, for example, if the banks do not resolve the problem. However, the State owns the banks. The process of reprivatisation should never have been started and should be reversed but the State should use our current ownership of AIB and PTSB, such as it is. The Government must take responsibility. It should clear out the boards of the banks and run them in a very different way, as public utilities for the benefit of society, consumers and ordinary people rather than being run on commercial grounds which lead to this type of scam being perpetrated on their customers and society at large.</p>

          <p eId="para_997">Up to 30,000 families have had their lives irreparably damaged by the criminal greed, misconduct, arrogance and brutality of the banks. People have endured many types of suffering as a result, including anxiety, depression, years and houses lost and relationships put under intolerable strain. This was done by incredibly profitable banks run by obscenely well-paid executives who got huge bonuses, in some cases while the banks were in public ownership. We now get belated apologies, statements and promises. It is too late for that and, in any case, we do not believe them.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> The banks cannot be trusted to deliver. They have made such promises before and have not delivered. Will the redress and compensation that may be paid be adequate? Will it redress the loss and hardships that have been suffered? Will everybody who deserves it get it and will there be consequences for those who imposed this suffering and committed this crime against these families? The answer to almost all of those questions is "probably not" if all the banks are going to have to endure is admonition from the Minister. There needs to be a criminal investigation followed by the prosecution and jailing of those responsible. Nothing less will put manners on these bank robbers or make them believe they will not be able to get away with this in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> We know that because this is not an isolated example. It is part of a long litany of crimes, scandals, misconduct and malpractice by the banks. It is happening now in the equally big scandal involving the obscene interest rates of almost double those available in Europe being charged to variable rate mortgage holders. It is pure extortion and profiteering. Other examples are the rotten treatment of distressed mortgage holders and the suffering that has been imposed upon them and the payment protection insurance scheme and its mis-selling to thousands of people. Before that there was reckless lending to developers and irresponsible lending that landed people in massive debt, upon whose properties the banks then moved in and imposed more suffering on the borrowers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> As Fintan O'Toole pointed out, banking culture in Ireland has been shown to be toxic, rotten and profit-ridden since the DIRT scandal and that has been engendered by the two main political parties in this country. That is the point. When those people wrecked the entire economy, what message was sent by the political establishment? It sent out a message that it would bail out the banks, there would be no consequences for those responsible and as soon as the rest of the country had been made pay for the crimes of the banks and bail them out, the State would reprivatise them. Everything the banks have done to holders of tracker and variable rate mortgages and all the victims of scandals in recent years has been to improve their attractiveness to foreign investors because the Government said from the start it was going to privatise them and Fianna Fáil agreed. Why would banks do anything other than what they did, given that was the message that was sent? If the Minister is serious about this, there should be criminal investigations and prosecutions, caps on variable interest rates for other mortgage holders, a closing of tax loopholes that allow banks to pay no tax whatsoever, the sale of the banks back to the private market should be stopped and some control asserted over them in order that they be in public control and can begin to serve the public interest rather than the greed of their shareholders and executives.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1001">This morning Deputy Healy noted the litany of appalling behaviour by key banks and building societies, including the DIRT scandal, the outrageous insurance and unit trust linked mortgage scandal which many people have now forgotten, the full rescue of AIB by the taxpayer in the 1980s and after 2008 the blanket guarantee of the main Irish banks and building societies after years of totally reckless and greedy behaviour by senior bankers up to September 2008. In recent years we have been grappling with the tracker mortgage scandal and the terrible suffering inflicted on citizens and their families who were deprived of funds of between €500 million and €1 billion in this latest appalling scam.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">Central to this appalling history was the regulatory capture of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator with the acquiescence of leading Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael politicians, including former Taoisigh, Bertie Ahern, Brian Cowen and Deputy Enda Kenny, and particularly in the recent scandal, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> The distinguished journalist Fintan O'Toole recalled yesterday how Mark Hely-Hutchinson, as CEO of Bank of Ireland in the 1980s, tried to implement a code of ethics for his senior staff but when he brought the proposal to the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, he was ignored. This episode showed clearly the huge problem in Irish legislation in regulating banks and bankers and underlies the often repeated comment of constituents that we hear many times that "there is one law for the bankers and another for the rest of us". They are referring, as the Minister knows, to Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942, which was the result of an amendment made in 2004, so both pieces of legislation were passed under Fianna Fáil Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> Section 33AT(1) of the Act outlines the system of administrative sanctions procedure for serious misbehaviour in the banking sector. Part IIIC was inserted into the Central Bank Act 1942 by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004. Section 33AT(1) of Part IIIC provides that no criminal prosecution may be brought against a financial service provider or person concerned in the management of a financial service provider if the prescribed contravention in question has already been the subject of an inquiry under the administrative sanctions procedure which led to the imposition of a monetary penalty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> Like other Deputies pursuing the latest scandal, when I asked the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, last May about this, he told me that where both the administrative sanctions procedure and summary criminal prosecution are available, the Central Bank has the discretion to decide which avenue to pursue. However, he said this does not absolve the Central Bank from the obligation to make a complaint to An Garda Síochána. Deputy Noonan argued that the existence of this legislation effectively means that the "double jeopardy" rule - <i>ne bis in idem</i> - is being applied and declared that he had no intention whatsoever of changing the law. However, it is his refusal and now the current Minister's refusal to bring in serious sanctions that has allowed the current tracker scandal and many other banking scandals to take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> I was recently contacted by a constituent of mine who is in the pre-2006 cohort of AIB customers affected by this scandal. The young family in question entered into a contract with AIB in 2004 for a tracker mortgage. Three years later they decided to fix the mortgage for five years. At the end of the five-year term, in May 2012, they met with AIB officials to discuss their options and were told, like so many others, that tracker mortgages were no longer available and that this rate was no longer an option for them. They were put on a variable rate. This family, like many others, does not know what positive impact, if any, the various announcements the Minister has made, the October update and the guidelines and so on, will have for them. I urge the Minister to address the pre-2006 mortgages in particular.</p>

          <p eId="para_1007">I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling this motion and I welcome the opportunity to make a quick contribution to the debate. It is significant that yesterday it was announced that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, has joined the distinguished Speakers Associates agency of London as an after-dinner speaker at €22,000 a talk. This captures what Fine Gael and to some extent Fianna Fáil - on the occasion of this motion I agree with it - are about, namely, talk and more talk. The banks did this because they got away with it and they knew that the tracker mortgages were good for their customers but not good for the profits of the banks, so they decided they would change that. We hear talk of the culture not having changed. The word is not "culture". That is a misuse of language. What the banks have done is wrong, in my opinion, criminally wrong, and there should be a serious Garda investigation into it. At the very least what we should have from the Government tonight is a serious report from the Central Bank and the Financial Services Ombudsman on what they have found to date, setting out what legislation is necessary if the current law is not strong enough and, if it is strong enough, why it has not been used. However, the Central Bank tells us that moral suasion should ultimately sway the banks to do the right thing and the Financial Services Ombudsman tells us he is very disappointed by the conduct of the banks. These are the banks that we bailed out. We talk about the €64 billion as if it were monopoly money and the blanket bank guarantee on 30 September and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008"> I have one minute left and I would like to use it on behalf of those people who have lost their homes, their health and, on occasion, their lives because of the absolutely criminal behaviour of the banks. A serious question must be answered about the role of the public interest directors on these banks. What are they doing? A serious question must also be asked about the banks themselves, two of which we substantially own. They have done this in our name, but I say clearly that they have not done it in my name. What they have done is criminally wrong. I ask exactly what Sinn Féin has asked. Deputy Pearse Doherty has asked at the very least for a weekly report on the progress being made by the banks. I ask the Minister for a written report on the progress of a Garda investigation into what appears to be out-and-out criminal activity and theft. Not too long ago the Taoiseach, when he was the Minister for Social Protection, ran a campaign on the sides of buses asking people to come forward with information on people cheating the system. Perhaps the Minister could run a similar campaign now on all the buses throughout all the cities for the benefit of those who were excluded from tracker mortgages when they were entitled to them or put on the wrong rates, asking them to come forward. Why does the Minister not run such a campaign if the Government is genuinely serious about tackling what is being wrongly described as "culture"?</p>

          <p eId="para_1009">I commend Deputy Michael McGrath on tabling this motion. We have not one damned thing solved today. Banks have come out apologising. One bank has identified 4,300 overcharged customers, another bank 3,000. The one with 4,300 has said it can solve the matter before Christmas. Another bank has said it will endeavour to find solutions for 1,000 customers before Christmas and that by June 2018 it expects to have this sorted. Now we see who is calling the tune. We see that the banks are doing it the way they like it and that they will give payments of €50,000 to people who have completely lost their houses. Who will be the arbitrator in all this?</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> I believe emergency legislation needs to be introduced. A retired High Court judge should be appointed. If the banks are to decide, that will not solve the matter and will not put things right, including the mental torture these people have gone through. Not alone that, but we also have a major problem when we hear this evening that there are 1,800 bank staff who are also on these trackers who could not open their mouths because they were afraid of losing their jobs. That must be sorted as well. There are also 300,000 more people on variable rates around this country paying exorbitant interest on their mortgages and the banks are still getting away with this. They seem to be calling all the shots and they are not accountable. I firmly believe that if something were going this wrong in any other walk of life, special investigation units would have been called into the sector, and this should have been done already in this case. We need to bring in legislation rapidly to make sure these people are accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> I wish to raise one other matter I have mentioned a few times previously. A person rang me this evening to tell me that a receiver has moved in on a debt of €30,000 and will basically put them out of their land. These people would be able to pay if the debt were sold on at the rate it was sold on to some of these vultures that are now moving in on debts. I ask the Minister to do one other thing. People need a new beginning. We need to put a fund together-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1014">I am sharing my time with Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Mattie McGrath. What is euphemistically known as the banking culture which allowed this scandal to happen is a failure to distinguish right from wrong. It is a failure to distinguish honesty from dishonesty, and ethics is at the core of this issue as well as a lack of standards and a lack of compassion. These are perhaps very old-fashioned ideas but they go beyond sharp practice into the realms of fraud, illegality and persecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">It is an abuse of power - financial power. It is, in fact, financial terrorism. Banks which were on their knees several years ago and were bailed out by the taxpayer have now inflicted this torture on customers, bleeding them dry due to greed and abuse of financial power, inflicting huge human cost, both emotional and physical.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> These were boardroom decisions which have to be implemented by somebody. Where does the Financial Services Union stand on this issue? Were its members involved in applying dishonest boardroom decisions and forcing customers to pay more for their mortgages or sell their homes? The Minister's statement made no reference to accountability, responsibility or criminal liability. Tracker mortgages are not the only issue on which banks abused customers. Many customers were pursued for a residual debt, having sold their property on the insistence of the bank. Many were not informed that such a sale did not clear their debt and they are being pursued for outstanding debt which they cannot clear. To add insult to injury, they are facing the prospect of having this debt sold on to vulture companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> The Minister referred to the Central Bank carrying out the largest review in the history of the State yet the Central Bank did not uncover any financial illegality in this review. I believe the Central Bank and the Department of Finance should consider introducing an alternative banking system, that of a community banking system along the lines of the <i>Sparkasse</i> model which has operated successfully in Germany for many years. This model is locally focused on the community, has low interest rates and is not for shareholder profits, with any profits reinvested back into the community. Why are the Department and the Central Bank so lukewarm on this issue? Is it because they want to protect the dominant position of the banks? There is a responsibility on the Minister to seriously address the community banking issue and embrace it as an alternative model to commercial banks, which are abusing customers repeatedly. A community bank, publicly owned and focused on its community, would have the benefit of supporting the fabric of a community and, if it was based on the post office network, would ensure the survival of that network.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1018">If what happened in this country over the last number of years happened in other jurisdictions, there would be a lot of fire brigades out and a lot of places burnt because people in other countries would not tolerate something like this. It has been happening continuously and is caused by the banking system we have and the bankers we have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> I have a few questions, like other Deputies. When did the last Government get to know about this, given it was highlighted here in the House? What did the last Government do about it when it was highlighted? I believe nothing was done. It is not clear how many mortgage holders are involved and we do not know how many people have lost their homes. We are only getting to know bit by bit, drip by drip. How many families have been separated because of this debacle? When bills and financial troubles come in the door, love is not long going out the window. I can tell the Minister that. How many families have been separated, upset and driven apart forever by this scandal? How many mortgage holders have committed suicide? The banks have been disgraceful in the way they have blackguarded honest, hard-working people. What did the Central Bank do, given it is supposed to be in charge of our banks? It did nothing. Where is the regulator and what was he doing? The last regulator landed us in trouble before this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> Community banking works well in other countries, as Deputy Harty said. Why not consider it here? How do banks propose to compensate people? Will they buy houses for the people who lost their houses wrongly? When will they do this? What amount would compensate their loved ones because of this outrage? Apologies are no good. People have to be brought to task for this. There is no doubt there was collusion between managers and former managers. It was not the bank buildings which orchestrated this criminal policy. Those responsible must be brought to account immediately and the Minister for Justice and Equality has a role to play in this sorry debacle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> The banks have been blackguarding people going back to the early 1980s. Look what they did to the people with foreign bank accounts. They advised people to put their accounts under foreign addresses but the banks then squealed on them, and they were faced with massive bills. I will give one example. A man telephoned me one night when I was coming home along a lonely road, and he said: "Danny, they are looking for £90,000 off me but I will not give it to them." I said to him that he would have to, but what happened? That man committed suicide that night, before morning. He made up his mind that he was not going to give it to them. That is what the banks have been doing and there is no accountability. I am asking the Ministers to do something. They should get the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner to round these people up and bring them to account because they know who they are.</p>

          <p eId="para_1022">Unfortunately, we have all listened to such stories, as have the Ministers. If they had any heart, they would have dealt with this long ago. The Minister announced today what he is going to do and not do. I hope he had a nice time with the bankers and with all the sweet cake he had in the last couple of days. I said yesterday that bank robbers at one time used to come in with guns to rob the banks, and we had Securicor delivering money and it was often attacked, shamefully. Now, the robbers are inside, deep in the caverns, inside in the boardrooms. Our public interest directors are a total waste of space and time. I asked the question of the Minister's predecessor and he would not tell me what their role was. They have no role, only rubbing fat butter into the sow's you know what. That is what they are doing with the banks - tickling them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> In 2008 and 2009 Mr. Jerry Beades of Friends of Banking Ireland and other colleagues came to the finance committee and told it what was going on. Who was sitting on the committee at that time? It was the current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar. However, he stands up here now with a frenzy of despair and crossness, and showing a little bit of anger about what is happening. He knew about it. Deputy Noonan knew about it. They all knew about it but they let it go on and they turned a blind eye until it was exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> We hear of the staff being bullied, in particular the ones who had tracker mortgages. It is disgraceful intimidation, racketeering, call it what you like. The regulator should have been sacked and should have paid back his pension but he walked off. The present regulator is doing nothing. The Central Bank is totally inept and uncaring. In the whole system, there is no regulation to cover banking. We all know that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025"> There is also what is going on down in the courts in regard to the level of repossessions. There is the whole army of receivers and thugs who go out and terrorise people, tearing up their homes due to court orders granted by county registrars who have no role to play, given they are not judges. The genie is out of the bottle. The Ministers have been found out. They should hang their heads in shame. What is being perpetrated on the Irish people is a form of genocide. It is financial terrorism, as Deputy Harty said. It is terrorism, getting phone calls at all hours of the night, like the man Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned, getting threatening letters, intimidation, getting the cold shoulder-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1033"> Until senior decision makers are held personally liable for the decisions they make in the banks, we will not see a change in the culture. There is a really serious problem that keeps on coming up over and over again. This was either a dialogue that was had between the banks, or within the banks, that was essentially a conspiracy to defraud, or else there were 20,000 mistakes. If there were 20,000 mistakes, one would have to question whether these people should be running the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> There is another aspect to this that I would want the Government to look at, namely, the whole area of financial management.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">AIB launched its IPO knowing about the tracker issue. It would have needed to have set aside the money that it would owe in compensation. It ought to have quantified exactly how much that would be. Bank of Ireland is selling shares knowing that the issue of compensation is coming down the line, but it has not set aside any amount. Is there a contingent liability there? One must also question where the accountancy profession was in terms of capturing some of these issues. The same profile of things is happening time and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> Are the banks delaying the sale of houses that were repossessed because of the tracker issue? I would like the Minister to ask them about this. Each bank has to know what its liability is because it would have needed to go through cases file by file to identify those in question. There is no reason that the banks cannot press a button today to repay what was taken out of people's accounts and follow that up with compensation. They have the bank details, so it could be done immediately. They should not leave the most difficult cases for last, but that appears to be what is happening. The more vulnerable people are, the more difficult it is for them to use the law. The law exists, but if people have no money and are under the cosh, they will not be able to find someone to take on a legal case. We must recognise that a collective approach is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037"> I wish to ask about local authorities. If compensation is paid, it may put people beyond the threshold for HAP, rent assistance or inclusion on local authority housing lists. This serious concern must be considered. If someone loses a house and gets €40,000 in compensation, that amount will initially have to be used to pay rent. It is not enough to buy another house and the person's credit profile will be bad. It is important that this issue be considered comprehensively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038"> The banks did this with tracker mortgages because variable interest rates made them money. This happened under the watch of the Department of Finance and the previous Minister for Finance. It was done to ensure that banks returned to profitability, but there is no one in the Chamber - at least, I hope there is not - who would want the recovery of the banks to happen at the expense of making people who were already vulnerable even more so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039"> We have the highest variable rates in the eurozone. This issue also needs to be tackled head on. It has become so expensive for people to service their mortgages that their family finances are often not being spent on some things. At times, this even includes food.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> The naming and shaming of banks is important. One cannot reward good behaviour or punish bad behaviour without specifying who is involved. That specification needs to happen. We should not hold back on saying which banks are bad and which are putting their hands up and tackling the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1041">At lunchtime, the so-called Independent Alliance, including the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Finian McGrath and Halligan, stated that a criminal investigation was needed into the banks at the centre of the tracker mortgage controversy. They also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1042">The allegations of fraud which have been made more than merit a top-level criminal investigation. [...] The time for talking is over. The banks were given plenty of notice that this was a problem they had to solve. Now it is obvious that a criminal investigation is needed to get to the bottom of the scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">They were all over the media at lunchtime. They were on RTÉ television, radio, the newspapers and social media. By mid-afternoon, they had disappeared.

          <p eId="para_1045">They are not here. They have gone into hiding. They have run away and abandoned the people who have been devastated by the banks in this tracker mortgage scandal. Obviously, the Taoiseach has put it up to them and they have backed down. Shame on the Independent Alliance. Shame on the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Halligan and Finian McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> During Leaders' Questions on 5 April, I told the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Enda Kenny, that the tracker mortgage fraud needed to be investigated criminally and that he should send in the Garda fraud squad. I did not have a whistleblower. I just had a healthy suspicion of senior bankers, backed up by the experience of 30 years of banking scandals and rip-offs like the DIRT scandal, the Ansbacher accounts, bogus non-resident accounts and the destruction of this country by the banks during the boom-bust period. Like every other Irish citizen now knows, I knew that the banks and senior bankers had no moral compass.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> This tracker mortgage fraud is a major scandal that requires criminal investigation. In April, I asked the then Taoiseach to make a formal complaint to the Garda and to call in the fraud squad. I told him that any delay in ordering that investigation could lead to the destruction or alteration of relevant records with a view to senior bankers blaming subordinate and junior staff. Shamefully, he refused to call in the Garda or protect the tracker mortgage holders. In fact, he was protecting the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> Six months later, we now see the extent of the massive fraud - 20,000 mortgage holders, 15 banks and €1 billion. It is clear that this scandal involves collusion by the banks in a systematic and widespread fraud. It is a scandal that has to be addressed by a criminal investigation by the Garda. Until and unless senior bankers are made subject to normal criminal fraud law, we will have victims like the tracker mortgage holders time and again.</p>

          <p eId="para_1052">I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath on his work to date and on tabling this motion calling on the banks to identify fully all customers affected by this scandal, restore all affected customers to their tracker rates instantly and pay redress to all victims without further delay. Unfortunately, the lingering sense is that we are not getting the full story. To see the banks putting their own interests ahead of the 23 families that have been made homeless and the 79 buy-to-let properties that have been lost is outrageous. They are putting themselves ahead of the financial and mental strain that families and others have endured. This is an outrageous scandal. The State was to the fore with the banks and implemented the bank guarantee to save them, yet this is their answer. They are financially penalising ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> I have a tracker mortgage. I do not know whether I am on the wrong rate. Like many thousands of others around the country tonight, I am wondering whether I have been wronged for the past 22 years. Unfortunately, the ordinary people who are getting up early in the morning, going to work and trying to pay their mortgages are being financially abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">It is an absolute scandal. This evening, the Minister told us that the banks had admitted to overcharging 14,600 account holders. Nevertheless, the banks have had to be challenged every step of the way to get to this stage. We need and demand a solid explanation as to why 11 institutions acted in precisely the same manner, which beggars belief. It is in no way acceptable that we are here almost two years on with few of those affected having got their own money back. All 14,600 of the account holders we know about require redress and compensation, but only 3,300 have received it to date. The effect of the scandal on mortgage holders lives in incalculable. In many cases, no amount of compensation will be adequate to address the suffering caused to these people, many of whom lost their homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_1055">While it is frightening to read about the scale of the tracker mortgage scandal and the thousands who have been impacted, the human cost that is visible when one scratches away the numbers of euros is so much more frightening. Peoples homes were unjustifiably repossessed and the health of mortgage holders was affected. People delayed having families and their hopes and dreams of a better life were completely dashed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> We have put down this motion to support the thousands of people who were denied tracker mortgages in this banking scandal. We have heard the first-hand accounts at our finance committee meeting and subsequently in the media. Great credit is due to Deputy McGuinness and his committee for raising that. Credit is also due to Deputy Michael McGrath who pursued the issue. It reflects very poorly on the banks, however, that the finance committee had to invite people to appear and bare their souls in an effort to get redress. It also reflects very poorly on the Government's oversight that it did not pick up on or act on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057"> We are hearing different numbers - 13,000, 14,000 and many more. Our motion calls on the banks to identify fully all those people who were impacted by their white collar crime, restore their tracker rates straight away, and to pay compensation and redress without further delay. The banks must ensure that people who lost their homes are adequately housed. There must be accountability. It is essential. The Minister cannot allow those who made deliberate decisions unashamedly to steal people's money month after month and year after year to go unpunished. I ask all Members to support our motion. Tá géarghá déileáil leis an scrios atá déanta ag na bainc maidir leis na morgáistí. Táim ag iarraidh go mbeadh an Rialtas níos gníomhaí agus go dtabharfadh gach éinne tacaíocht don rún. </p>

          <p eId="para_1058">This is not the first time the State has had to respond to wrongdoing by banks. In fact, it is not the first time that the State has had to respond to banks taking money from customers without their permission. We must recognise that there is great fury about this for two reasons. First, many of those who have these mortgages are people who bought their properties at the height of a property market and found it difficult enough to make the payments anyway in the orthodox fashion. Furthermore, fraudulent charges were put atop their ordinary mortgage repayments. The second reason people are so irritated is that banks have got away with too much for too long in this country. Even people with short memories will remember that the banks were bailed out by the State. People with long memories will remember the ICI issue. It is the combination of the vulnerability of the people involved and the repeated behaviour of the banks that is causing so much outrage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> The response of the Central Bank has been far too slow to date and it has been too timid in dealing with the banks. We need a lion tamer but instead we have a shepherd, which brings me to the role of the Government. The Government has been far too tame. I read the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> the other day that the Minister said unless the banks respond to this and get their act together, they will be named. It is of no consequence to the banks that they will be named. The Minister must reflect on the fact that something similar to this happened back in 1998 when National Irish Bank was identified as having overcharged its customers. In response, the Minister for Finance in the then Government went to the High Court and had inspectors appointed. As a result of the appointment of those inspectors, a clear, independent examination by external accountants took place into what was happening in the banks. We got a report in respect of it. We also got those inspectors to ensure there was a proper overview of the compensatory scheme introduced by the banks to ensure that people were given redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> Unfortunately, this is not the most recent example of the failure of banks to fulfil their obligations to society and the State. This morning, the justice committee considered Deputy Michael McGrath's Mortgage Arrears Resolution (Family Home) Bill. Representatives from the Insolvency Service of Ireland attended the committee and informed us that the legislation dealing with personal insolvency which was put in place in 2012 has not resulted in constructive engagement from the banks. It is about time the Minister got tough with the banks and realised they only respond to pressure, not to nice language.</p>

          <p eId="para_1061">In the limited time I have to speak, I commend my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, not alone for bringing this motion before the House tonight, but also for having pursued this issue so vigorously over the last number of years along with a number of other colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062"> I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of the reaction among journalists on social media to his press conference this afternoon. It was one of incredulity to the response of the Government to the actions of the banks. My constituents have already let me know by way of email and text message that they share this incredulity. There are events which change the affairs of men and this is one such occasion in the lifetime of this Dáil. After the crash, it became clear that the banks had been a law unto themselves. The absolute scandal is that they clearly still are and appear to be beyond the reach of the Minister and regulation. The general feeling among journalists on social media is that banks are going to get away with it again. This is journalists not the public. Nothing the Minister said appeared to address that. That contrasts vividly to what I heard as I listened to Sean O'Rourke's radio programme this morning. Paddy O'Gorman, who does such great social service with his vox pops with people coming in and out of the Dublin courts, had an interview on the show with a person facing prosecution, fines and a suspended sentence for failure to pay her television licence fee. She had very justifiable reasons given the circumstances in which she was living in the fact that she was cash-strapped.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> People out there are wondering what has to happen for this Parliament to be sovereign and for the Government to govern with impact. Institutions appear to be beyond the reach of the State and Parliament. What has the Government learned the last decade? People are in disbelief. While the priority for the Government now is resolution and repayment, the priority in future must be to bring the people who made these decisions to account. The citizens of this country have to know that its laws apply equally to every citizen and that every institution is subject to rules and regulation. If those are breached, institutions should not simply be named and made to repay, they should be subject to the law and punished accordingly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1064">The way the banks have dealt with this issue is wrong and it is unacceptable to me. The behaviour that caused this issue was wrong and the behaviour in responding to its resolution has failed to reflect the appreciation the banks should have of the difficulty, hurt, anxiety and trauma caused by their actions to their customers and our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">I am unambiguously sending out the message on behalf of Government and through the statement we made earlier that we will make use of powers and of choices available to us to allow, and to force, this issue to be resolved. During the commentary on this matter over recent days, weeks and beyond, I have heard talk of "cohorts", "consumers" and "citizens", but we are talking about people's lives, which have been affected by this not just, as has been acknowledged by all Deputies, in the context of their financial affairs, which would be bad enough, but also in respect of their health and the well-being of their families who were dealing with difficult times in their lives anyhow and which the entire country was going through at that point. All of this was compounded by the behaviour of our banks in respect of tracker mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066"> The statement I made today, which, of course, the House will evaluate over the coming weeks and months and beyond, is not only to support the Central Bank in its work to ensure its probe into the practices it is investigating can continue and reach a conclusion but also to ensure as this is happening that those customers who deserve to have their money paid back are paid back. What the banks have done today, some of which they have done already, is lay out publicly timelines in respect of repayments, numbers of customers and timings. I wish some of those timings were different. I wish all banks were able to make repayments to their customers, those we represent and serve, with timings that reflected the urgency of this issue, but the banks, with the Central Bank working on this matter, outlined certain times this afternoon. What I will do is hold those banks accountable to those times. They have made commitments on numbers of people and on when this work will be done by, and I have communicated directly to them, particularly to the banks in which the State retains a share, that if certain timeliness are not met and if the Central Bank reports back to me to say that its expectations have not been delivered against, then I will look at options available to me under law, and as a shareholder in a number of them and I will take further action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067"> I would like to emphasise three points regarding the statement I made earlier today. The first relates to the role of the Central Bank in dealing with this matter. The bank is the independent regulator of our banking sector and it is imperative that its role in this process is understood and that its role in the timing and setting of redress is recognised by the Government and, indeed, by the Oireachtas. What I have done with the framework I described today is say that the Central Bank, which is committed to doing this work, will outline by the middle of December if any further customers or families are affected by this issue. It will then communicate its decision on this matter directly to the banks and to me. It is vital that this happens because we know of all those families who have dealt with, and are dealing with, the worry, upset and huge difficulty of this matter. What needs to be confirmed is whether any further families are at risk in this regard. The Central Bank has outlined how this will be done in terms of work it will do by December and further work that may need to be done by March.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068"> The second point I want to outline is options that will be open to me, and powers that are available to me, that I will use if I need to on foot of the advice I will receive from the Central Bank. I outlined three of them in my statement and I will do so again. First, I will look at ensuring, through legislative means if necessary, that there are further requirements on the banks in terms of statements and reports they make back to Government. Second, there are options potentially open to me as an activist shareholder in a number of banks to deal with this matter in terms of resolutions and the consent that banks require of me in respect of matters within their business. The third issues is bankers' pay and future remuneration. These are all issues, the stance on which I will evaluate in the context of whether this matter is resolved and progress made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> This leads to the third point I would like to emphasise, which is the role of culture and attitude in respect of this issue. Culture for me is not a way of getting around the individual role and the individual consequences that people within banks may face. Culture for me is not a way of second-guessing the potential culpability that the Central Bank may establish regarding institutions and individuals. However, this is about the response we must make to where our banking sector and our banks stand now. How we have got to this point is unacceptable, but what is as of much concern to me is where we now stand in the resolution of it. Some banks have responded in a different way to this matter from others, but what is common to all is the time it has taken to resolve the matter, that the fact this issue has arisen in the first place is unacceptable, and that the banks' customers and the people we represent in this House have suffered in a way that I believe to be unacceptable. I have mandated the Central Bank to come back to me with a general assessment not just of this matter, because this has afforded me an opportunity to look at all the matters relating to tracker mortgages and how issues have or have not been dealt with, but also the broader issues associated with this in respect of how our banks currently conduct themselves. That is why that requirement is there and the Central Bank will report back to me and the Government on this matter in the first half of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070"> I acknowledge Deputy Michael McGrath in tabling the motion, Deputy McGuinness as Chairman of the committee that has been looking into this matter, and all the members of the committee, including Deputy Pearse Doherty, who have raised this issue. They have focused, understandably and correctly, on how people feel who have gone through this experience, the difficulty they have had to deal with, and the huge financial distress at times of difficulty. I understand that and I understand what has happened to people who have been wrongfully treated. What I have outlined today is not just words. I believe words have a role when I as Minister for Finance say I do not accept the behaviour of our banks not only in causing this issue but also in resolving this issue. That is not a standard that is acceptable to me. As a shareholder and as a member of Government, this is something that must change further. What I also have done is to have outlined actions in this regard. These are actions that I can only take when the Central Bank, which is the independent regulatory body and which is charged with overseeing the sector, completes its work on the numbers of customers and the action that needs to be taken. The bank sets the policies in this area, but I am clear on the principle relating to this area. People who have been wrongly and unfairly treated, and there are too many, must be treated in a better way. The statement I have made, and the actions I have outlined today, identify how the Government will, I hope, reflect the views of the House on this matter and will support the Central Bank in the resolution of this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1071">I thank my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, for tabling the motion tonight and for relentlessly pursuing the issue, not for a number of weeks or months but for a number of years. In fairness, Deputy Pearse Doherty on the Sinn Féin benches also did so. The reason we are here tonight, however, is that Deputy McGuinness and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach facilitated those who had their money, mental well-being and lives robbed by the banks for the past number of years. Tonight I thank them for their bravery in coming forward with their stories. It is because of their bravery that the Government has belatedly come to deal with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072"> The Minister's statement tonight is despicable. It is so weak and lacks courage and conviction. He spoke about supporting the Central Bank, the regulator, which itself said that it hoped it would bring moral pressure on the banks. The banks do not understand morality. This Government over the past number of years has facilitated the bank every inch of the way. The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, invited the vulture funds to come in and buy property at reduced rates. The insolvency service is framed to suit the banks. The Government is blocking the legislation that would ensure we had fair variable interest rates. The Government facilitated the banks. AIB will make €1.2 billion profit but will not pay any corporation tax for 20 years due to the legislation brought in by the Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> The Minister says to name and shame. We know the banks and the culprits involved. Unless there is accountability and real consequences for those who committed white-collar crime, which is what it is, justice will not be served.</p>

          <p eId="para_1074">Any trust that was starting to be restored in our banking system has been shattered. How did 11 institutions end up doing the exact same thing? Are citizens expected to believe that it is a coincidence? It is quite likely, as people expect, that we will have no evidence to support that suggestion when this process ends. However, it is what people believe and they will always believe it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> These banks put their hands into people's pockets, took their money, kept it in their accounts and, in some cases, repossessed their homes. They put thousands of people under severe financial pressure, resulting in mental and physical stress, illness and the breakdown of families and relationships. It is difficult to see how adequate compensation could ever be offered to any of those people. The State is the largest stakeholder in some of these banks and institutions, yet they have not even owned up to those who are affected. They have not reinstated the tracker mortgages, refunded the money owed, or given compensation. It is difficult to see if there is any remorse whatsoever. </p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> People had to detail their mental anguish in public to get this Government to act. Were it not for the actions of Deputies Michael McGrath and John McGuinness at the committee and in this Chamber, it seems the Government would never have acted. Ministerial reaction to this has been extremely slow. The Ministers were forced to show their hand and the response this evening is quite lethargic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077"> It appears to people that the Government is extremely uncomfortable coming down hard on the banks and the Government will find it hard to shake that perception. </p>
          <p eId="para_1078"> We need accountability. We need people to stand up and be counted and for them to take responsibility for their actions. There must be consequences for those actions. Unless there are consequences at the top for those that instigated these actions, there will be no proper compensation or justice for the people affected.</p>

Last week, the committee heard from a number of people who were wrongly refused mortgage tracker rates by their banks. We heard testimony from people who suffered strokes, nervous breakdown and severe mental anguish over a period of nearly ten years as a result of what can only be described as gross financial criminality on a national scale. People's lives have been permanently damaged in the wake of a scandal which has persisted over many years. Meanwhile, the banks involved have done everything in their power to avoid honouring legal, financial and moral responsibilities. The time for meaningless updates and hollow apologies is long gone. The Government must apply the political pressure needed to ensure that the Central Bank ramps up its efforts at every turn and pursues with venom the 11 institutions which acted in precisely the same manner in relation to this scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080"> The motion calls on the banks to identify all customers affected by the scandal, instantly restore all affected customers to their tracker rates and to pay redress and compensation to all victims without further delay. It calls on the banks to provide adequate housing for those who have lost homes as a result of this scandal. Further, the motion calls on the Government to threaten a vote against the board of directors in each of the banks in which the State has a shareholding. On Tuesday, the Central Bank published its second update in 2017. The number of customers affected now stands at 13,000. Those figures are set to increase, however, and are expected to rise to 20,000. Some experts have speculated that the number could eventually rise to 30,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081"> The effects on mortgage holders living in this situation is incalculable and in many cases no amount of compensation will be enough to allow them to come to terms with the pain and suffering caused. Many have lost their homes and some have lost their lives. The additional stress and suffering caused by the banks' refusal to take responsibility is shocking. If we cannot ensure that these banks provide appropriate redress and compensation and ensure justice for the people who have suffered so badly due to this needless scandal, we must ask serious questions of ourselves as public representatives. Bankers and white-collar criminals who did wrong doing need to be brought to task and justice must be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_1082">I recognise in the Minister the decency and moral compass that he has applied to the issue. However, he is dealing with thieves. These are people who ignore regulation and whom the Central Bank could not control. They are responsible for the deaths of people by suicide. They are responsible for the loss of 100 homes. The figures the Minister gave today do not add up. The number is 14,400 according to the Minister, with only 3,500 being repaid by AIB, which predicts that the numbers in that bank will double. Representatives of KBC came before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and refused to answer the questions. They refused to give us the information. Those from the Central Bank spoke about moral suasion. One cannot impress on the banks anything to do with morals because the culture is so incredible and they have now passed it on to the next generation of bankers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> On 4 July 2013, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan said in answer to Deputy McGrath that the ECB could choose to fly people to Dublin for supervisory purposes in relation to the Bank of Ireland and AIB. He admonished Deputy Pearse Doherty for his genuine and sincere efforts on behalf of the customers affected. </p>
          <p eId="para_1084"> Where is the ECB now? Will the Minister for Finance insist tomorrow morning on each and every bank, at their own expense, appointing an ethical officer who will report regularly to the Central Bank? Given that it does not deliver it, will the Minister take responsibility for customer protection from the Central Bank. It has allowed this to happen. The Central Bank has stood idly by and the Minister would not be here were it not for the testimony of the brave individuals who came forward. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, says that it is a matter for the Central Bank and, in the context of the amendment he has tabled, has taken Government out of it. The Government should stand up and take responsibility. It should be as brave as those who were robbed and had to pour out the details of their lives in public to get their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> The banks in this country have robbed individuals and families of everything they have, including their dignity and their lives. They are the thieves in this question and the Minister, after today, is driving the getaway car for them. Shame on the whole lot of you.</p>

          <p eId="para_1086">I thank every contributor to tonight's debate and acknowledge the work of every member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, led by Deputy McGuinness, Deputy Pearse Doherty and others. The overall message from tonight's debate is that the nightmare has to end for thousands of mortgage customers, many of whom are dealing with this issue and carrying the loss for approximately ten years. I do not trust what the banks are doing. When I consider banks that have already examined the issue, KBC, PermanentTSB and Bank of Ireland examined it prior to the current investigation. Across those banks, more than an additional 6,000 customers have now been found to have been wrongly denied their tracker interest rate or put on the wrong rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">That is the record. That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> The banks are not quaking in their boots tonight following the Minister's statement and intervention. The extra steps the Minister threatened are a puff of smoke. They are not serious enough to deal with this issue. I asked every bank that appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach had it investigated how this happened. If I were the chief executive of a bank that was having to pay €100 million or €200 million I would want to know how it happened. Not one of them has conducted an internal investigation. They say their focus is on correcting the issue and stopping the harm. That is rubbish. They have not looked back because they know how this happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089"> I and my party will stay the course. We will hold the Minister, the Government, the Central Bank and certainly the banks to account. The litmus test of this issue will not just be whether those affected get justice, get their money back and get their compensation immediately but also whether the questions of how this happened in the first place, who is accountable, who is responsible and will they be held responsible, are answered.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1141">The Bill before us deals with a raft of issues, particularly on the farming side where concessions were made which I welcome. As the food industry, our largest industry, and its exports grow apace, fundamental issues face the farming community. I had discussions this morning with Teagasc and I meet others daily. The dairy industry is powering ahead. It has had a successful year but it depends on the global economic markets. There is great price volatility. Commodity prices this year turned out to be better than predicted. However, many commentators say that the tillage industry is under savage pressure. Indications were given to Guinness in the past couple of weeks that it might not be possible to grow the malting barley in Ireland to produce our internationally famous product. That is fundamental to how we view the different components of the agriculture industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142"> I am a beef farmer and the margins are very tight even with the most economical base. That has huge implications for a large area of countryside, particularly the marginal areas where people continue to farm on an off-farm basis. There will be a major shift over the next ten to 15 years because while farmers continue to farm land that their parents derived a full-time income from out of pride the next generation does not have the same pride. They have off-farm income and are not returning to the land. That will lead to people leaving rural Ireland. The former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, set up a beef forum which was a talking shop and has not delivered anything for the farming community or the beef sector. There does not seem to be a clear plan in place for how to protect this industry into the future or to protect those who are willing to get their hands dirty and comply with every single regulation imposed on them to make sure they have a world class product that they can sell in Europe, where the standards are extremely high, or in other parts of the world. My constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is away with a trade delegation this week and I wish him the very best of luck with that. He understands farming and how to protect the small farming units. Many industries in rural Ireland depend on that. The spin-off is enormous. </p>
          <p eId="para_1143"> The pig industry and white meats have moved into huge units. Will the beef industry go the same way? We need a very clear, distinct plan. We have a product we can sell but is the margin being returned to the guy who is willing to work hard, and get his hands dirty to make sure there is a product for people to buy? That is one of the most fundamental issues facing farmers. </p>
          <p eId="para_1144"> How is Ireland going to develop in the next ten, 15 or 20 years as we emerge from recession? The census results from 2011 and 2016 continue to show the east coast growing. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Griffin, comes from a western most part of the country. Are we losing population in those places? How will we ensure the population stays there? We need proper broadband services. There are people doing highly skilled high-tech jobs in remote parts of the country, for example, Ashgrove Engineering on the Mallow to Killarney road or Avonmore Electrical. Their products compete at the highest level in the European Union. They are far away from the ports in Dublin and on the east coast but their motors are servicing the Scottish wind energy industry and are going to the Continent. They are looking to enter markets in France and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">There are people there with fantastic skills who are willing to work and live in those communities. In respect of rural electrification in the 1940s and 1950s and telephone wires to each house in the 1970s and the early 1980s, I was only commenting on rural electrification. We saw the storm last Monday week and the devastation it caused, but by and large the infrastructure that was put in place in the 1940s and 1950s stood the test of time. An awful lot of it withstood the gale-force winds of Storm Ophelia. It was put in with limited resources. Regarding broadband, there was a very coherent plan involving the Vodafone-ESB joint venture to use the infrastructure that is there to bring broadband and fibre-optic cable to every community, no matter how remote, every house and every business because it is fundamental. We will not be able to contain or develop the east coast and have all the industries. If we look at the local elections in 2014 and the boundary changes, we can see that extra seats were given to areas east of Mallow and the seats were taken from areas west because of the population drop. We will not be able to continue or contain the amount of development and we need to look at those places. We have Munster Joinery on the Cork-Kerry border. No planner, IDA official or official in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation or its predecessors would have ever advised anybody to set up a plant of this magnitude in a remote part near Ballydesmond and Knocknagree. In excess of 1,300 people are employed there at the moment. It is delivering all over Ireland and to Great Britain on occasion. It has also broken into the US market. It must be complimented but we must take the blinkers off.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146"> We are going to debate the national planning framework here tomorrow before the public consultation concludes. We need to look at the resources available in rural Ireland and putting basic infrastructure into it to ensure we are looking at this as an alternative and to try to persuade young people in particular to stay in and add to their own communities. The infrastructure is there in terms of schools, social infrastructure and family networks. Young people are working and living in Dublin and have moved to where the employment is. I know families where grandparents get on the train in Mallow or maybe further west in Rathmore and go to Dublin to give a helping hand. That is fine when parents are in their late 60s or early 70s, but in ten or 15 years, will we be left with a part of the country with only aged people and no young people? If we look at places where there have been massive housing developments over the years, the people living there are all of the same age group and go through the cycle of life together. Prior to that, there was huge family support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147"> In respect of the national planning framework, which we will be looking at tomorrow, we must make sure that it is as easy to get planning in rural Ireland as it is in urban areas. Regardless of whether someone is in Cork or any other county, the talk will be about the same difficulties with planning. Between 2008 and 2015, when very little planning was going through, the planning regulations seemed to have been hardened, tightened or made more difficult. People are certainly willing to invest their hard-earned money in communities and build a house of their own. I have seen reasons for refusals of planning such as the applicant not being from the area or he or she had been living outside the country in Australia or elsewhere for one year between 2009 and 2010 and the total did not add up to seven years. They were building on a family landholding and their parents were living in the area. It was all documented. This stipulation regarding someone living continuously in an area is ludicrous. Regarding the regulations relating to settlements and tiny villages, a village with maybe a church, pub and a shop and possibly no detached house but houses scattered in different parts in a cluster is deemed a settlement under the planning regulations. If a person had been living in the village and wanted to move 300 yards either side of where this so-called settlement is marked out on a map, he or she could not do it because it would be deemed to be moving outside an urban area, an area which would have a church, pub, shop and school. That is ludicrous and does not show any imagination in terms of how we implement planning regulations or planning Acts. We must be very careful because every planning application costs thousands of euro. We have situations where people who went to Australia and who have been living there for eight or nine years and now want to come home are being refused because they are not at home. They want to have their planning, build their house and then come home to Ireland but they are refused because they are not physically living in Ireland. That is another ludicrous situation where planners have interpreted matters too severely. They should be more accommodating in terms of how planning permission is granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148"> JobPath, which was developed by the former Department of Social Protection at the height of the recession, is certainly not working. What it is doing in practice is depriving people who are long-term on social welfare of the opportunity to go on a community employment scheme, which is much more beneficial to them. The community employment schemes have been brilliant for communities. We have community employment supervisors throughout the country who should be complimented on the pride they take in their communities, for the amount of work they do in terms of improving the environment people are living in and for engaging with and helping people on the schemes. I have seen the work they do in my area. The JobPath scheme seems to be coming up more and more as a barrier. People go onto JobPath and have one or two interviews and are then debarred from going on a community employment scheme. That must be looked at. During the height of the Celtic tiger, they talked about doing away with the community employment schemes, but those schemes must be looked at fundamentally. They talk about it as a labour activation scheme and trying to get people into the workforce. People are being taken off it at 63 and 64 years of age. They have nowhere to turn to and must be on the dole until they reach pension age. The Government and officials must accept once and for all that community employment has made a massive contribution to our society, be it in urban or rural Ireland. Whatever other schemes are there, the Government must make sure this is developed and maintained, and it must look at the applicants coming off it in their 60s to see if they can stay on the schemes and see out their time. They have enhanced a huge number of small villages and communities throughout the country and have done excellent work in urban Ireland. The question of how we develop it must be looked at very seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149"> I will address two issues in the time left to me. One is the tracker mortgages, which was debated here tonight. There is no doubt it is one of the major issues. There is no politician from any constituency who has not met couples that have been adversely affected by bank decisions over the past two or three years in terms of stifling the information on tracker mortgages. We need to be very clear and firm in how we deal with it. We need to make sure we bring this scandal once and for all to a conclusion. Deputy Michael McGrath put forward a motion tonight and he accepted the amendments tabled by the Government and Sinn Féin. There is room for greater debate. Many Members want to make sure there is proper and lengthy debate about how the scandal came about. In 2008 and 2009 the issue was that the regulations were not strong enough. They were strengthened and the Central Bank was looked at to see if it was fit for purpose. New regulations and international best practice were brought in yet this carried on after all the changes and moral outrage eight or nine years ago. The banks continued to do this and take people off tracker mortgages in the intervening years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150"> Former Deputy Rory O'Hanlon said to me way back that the Finance Act is like an AGM where we review where we are at and the challenges facing us as we go forward. Many families have benefitted extremely well from the family income supplement. However, for those whose employment increased for a specific part of the year, if there is evidence available that it does not represent their average yearly income, the Department should consider that and not just take a payslip that is out of synch with all the other payslips. It should review it thoroughly and properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151"> The Department of Social Protection made a decision some time earlier this year that it was going to do away with the practice of sending out PRSI contribution records. Instead people have to go into the online system to get the records. The Department said it will not send out paper records any more. Many accountants, Deputies and people have been helping people who are approaching 60 or 65 years of age to get their records. The Department is saying people have to go online for this. It is retrograde. I raised it with the Taoiseach last week and I have raised it with the Minister. It has to be changed. The more information people have on their PRSI contributions and the earlier they have it, the better it is for them. The more freely available information they have, the better. The Department is obliged to make sure the citizen has top quality information. To say it is online debars people who are not familiar with computers or who are living in places where there is no broadband. It should be rescinded as a matter of complete urgency because they are entitled to information on what they paid in, what they contributed and whether there are changes they have to make. I ask for that to be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_1157">Beidh deich nóiméad an duine againn. I fully support my colleague in what he said about the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Revenue. People are saying it has to be done online. I do not know whether many Deputies carried back with them the experiences of their clinics and try to apply it in the world of bureaucracy up here. It seems to me there are zealots in the system who think the efficiency of the online system is more important than a person's right to do it the way he or she can and grapple with his or her own affairs. I had a call from my office today saying they could not get social welfare contribution records. What does the Minister of State do when he gets somebody in his office who does not have broadband because he or she lives in the back of the mountain and the Government has not brought broadband there? What about people who do not have a computer and do not know how to work a computer because they are 65, 66 or 67 years of age? That is why they want their records because they are coming up to pension age. We have to set the person up on the system but then we have the information and not them. As the Minister of State knows, despite assurance given to the Ceann Comhairle and letters sent by the Data Protection Commissioner we are still having a fair amount of difficulty getting the system to interact with us on behalf of our constituents. More and more, there are people saying they cannot give us the information because it is confidential even though we got a letter stating that as long as there was reasonable evidence we are acting on behalf of a constituent we should be given the information. The issue has to be dealt with because demanding that people who have no experience of computers do things online has become a new form of terrorism for older people or people who just did not have the skills to learn how to work a computer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158"> I do not know how many Members have ever tried to fill in a tax form. It is hard enough for people to fill in the PAYE tax form. I mainly deal with constituents whose incomes are in the lower bracket. Many do not have any tax liability but they are still required to make a tax return. Most of these would not just have a PAYE income. Many would have a pension and a small farm. Some would have a small PAYE income of maybe €15,000 or €20,000 and a small farm and they have to make a return. There is a 30 page tax form to fill in for these people to prove they have no liability. There are also crinkly little rules in it. I had a rule when I was a Minister that if they were devising a new form in my Department they should go to some section of the Department that had nothing to do with that form and give it to some official in the other side of the Department and see if he or she could fill it in. It was a fair test. If the official could not fill it in, how could ordinary members of the public fill it in? I guarantee the Minister of State that if he took the Revenue forms and went around to public servants, who, like ourselves, deal with paper every day and asked them to fill in the self-employed form, many would throw their hands up in horror and say they cannot. I know I will be told these people should go to an accountant. They will pay €600 proving they have no tax to pay. In many cases, one might have a farm income in the part of the country I live in of €5,000, €6,000 or €7,000. The gross income might not be more than €8,000. If one has a social welfare payment, it is not subject to USC. If the residual income is under €13,000 it is not subject to USC either. Then there are all the rules on PRSI which are quite complicated. Then one has to move on and calculate the income tax in all of this. It is time we simplified the system for the small people. I do not mind if we have a really complicated system for corporate entities or the big people with big incomes and complex lives with pension funds, hedge funds and every other kind of fund. I deal with ordinary people. Some 80% of the people in this country are on small incomes. We have made a hugely complicated system. When we introduced the USC during the crisis it was supposed to be a temporary tax. I fundamentally disagree with it as I did at that stage even though I was in Government. We had to introduce it to take money in fast. The concept of a three tax system is wrong. The USC can be eliminated quite simply by replacing it with adjustments to income tax and PRSI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">There is no technical difficulty in doing it, but the ordinary person does not have a clue as to what they owe and why they owe it. I bet if we had a question-and-answer session we would find many educated people here, who are doing clinics and everything, but would not be able to answer all the questions either. It would be great fun to have a pub quiz on this with only Deputies allowed in. We would then see how much they know about the low end. We will only talk about people earning under €40,000 and we will see how smart people are at dealing with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160"> We were part of this, the present Government is part of it and the system is very keen on it. They hate one-income families and tax them highly. In reality most couples with children at some stage are one-income families. They may not be at the beginning. They might be for three, four, five, seven, ten or 12 years and then they go back working. I accept that most of them work at times or they have a very small subsidiary income. The €1,000 or €1,100 does not compensate for the loss. Even this year it is interesting that with regard to the €750 on the band, the two-income family gets the €750 twice on the band, which divided by five is €150. Yet it is €100 for the one-income family. Therefore the two-income family is again winning.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161"> Two families could be earning €70,000, one with twice €35,000 and the other with one income of €70,000. The Minister of State can get out his pen and paper to calculate the difference of the tax they pay. If it goes to €80,000 it gets much worse. The one income of €80,000 pays much more than the two on €40,000. There are the two PRSI allowances as compared with one. In addition, the one-income family will pay much more USC than the two-income family because the two-income one will get double the amount at 2%, double the amount at 4.5% and so on, and therefore pay much less USC. When the figures are stacked up the difference between two families with the same overall income is staggering. We must remember that most families end up in the one-income phase at some time in their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162"> It also works negatively against people with disabilities. In many families that have a child with a disability, one parent will have to give up work and they are hugely penalised in the tax system.</p>

          <p eId="para_1165">We made another retrograde move in the past 15 years. Again for some reason the system has this absolute hatred of people who own their own houses. They all want us to live in rented flats at the top of towers. There would be many different companies charging us massive fees and we would never really own the place where we live. The Government abolished mortgage interest relief. Only that Fianna Fáil saved the relief it would be gone. It is only temporarily reprieved. The death sentence is just commuted, not abolished.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166"> We got rid of the first-time buyer's grant. It is interesting to ask ourselves one simple question.

Did they actually own their houses and was it to the benefit of what we were doing?</p>

          <p eId="para_1170">Deputy Ó Cuív lent me his pen and the Ceann Comhairle acted as witness to the return of the said ballpoint. These are cherished items.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171"> I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. We had the director of the Office of Budgetary Oversight in today. I am sure the officials will be interested. They have probably read the director's report at this stage. They should not say they have or else they will completely steal my thunder. There were some interesting observations from the office. No more than the novel aspects of your election, a Cheann Comhairle, in this Dáil, the Office of Budgetary Oversight is a new departure. The director is already demonstrating an independence and objectivity. Her comments on the budget as produced by the Government were interesting and I will advert to some of them briefly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172"> The Government outlined a number of areas of spending and where it proposes to raise revenue in order to cover that spending. Even on the night of the budget, the stamp duty on non-residential property transactions raised a few queries from Deputies, particularly those representing farming interests. The Government expects to raise about €376 million in 2018. The Office of Budgetary Oversight suggests that this is a static estimate and there can be behavioural change as a result of the change in policy to be expected in response to that tax increase. It also points out that any exemptions introduced would reduce the expected yield. The officials and the Minister may have to revise the anticipated revenue from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173"> Deputy Ó Cuív already covered the issue of mortgage interest relief. It is relief that is often taken for granted by householders. It will be tapered out. Thanks to those who negotiated the supply and confidence agreement on this side of the House, that has been rescued in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174"> Another revenue-raising measure the Minister for Finance referred to on budget day was the introduction of a sugar tax and the increase in excise duty on tobacco. The director of the Office of Budgetary Oversight had a few comments to make on this given that the figures are so critical to paying for the increased spending announced in the budget. She outlined how the increase in tobacco excise duty could actually reduce revenue by up to €40 million owing to behavioural change. Have departmental officials factored that in?</p>
          <p eId="para_1175"> When the Minister appeared before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I asked him if he was a consumer of fizzy drinks. I think he might have missed the point. I can understand the justification for putting a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks. The budgetary oversight director points out what is blindingly obvious to anybody, which is that the estimate of the revenue to be raised by the new sugar-sweetened drinks tax is difficult to assess as it is a new tax and there will likely be a behavioural response to the introduction of that new tax. Has that been factored in? Of course, there is no tax on the alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176"> On the fiscal space and the discretionary measures, the budgetary office suggests that in the interests of proper planning and management consideration could be given in future budgets to having some contingency built into budgetary numbers. There is no space either side of the fiscal space in this budget. There is no wriggle room.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177"> That feeds back to the last point I made. I speak as a layman. I am not a financial expert by any means. The tax-raising measures may not meet the targets the Minister has set. The Office of Budgetary Oversight also highlights that if the rate of increase of staff numbers in the public service continues at 3%, there will be consequences on expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178"> There are some practical points on the presentation of the budget. One of the reasons I am bringing this to the floor of the House is that it can get lost in committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">This point relates to budget transparency. The director of the budgetary office suggests that one way of improving parliamentary engagement with the budget process, in other words, improving budgetary scrutiny and accountability, is the simplification of the presentation of complex budget information. I for one echo the director's call for that. She goes on to say that in the context of achieving a more effective level of parliamentary engagement, the budget documentation presented on budget day is unduly lengthy and complex. The final point she outlines is that the information presented within the core 300 pages of the budget is not always set out in a transparent manner and greater emphasis could be placed on presenting the most relevant information in a way which is easier to navigate. That is coming from the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. It has taken three quarters of my speaking time to outline this issue but it is important. It is also important that this information is fed back and I know the Minister of State will get it in a report. I know that the office engages with the Minister, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. It is important this is put on record in the context of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180"> I now have fewer than three minutes to talk about some issues close to home and from a constituency perspective. I was in the environs of this House, although not a Member of it, for a number of years when debates on the Finance Bill, some might say, went on for weeks. I do not welcome the guillotining of the debate because there is much to be said and sometimes it is the only opportunity Deputies get to raise particular issues. I will raise a few issues with the Minister of State. One comment I have heard from families who are not in receipt of social welfare is that 1 September, the first day back to school, has become the new Christmas for many families in terms of the expenditure they face in buying school uniforms, school books and materials for school projects. Many people have said that provisions in this regard should be available to a wider range of people and not only people who are availing of social welfare payments. Families who are fortunate enough to afford a holiday head straight back into the back to school season and it is incredibly onerously expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181"> Another matter that has been close to my heart for a number of years is the apprenticeship programme. There are 285,000 students in third level institutions in this country but only 11,500 are apprentices. When Mr. Coffey from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council appeared before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight he said that with unemployment at 5%, there are very few trades left within that 5% cohort. There could have been engagement in terms of those programmes three or four years ago and those apprentices would be graduating now, having come through the programmes. They would be available to build the houses we need to build and engage in the construction programmes we need construct.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> I could spend an hour speaking about transport. Major work needs to be done in the area of transport. I am not enthralled by some of the measures provided because they are not being addressed in the budget with sufficient urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183"> As my party's spokesperson for Dublin, I want to highlight the area of tourism and the different attitude of the Government towards tourism and agriculture. It can be seen in the research and development spend of both Departments. If we consider the research and development spend in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, under one of the headings, it is close to €350 million odd and yet during the crash and recession the most resilient product we had in this country was tourism. It was incredibly resilient and we still failed to invest significant amounts in it. Only small amounts were invested in research and development in tourism as an economic product for the country. I agree with what Deputy Ó Cuív said about JobPath.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184"> In terms of our two-tier recovery, a cohort of people are doing well but the Government needs to be aware that there are many people who manage quite okay from month to month but if an unexpected bill arrives, if the fridge breaks down or the car needs a service that the family was not anticipating, it causes havoc in the family finances. We need to take any measures we can to ensure future budgets, like the last two, are progressive and that we do not have regressive budgets like those we had for the previous five years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DessieEllis" eId="spk_466">
          <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1185">Táim an-bhuíoch deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille seo. It is not hard to conclude that we are in an escalating housing and homeless crisis. Effectively, we have an emergency crisis. We are at a point where it is now out of control. The figures speak for themselves. Almost 92,000 families are on the social housing list, which does not include the close to 9,000 housing assistance payment tenancies up to the second quarter of 2017. There is a record number of homeless people. There are more than 5,000 homeless adults and 3,048 children accessing emergency accommodation in the State. Some 46% of all homeless people are under 24 years of age. The statistics, dramatic as they are, do not convey each personal tragedy. Each individual has a personal story of anguish and despair. Behind each of these figures is a father, a mother, a child or a family or an individual who have been failed by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186"> The most effective way to address the housing crisis is to increase the housing supply. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government currently calculates its housing completion statistics using connections to the ESB network. However, concerns have been raised about the level of accuracy of those figures. When set against other data sets such as stamp duty transactions, building completion certificates and building energy regulation certificates, the Department's figures appear significantly inflated. Central Statistics Office, CSO, statistics confirm that there is a problem with the accuracy of the Government's housing completion figures. These figures get skewed when, for example, a house has been empty for more than two years and the owner must apply for a new ESB connection. This can result in vacant units, refurbished homes and other existing empty properties being classified within the new housing completion figures, thus distorting the true housing completion rates. The figures for completion rates issued by the Department could in reality be exaggerated by more than 50%. However, the Government continues to use ESB connection data as a means of measuring housing completion rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187"> The Minister has proposed that 3,800 new social and affordable housing units will be built in 2018. These houses will be built by local authorities and approved housing bodies. However, this will not go anywhere near addressing the current escalating housing and homeless crisis. </p>
          <p eId="para_1188"> Sinn Féin in our submission to the review of Rebuilding Ireland proposed more realistic figures to meet housing requirements. We proposed 10,000 new social houses to be built each year, amounting to 50,000 over a five-year period. We showed that this can be done and financed in our alternative budget. In addition, we believe that the Government should abandon the expensive use of public private partnerships, joint ventures and so on to develop mixed tenure estates and regeneration projects on public land. Such estates should include social and affordable housing, rentable and affordable based on need. They should also have the associated social and economic amenities in parallel with any new housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189"> This Government and previous Governments have placed far too much reliance on the private sector. This has led to increased rents and a shortage of long-term rental accommodation. People are finding it increasingly difficult to find rental property and when they do, the rents are often exorbitant. We hear stories each day of how even professionals and families with two incomes are finding it a struggle to pay the rent or even to save money. Many rental properties are beyond the reach of low income families, including those in receipt of the housing assistance payment. That is why Sinn Féin has argued for the introduction of rent controls or, to use the new buzzword we now hear mentioned, "rent certainty". This should be based on the consumer price index and tied to inflation, and not the pressure zone system that the Government now has in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190"> Sinn Féin believes that the provision of affordable housing for average income earners should be a priority for this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">Various schemes rolled out by the Government such as the affordable rental scheme have yet to be developed, while others such as the help-to-buy scheme only pushed up housing prices. The planning rebate scheme and the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, have also proved unsuccessful at delivering affordable rental or purchase housing. Sinn Féin has continually argued that affordable rental homes could be provided through existing vacant housing stock. As long as the Government continues to adhere to deeply flawed policies and housing plans, remains over-reliant on the private sector to deliver social housing solutions, and does not provide adequate resources or funding, we will always have a housing and homelessness crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> The disastrous changing of our planning laws, whereby under Part V we now get 10% of any new scheme instead of the previous 10% social and 10% affordable, has had a hugely negative impact on the delivery of social housing. It was a disaster and should never have happened. We should have left it at 20%. It just never made any sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> We do not even have a senior citizens scheme in Dublin City Council. The schemes were open to financial contributions from people. They would give up their house and in return they might have to pay the council a third or a quarter of the money depending on their age. That is another means of getting more money. We are talking about finances. It is also a means to contribute towards new housing and should be ring-fenced for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194"> The mortgage-to-rent scheme has delivered fewer than 200 units. What a disaster. It could have been very effective but it has not been pushed by the Government for various reasons. On vacant homes and businesses, all we have seen is empty places left, right and centre throughout the country - businesses newly built in the so-called Celtic tiger era. We have seen them everywhere across the city and the country. The wider use of co-operative housing using local authority lands should be pushed harder. We should be looking at building bigger schemes. This thing of doing small infills is every bit as costly and the whole process is every bit as tedious as going through four, five or six houses in one scheme. We should be looking at increasing the sizes in the local authority areas. Co-operative organisations such as Ó Cualann in Ballymun are examples of how we could use more co-operative housing at a lower price. We can use the structural funds which have been put aside to start using those lands. It is very important that this is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> There are enough resources to tackle housing and health in this country, the two main areas in which we are failing abysmally. It is not all down to money, however. It is also down to ideology and choices. Money obviously comes into it. It is how we get that money and our approach that form the question. We should also be outlawing the hoarding of land. This practice has set prices at a very high level and we need to stop it. More use should be made of the funds NAMA has raised. We have all met credit unions that have money available. I do not know why we have not figured out a way they could supply the funding that we badly need. The European Structural Fund is available as well as the finance agencies from which we can borrow at low rates. There is no excuse for not being able to raise money on the basis of the housing stock many local authorities have, similar to what is done with the voluntary housing bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196"> This housing crisis could have been resolved. There is no doubt that with the right will and the right mind, it could have been resolved. The budget and the ideology behind it have given senior citizens a rise of €5 instead of looking at the health system or the housing or transport issues, or looking at the structural funding that is required to try to improve life for everyone. We should be looking at that but this is down to mindset in many cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_1200">It does not. Time is flying. I remember the first Fine Gael budget in 2011. It was certainly a very different time overall for the country. That is not to say we do not have our challenges and problems at the moment; we absolutely do. It is remarkable how far we have come over the past seven years. Long may it continue. We have a long way to go yet. It is not really until every citizen in the country feels the benefit of the improved overall situation that we will be able to say we have come out of the terrible crash that we encountered. In 2011, 2012 and 2013 there were huge negative adjustments to be made and it is brilliant to be in a position not to have to make those cuts and to be able to expand in certain areas. The balanced budget has obvious benefits for the citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201"> I refer to the areas in which I have responsibility, namely, tourism and sport. I am glad to say that we have had some excellent outcomes in both areas in this budget. On the tourism side, we are seeing record figures this year on the back of record figures for 2016 and previous years. That did not happen by accident. When we look back six or seven years, the tourism industry was in a very poor place. That happened for a number of reasons. We lost our competitiveness during the mid-2000s and failed to regain it for a number of years. One of the key catalysts to getting our tourism industry back on its feet again was introducing the 9% VAT rate for certain tourism and hospitality services in the mini-budget of May 2011. That has been a major contributor to the growth levels we have seen in tourism over recent years and has been one of the most pro-rural policies implemented by any Government in the history of the State as it has got into every community in the country. There are critics of the rate. The main criticism is levelled at hotels in Dublin that are benefiting from it and that are, in some cases, charging more than what they should be. I look at the search engines daily to see the prices that are being charged in various parts of the country. The difference is amazing between Dublin and other parts of the country, even at this time of year in the shoulder months, as are the prices that are being charged by certain hotels that are very modest in terms of standards but not in terms of price.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">One can get excellent value for money in many parts of the country. While there is value to be had in Dublin, prices remain a problem. As a country, we risk huge reputational damage to our tourism product and offering unless this matter is addressed. Reverting to the 13.5% VAT rate is not the answer. An increase in the rate would only be passed on to the consumer and further erode our ability to compete internationally. Some have argued that the 9% VAT rate has done its job. I make the argument that while it has done so, it has a huge role to play into the future. It was the kick-start we needed in 2011, but it is still a vital lifeline for many enterprises throughout the country, particularly in rural areas off the beaten track. For many enterprises, it is the difference between survival and going under during the many months of the year when they do not experience the seasonality that might be experienced in larger urban centres. I have been very vociferous on this issue and I am prepared to defend it because the sins of a few cannot be rectified by adversely affecting the many, which is what I believe a change in the 9% rate would have done. It is welcome that the 9% rate has been retained and that the Government has recognised that it is a pro-business, pro-tourism, pro-growth, pro-jobs measure and, particularly, a pro-regional rural policy. I know that for many enterprises along the western seaboard or the midlands the 9% VAT rate is vitally important. As I said, I am glad that it has been retained. As far as I can see, there is no appetite within the Government to change it in the foreseeable future. </p>
          <p eId="para_1203"> Prior to the announcement of the budget, it was rumoured that the 9% VAT rate was to be increased to 10%. Any such change would be detrimental to the tourism industry. Also, to make that change in a budget with immediate effect would create huge difficulties for businesses because in many cases tour operators and those booking conferences and weddings which account for a huge amount of business in the hospitality sector book 18 months to two years in advance and prices are agreed. Had the VAT rate been changed it would have created a huge difficulty and poor sentiment between customers and business providers, of which we need to be cognisant also.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204"> I welcome the increase in funding for Tourism Ireland to market the country abroad. The CSO figures produced yesterday show a very healthy increase of 3% in visitor numbers in the first nine months of the year. The work of Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland is important and effective. I acknowledge that the level of funding in this area is not sufficient. We could always do with more, particularly in the context of the UK market where we are experiencing difficulties in bringing visitors to Ireland. One could point to the reason for this being the fluctuation in the currency exchange rate and thus the reduced spending power of people coming here. That said, the marketing power of Tourism Ireland in the United Kingdom versus its competitors, VisitBritain and its Scottish and Welsh counterparts, is seriously reduced and in a much poorer place. Our ability to access television advertising is also seriously diminished and this issue needs to be urgently addressed if there is to be a halt to the reduction in visitor numbers from the United Kingdom and an increase in same. Online, print and modern methods of advertising are important but television advertising enables one's message to be sold in a very effect way. Unfortunately, we are currently not able to do that in the United Kingdom. I would certainly like to have some more funding in that regard. However, I welcome the additional €2 million provided. Coupled with the stimulus that is the retention of the 9% VAT rate which is worth hundreds of millions of euro, it is critically important. Not to be all doom and gloom, visitor numbers from North America are soaring, while visitor numbers from Australia, mainland Europe and the rest of the world are, thankfully, very strong. I compliment those working in the agencies for the great work they are doing on these fronts. I was recently in London to meet Tourism Ireland. Since taking up this portfolio I have been to London twice to meet it to discuss various issues. We have excellent people working in our agencies, whom I compliment on the work they are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205"> I also welcome the increase provided for in the budget in capital expenditure in the tourism area. There is now money available to invest in developing the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East. The roll-out of the Wild Atlantic Way was a positive development for the country. Even though it runs from Malin Head to Kinsale, along the western seaboard, areas in close proximity also benefit. Following on from the progress being made as a result of the roll-out of the Wild Atlantic Way, the decision to roll out Ireland's Ancient East was further progress. It is only getting started. It should be borne in mind that a couple of years ago we did not have the Wild Atlantic Way. We had the Atlantic, the wilderness and many ways, but we did not put them all together. Often the small ideas are best. Following on from the roll-out of the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East is a positive development. I recently had the pleasure of attending the launch of the Munster Vales initiative in Lismore Castle in County Waterford. This initiative is a coming together of the region within Ireland's Ancient East to market that part of the country. Included in the initiative are parts of east Limerick, Cork, south Tipperary and Waterford. It is an excellent initiative. The branding of this area is very strong. There is a huge offering, particularly of activities. For example, the Dungarvan greenway forms part of the Munster Vales brand. In terms of improvements in the regions, we need to see more of this happening. </p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> I welcome the additional €2 million provided for the Lakelands initiative in the midlands and northern midlands. This will pay dividends for the people living in these areas. There are 230,000 people directly employed in tourism. It is often forgotten that these 230,000 individuals and families are supported by these jobs. My family depended on employment in tourism. My father was a hotel porter for 36 years, prior to which he worked in a particular hotel in Killarney for two years. He also worked on the film "Ryan's Daughter" which put the Dingle Peninsula on the map.</p>

          <p eId="para_1208">He was a driver. He did take part in the audition process. He left the acting to his son. As I said, he worked in the industry for almost 40 years and our family benefited hugely from that income from it. I have three brothers. We all got to go to college and progress in life, in part because of that income. The 230,000 people employed in tourism are just like my family. They all individually have hopes, dreams and aspirations. The tourism industry provides a huge chunk of employment in the country. We need to ensure the growth will continue but in a way that is sustainable and beneficial to all communities, society and the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">I was in Scattery Island in County Clare yesterday where the winners and finalists of the European Destination of Excellence, EDEN, awards for excellence in tourism sponsored by the European Commission and administered by Fáilte Ireland were recognised. Sustainability is at the heart of that. We must ensure that is at the heart of our tourism industry in order that our children and grandchildren can benefit as much as we do. That is very much at the heart of Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210"> I am glad that an extra €50 million has been allocated to greenway development, which has sustainability written all over it. There is huge potential for additional greenways. Research shows that every euro spent on greenways has a massive return in terms of economic activity. An example of that is the greenway from Westport to Achill. I was on the route from Newport to Mulranny in 2010 and it was a short, quiet greenway. I went back in 2013 and when I was sitting in a hotel in Achill waiting for a taxi to bring me back to Westport after completing the greenway I wrote a blog entitled "Why greenways should be called goldways". Activity on the route included taxi hire, cafés, bicycle hire and many other little shops doing very well out of it. There is great potential to do even more in that regard. Members know of the Dungarvan greenway, which is going very well, and there is much more potential in terms of canal banks, old railway lines and various other assets. In terms of old railway lines, I am particularly familiar with the south Kerry line from Farranfore to Valentia Harbour and lines from Tralee to Fenit and Kilmorna to Listowel. Not only are those assets available but we have an obligation to those gone before us who built those fantastic feats of engineering by hand to make the most of those resources. Not to do so would be a terrible waste. Those fantastic feats of engineering were put in place in the late 1800s when there was little machinery to assist in their construction. We have an opportunity to make the most of them for this generation and for future generations and need to grasp that opportunity. I am, therefore, glad that €50 million has been allocated for drawdown in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and will be working on that within my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211"> In terms of the sports capital programme I was thrilled, working with the Minister, Deputy Ross, that our budget for the current programme was increased to €60 million from its current level of €30 million. That will give us an excellent opportunity to roll out a very responsive sports capital programme for the needs of local and regional sporting organisations. Considering that we had €155 million worth of applications, €30 million would only hit the tip of the iceberg. Thankfully, €60 million will clear much of the backlog and prevent many volunteer applicants having to again go through the very tedious process of application. It will mean very positive outcomes for applicants. Positive health policy, participation and preventative health measures are at the heart of the programme. It has left excellent footprints around the country. Some €911 million has been invested in sports facilities throughout the country since 1998. If one drives around Ireland one will see the great sporting facilities in various parts of the country. This is a scheme that is working well and needs to continue. I am glad that we hope to be able to roll out an excellent programme in the coming weeks that will help increase participation and will give an extra weighting to the disadvantaged in order that they get more out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212"> There was provision in the budget for €50 million in 2019, 2020 and 2021 for large-scale projects above the threshold of the sports capital programme. There are current thresholds of €150,000 and €200,000 for local and regional sports capital programmes, respectively, and an overall budget of €4 million for the regional programme this year. The large-scale projects will now have €50 million available to them in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and we will be inviting expressions of interest in 2018 for such projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213"> I am also glad that provision has been made for phase two of the national indoor arena at the National Sports Campus in Abbotstown to be completed. Provision has been made for a velodrome and badminton centre to be built thereafter. Those projects are long awaited but are very positive and even though they will not be in place before the Tokyo Olympics, it is hoped that at Paris 2024 Irish athletes will be in a position to contest medals because of having the benefit of those facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214"> I went to Páirc Uí Chaoimh on Sunday. As a Kerryman, it was unusual for me to be there and see a Cork team winning but it was the finals of the Cork county championship. I congratulate Nemo Rangers on its win in the football championship. Páirc Uí Chaoimh is a fantastic facility into which €30 million of State funding has been invested. That was financed by capital spending by my Department and is an example of the positive achievements of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in conjunction with funding from the GAA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215"> I would like more funding to have been allocated to sporting organisations. However, the Government subsidy to Sport Ireland will be just shy of €50 million this year, which is a slight increase in terms of current expenditure. However, we need to make greater future provision in terms of current spending for our sporting bodies, in particular for the high performance area. They have done extremely well in terms of capital funding but more current funding is needed and I would like that to happen because it is money well spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216"> Money spent on national governing bodies trickles into every community in the country and increases participation, which is good for the overall health of the nation. Any money we spend on sport today will lead to long-term savings. It is one of the most positive areas in which money can be spent. It is to be hoped that as the overall situation improves, the Government will be able to do more in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMcGuinness" eId="spk_472">
          <from>Deputy John McGuinness<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T22:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1217">A 2012 report by Transparency International referring to a national integrity systems, NIS, assessment of Ireland it conducted in 2009 said the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1218">The 2009 NIS reported that perceptions of legal corruption in Ireland are higher than perceptions of corruption prohibited in legislation. Legal corruption is facilitated when there are no legal barriers in place to curb undue influence over public policy making, prevent regulatory 'capture' and ensure political accountability. Legal corruption played a role in the poor regulation and weak oversight of financial institutions which led to Ireland's banking crisis. The crisis has been described by a parliamentary committee as 'the greatest challenge to the State since it was founded in 1922'.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">Bearing that independent commentary in mind, I want to reflect on the Finance Bill and ask the Minister what oversight is in place through his Department to ensure value for money, transparency and accountability. The Government allocates massive amounts of money to companies such as Iarnród Éireann and similar semi-State bodies that have very little or no accountability to the House. Appropriate measures would be forensic accounting, an examination and audit and a teasing out by Members of Parliament of exactly how the money is spent. If that were done, the Minister might get better value for money, better services and there might be a better understanding of why the school transport system, for example, is not as good as it should be and why it, like many other services, is still in the dark ages. There is little or no accountability for the money the Government gives to semi-State bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">At every turn they are back looking for more money, but no one looks at the efficiency or the audit within the companies. The Comptroller and Auditor General is very limited in what he does with the money, the spend, that he can examine. For example, going through the Houses at present is the Water Services Bill, and I praise Deputy Catherine Murphy for tabling an amendment that would empower the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine Irish Water's accounts, report to the House and have the Committee of Public Accounts examine them. There was very little appetite for the amendment, but I hope now that my party and the Government will ensure the safe passage of the amendment. Irish Water received €2.6 billion to the end of 2017 and it is envisaged that the State will give it €1 billion a year onwards. Alongside this, the commercial water charges that are being collected by Irish Water and the rates it now charges for the traps at various fast food outlets, for example, will all go into a pile of money that is not examined by the State but which is currently examined, albeit not very efficiently, by the auditor within local government. If we are really serious about ensuring we get transparency and accountability regarding the money contained in the Finance Bill for every single Department, the changes that are necessary to bring this about need to be driven not by the Opposition but openly by the Government. It is my firm belief that if the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, did this, he would impose on Irish Water the same moral compass and decency he has. That is what is lacking in many of the organisations I am speaking about. They feel they have the right to do what they are doing. They feel they have avoided the transparency that would have been imposed upon them if the political classes in this country had a mind to do so and were awake when legislation was being passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221"> There is an awful lot riding on the Minister's shoulders. He was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and saw how it can make agencies and Departments of State account for themselves. The only regret I have, looking back on my ten years on the committee, is that when the various reports were made available to the line Ministers, they by and large ignored them or paid lip service to them, or the very civil servants on whom one must rely to enforce the law just did not bother to enforce it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222"> That is essentially what happened to our banks. It has everything to do with the Finance Bill what is allocated to the banks, and there is no regulation. The Central Bank does not examine forensically the activities of the banks. There is almost a reluctance to do so. When we look back on the past ten years, do we think any of them are capable of even understanding what moral suasion is? I visited Capita recently on behalf of clients - I do the same in respect of the banks - and its hard-nosed disrespect and the manner in which it bludgeons its customers is shocking. This is not the senior, older bankers. It is the younger, newer ones coming in. They have now been indoctrinated into that very same culture the Minister spoke about today at the press conference. I was there and I believe his sincerity in dealing with it. However, again coming back to transparency and accountability, until such time as he insists on every single bank having an ethical officer, someone who would oversee what is going on and be able to report directly to the Central Bank and to the Minister, he will not get change. The reason he will not get change is that banks are not driven by ethics or a moral compass. What drives banks is money. As one senior person in Capita said to me recently about a client, "Go to your neighbours, your friends, your mother, your father, your community, the credit union, but what we want is money, money, money."</p>
          <p eId="para_1223"> If that is the thinking that dominates in the banks in a culture that has been passed down to the next generation of bankers, the Minister has a job on his hands. I will support him in every way I can to see that culture broken because that culture has broken the nation. It has broken families beyond repair, made their lives miserable, removed hope from their lives and shown in the most awful way, without any shame on the part of the banks, that they have no compassion, humanity or decency. They believe that they live in a State in which this can go on. I do not think any community in the country wants that kind of State. They look for political leadership, but we have not given that leadership for the past ten or 15 years or more. The Central Bank promised it in 2010 and 2015. Charlie Weston wrote about it in 2009. Nothing has happened. It is the same culture, and we must break it within the Oireachtas by ensuring we do these things in committee and by being open and transparent ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224"> I wish to move to the issue of financial reporting. I have tried for years, again through the Committee of Public Accounts, to ensure that the HSE and the Garda would have one single financial reporting system. I often asked the Minister about this at the committee meetings. They acknowledged again recently that they still do not have a single financial reporting system. What gets counted gets done. If there is no analysis, it is not possible to know what is going on in an organisation. The Minister increased significantly the money that the health services get, but it is going into the same structure, the same old way of doing business, and some of those senior people within the HSE who manage it are not fit for purpose. There are too many managers. The front line is the Band-Aid that holds it all together, and by the time the money gets down to the front line, the services get so diluted that the citizen, the patient, suffers dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225"> The same applies to the Garda. We can have all the agencies and all the oversight of those agencies we want, but if the culture that exists is not broken, they will not recognise the fact that they are accountable. Garda, banker or politician, we are all accountable and we as leaders within our communities and at national level must ensure through this Parliament that accountability is first and foremost, that the value for money flag flies over this House and that we are not afraid to root out the people who have caused such distress in the State. This is why citizens say, and I heard it said tonight, that if a person does not pay his or her television licence, he or she will get fined. That lone parent in court today was fined €120. Others were fined €350. The banks look at these fines like parking tickets. It is part of their business. It is what they do. They issue fines. As one banker said to his own staff when they asked what happens if something goes wrong, "We will pay the fine and you will get on with your business." He used much clearer language that I could not use in this House to his staff. That is what they think about it, and we have to change that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226"> I tried in vain to convince the political system in my own party that the National Housing Co-operative Bill was a runner and that it could be worked on. I will give it to the Minister. He can have it. The legislation was written by a very eminent person. The Minister should take it, work on it and change it, but for God's sake, he should stop what is happening in the courts. That has a huge cost to this State and to families and individuals. In the Taxing Master's court two weeks ago, 138 cases were listed from AIB. The lawyers came in and had most of them postponed to another date, resulting in more hardship and trauma for those involved. They have nowhere to turn because the banks have all the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">They have the power to deal with them in a way one would never expect in a country like ours, yet it happens. That is why I ask the Minister to ensure, when he meets the banks, that they stop every one of the repossessions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228"> What have not been touched on tonight are the tracker mortgages that have been passed on to vulture funds, where people are threatened with the loss of their homes. These cases are not being counted. The figures the bankers gave the Minister have been massaged and he should not think they are not capable of it. At the finance committee hearings that was the one single thing that came across: they believe an apology is sufficient and that once they apologise, they will hunker down and the storm will pass. I hope the Minister will not let that happen. I hope he will speak to the Minister for Justice and Equality and that some arrangement, through the Central Bank and the banks, will be found to stop the repossession of homes because the cost to the State of not doing so would be enormous. It would have to house the people concerned; it would displace people in the housing market, while the number on the housing list, currently 120,000, would grow significantly. I am not exaggerating; I have heard these figures talked about at the committee. The Minister must analyse the issue and stop the banks when they state to him that they have identified 14,400 cases. Yes, they have, but they stopped a significant number because they were not identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229"> The Minister of State at the Department spoke to Mr. Kissane who is an expert on this issue. He said that if he was given five minutes to deal with every case in a bank, he would be able to tell whether they had been impacted on, but he has never been asked. The Minister and the Taoiseach should bring him in and have him explain to them the truth about what is going on in the banks. PTSB went to the High Court and lost. There were similar cases which it took to the High Court and which it still refused to declare as having been impacted on. The families in question become homeless and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has to deal with the matter also. It is shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230"> In the registrar's court, for which we are also paying through the Estimates, to be fair to some of them, the registrars will stop the banks from what they are doing. In the registrar's court in Kilkenny Bank of Ireland had the biggest recent number of cases. The manner in which it speaks to customers before the registrar is appalling and shows no sense of decency whatsoever. We are allowing this to happen in the court and I am asking the Minister to, please, stop it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231"> When I investigated the money available to support the housing co-op Bill, we discovered that in Europe there were ethical funds with anything up to €5 billion which were prepared to take a look at various debts, that is, take them from the banks, and push them out over 25 years and make their profits on them in an ethical way. When they travelled to America, they established that these funds were available and that they were able to help. Will the Minister consider taking the Bill, examining the prospect of raising the money privately and ensuring the Bill at least would have the stamp of approval from the State and save all of the people who are being queued in the banks or the courts to lose their homes?</p>
          <p eId="para_1232"> The Minister must have seen - certainly Members have - adults crying at the table in his clinics. I have seen adults in court break down and cry. I know of one court case that has continued for 20 years. I have been in the High Court and the appeals court and have to say they would want to pull up their socks because the way they waste time in dealing with cases is a further abuse of taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233"> Local government expenditure is audited after the spend by the local government audit team. I put it to the Minister that there should be one auditor general with a sufficient number of staff to examine all of the accounts for which the office should be responsible, including local government accounts. Why should they be exempt from proper scrutiny? Yes, they are audited, but does it ever appear that they are? Do senior executives in any of the councils ever appear before the Committee of Public Accounts? No, they do not. Is it easy to have a question about an audit answered by local government? No, it is not. There are many such cases which the local government audit team picks up, parks and includes in a report which gathers dust. That is what happens. Every single party in this House has a responsibility, having examined the culture in the banks, Departments and agencies, to act in a way that will send a very clear message that what happened in the past is in the past and that in the future there will be accountability, transparency and respect for this Parliament, something I have not seen for a long time and I certainly have not seen from the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234"> The Minister has set a trend in his desire to put this right and he certainly has my support. He should remember that his language is soft about what happens in the boardrooms of the banks. If, as Deputy Michael Noonan said in 2013, the ECB has a role when it comes to Bank of Ireland and AIB which the Minister owns, the Minister should telephone the ECB tomorrow morning to ask it to, please, come as a body which has no vested interest except in terms of regulation to guide the Central Bank and not to ask the banks but to tell them that they will have to comply with regulations or else the Minister will have to introduce legislation to curtail their activities and change their culture.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2017-10-25T22:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1235">I will attempt to address as many of the points raised in this wide-ranging debate as possible. However, as I am sure Deputies will appreciate, I will not be able to respond to every point made in the course of the discussion of the Finance Bill on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236"> I want to address the points made by Deputy John McGuinness in two areas, the first being about the comments I have made and the actions I have indicated today on the tracker mortgage issue and all of the hurt that has been caused. My language was not soft in that regard. I have unequivocally described the behaviour I have seen in the handling of this matter as being absolutely unacceptable. I said that today very clearly and I have also said it to all of the banks. I agree with the Deputy that, as powerful as words may be - I believe they do have power - all that is capable of responding to this issue is action. Those waiting for redress or, of whom there are many, recognition need far more than words; they need action. That is why I have indicated that if the actions to which the banks have committed or recommitted do not happen, what I will do about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237"> The criticism that has been made by the Deputy and others as we have dealt with these issues in the past is the retort of what we will do about it. As a shareholder in a number of the banks and as Minister for Finance with powers available to me next year, I have outlined what I will do if the Central Bank, which also has power to deal with this matter, reverts to me and indicates that the issue has not progressed in the way it believes it should. This, alas, is a matter that the House and I will have to return to across the coming period. I am certain that this will be the case, but what I have looked to do today is outline how I intend to deal with this matter, and that is what I will be doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238"> Regarding other points that have been raised on the Finance Bill, Deputy Michael McGrath welcomed the combined measures on income tax and USC. Deputy Pearse Doherty expressed concern about the impact of these changes, but I should point out to him and his party that I have retained the entry point into USC at €13,000. I have also indicated that this should be the ongoing entry point into that code, particularly if that code is, at a point in the future, integrated into PRSI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239"> Deputy Shortall queried the progressiveness and fairness of the budget. The budget and its tax changes have been constructed to focus as many benefits as possible on the middle and lower end of taxpayers. Overall, the total amount of funding being made available for tax reform and reduction is €335 million out of a total budget day announcement of €1.2 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240"> Deputy Michael McGrath and others have welcomed the tapered extension of the mortgage interest relief, cognisant of the difficulties that a number of mortgage holders in our State face. This is a response from the Government and the House to many of those challenges. I confirm to Deputy Burton that section 69 of the Finance Bill refers to the modernisation of the PAYE system and the preparatory measures to move to a real-time system from next January. It does not relate to a move to the universal credit system that the Deputy mentioned. Deputy Pearse Doherty raised questions about the effectiveness of the help-to-buy scheme. It is appropriate to retain that policy measure as it is currently available and I will continue to effect and monitor it. </p>
          <p eId="para_1241"> A number of Deputies raised concerns and questions about the operation of the key employee engagement programme, KEEP. I confirm that my Department continues to engage with the European Commission on the deployment of this scheme. We anticipate that, when it is made available next year, it will be of help to SMEs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242"> A number of Deputies touched on the value and role of certainty in our corporation tax system. I reconfirm my commitment to that certainty while addressing matters that need to be, and are being, addressed within the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process. This was the subject of criticism from Deputies Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy, but I ask them to acknowledge that the tax code, which they have criticised, plays an important role in the retention of jobs for more than 300,000 people by supporting and retaining foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243"> Deputy Pearse Doherty made the point that there had not been changes to the research and development tax credit scheme. The review that he mentioned, which was published last year by the Department of Finance, concluded that the tax credit provided a reasonable level of additionality and that the rationale for it was not in question. Given this thorough review, I am satisfied that the credit is working as intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244"> Comments were made about some of the moves that I have announced regarding capital gains tax. Along with the changes that we have made to stamp duty, these measures are consistent with having a resilient tax base. If we want to change our tax code to create the conditions for a sector to recover, we must use opportunities like this to revert to a more sustainable taxation rate so that we have a tax base in the future that is resilient and capable of dealing with the challenges that we know we will face.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245"> A moment ago, I acknowledged Deputies' concerns about the banking sector. During the Private Members' motion, we touched on the mortgage tracker issue and all the difficulties that it has caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246"> A number of Deputies raised concerns about our Brexit preparations. The strongest economic contribution that we can make to our economy's readiness to deal with potential shocks is to close the gap between spending and taxation next year, have a credible path for the future of our national finances and use that as the bedrock for putting in place measures like the Brexit loan scheme and additional resources for various State agencies so that they are allowed to support companies in diversifying and winning business in new markets abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247"> I am aware of the wide variety of challenges that Brexit will pose, but we have put in place measures to strengthen our finances and support State bodies and we are seeking to provide clarity regarding capital investment so that agencies are better aware of the resources that they will have in future and the private sector, including our construction and development companies, can plan for the future and, in so doing, put in place the kind of investment that will be vital if our economy is to rebalance and respond to the opportunities and threats that we know will present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248"> Many other matters have been raised and I look forward to discussing them with Deputies on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249"> I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
