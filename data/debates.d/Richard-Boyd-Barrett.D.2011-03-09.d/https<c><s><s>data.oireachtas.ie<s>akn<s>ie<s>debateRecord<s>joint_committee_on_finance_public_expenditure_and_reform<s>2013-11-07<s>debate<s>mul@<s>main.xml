This is purely technical as the joint committee wishes to record the recommendations agreed to at the meeting. The following recommendations were proposed to the joint committee. On Schedule A, it was recommended that COM (2013) 520 warranted further scrutiny - will be carried out later today; that COM (2013) 450 did not warrant further scrutiny; while COM (2013) 679 was noted for adoption. On Schedule B, it was recommended that COM (2013) 213 and COM (2013) 293 did not warrant further scrutiny. Are the recommendations of the sub-committee agreed to? Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">I understand this meeting is being broadcast on two cable networks. I ask members to switch off their mobile phones because they cause much interference and I will have members of the public e-mailing to say there is distortion of the sound. </p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The next item on the agenda is matters relating to the payment of the local property tax for 2014. I welcome from the Revenue Commissioners Ms Josephine Feehily, chairman, Mr. Michael Gladney and Ms Vivienne Dempsey. The format of the meeting will be that Ms Feehily will make some opening remarks which will be followed by a question and answer session. I thank Ms Feehily for coming before the joint committee at such short notice. The invitation only went from the secretariat to her on Monday morning and I certainly appreciate the time she has made available to us. Given the debate we will be having, I also welcome the extension of the deadline to next week. </p>
          <p eId="para_22"> By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected to the matters under discussion should be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I ask Ms Feehily to make her opening remarks.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to make a short opening statement. I propose with his agreement to broadly cover the questions raised in the clerk's letter relating to the local property tax and to leave the detail for further discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> It is important to recap that this is a new tax, with new concepts and new language for many of Revenue's customers. It is also a new tax for us in Revenue and the largest extension of the self-assessment system in the history of the State. In approaching the design of the administrative system for local property tax we were very conscious of concerns which had been outlined by taxpayers about payment of the household charge and decided to offer the widest range of payment options we could for customers. We also sent earlier this year to all property owners an individual copy of a booklet explaining the tax and the payment methods. </p>
          <p eId="para_25"> When I last appeared before the joint committee in May in the context of an attempted credit card fraud, I was able to advise it that our approach was proving to be very successful. It resulted in a compliance rate of 89% by late July, which has now risen to 91%, in other words, returns for 1.6 million properties, plus local authority and social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Property owners can choose from seven payment options. It is important to point out that all of these payment options were successfully used in the first filing period this year. Data showing the range of options chosen by taxpayers were circulated in advance to committee members. For example, over 10% of the tax paid was paid by phased payment by monthly direct debit. Less than 1% was paid by phased payment by deduction at source from salary, pension or certain Government payments. A total of 24% was paid by single debit authority, a mandate to Revenue to debit one's bank account once. Just under 15% was paid by credit card. </p>
          <p eId="para_27">Debit cards, which are quite different in nature from credit cards, comprised 36.7%, cheques and postal orders comprised 6% and cash or other methods through service providers comprised 7%.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> I have been asked to address the structure, timing and operation of LPT for 2014. The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) sets out how the tax is to be administered. Apart from the half year of 2013, the timing provided for in the law is the same each year. The liability date is 1 November if one is a property owner on that date, the return filing date is 7 November and LPT is payable on or before 1 January. In accordance with our normal practice, Revenue allows extra time for people who file online until 27 November. In accordance with the law, the tax is payable on or before 1 January or an agreed payment arrangement is entered into with Revenue to pay it in 2014. Unless filing is completed in November, Revenue cannot offer the options of phased payments over 12 months or 52 weeks because these need to be set up and instructions have to issue to the employer in time. In our experience, many employers do their January payroll run in the middle of December. We also have to write to all our direct debit customers in December before we can activate the 2014 direct debits, in accordance with the rules governing direct debits.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Beginning on 21 October, Revenue began writing to approximately 988,000 property owners relating to LPT for 2014. In accordance with the law, we did not write to those who had previously claimed exemption or deferral or those who had selected the phased payment options of deduction at source or direct debit. We placed advertisements in national and provincial newspapers, provided a briefing note which was circulated on the Oireachtas intranet system in the week the letters were being received and we provided spokespersons for national and local media, and so on. I think we assumed that people might still have their LPT booklets and that there had been so much printed and said about this tax only five or six months ago, that people would be somewhat familiar with the concepts and language, so we pared the letter back to its absolute basics. Clearly this was a mistaken assumption on our part.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Committee members will be aware that to facilitate people who need some more time to decide on their preferred payment option, we have extended the filing date for paper filing to next Thursday, 14 November. As always, returns postmarked on the closing date will be regarded as being on time. I was asked to address the question of premature payments. By law, this does not arise because the tax is payable on or before 1 January. As a matter of practice it cannot arise because the choice is entirely with the property owner. In this regard, it is important to say that the payment options operate in exactly the same way as they did earlier this year. Generally speaking, with one exception to which I will return, people seemed to understand them and used them, if not happily because paying any tax is unlikely to generate happiness, then certainly without difficulty. In the telephone calls we received last April and May the issues which are suggested to be causing confusion and concern at present hardly arose at all. We did not have issues about credit card dates or the STA. We had no advance warning from the last campaign that these apparent misunderstandings might have existed.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> I mentioned that there was one exception. A reasonably small number of people contacted us to say that they did not realise the debit card or credit card options would hit their accounts immediately. We responded to this by adjusting our system to alert them in our communications and in our online LPT system. We did this as a customer service initiative and to highlight the cash flow advantages for them of other payment options which we are making available. In reviewing the papers for this meeting, it occurred to me that if the alert had added “You may wish to pick another option” it would have been more helpful in terms of clarifying the options. The purpose of the option was to alert them to the fact that this would happen because that is how cards work. We suggested implicitly - perhaps we should have made it explicit - that they might like to pick another option.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> This brings me to the kernel of the issue it seems to me the committee invited me here to discuss, in which regard I would like to make a number of key points. Our job in Revenue is to collect taxes and duties for the Exchequer in accordance with the law. Our approach to collecting tax is informed by our responsibility to secure revenues for the State effectively and efficiently. Effectiveness includes reducing as far as possible opportunities not to pay. Efficiency includes not imposing unnecessary cost or burden for either the State or the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> As a service we are offering seven different payment options for LPT which allow property owners to decide whether to pay now, next year or in phased payments. From a customer service point of view, we wanted to ensure that property owners were fully informed about the implications of their choices when making that decision in a clear and transparent way. As committee members will see from the preliminary data which I have circulated, large numbers of property owners are successfully filing returns and selecting payment options. When this morning’s post is included, returns have now been made in respect of 205,000 properties. When combined with the payment options which are rolled over from 2013, this gives us a compliance rate of 35%, which is very good with three weeks to go to the online filing date.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Nobody has to pay LPT before 1 January 2014, unless he or she chooses to do so. Many taxpayers are telling us that they want this option and the figures support this view. For those who do not, there are five other ways to pay in 2014 providing both phased and single payment options. The choice is with the taxpayer but they have to tell us now.</p>

I propose that we allocate 12 minutes for the first round of questions, eight minutes for the second round and five minutes for the third round, following which we will do a wrap up. Is that agreed? Agreed. Is it correct that approximately 1 million households use the debit card and credit card payment system?</p>

Ms Feehily is correct when she says the payment is due on 1 January but in other cases she allows for the payment to be made after 21 March.

If somebody enters their credit card information it is exactly the same as any other website transaction for airline or concert tickets or whatever.

          <p eId="para_52">The Revenue has a merchant agreement with a banking company. There is a coding system in that merchant agreement. If I were to book a holiday this afternoon to travel abroad for St. Patrick's weekend, and if I were to use one of our Irish airlines such as Ryanair or Aer Lingus, departing on 15 March, that sum would be taken from my account immediately. If, however, I were to book a hotel with an online hotel agency, it would put a hold on my account and on the date of my arrival at the hotel, or if I failed to notify them that I was not arriving, that sum would be deducted. That is just a system of coding. The merchant company the Government has engaged, if that is the case - we can clarify that later - can establish a code for the Revenue. I understand the Revenue can modify the merchant agreement in place so that credit card details can be given and payments removed on a particular date. Is that not the case?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_21">
          <from> Ms Josephine Feehily<recordedTime time="2013-11-07T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_53">It is not the case in the contract we have. I am not sure those hotel bookings work exactly like that. Any time I have used them they have taken a certain amount of money immediately, and when one turns up at the hotel one has either already paid in full or they immediately ask for one's card. I am not sure it is as simple as the Chairman suggests at all. We do not have that kind of contract. We operate within the Government contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> To return to the question of the difference between debit card and the date of 21 March for single debit authority. As I outlined in my opening statement, one of our responsibilities in Revenue is to take steps to secure the revenues in a way that reduces the opportunity for non-payment. The difference between the two methods, from Revenue's point of view, is a single debit authority, which is filed on time, gives us the authority to go to a person's bank account once only. We can then make a concession on the time because we have the person's authority to dip their account without returning to them for permission. We have operated this system for many years in the context of self-assessment. It works very securely, safely and cheaply. There are no transaction charges. It is a much simpler, safer and more secure option than getting us into the business of holding and exchanging credit card data.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_22">
          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2013-11-07T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_55">So we are discussing a financial IT systems process, not a legislative process, and there is nothing in the legislation insisting on payment before Christmas. I understand there is no impediment to the Revenue getting a property owner's credit card details and processing payment at a later date. The advice I have received through the secretariat from two card payment processors taken at random from the Irish Payment Services Organisation, IPSO, website is that there are three very developed types of processes. First, for bookings such as hotels or pick-up tickets for a bus or a concert they allow for a zero charge validation to ensure the bona fides of the card holder. They guarantee that the person booking is the card holder and if that person decides to cancel, there is no charge to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> The second type is for variable charges such as utility bills, phone services and motorway tolls. Many people use the M50. The old toll gate was a serious problem. It now uses a credit card system. The third type is for monthly or quarterly charges such as subscription charges or charitable donations. This would allow somebody with a debit or credit card to not only have the lump sum payment taken out once in the year the tax is due but have it staged to remove the tax on a monthly basis. We are talking about a systems as opposed to a legislative issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">There is a compliance rate of 91% according to the figures Ms Feehily has given us today. This is a customer service issue. If half of the customers wish to pay through this system, the system should be made as compliant as possible. While the secretariat may have put the word "premature" in the letter I would have edited it. I would see that a withdrawal of the payment in a period when the payment is not due as being premature. We can argue the semantics later.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> My examination of this shows that the Data Commissioner sees no difficulty with this. If the Revenue has information from the Data Commissioner saying he has concerns with it, I would like to hear it this afternoon. Will Ms Feehily give this consideration? Perhaps it is impossible to do it because it is a new tax. People came into the system in July paying a half year sum and probably the majority of people out there, particularly PAYE workers, do not engage with the Revenue as much as private business people do, so there is a learning curve for all of us. In terms of improving the Revenue's customer services, if the system cannot be changed for this year, can consideration be given to changing it for next year?</p>

It is important not to think this is simple. We have very big data holdings and a very close relationship with the Data Commissioner. I do not have information from him about this but we know the Act very well. Does the Chairman think taxpayers would be happy giving us their credit card details and letting us dip whenever we like?

          <p eId="para_84"> The net issue is that if people choose the debit or credit card payment method, they will have to pay in advance of the calendar year to which the liability relates and I have some sympathy for the Revenue because it is working within the confines of legislation. The fact that people paid the 2013 liability only four months ago and are now being asked an 18-month liability within a period of four months is a sore point for many people and that has led to much of the anger and concern they have expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> The payment in advance issue is a direct consequence of the legislation. While it does not state that the Revenue has to take the money before the calendar year, if the Revenue tries to comply with the various dates set down in the legislation operationally and if, as Ms Feehily says, Revenue is obliged not to retain credit or debit card details, then those transactions must be put through immediately. Is the option open to the organisation to have a two-part process for people who wish to pay by debit or credit card to signal that before the filing date in November and then return in the new year to provide the card details for the transaction to be effected?</p>

          <p eId="para_86">If we were to do something like that, the person in question would have to think about going back in on New Year's Eve, which is not a day people would necessarily be thinking about their tax for the following day and I would not be doing our job of securing the revenues for the State effectively if we said to people, "You can tell us now and you can come back in on New Year's Eve to pay", but, more important, we would deprive those people of the opportunity to spread their payments evenly over the year. The reason we were out there talking to people at the end of October is to give the maximum opportunity to them to avail of phased payments over 52 weeks or 12 months. That is why we need to know now in order that we can put the various payment systems in place. While the Deputy might say that somebody could say he or she will come back on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day to pay with his or her credit card, there is a small but significant number of people who change their mind during the year. One can change one's payment option any time. If the Deputy changes his mind on 2 January, we will be lucky if we can get his direct debit up for the middle of February or if he is monthly paid for his March payment through employment deductions. It is risky. Why would one?</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> I keep coming back to the fact that if somebody is uncomfortable about paying before 1 January with a plastic card, we provide an alternative called the single debit authority, which is identical to a debit card. A customer has to give us less information and do it with fewer clicks on the website and we are giving that category as a concession until 21 March because I am satisfied in terms of my governance responsibilities that I have the authority to collect that money so the money is secure.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">If the Revenue required people who wish to pay with a debit or credit card to give those details in the new year, that does not necessarily mean it is removing the option for other people to pay by direct debit over 12 months because when they indicate in November that this is their preferred option, Revenue could require them to provide their account details and so forth then in order that it can commence the 12 monthly deductions in January. No cash would be taken from them until January. The notion of preliminary tax is par for the course for the self-employed or companies. They understand it but it is an alien concept for PAYE taxpayers. People might not like the property tax but they accept it is a liability they have to meet and they will meet it in the year the liability falls due. Revenue has to find a way of changing the current procedure. If the legislation said that the Revenue shall not deduct any money from property owners until the calendar year to which the liability relates, would Ms Feehily then have to comply with that and not deduct money, for example, the previous November?</p>

          <p eId="para_89">Clearly, if the legislation said we could not deduct money, we could not do so. That would certainly mean we would not give people options to pay before Christmas using plastic cards. The interesting thing about that is we have 205,000 returns. The other thing that is interesting is that half of those returns to the extent that they are processed - it is not half of the 205,000 because they are not all processed yet - are choosing the single debit authority. They are understanding well how to use the March option.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">It is a contractual issue for now. As the Chairman asked, we will certainly look at it but I do not want to mislead the committee. While I will look carefully at it, I would be concerned about us getting into the business of retaining that kind of data. I would need all sorts of assurances in light of things that happened in other businesses in the past week or so. We would have difficulty satisfying ourselves that we needed to retain the data when the single debit authority, which is a simple, safe, secure solution, is an option. We are not sure we need it. We would have difficulty with the Data Protection Commissioner in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> The comparison with iTunes and so on is not the same because there is a recurring relationship. One is topping up every week. Each time, one clicks that one accepts the terms and conditions. If somebody gave us their details and a year later we come back and ask about the card details he or she gave us the previous year, it would be more complex. The issue is certainly contractual but security, data and privacy issues also arise. I would have to have a good discussion both with ourselves, our IT people and our audit committee to see if it is a risk we need to take.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I acknowledge that confusion seems to have particularly impacted on paper filers, as Mr. Gladney's staff would confirm. Our compliance rate to date is 80% online. The paper filers have been listening and suddenly realised that they were out of time which is why we extended it yesterday. I can assure the Deputy we will be reasonable where we can. Penalties will not be imposed in any event without us making contact with people in advance. When people use the word "penalties" they do not quite understand. When I talk about penalties, I am talking about penalties in the law.</p>

However, it still leaves approximately 150,000 property owners who have not complied. What approach is Revenue taking with those? I know a few Deputies who refused to pay the tax have had their salaries deducted. Is the net closing on the 9% or 10% who have not paid?</p>

          <p eId="para_111">I explained previously that our priority in the beginning was to establish the tax and establish the register, and we have been doing that. When we only have to do this once, as we will next year - this year we had to do it all twice - the staff who are merrily answering the telephones now will be available to us for compliance campaigns and they will begin very early in the new year. We have new data sources which we are adding all the time. We will do two things beginning in the new year. We will obviously be following through with deductions for people who have not filed this time. We will also be scrutinising the outliers regarding valuations. We now have data that show us in certain parts of the country clear outliers - we can see norms and ones that are not in the norm. We will be looking at valuations and we will also be looking at other data sources such as property registers where we can see gaps where we have had no compliance and we will follow them up. As we said previously, at the end of the day from now on no property can be disposed of without this tax being brought up to date. So we have a pinch point there in any event which will continue to build our register.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I have to keep correcting the Deputy that it is not in advance because the legislation states "on or before". When it is on or before it is at the person's choice. I certainly hear what the committee members are saying. The commitment I am making is that when this campaign is over, we will have a good look at this. We will see in the light of patterns chosen by people what the new numbers are. It is not reasonable to come to any conclusion based on the half year. We need to see what happens when people have to pay the full year and establish what proportion of people still prefer to use cards. I will look at all of those angles, including the risks, security and the costs to us and the taxpayer because we will pass them on to the people who chose those payment options. Certainly retaining details with one of those companies the Chairman discussed has a cost. I will look at all of those things. We will take a very serious view and look at it after we get past this filing season.</p>

          <p eId="para_117"> Confusion has arisen from the letter that issued. Section 119 of the legislation states the tax is due on or before 1 January. However, the letters that issued to ordinary taxpayers make no mention of 1 January - it is the only date missing from the letter. I would have thought that was a glaring oversight.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> If people are not obliged to pay the tax until 1 January, it would be very simple that anyone who wants to go for direct debit, the single debit mandate or deduction at source or through a service provider should be obliged to come forward by 14 November for manual filing or 27 November for online filing, but anyone who has a payment coming out of their account the very minute they pay should not be required to submit it until 1 January. It would be very simple way around it and would ensure there was no element of confusion. Is that something Revenue would take on board?</p>

In some cases it may suit people to hold out until 1 January and under the legislation they are not required to pay until 1 January. Can they write on the manual form that they will be paying by cheque and the cheque will reach Revenue by 1 January or they will pay by debit and payment will be made on 1 January or they will pay by credit card?

          <p eId="para_145">Just before I came I checked and in the middle of the day the waiting time on the 1890 number was six minutes. A significant proportion of the calls are being referred to our own staff for expert knowledge. If access to the IT system is required, our outsourcer does not have access to it. My advice to people in this position is that they will receive an audio message telling them the waiting time and inviting them to leave their number and that we will call them back in the evening. This has been happening for the past two weeks and we are up to date. People in the second referral to a Revenue number who leave their telephone number will receive a telephone call.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">I thank the staff of the Revenue Commissioners for coming before the committee. I was going to ask about the cheque option. The bank cannot process a cheque until the date that is on it. To use Ms Feehily's term, it cannot dip into the account.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> It is clear from the legislation the tax is due on 1 January, at which time it must be paid. Ms Feehily mentioned that people did not have a problem in May, but the problem arising for many people is that they paid the household tax for the previous year in May or June, after which the half-year tax was paid. Perhaps this was done with a single payment. They are now being hit for a third payment in November this year. People believe they are making three payments. Ms Feehily can answer as to why, but it is a fact that it is happening. In some cases it is happening because people did not have it at the time. This is an issue I ask Revenue to consider with regard to giving flexibility. It is clear that the legislation was badly drafted and rushed through the Dáil. The Christmas break was high on the agenda and there was not much time to discuss it and here we are now with the consequences. Ms Feehily has mentioned payment is due on 1 January and she has also mentioned risk. If the Act were changed, would it satisfy Revenue's obligation to collect the tax on behalf of the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_199">People who have been around for a long time will remember that when we changed the income tax year, we needed to have a special nine-month year. There would be a transitional arrangement and a large machine would need to be created if one wanted to change the year. Perhaps we did not succeed but we were trying to be mindful of this by placing so much emphasis in the letter - we used a box - on phased payments beginning in January, under which taxpayers would tell us at once whether to spread payments out over 12 months or 52 weeks, beginning in January. We also emphasised the single debit authority, which strikes a balance between my responsibility to secure the tax and taking account of the fact that people might not want to pay this at Christmas or immediately afterwards. If they give me a mandate, I can secure the tax and provide them with the maximum time. We offered several options. However, we cannot offer every option to everyone, which may be what people want me to do. We can only offer options in circumstances in which we can secure the funds.</p>

          <p eId="para_200">The liability date is 1 January. What if we changed it to March? I am curious about Ms Feehily's remarks on risk. My understanding is that the tax is for 2014. If I use a service, go for a meal or so on, I pay before I leave the premises. I am not trying to oversimplify the matter, but the owner is happy because I have paid the bill on the way out. One can pay for other services during the period in question. I do not understand why the full payment must be paid on day one as opposed to through phased payments over the year. Would the current legislation allow the Revenue Commissioners to opt for 1 March?</p>

          <p eId="para_201">Under the current legislation, there must be a return by 7 November and the tax is payable on or before 1 January unless one has an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners, from which phased payments arise. The "unless" comprises exceptions, phased payment arrangements and the single debit authority. I have secured the tax. This is how I deal with the "unless". The current legislation does not allow me to tell everyone to go away and that I do not need any money until March. It obliges me to secure the tax in a way that I can satisfy this committee and a committee that might be meeting across the hall on another day that I have done my job in accordance with the law.

          <p eId="para_204">When Ms Feehily appeared before the committee in May, she stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_205">The legislation says what it says but we can, within reason, manage and schedule payment dates. Every year Revenue grants a concession when people file their tax returns online. Within our own care and management, we can make some sensible arrangements around the margins of payment dates. We chose the January date specifically because we can send out returns to people before the end of the year and they can pick 12 equal months.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Although she referred to 12 payments, she mentioned in the early part of her reply a degree of flexibility. For many people, making a single payment after Christmas would be a great deal easier. For obvious reasons, Christmas presents significant problems, given the festivities and the associated costs, particularly for people with families. Apart from the phased payments aspect of Ms Feehily's May reply, she seemed to indicate that Revenue had some flexibility "around the margins" to try to bring the date into next year. Could it not be applied?</p>

          <p eId="para_207">We offer that flexibility on the basis of a single debit authority that people give us now. That is what I meant about offering flexibility "around the margins". People give us the authority now, thereby allowing me to secure the tax. I have a commitment. They can pick any date between now and 21 March to give us permission to collect that money. We give the concession in a managed, ordered way where people have given us the authority to collect from their bank accounts. If they do not want to go the bank account route, they can tick the service provider box, go to a post office on 2 January and pay us in a lump sum. It is simple. There are options.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">They have complied because they have submitted their returns on time and ticked the service provider box. We are not asking people who pick a service provider option to pay by 1 January. This is what I meant when I referred to having flexibility at the margins. Once people have made the commitment to us and given us the mandates that we need, we can be flexible. We have given so many options that, no matter what a person's circumstances are, there is an option that fits. It seems to me that people want to fit the options to the plastic card. I cannot go that far, as the plastic card system has different characteristics, particularly as regards giving us authority to debit. If someone wants to pay a lump sum after Christmas, he or she has at least two options - service provider or single debit authority - and can pick any date between now and 21 March. I will give them these two options.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">I wish to ask about the half-year returns made earlier this year. People received from Revenue their notifications, estimates and return forms. In some cases, those estimates were way out. A house might have been placed in band 4. According to<i> www.daft.ie</i> or sales in the area in the past year, however, that house should have been in band 2. I have encountered such cases. The people involved would have written to Revenue, filed a return and submitted evidence to back up their claims, for example, the sale prices of the last four houses sold in the area, the fact that their houses were old and had lower specifications and a similar one sold for a certain amount in the past nine months, etc. I accept that Revenue made clear at the time that it was a self-assessment, but people have not heard a squeak since filing their returns. What is happening? People did not know what to pay for the six months of this year. The issue is hanging.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">From the outset, we are dealing with compliant taxpayers, in that they were prepared to pay. The sense I am getting from Ms Feehily is that Revenue was not confident that they would pay a second time if the situation was left as was. She used the phrase "good governance".</p>
          <p eId="para_218">As these 800,000 plus people are compliant taxpayers who paid the tax last time, why was Revenue not confident of their paying in January by either debit or credit card? Was a risk analysis undertaken which supports Revenue's expectation that a large proportion of this 800,000 people would not make the payment in January, February or March?</p>

          <p eId="para_219">There are two parts to the answer to that question. As I said earlier, I do not believe it was possible to draw any conclusions based on the half-year payment. Once this campaign is out of the way, we will have a better pattern. Already, the numbers indicate a drift away from debit card payment to the single debit authority and phased payments. As the amount due has doubled, the pattern this time will be different. That is the first part of the answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Second, Revenue has no authority to debit a card a second time. This comes back to the point about retention of card information, which I regard as high risk. Revenue has no authority to debit a card a second time and as such could not simply have rolled over payments as we did in the case of direct debits, which operate within a particular framework.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">If I was undertaking an analysis and 800,000 customers had paid the first time via debit or credit card, I would do everything I could to facilitate them paying in the same manner the second time. To me, it should have been obvious to Revenue that asking people who previously paid by debit or credit card in May to pay the second tax in November would have annoyed them. If, as a person who paid the tax in May and who has every intention of paying the tax for 2014 in 2014, I received a demand for early payment of the tax in November, I would not feel I was getting good customer service. Does Ms Feehily not understand the reason for the resistance, annoyance and anger in relation to the demands in that regard?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_170">
          <from> Ms Josephine Feehily<recordedTime time="2013-11-07T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_222">I can understand there is some concern. The Deputy asked if Revenue had undertaken any risk analysis. I come back to the point I made earlier that in April, May and June this year large numbers of people paid via debit or credit card even though the payment was not due until July in respect of which Revenue received virtually no complaints. It is difficult to anticipate something that did not happen before. The online and paper systems being used now are the same as those used previously. On the last occasion, the final date for online filing was 27 or 28 May. I recall I was in Leinster House on that day. People used their debit or credit cards in advance. That dimension of it was not something that was evident from the analysis we did from the first half year. It is clearly evident this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> To be fair to Revenue, we felt we were meeting our customer service responsibilities by giving people so many different options to pay. There were times last year when I was tempted to say we would not accept payment by debit or credit card. Revenue only commenced accepting payments in this way in 2012. It is a new thing for Revenue. It is almost as if the additional piece of service has become the problem. I am being flippant. I have no intention of stopping Revenue accepting debit or credit card payments. If people wish to pay in that way, it is Revenue's job to facilitate them in every way it can. The fact that the tax spans the year has made this one particularly difficult. It is not tax that is due in 2014 rather it is tax payable on or before 1 January 2014. The reason for that date - Deputy Stanley referred earlier to my remarks in this regard on the last occasion I was before the committee - is so that we can set up the phased payments. It is all part of trying to give the optimum service. We cannot give the optimum service on every eventuality. For all of the people who are unhappy about one method of payment I have requests to add seven, eight, nine or ten other payment methods. All of these have to be evaluated in the context of service and cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">No. The only penalty - I do not in this regard mean a "penalty" as per the Act - has been some enforcement activities. We have imposed mandatory deductions at source from people who paid late or did not pay at all. Some people switched and paid another way. Also, a number of tax clearance certificates were refused because of late or non-payment. The matter was then rectified and the tax clearances were granted. We have used enforcement penalties in the broader sense but no penalties under the Act.</p>

Against that context, we do have legal expertise but this tends to be in the area of tax law and not necessarily in other areas of law. It is not as simple as the Deputy suggests.

          <p eId="para_259">Okay. For the large majority of people who form part of the negative equity generation the preferred <i>modus operandi</i> of payment is via debit or credit card. According to the demographics of what we know about debit and credit cards, there are almost 5 million held in this country. Retailers are concerned about Christmas. Whatever about that, people are concerned about the amount of money that will be taken out of their pockets.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Many people have approached me to say that in the space of a couple of months they will be paying €1,000 or upwards in property tax for moderate houses that are very heavily mortgaged. I do not know if the Revenue Commissioners have exhausted the merchant services providers with regard to how the service could be provided. Debit and credit cards could be set up in a way to take money from the account over the calendar year 2014. I spoke to some credit card experts today. Do the witnesses feel this can be addressed now or, as was noted earlier, could it be considered for the future? Is the notice too short?</p>

I have already indicated to Deputy McGrath and the Chairman that we will consider this in the context of next year's renewal season, but I am not making a commitment that we will enter into a particular position. I am not making a commitment that we will provide a service that will enable us to dip into somebody's credit or debit card regularly. That is a risk of which I must take account before committing. We will consider the matter and I would be happy to speak about the matter in the middle of next year, when we have examined the matter. I am not making a commitment as it would bring us into a whole different kind of business that we are not in.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">I represent many decent taxpayers in that regard. Ms Feehily has stated today that this is a new tax and that "our job in Revenue is to collect taxes and duties for the Exchequer in accordance with the law". She has also stated that paying any tax is "unlikely" to generate happiness. I say "Amen" to that, and it is particularly the case when the new tax is loaded onto the people by the Government to pay the debts of speculating bondholders and bankers who profiteered wildly in the Irish property market and had bad private debts laid at the feet of our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> I will speak very bluntly, although not for very long. Ms Feehily has been brought here for one reason, as she is unwillingly and unwittingly providing an alibi for the parties in Government and helping them evade responsibility for a draconian new tax they have introduced. She is distracting attention from the culpability of both Ministers and backbenchers for this hated new burden. Ms Feehily has stated her job is to collect taxes in accordance with the law. Listening to Ministers and backbenchers over the past week, I have asked myself where the hell the law came from. Am I right in thinking that in December 2012, the Fine Gael and Labour Government, including backbenchers, designed and manufactured what I call a crude weapon of austerity, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act? They loaded the weapon with draconian powers to intimidate, frighten and coerce decent taxpayers into paying for this unfair new weapon. The Revenue Commissioners, in doing the Government's dirty work, is pulling the trigger, leading to Ministers and backbenchers screaming blue murder. Necks of flint have been on display today and in the course of the past week on behalf of Government representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Next year a new water tax will be inflicted on decent householders and taxpayers. When people rightly begin to scream about this new burden and learn about it in greater detail, I fully expect the contractors digging up pavements to install water meters to be dragged in here to explain their audacity in facilitating this new tax. That is about as much credibility as the Government Deputies have shown in requiring representatives of the Revenue Commissioners to come here today. Ordinary taxpayers are very angry about the property tax, and they are right. The elderly, unemployed and poor people who have been saddled with this austerity bondholder tax are quite distressed. It is a new hardship, and therefore the Revenue Commissioners should be very conscious of how they deal with ordinary people and the distress and fear that is disgracefully being brought about by Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> I have a question. When Ms Feehily heard in the past week the deputy Prime Minister of the country and Government Deputies screaming objections to the letter demanding that people should pay the home tax which they had introduced, did she say to herself how pathetic that was and ask who they thought they were fooling?</p>

          <p eId="para_280">I would never use those phrases or sentiments with regard to the Government of the day and it would be completely outside my role. I asked colleagues how we got into this space when I thought we were offering seven different ways to pay. It is a question I asked myself for the past couple of days, as we thought we were providing many options but they seemed to get us into bother. The sentiment that came into my mind was more practical and I offer no further comment on the Deputy's remarks.</p>

          <p eId="para_282">I will try to be as concise as possible. I thank Ms Feehily and her colleagues for being here and they may recall that I wrote to the Revenue Commissioners on 6 September on this issue, as I anticipated the problem that would be caused when seeking compliance for 1 January. I asked that the date be moved to 31 March. Will the witness comment on the fact that we are dealing with compliance and confidence in the collection system? People who have been compliant are really annoyed and we - I use that term because the legislation is flawed in some respects - have damaged public confidence in the collection system, which is unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> There is also a more significant observation. The witnesses have indicated that the Revenue Commissioners have offered seven options for payment, indicating the legislation stipulates it is due on or before 1 January. For the 35% of taxpayers who have availed of options declaring name, address and telephone details of banks along with account numbers, they will not pay on or before 1 January. The Revenue Commissioners have all the details they need so these people will not pay before 1 January. It might be assumed that others had the audacity not to give those banking details, and the Revenue Commissioners are insisting on payment before 1 January. These people include those paying by credit or debit card, cheque or postal order. That is 57% of people in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">These are the people the Revenue Commissioners are going after and who will have to pay on or before 1 January. However, those who have given their banking details are being given an opportunity to spread it out over 12 months because the Revenue Commissioners have a fall-back position. They can go after those people if they are in some way non-compliant in the future. However, those who have said they will pay, but are not happy about paying, have also said they are damned if they are going to give their banking details. These people are being nailed to the cross in respect of this issue and that is unfortunate. They are very wise people not to give their banking details. </p>
          <p eId="para_285"> We have damaged the competence and collection of and compliance with the tax code. We have done this in a calculated way because we want to corral people into a payment system which gives the Revenue Commissioners all of their banking details. If they do not do so, they must pay on or before 1 January. If they give their details, they can spread it out over 12 months because the Revenue Commissioners know they can go after them.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">I do not accept nor do I think the data support the view that confidence in the collection system has been damaged. The fact that 205,000 people have already filed does not support that view. The time to make that judgment will be when we pass 1 January, get into next year and run the numbers. In regard to the Deputy's other comment, I need to clarify something. It is not because people have given us their bank account numbers and their telephone numbers that we can be comfortable allowing those people to pay us in March; it is because they have given us permission once, and once only, to debit their bank account. As soon as we have debited their bank account, that authority is torn up, if it is on paper, and it is destroyed, if it is electronic. It is a single debit authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_288">The Deputy mentioned cheques. People do not seem to understand that their banking details are along the bottom of the cheque. That is why I wonder why people would choose to pay by cheque, as it costs money. It costs them stamp duty and a transaction fee, whereas a single debit authority, which shows exactly the same information - there is a sort code on the bottom of the cheque - is much cheaper and is more secure. We do not keep people's bank account details at all. We simply exercise the mandate and then the bank account details are destroyed.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I thank Ms Feehily for coming in this afternoon. I would like to flesh out something she said earlier about the holding of data, the holding of bank account information and how it is somehow more appealing to the Revenue Commissioners versus the holding of credit card information and how it is somehow more secure. It is as easy for me to cancel a credit card as it is to cancel a single direct debit authority. It is also as easy for me to pick up the telephone and cancel a cheque as it is for me to cancel a single direct debit authority. I used to work in debt management, so I find it confusing that the Revenue Commissioners take some comfort in having a person's direct authority to deduct from his or her bank account over holding credit or debt card information, because they are the same. In terms of ease, it is actually easier to provide bank account details because there are fewer digits.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">I would prefer the date of payment of the local property tax to be other than the bank holiday of 1 January. We should change it to 3 or 4 January, or the first working day in January, to allow people to go to a payment service provider, such as An Post, to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I do not believe it is easier for the Revenue Commissioners to rely on somebody lodging his or her account details online or via a mandate and sending it to them on the filing date. It would be a lot easier for somebody to set up a standing order. It is a little bit of a red herring that it is more secure for the Revenue Commissioners. </p>

          <p eId="para_307"> I refer to another point Ms Feehily made about cheque payments. If the Revenue Commissioners receive a cheque dated 1 January - notwithstanding the fact that that means very little - sending it in directly rather than waiting until the last week of December to send it is perhaps betraying the trust the people have in the Revenue Commissioners, which has an extraordinarily good reputation, by simply ignoring their request to make the payment on 1 January.</p>

I said on local radio this week that these hearings were a disgrace and that the Revenue Commissioners were being hauled in to answer questions. My personal choice has always been not to support this tax.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">It was not put to the committee whether we would invite the Revenue Commissioners. The Chairman went on television to ask Ms Feehily to come in. We were never asked if she should be invited. When the Government Deputies legislated for the tax they blamed it on Fianna Fáil, and now this is being implemented, they are blaming it on the Revenue Commissioners. It is completely farcical for a Labour Party Deputy to ask if Ms Feehily had any hand, act or part in bringing this legislation forward. It is also farcical to suggest the Revenue Commissioners have become like a hotel booking site and that Government backbenchers are asking the Revenue Commissioners to start to accept postdated cheques as a matter of routine. I presume revenue commissioners in Third World countries do not do that routinely but I am sure it happens in very hard cases from time to time. Ms Feehily has been put in this position and has clarified a couple of points I wanted clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> I dealt with a very hard case in my office last week. A person clearly did not understand the system at all and the wrong valuation was put on his property last year for some reason. Is it possible for him to change it?

          <p eId="para_318">I do not require Ms Feehily to respond to this but it is worth reminding Members who voted for this legislation that they are the ones who inserted a due date or liability date of 1 November. They are also the ones who put in a return date of 7 November and a payment date on or before 1 January, which is a bank holiday and the seventh day of Christmas. That is what has happened here. It has been legislated for and in my opinion the Revenue Commissioners are doing a reasonably good job in putting this tax together. While there has been some confusion over the last week, when anyone has come to my office, that confusion has been dealt with relatively easily. It is our duty to help. It is the duty of Government Deputies to help instead of just attacking others. It is a pretty disgraceful way to treat public servants in the one institution that has come out fairly well in recent years in this country. We do not always agree with the Revenue Commissioners and tax collectors have never been in exalted positions in society. The commissioners would accept that they are not the most popular people but they have a job to do, given to them by us. It is that simple. If there are problems we ask them to address them and should not blame them for bringing in this hated property tax, to which I am opposed. The Government introduced it and we need to remind people of that and stop blaming the Revenue Commissioners</p>

          <p eId="para_328">However, I want to address a different question. This is the third time that Ms Feehily has been before this committee, as far as I can recall. On one previous occasion she was before us regarding a letter sent to people in receipt of an old age pension about a potential tax liability. One of the issues that came across very clearly during that exchange was the fact that there was a communications problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Revenue Commissioners and the public. I fully take on board what Ms Feehily said in her statement about the LPT being a new tax. It is indeed a new tax and not one that anyone here would have liked to introduce. However, there are benefits to extending the tax take across as broad an area as possible. I am very concerned that, according to the statistics Ms Feehily has given us, over 50% of people are paying by debit or credit card. Have the Revenue Commissioners examined why people chose those particular payment methods? If one were to match the payment method chosen with the income profile of the payee, I suspect one will probably find that many of those paying by debit card in particular, are those who have a cash-only card and do not have access to the wide range of financial accounts that better-off people would have. One of my concerns about the current debacle over the payment date is that a lot of those people who will be impacted by the payment being taken before December are in the lower income profile. Has Revenue done any research to establish the who, why, where and when regarding those people who are paying by debit card, given that the logical choice would be to select the one single debit authority payment option?</p>

          <p eId="para_334">The short answer is that we did not do the kind of analysis the Senator is describing because the half year was unusual. It would not have been valid to draw conclusions on the basis of a half year. Already this year we are seeing - to the extent that we did analysis but not the type the Senator is talking about - that people want to shift to a different payment method because the tax has effectively been doubled. That is what we are seeing in the payment methods of the 200,000 returns that we have already secured this year. The time for that analysis is when we have a proper, full filing season. Then we can determine the profile of amounts paid and payment method chosen as well as demographics and payment method chosen.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">Basically, the Revenue does not have that information so my supposition may correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> It seems from the exchange between Ms Feehily and the Chairman that there are no legal issues at play here because the law says that the payment is due on or before 1 January, except where an agreement is reached with the Revenue Commissioners. The Chairman explored with Ms Feehily the possibility of that agreement constituting an individual's permission to the commissioners to debit his or her credit or debit card at some future date. Her response, if I remember correctly, was that this was a route that she did not wish to follow. In other words, the Revenue Commissioners do not want to hold card details, as opposed to not being entitled to do so. She suggested that it was something that was possible but not something the commissioners wanted to pursue. My understanding is that there are no data protection issues involved here and that there is no impediment to Revenue taking account details and processing the payments at a later date. That is my understanding of the exchange between Ms Feehily and the Chairman. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_337">Let us start again. What I indicated to the Chair, or at least I felt I had indicated, was that I have serious concerns that such a process would bring us into conflict with the Data Protection Act, based on our understanding of that Act and the code of practice we have agreed with the Data Protection Commissioner. I definitely indicated that Revenue, at this point, is not comfortable with retaining credit and debit card details. This refers back to Deputy Farrell's question, which I did not answer earlier. The security issue I was referring to was the security of the information. It is quite a serious issue and would require us to move into a whole different line of business if we started to hold on to debit and credit card details. It presents risks of data loss way beyond any of the risks we have to cope with at present. It presents risks that cardholders could find attempted fraud on their credit or debit card accounts and we already experienced that - although it did not succeed - last May. That is the kind of security risk I am talking about. We are not set up for it. There is definitely a question as to whether it would bring us into conflict with section 2 of the Data Protection Act, which deals with the retention and use of data, in particular, unnecessary retention and use.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">eToll has my debit card details and does not seem to have a problem with that. One of my concerns is that 45,000 people have chosen to have the money taken out of their accounts in advance. People are afraid of the Revenue Commissioners and when they get a letter from Ms Feehily's office, they pay up because they do not want to be on the wrong side of the tax authorities. In terms of the legal issues involved here, can Ms Feehily provide this committee with the legal advice she received on this subject?</p>

          <p eId="para_339">I have not taken legal advice in the manner which the Senator means. We are very familiar with the Data Protection Act. We have been audited up, down and sideways by the Data Protection Commissioner's office and have an ongoing relationship with that office. We are very clear that if we were to move into this business we would have to have a long conversation with the Data Protection Commissioner. I would be surprised if that office did not take a very keen interest and put us through the hoops. The first question they would be asking is why we need this data and I would be saying that we do not need it because we have other payment options.</p>

In fact, there are catch-all aspects to different Acts which give the Revenue Commissioners sweeping powers. Ms Feehily suggested that it was easier for eToll or iTunes to have a relationship with me but who has a more recurring relationship with anybody than the Revenue Commissioners? I again ask Ms Feehily to reappraise her position on the debit and credit card issue because in my opinion it is causing incredible concern and hardship, particularly among older people and those on low incomes.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">No, I cannot look at it for this year. It is not possible. These are risks that I would have to consider really carefully. We would have to develop new systems and would have to charge people, which is what the commercial companies do.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">We are operating with a particular contract for the management of debit and credit cards - the Government contract - at the moment. It is certainly not possible to do anything about it this year. I have already given a commitment to look at it for next year. I am stopping short of giving a commitment that we will get into that kind of business. If we were to get into it, there would be costs that would have to be passed on. A range of issues would arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> The Senator suggested that Revenue has the power to get lots of information because of its recurring relationship with taxpayers. Most people do not seem to understand that we do not have a recurring relationship with the vast majority of PAYE taxpayers. That goes to the heart of the data protection concern. The Senator said she has a recurring relationship with eToll or some other company. She gets a chance to look at her statement every month or whenever she gets it. She can see very quickly if there has been an irregular payment. We do not have a recurring relationship with PAYE taxpayers unless something happens in their lives and they want to claim a credit. The relationship is managed through their salary and their employer. We have a recurring relationship with self-assessed taxpayers, for whom we have been operating these kinds of payment systems without any issues for a long time. I refer in particular to the single debit authority system. We do not have a recurring relationship with the vast majority of people in employment in this country. That is at the heart of part of the security risk.</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2013-11-07T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_348">We have been in contact with officials in the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. Before I read into the record what they had to say, I would like to come back to the point that was made about the 1.49% rate that customers are paying. Further information has become available to me in that regard. It has been suggested to me that more secure systems, such as 3-D Secure prompts, could be used. These systems require the card holder to give a password or card number to verify his or her identity. In addition to fulfilling data protection requirements, these systems also seem to lower the commission rate. The industry commission rate seems to be approximately 1%. The major retail companies in Ireland that have significant volumes of card transactions seem to charge this 1% rate. As I said earlier, people give a code or an iTunes account number when they are using Amazon or iTunes. The biggest companies in the world - we are not talking about the Revenue Commissioners - operate a system that merely requires one to provide a password in order for one's account to be debited.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I would like to follow up on what Senator Hayden was saying by quoting from the feedback we have received from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_350">We are aware of recent media reports which appear to reference statements from the Revenue Commissioners outlining data protection issues with the retention of credit card data. We can advise that any organisation, including Revenue, is responsible under data protection law for keeping personal data it holds safe and secure and it is also obliged to only collect personal data when it is required and then retain it only for as long as is necessary. Revenue, being an organisation which is very aware of its data protection responsibilities, appears to have considered these data protection principles and applied them accordingly in relation to the collection and storage of credit card data for a particular transaction. There are separate industry payment card standards which providers of payment card services have to adhere to and which may also be relevant to Revenue's approach in this matter but those requirements would not be matters for this Office.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">This brings us back to the point that Senator Hayden was making. I made the same point at the start of the meeting. It has been made by other people as well. Certain systems or processes could be examined to ascertain whether they could be used in the future. I recognise that Revenue has done a great job in providing as many options as possible to the public. Some red herrings have been thrown out there this afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> I will reiterate the core issue that is being debated this evening. Of the seven options, the highest rate of compliance relates to the credit and debit card option. They are the only customers who are being asked to pay the tax in the year before it is due. I can assure Ms Feehily, in response to a point she made earlier, that I understand how the tax is being created and the operational systems are being rolled out. Perhaps it is just my opinion, but I do not think those who were complaining back in May or June were complaining about having to pay the 2013 tax in 2013. The concern at the moment is that people are being asked to pay a 2014 tax in 2013. That is at the nub of this issue. I recognise what Ms Feehily has said this evening. I appreciate her assurance that Revenue will agree to examine the matter. I would be interested to know if there are hindrances with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, or if there are difficulties with Revenue's merchant agreement with the people who handle its credit card transactions. All the information in front of me would indicate that this is a workable problem. A solution can be found for it. Maybe the difficulty was that none of us saw this coming down the tracks. Now we can engineer a solution to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">I thank Ms Feehily for her attendance. Unlike some of my colleagues, I think the Revenue Commissioners are to be commended on the manner in which they handled this issue earlier this year and, in the main, the manner in which they have handled it in recent weeks. It might not be politically prudent for me to say that. By comparison, the collection of the household charge caused immense difficulties for people. The Revenue Commissioners are to be commended in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> I would like to refer to the 91% compliance rate. It is in the public domain that Revenue has taken action against certain people who are not compliant. What are Revenue's plans for dealing with the 9% of people who have not complied? How quickly will those plans be enacted? What does Ms Feehily think will happen? I also have a slightly tongue-in-cheek question. A lovely gentleman contacted me yesterday afternoon to complain about having to pay the property tax. He had received his letter. He pointed out that the half-year charge was €142, whereas the full-year change is €285 rather than €284. He saw the funny side of it and wanted to know what Revenue intends to do with the extra €1.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">The answer to the tongue-in-cheek question is that the man in question got a discount on the half-year payment because we rounded it down. In response to the Deputy's question about compliance, I can confirm that when we get past this filing season, the staff who are currently involved in filing and customer service will be available to begin compliance work in relation to properties we have not yet identified. Compliance work also needs to be done with regard to evaluations. We know that some people have under-declared. I am not talking about the sort of case Senator Byrne mentioned earlier, which was the other way round. Some people have under-valued. We will get into the real compliance part of this tax next year. We have access to many databases. We will get them refreshed to see whether there is a gap between our register and other registers. We are also exchanging information with Irish Water, which is clearly in a position to add properties and give us information as it rolls out its metering programme. I remind the committee that a property cannot be disposed of without bringing the tax up to date. There is a certain inevitability about the tax. The short answer is that serious compliance work will begin shortly after the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">I would like to ask Ms Feehily about another aspect of the compliance issue. There is some confusion - I will not say concern - about certain issues with the sale of properties. I know today is 7 November and the relevant date is 14 November. If the conveyancing process in respect of a property is beginning - a person is letting go of a property and somebody else is purchasing it - who is actually responsible for paying the 2014 tax?</p>

          <p eId="para_377">Sure. I wish to mention three cases where Revenue has serious responsibility, although I believe the primary responsibility lies with the Government. A woman who came to my clinic had €61.75 taken from her wages in September and again in October. This was done without notification. She does not own a property. She spent three weeks trying to get through to Revenue, but has failed to get through. Another man in my constituency was charged half a year's tax for one house, but this year he was charged for a full year for two houses. He only owns one house. Third, a 27 year old, unemployed person on a community employment scheme who is not a property owner and who is currently homeless and sleeping on someone's couch, has had four weeks' property tax deducted from her unemployment benefit for a house in which she rented a bedroom when she was in college six years ago.</p>

What we have found where we make a compulsory deduction at source is that it is sometimes only when the deduction is made that people actually ring us and say they do not own the property, although they would have received two communications asking them to contact us. The second notification, in particular, states that if the person does not contact us, we will contact the employer or company of the person and tell them to make the deduction.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">I have given that information for 2013, but I do not propose to do that analysis. We are filing every night. The paper returns have yet to be processed, so we will not run numbers every hour or so. We are taking the top line numbers and when the filing season is over, we will produce the kind of analysis we have circulated for 2013. This is our third time to produce preliminary data for 2013 and each time it has got more granular. We will do 2014 when the filing season is over, but I thought I should provide the top line numbers today. We will get to the figures the Deputy wants eventually.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">I just do not understand the figure. If approximately €500 million is to be collected this year and €10 million has been collected, that is just 2%. However, Ms Feehily has told us that 200,000 people have already paid for 2014.</p>

          <p eId="para_400">Some 50% of those returns processed have opted for the single debit authority, which comes into effect in March. Some 15% have opted for direct debit, which is paid monthly starting in January and some 5% have opted to pay by deduction at source. Therefore, there are not huge numbers opting for the models that hit this year and perhaps that is the reason the figure is difficult to understand. These are rough preliminary data, but I thought I should bring it along with me.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">That is fine. With regard to the lead-in time for people who want to use a credit or debit card, we had the same issue last summer. People complained in May, but they paid the tax using their cards. Therefore, we knew about the issue. Therefore, there is no doubt that everybody involved in the Department of Finance and the Government could not but have known that a similar problem would arise with regard to the lead-in time and taking the payment in advance of 1 January. We all received queries from people who had moneys taken from their debit and credit accounts last May, although the tax was not due until July. This issue arose last summer and now we face it again. However, there is a particular difficulty now because the payment is for a different calendar year.</p>

          <p eId="para_403">The Revenue Commissioners are putting a big emphasis on encouraging people to sign up to a phased payment, by way of deduction from wages or by direct debit. In the booklet issued to every house last year, it was stated the Revenue will advise the pension provider or relevant Department of the amount to be collected.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Revenue wants to get a lot of people onto the phased payment method, whether that be a deduction from salary or pension or by direct debit. That is made clear in the book. In the case of those salary and other deductions, Revenue will advise as to the amount to be deducted. When it comes to direct debit, Revenue takes the amount due each month and informs the bank how much is to come out of the account on the particular date. Can Ms Feehily confirm that there is provision in the legislation from next September for local authorities to pass a motion increasing the rate by 15%, which will become effective from 1 January 2015?</p>

          <p eId="para_416">I am making one net point. The logical consequence of the legislation is that when Revenue seeks payment by direct debit, people will think that they can pay one twelfth of their liability each month, but if the local authorities increase the total amount by 15%, the Revenue will be taking that extra money out of people's account by way of direct debit. Based on the legislation, the Revenue can inform the employers or their pension providers of the increased amount without consent or prior approval.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">Direct debit requires confirmation. In respect of next year's direct debits, we will be writing to people in the middle of December, advising them that we are proceeding with the direct debit for the following year. That is part of the code of banking regulation. If a local authority decides to increase the rate, I will certainly have to engage in a communications process. We will not proceed to increase their direct debit or increase their deduction without engaging with them. I certainly will not do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">I have to do so. I will also have to reflect on what it means for the timing of this other discussion, and what it means for the timing of issuing the returns and so on. If a local authority makes that decision, we will have to see what we will have to do to implement it. We will certainly not increase a direct debit or a deduction from somebody's salary without communicating with them, in the context of a decision by that person's local authority. That will not be our decision.</p>

The situations mentioned by Deputy Fleming can arise next year if the local authorities increase the tax. Everybody should be alerted to what everybody else is paying. It also means that the basic assessment or valuation is brought to their notice. It is like a refresh. I think everybody should be informed. It is just something to note.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> In respect of the risk that Revenue will not be paid, I think we have thrashed over that ground fairly heavily. Debit cards and credit cards provide bank details, although not expressly on the face of the card. That is a matter of fact.</p>

It is a shocking shame that €50 billion of losses have been put on the shoulders of the people, and €50 billion at 3% is €1.5 billion. That is three years' worth of local property tax. I am embarrassed that our Government has not got €50 billion worth of a creditor buy-in from the euro system. That is still possible, and I am using every possible forum to say so. I recommend to everybody to read <i>The Price of Inequality</i> by Joseph Stiglitz. It is only five weeks old but it is already out in paperback. Please do not laugh.

          <p eId="para_464">I do not believe the Revenue Commissioners should ever be immune to hearing feedback from Parliament. That is one of the reasons I am here. We are independent in our application of the Acts and that independence, although it has always been honoured by all Governments, was enshrined in law in recent years. However, that independence does not extend to putting ourselves into a box. We should listen and hear and I am here today to listen and hear and to reflect on anything that Members of Parliament say to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> I regularly get contacts and we regularly get representations. I have been asked several times whether we should be subject to such communications and I have always said that I consider it appropriate for us to be communicated with by Members of Parliament, as representatives of the people in a democracy, and for us to reflect on the issues being brought to our attention. In that sense I have no issue with any politician bringing a matter to my attention - none at all.</p>

I was at a briefing given by the Citizens' Information Board, the National Adult Literacy Agency, which is the body that deals with literacy issues, and several other organisations. The request that came across from everyone - it was a direct question in the context of the local property tax - was for the use of plain English. Will the chairperson comment on that? These bodies said that the local property tax forms and the process were a perfect example of the problems caused by a lack of plain English and the fact that the request to pay tax was not framed in a comprehensible way.</p>

          <p eId="para_488"> I made reference to the 35% who had made all of their bank details available and to the reference in the legislation to the tax being due on or before 1 January. This appears to be the stick being used to beat those who have not given all their bank details. How can the law differentiate or provide for differentiation if the payment is due on or before a certain date? Those who avail of certain payment options are not obliged to pay on or before but those who do not give chapter and verse of their bank details must pay before 1 January. The legislation states "on or before" but some need not comply with that deadline.</p>

Can she clarify that if a person is submitting manually by 14 January he can write that on the form, and that is fine as long as he makes the payment before 1 January? If a taxpayer goes online, he can go the service provider route and indicate his intention, and then on 1, 2 or 3 January he can make the payment. The point about 1 January arises. I realise the task the Revenue Commissioners has, but it comes back to plain speaking.</p>

The date on which the money will be taken out is 21 March, unless the taxpayer specifies an earlier date. I welcome that but I am struggling with another point and we need to convey it better. It is not the intention to take the money for the property tax by debit card or credit card before Christmas. We saw the specifics earlier, and a figure of 15% was mentioned. If I came across as putting the witnesses under pressure earlier it is because I am feeling the pressure in my office as well.

Using our care and management of the Revenue Commissioners' authority, we can make concessions when we are confident we have secured the funds. It is not a matter of bank details. When we have the authority to dip into a person’s bank account on a date chosen by the person between now and March, we will do so.

          <p eId="para_511">We cannot go in any earlier but the person may pick an earlier date. Revenue can allow that concession. We have done it with self-assessed taxpayers for many years. If they send in their tax returns early, they fill in a single debit authority, either online or on paper and we do not execute it until the date on the authority. That is why we can allow the concession. This was our way of offering something to get people past the Christmas holiday season. I do not think January is necessarily any easier than December. That is why we offered this option. It is interesting to note that approximately half the returns processed have chosen that option. If I did not answer, that is what I meant.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Deputy O’Donnell asked me to make it clear what people can do who do not want to pay before 1 January. They can pick a service provider on either the paper return or online and they can go to their service provider and pay, either in phased payments or in one lump sum, after 1 January. There are three service providers. Some will take debit cards, while most will not take credit cards. People can pay in cash or by debit card at some of the service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> I keep coming back to the question of why anybody would want to have to engage twice with this paperwork. They can engage with this paperwork once if they pick the single debit authority. It is a simple pay and file transaction, whether on paper or online. They have to engage with the paperwork, to use that metaphor, only once. They pick the payment option of "single debit authority", give us their bank account details, which, as somebody said earlier, is far fewer characters than debit and credit card and CCV numbers, and tell us the date up to 21 March on which they would like us to take it. That is our way of making it as simple as we can and giving as much time as we can.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">At the conclusion of the meeting I will have a word with Ms Feehily because I do not want to create any undue concern. I thank Ms Feehily and her officers for coming before the committee at such short notice and for the spirit in which they engaged with us. The Revenue Commissioners are not accountable to Government. They are independent. The structure of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform is also separate from Government. As Ms Feehily has probably noticed, questions come from diverse political groups on the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> In my time as Chairman I think I have accommodated every request for somebody to come before this committee. I accommodated one earlier this afternoon in regard to the insurance industry. I do not think it is appropriate that if one group asks for somebody to come before the committee, everybody else disclaims ownership of it. If we create that precedent, future invitations will become very politicised. I would not like to see that precedent being created.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The information from, and engagement with, the Revenue Commissioners this evening have been very positive. They have cleared up many issues. We greatly appreciate the spirit of the engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> To return to Deputy Spring’s comment, my last question is to clear up a legislative matter Deputy Creed raised earlier. Is it possible for Revenue to include, or classify as entering into an arrangement, the position whereby a property owner elects to pay the tax in one lump sum by way of credit card or debit card that is processed by 15 January? Is that regarded as compliant? One can defer the payment to 21 March. Let us forget about the data security issues and the coding that finance IT systems require. Am I right in saying that the legislation allows for a credit card deduction to take place later than 1 January?</p>

          <p eId="para_552">I thank the committee for the invitation to brief it on the European Commission's legislative proposal for a single resolution mechanism, SRM, which is the next essential step in creating a European banking union. I am accompanied today by colleagues from the Department of Finance. As the Chairman outlined, the proposal is for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a single resolution mechanism and a single bank resolution fund and amending EU Regulation 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> The first step in creating a banking union for Europe was taken with the recent adoption by the Council and the European Parliament of the single supervisory mechanism, SSM, which was negotiated under the Irish Presidency. Under the SSM, responsibility for the direct supervision of the most significant credit institutions will transfer to the European Central Bank, acting jointly with national supervisors. The ECB will issue instructions, regulations and guidelines to national supervisors for tasks performed by them as part of the SSM. The ECB will take over its full tasks under the SSM in November 2014. The banking union will apply to all members of the euro area and any non-euro area member states which choose to opt in. </p>
          <p eId="para_554"> A complete banking union requires common supervision, deposit insurance and a common resolution framework, with an appropriate fiscal backstop. Following the adoption of the single supervisory mechanism, the European Council called for the creation of a single resolution mechanism for banks covered by the SSM. This is consistent with the principle underpinning the banking union that where supervision is centralised, resolution should also be exercised at the same level of authority. If supervision were exercised at the central level but resolution remained national, tensions could emerge between the EU-level supervisor and the national resolution authority over how to deal with an ailing bank. </p>
          <p eId="para_555"> The single resolution mechanism consists of a single resolution board and a single resolution fund. The fund will be financed by contributions from the banking sector. The board will generally make the initial decision about whether a bank needs to be put into resolution and will draw up the necessary plans and make a determination as to whether funding from the single resolution fund is necessary. However, without a treaty change, it is not possible for an EU institution to delegate policy-making powers to a subsidiary body such as the SRB. Therefore, the European Commission will take the final decision to trigger resolution and use the fund. </p>
          <p eId="para_556"> The basis for implementing resolution under the SRM will be the toolkit set out in the bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, agreed on by member states at the ECOFIN meeting that took place on 26 June under the Irish Presidency. This common toolkit for resolution will help ensure a reasonably level playing field across the EU between participating member states in the SSM-SRM, and those which decide to remain outside of it. Although the BRRD has yet to be finalised, trilogue negotiations are ongoing with the European Parliament and it is hoped agreement can be reached by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> Before proceeding to outline the main elements of the proposal, I will briefly explain why a single resolution mechanism is considered necessary in addition to the bank resolution scheme already agreed by the ECOFIN Ministers. The purpose of the BRRD is to provide national authorities with common powers and instruments to pre-empt bank crises and resolve any financial institution in an orderly manner in the event of failure, while preserving essential bank operations and minimising taxpayers' exposure to losses. These powers represent a minimum harmonisation of the rules to be used in resolution. There remains, therefore, the potential for variations in how member states handle resolution. </p>
          <p eId="para_558"> In a banking union context, however, stakeholders generally agree that in a situation where the supervision of banks has transferred to the centre, resolution should take place at the same level. Without such symmetry, market expectations about member states' inability to deal with bank failures nationally could continue, reinforcing feedback loops between sovereigns and banks and fragmentation and competitive distortions across the Internal Market. Furthermore, the Commission is of the view that a strong single resolution mechanism is critical to ensure timely and least-cost resolution of banks. Its position is that the goal should be a centralised authority with power to trigger resolution and make decisions on burden sharing. </p>
          <p eId="para_559"> Ireland has welcomed the single resolution mechanism as the next essential step in creating a banking union. The SSM is now in place and the ECB will take over direct supervision in November of next year. Progress is being made in discussions with the European Parliament on concluding the EU deposit guarantee directive. The creation of the SRM with centralised decision making by a single resolution board and equipped with the resources of a single resolution fund, financed by contributions from the financial sector, represents a significant step in achieving the core objective of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> I will now set out the main elements of the proposal as published by the Commission. In regard to the legal basis for the proposal, the SRM will be based on the Single Market treaty Article 114, which provides for the harmonisation of laws in member states in the pursuit of smooth functioning of the Single Market. The Commission's legal services have indicated that, in accordance with that article, the legal basis to proceed is sound. Treaty change would be required to make the single resolution board independent in its role and while there is a view that this might be preferable, the time required for such a treaty change did not fit into the timetable demanded by leaders and Heads of State - and, for that matter, by the financial markets - for the completion of the banking union. The Commission is of the view that the proposed governance structure, whereby it would retain the ultimate decision-making authority, is consistent with the Meroni principle, which requires that there should be no delegation of discretionary powers with a wide margin of discretion that would have the effect of transferring policy-making powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> On the issue of scope, it is proposed that the single resolution mechanism will be directly responsible for the resolution of all banks - approximately 6,000 - in member states participating in the single supervisory mechanism. As is regularly recalled, relatively small distressed banks have been the source of considerable systemic difficulties. The proposal does not permit a differentiated approach similar to that in the single supervisory mechanism under which the ECB is responsible for the supervision of all banks but only directly supervises the most significant credit institutions because it is considered that the nature of the resolution process requires a high degree of centralisation of resolution decision making in order that successful bank resolution decisions can be taken rapidly. Irish credit unions are not credit institutions for the purposes of the capital requirements directive and consequently are not within the scope of the single resolution mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> On structure and governance, while the Commission will make key decisions such as in respect of approval of resolution, the single resolution board will prepare and carry out the resolution of any bank in a member state participating in banking union. The board will apply the resolution toolkit as established in the bank recovery and resolution directive. The board will be composed of the executive director, the deputy executive director, representatives of the Commission and the ECB and the representatives of the resolution authorities of each participating member state. Under the proposal, the board would have two configurations, namely, the plenary session which would involve all member states' resolution authorities and the executive session. The executive board will be the key decision making forum of the single resolution board. Under the proposal, as published, the executive board will consist of the executive director, the deputy executive director, representatives appointed by the Commission and the ECB and the relevant national authorities of a credit institution subject to a resolution decision. Decisions will be made by simple majority, with the home resolution authority having one vote and all of the host resolution authorities collectively having one vote. The proposal makes a clear distinction between the role of the single resolution board and that of the national resolution authorities. The single resolution board and, ultimately, the Commission occupy the decision making level, whereas the national resolution authorities will be responsible for implementing all resolution actions decided on by the single resolution board or the Commission. If a national resolution authority does not comply with a decision of the single resolution board, the board or the Commission could directly address executive orders to the credit institution involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> In practice, it is expected that the ECB, as supervisor, will indicate to the single resolution board that a credit institution in a single supervisory mechanism participating member state is in severe financial difficulties and that the matter should be resolved. The executive board of the single resolution board will prepare the resolution of the bank, including which resolution tools to use and how the single resolution fund should be involved. The proposal provides that the European Commission, acting on the recommendation of the single resolution board or its own initiative, can decide whether to place the credit institution under resolution. The national resolution authority would be responsible for implementing the decisions of the Commission or the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> The Commission proposes that a single resolution fund be set up in order that funding support for credit institutions in resolution would be available. The fund would be built up over ten years through contributions from the banking sector. It would replace the national resolution funds of participating member states. The target level of the fund is 1% of covered deposits of single supervisory mechanism credit institutions, which should equate to between €55 billion and €60 billion. The single resolution mechanism is constructed with the objective that resolution will be carried out without recourse to national taxpayers' money. Instead, banks will contribute to the costs of resolution though the collection of levies and, where the fund is not sufficient, <i>ex-post</i> levies. Under the proposal, the fund can "seek borrowings or other forms of support from ... other third parties". This could including market-based funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> Until the single resolution fund reaches its target funding level, provision is made for the member state representative of the executive board to delay but not prevent resolution decisions where they might impinge on national fiscal responsibilities. This is a very sensitive issue for a number of member states and there has been much debate in the Council negotiations on the single resolution mechanism on an EU backstop that would guarantee a line of credit to the single resolution fund in such shortfall situations. Any money advanced by such a backstop would have to be repaid by the banking sector by moneys raised through the levy process. </p>
          <p eId="para_566"> In view of the high importance and complexity of this proposal, a high-level <i>ad hoc</i> working group of officials and experts from each member state was established. The group has met seven times in order to make progress on this file and has discussed various options for a possible overall compromise. As a result of these debates, the Council Presidency has drafted three compromise texts and is of the view that the third text - to the extent possible - addresses the main concerns raised by the member states. This text will be debated by ECOFIN at its meeting on 15 November. While negotiations continue and agreement has yet to be reached on all aspects of the proposal, Lithuania, the current Council Presidency, is prioritising the single resolution mechanism proposal. The October European Council called for agreement among member states by the end of the year in order to allow for the negotiations with the European Parliament and the co-legislators to reach agreement on the proposal within the current legislative term. Given that European Parliament elections are scheduled for the end of May 2014, this effectively requires agreement between the co-decision authorities by end of March 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> Ireland fully supports the creation of the single resolution mechanism as a significant and essential step in creating a credible banking union for Europe. We consider that the Commission's proposal provides a strong basis for a single resolution mechanism supported by an industry-funded single resolution fund. As stated, this issue will take up a large part of the agenda for next week's ECOFIN discussions. The Minister will be briefing the committee further on the matter next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">It will not be in a normal situation where a bank needs capital. In such circumstances, the bank in question would have a number of processes in place to allow it to raise capital. I should emphasise that what is being managed under the single resolution mechanism is the rule book of the bank recovery and resolution directive. There will be a process of bank recovery interventions which will be managed by the single resolution board. Where a bank has failed to put straight its own affairs, is in danger of insolvency and where there is a need for resolution intervention, at that stage the single resolution mechanism will kick in. There will still be a range of interventions available to the resolution mechanism in order to deal with recovery plans. The final step would be financial intervention.</p>

          <p eId="para_590">I welcome Mr. Carrigan and his colleagues. I have two questions. In the context of the recent crisis in Cyprus we saw a hit on deposit holders. Where does the establishment of the single resolution mechanism-resolution fund leave the issue of the deposit guarantee?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_480">
          <from> Mr. Aidan Carrigan<recordedTime time="2013-11-07T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_591">The deposit guarantee stands. As I indicated, parallel negotiations are currently going on with Parliament to confirm the deposit guarantee of €100,000 will be protected at a harmonised level across Europe in a separate directive. The resolution directive recognises that and that protection. I believe the Minister stated here previously that this protection will stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> What the bank resolution will change, and this was in the BRR deal rather than in this negotiation, is that all deposits, even those that are not guaranteed, will be given a depositor preference treatment in the event of resolution. Up until now in a resolution situation as soon as one moved into senior bond holders one had to treat depositors on a <i>pari passu</i> basis and they had to suffer equivalent losses whereas, under the bank resolution directive, they will be given a depositor preference, which makes it even less likely that they will ever be called on in a situation like that.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">Yes. That has been addressed. Basically, the single resolution mechanism is a European institution. It is set up under the European Commission. In the first instance it will be accountable to the Europe Council and to the European Parliament but, similarly, because of the involvement of the national authorities there will also be direct accountability to national parliaments through the national authority, and there is provision for the executive director to also deal with questions or issues raised by national parliaments.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">Mr. Carrigan can understand the concern that some people might have because they feel at least the ultimate damage to their depositors would be less knowing there is a resolution fund in place. I get his point. There is a question of moral hazard and that is subjective, and that is what the supervisory mechanism is there to ensure does not happen. That leads me on to my next question.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> The supervisory mechanism will only deal with the most significant institutions whereas the resolution mechanism will deal with up to all the 6,000 banks. Where is the trigger in that respect? One can easily recognise that an institution that is being supervised by the European Central Bank and authorities through the supervisory mechanism would have a good handle on those and would see a problem arising and if it arose they would be on top of it, but with regard to all the other institutions that are not being supervised, is there not a concern that people will only hear about it when things have gone completely wrong because there was not the same level of supervision?</p>

          <p eId="para_604">First, this is a live issue in the discussions at Council, as in the scope of the direct oversight by the single resolution mechanism, but the vast majority of member states are of the view that the single resolution mechanism should apply equally to all banks. The difference is that in the supervisory situation there is a day-to-day supervisory function in relation to all banks and, therefore, the direct supervision has been netted down to the largest banks, but the ECB retains responsibility for supervision of all banks through the national resolution authorities. In the case of resolution, there is not an ongoing oversight on a daily basis of all banks because resolution events only happen, we hope, very rarely. Therefore, resolution interventions are only required on an exceptional basis. One is not comparing like with like when one compares the day to day supervision of 6,000 banks with a resolution responsibility for 6,000 banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_621">Yes, the rest of the 6,000. The national authorities do the day-to-day supervision in accordance with guidelines and rules from the single supervisory mechanism, SSM. The single supervisory mechanism can step in at any stage. That is the supervisory function.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">While we are on it - to get the supervisory function out of the way - will there be two levels of supervision and will one type be more intense? By definition, if some of the institutions are more significant the risks attaching if something goes wrong are far more serious. Will there be two tiers of supervision between those that are being regulated under the current regime versus those that will come under the new single supervisory regime? Is Mr. Carrigan saying it is the same thing?</p>

          <p eId="para_623">No. We would emphasise that there is a single supervisory regime. The regime will operate the rules set out in the capital requirements directive on liquidity, prudential, capital and other regulatory requirements. The single supervisory mechanism under the ECB is responsible for applying those rules fairly and equally across all banks but there is a proportionality principle underpinning that so that one would not have the same demands for low-risk small institutions as one would have for those with bigger risks.</p>

          <p eId="para_625">No, I am saying that proportionality would be applied in relation to assessing the risk. Our current national supervisor, the Central Bank, supervises on the basis of assessment of risk and applies a PRISM system and decides which banks need more attention. It would be the same at European level. There are not two tiers. Basically, we have a single supervisory mechanism responsible for supervising all banks in accordance with a common rule book across Europe but in some instances the day-to-day supervision would be carried out by the local supervisor in accordance with guidelines set by the single supervisor which has to oversee that and can step in at any time.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">Funding is based on a percentage of deposits. Is there a case for those under the SSM regime to feel that because they are centrally and directly supervised that their risk of requiring a resolution would be reduced and that they should have to pay a lower percentage? If the risk of them requiring a resolution is no less than those that are not being supervised by the SSM, the question then is what is the value of the SSM supervision if it is not to reduce risk and identify problems earlier through the great supervision applied?</p>

          <p eId="para_631">That is a reasonable question. The contributions to the fund will be risk based. It will depend on how risky one is assessed to be. Those institutions taking more risks will have to pay more into the fund. All institutions will benefit from the existence of the fund because it enhances financial stability and therefore means that with more confidence in the banking system, all banks will be able to raise funds on a cheaper basis and at the same cost.</p>

Could he give us the range of contributions that will be required? I thought it would be a set percentage. I can understand a bigger institution would pay more because its deposits would be greater. It is a case of direct proportion. Will there be a different rate?</p>

          <p eId="para_635">That will be determined on a national basis by the percentage of the business of the local bank compared with the overall level of activity in Europe. If it is a small bank and it represents 1% of the overall system then its contribution will reflect that percentage. Therefore, it will be proportionate and <i>pro rata</i>. As Mr. Carrigan mentioned, the contributions will also be risk based so pure deposit banks, which have less risk than big trading banks, will have a lower contribution. That will be reflected in the contribution they make. The Commission will introduce a series of delegated rules around how one determines what the appropriate contributions are. The general rules will be set out in this particular proposal and then the detail of it will be worked out.</p>

          <p eId="para_651">The answer, as Mr Sheridan has stated, is that there will be further Commission legislation which will set out the exact parameters for the calculation of the rates. I might as well read into the record what the Commission outlined. It said the contributions will be calculated in a way that will reflect different types of bank and their business models. First, the contributions will be calculated in line with the draft bank recovery and resolution directive on the basis of criteria taking into account the amount of liabilities, minus own funds, and covered deposits of each bank and adjust it then to their risk profile. This means that banks which were financed almost exclusively by deposits would in practice have very low contributions. Second, contributions would be risk based, reflecting different risk inherent in different types of banking activity. That is the principle that is being reflected in the directive which sets out the legislative principles. There is another stage of level two legislation, delegated legislation, whereby the Commission will set out the exact criteria to be applied and it is only then that it will be clear what the range will be. The overriding principle is that the total of the fund will only equal 1% of the covered deposits of all banks in member states.</p>

In addition to the type of institution, it might be said that a bank in Greece or Ireland carries a potential greater risk and in view of the difficulties we have had so far, it would be silly not to examine that issue.

          <p eId="para_682">Correct. I am getting the point now. In terms of contributions by the banks in the context of risk base, I suggest that a bank that is state owned should have a lower risk. For example, AIB is a state-owned bank whereas I would have thought that a bank owned by any state in the Union intrinsically would be of lower risk for resolution because for it to go to resolution not only would it have to fail, but its shareholder would have to fail it also, which is the state. The chances of a state-owned bank in that situation going to resolution would be less likely than one that is privately owned. Does Mr. Carrigan see a point in that regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_683">The criteria to be applied here will not be based on state ownership or where the bank is located. They will be based on independent criteria looking at the quality of capital and the extent of risks. We would be expecting, as the financial crisis clears and financial markets settle again, that banks in temporary state ownership will be moving back into the private sector. It is the quality of the capital, the quality of the loan book and the riskiness of the activity that are expected to be the criteria.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">To some extent the bank recovery and resolution, BRR, directive, is about breaking the link with the sovereign. The fact that a bank is currently owned by a sovereign should not come into account because the assumption is that no further funds will be available from the sovereign in the event of failure. From that perspective, therefore, the bank's shareholders are somewhat irrelevant in terms of their propensity to fail.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">The assessment in Europe was that this €55 billion will be sufficient to deal with future resolution situations. I bring the Deputy back to the point I made earlier that while we are looking at what happened in a financial crisis over recent years, we now have a completely different architecture to deal with those crises than we did in 2008. The architecture we have introduced involves bail-ins and there will now be a substantial bail-in from bank shareholders and creditors that will minimise any call on a fund <i>vis-à-vis</i> what had to be paid out in previous years when there were no such bail-in arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">While the fund is set at an amount that would have covered the euro area cost to date, the likelihood of a call on the fund has diminished substantially owing to the need to bail in creditors and shareholders before one moves to that situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_706">That sounds to me as if an arrangement has been put in place to prevent what went wrong the last time from happening again. Inevitably, the next crisis, if there is to be one, will be different and will not be a recurrence of what happened the last time. It is like a house that went on fire for which one puts in place a system to prevent what happened the last time from happening again but normally the next crisis is different.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">It also will be able to use the staff of the local supervisor. That will be an integral part of the process because the local supervisor will be working with the ECB as part of the supervisory process. As they will be working together as a team, both will have an insight into the developing problem and an input into the process. There also will be a national resolution authority. The board obviously will make the decision and then both it and the national resolution authority will implement it.</p>

A question arose in Ireland as to the reason the auditors had not spotted it. Mr. Carrigan should talk me through this process. We cannot have some of the big global accounting firms issuing audit certificates and billing on the basis of a going concern only for a resolution to be required eight months later. I refer to people who certify the accounts are correct up to the previous quarter or whatever else. In Mr. Carrigan's opinion, should there be some call on those who were involved in certifying the institutions immediately prior to their entering a resolution? If not, why not? This is one lesson it is necessary to learn from what happened in Ireland. All institutions received fine audit reports right up until the day they became bankrupt.</p>

This is a matter on which the Government and its officials in the Department of Finance are working with the other governments. Forgive me if I am wrong, but one reason the delegates have come before the national Parliament is to get the views of the Parliament's relevant committee to inform their own views. Consequently, they are in attendance to hear the views of Parliament. I am giving them views that might not necessarily be those of the Government, but the precise reason for their attendance is to hear the views of Parliament; not the Government. As a Member of Parliament, I am putting this issue to them as one they should be considering.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">I believe the answer is while I stated it is not being addressed in this directive, about which we are talking to members and on which we have prepared, auditors are obliged to operate within a legal framework that applies to them. If they fail to operate to the standards required of auditors, there are arrangements for dealing with this within the legislative framework in which auditors operate. That is a matter for company law. There is a European accounting directive, as well as various legislative mechanisms that require auditors to perform to a certain standard.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">Members are aware that there is legislation to deal with these issues. However, I note that no auditor has as yet been held liable for some of the banking failures here. My point is that there have been banking failures in Europe where everyone agrees that a new resolution mechanism is needed to have in place a fund, funded by the industry, in order that taxpayers will not be caught next time around. That is a good lesson to learn. Surely, however, there is another lesson to be learned from what happened in the past. As the fund is being set up, it is accepted that this could happen again. One past failure was that the auditors certified accounts as being true and fair almost right up until the end. As part of this process, there should be new rules to deal with that issue. If one suggests this is not an issue, one is suggesting there is no need to learn lessons about that aspect of what went wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> I will conclude with one last point. I acknowledge it is late on a Thursday evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">If there is no provision in these new procedures whereby directors who are guilty of fraudulent or negligent activity can face criminal prosecutions, we are saying to everybody, "Carry on regardless". We know what happened in Ireland. Most of them got off. I will not comment on any cases. If there is a situation where a bank requires resolution, the question is whether this legislation will include provisions for legal sanctions against such persons. I am not only talking about barring them from future directorships. Will there be a mechanism in place where they can be brought to account? It is not fair on the customers of the banks who will pay, not ultimately but initially, for this fund. They should at least have the satisfaction of knowing that about the directors of those institutions whose work, if careless or negligent, results in their banks having to be liquidated and go through the resolution process. From an Irish perspective, having been through more of the pain involved than most other EU countries, we have probably one of the richest perspectives to bring to this debate. One of the lessons that we have learned is that those who caused the problem should be accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> If there are not mechanisms in this, it is all well and good to propose the setting up of a fund and if a bank misbehaves again and goes bust at least there is such a fund. That is fine in so far as it goes but it is not fine that the directors feel there is no sanction against them. I want to know what sanctions - whether they are legal and court sanctions - can there be against the directors of institutions. Some of them might merely be due to trading circumstances or where there is a fraud committed against them. Some of it may not be their fault, if an institution goes down. It could be due to matters outside their control. If there is a Ponzi scheme being operated by some directors of some bank, one would need to know this mechanism is not merely a method of bailing out or having a fund in place to pick up the problems. Those who caused the problem should be brought to book. What provisions are in the proposal in that regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_747">Is there a section requiring states to pass new legislation? The lesson we learned is that under current legislation nobody seemed to be guilty of anything and yet some of the banks cost a great deal to bail out. It was a foregone conclusion to tell them that they were losing their jobs. I do not see anything in it about losing their salaries or future entitlements from the bank, or their pensions. They merely lose their job.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> The legislation is not satisfactory. If we have learned anything and if we are to be strict on the banks, I am worried about the moral hazard. I have gone full circle from where I started. If this fund is in place, somebody will feel that there is an insurance policy or bond in place and if they take a chance, it works, and so what if it does not. The person will feel he or she will be out on pension anyway and there is a fund to pick up the pieces. We are putting a safety net under them, yet we are not putting in place any new legislation to deal with their maladministration. In the public service, one will be familiar with the phrase "maladministration". If somebody maladministered their job, it might not be a criminal offence today but, perhaps this process needs to be looking at some new mechanisms to deal with those persons.</p>

In the Council conclusions in 2013, the Heads of State made it clear that this supervisory mechanism must be backed by an effective backstop. The details of that - whether it will be the ESM or some variation on it, and how it will apply because this provision only applies to the euro area members and there will have to be an equivalent backstop for non-euro area members - is still being worked out.</p>

          <p eId="para_761">The final point, I suppose, goes to the heart of the matter. The biggest issue in Ireland was the cost to the taxpayer, the ordinary person. The banks themselves did not have the capital to soak up the losses. The SRM proposal, which talks of eliminating taxpayers' exposure, appears to indicate that the state-aid procedures will run in parallel. The bottom-line question is, under the resolution mechanism, will the Irish taxpayer have an exposure in the future if an Irish bank fails or requires support?</p>

          <p eId="para_762">The objective of this mechanism is to minimise that exposure by the maximum amount possible. We can never say never because, as the Deputy was saying, we cannot anticipate exactly what will happen.

          <p eId="para_765">I will run through it. The losses are absorbed in accordance with the normal insolvency hierarchy until they are fully absorbed. First are the shareholders, and they are followed by junior debt, all senior debt, bondholders and other creditors. If there are still losses, we move to deposits and, ultimately, we could get to retail deposits. Eventually, we would reach covered deposits but, of course, they will not be bailed in. However, the DGS fund would cover it. However, because it would be preferenced, it is pretty unlikely we will get there. After we have absorbed losses up to 8% of the balance sheet, we can, instead of imposing losses at whatever level we have got to at that stage, look to the fund for an amount equal to 5% of the institution's balance sheet.

          <p eId="para_769">Yes. After that, we can continue to bail in or we could look to this backstop. Nowhere in that process has the taxpayer been called upon. The concept is to keep bailing in until the losses are absorbed.</p>

          <p eId="para_770">There is a specific provision in this resolution proposal that there should be fiscal safeguard provisions so no decision concerning a resolution will have an impact on the fiscal situation in member states. The provision was reviewed by Council legal services, which actually asked that those provisions be strengthened further to make it very clear that the resolution process will not have an impact on national budgets.</p>

          <p eId="para_771">If an institution got into financial trouble and the member state in question had major financial issues, perhaps concerning its ratio of debt to GDP or level of debt, would that state be more likely to have access to the ESM than a country with a similar type of institution that is financially sound and has lower levels of borrowing?</p>

          <p eId="para_776">In regard to the resolution, I believe the Deputy is pointing out to me that some member states might be stronger and in a better position to intervene. That issue has been addressed by an amendment to the state aid rules. A national resolution fund was deemed as state aid and the thinking in this regard has been extended by the European Commission to stipulate that any payment out of the European resolution fund will also be treated as state aid. That will require the kind of restructuring and downsizing we have seen, or the kind of conditionality that is applied to state aid. Even when a strong country chooses to intervene with its own resources, it will still be subject to the guidelines on state aid related restructuring of the institution concerned-----</p>

          <p eId="para_780">All I can say at the moment is that the Lithuanian Presidency is presenting it as something it would like to see completed at the ECOFIN meeting. There are still a large number of open issues to be resolved. There will be a lot of work for Ministers concluded at this ECOFIN but the objective of the Council is to have it concluded by the end of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_781">In layman’s terms, beginning with the SRM, one goes down through the rankings in terms of shareholders and then works down through the normal procedures. Then one gets to a point at which the ESM is effectively a backstop fund for a resolution mechanism. Is that a fair comment?</p>
