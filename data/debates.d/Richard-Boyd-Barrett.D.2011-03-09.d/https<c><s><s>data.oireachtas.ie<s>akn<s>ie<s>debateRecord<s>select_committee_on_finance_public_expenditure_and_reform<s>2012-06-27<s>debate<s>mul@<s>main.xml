There is a technical amendment consistent with our opposition to that section which deals with the extra contributions required from fire fighters, prison officers, members of the Garda and persons in similar categories who must retire earlier because of the nature of their job.  They are being required to make extra pension contributions under section 25.  This section refers to the same issue and on that basis we oppose it.</p>

Certain workers in the public service have fast accrual pensions.  They include fire fighters, members of the Garda, Army personnel and Members of the Oireachtas.  Proportionately, fast accrual is reflected in the increased contribution required from those to whom it applies.  By comparison with the private sector, it is still a good deal.</p>

The Central Bank is part of the euro system and is an independent body under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which states in Article 130 that national central banks must not be interfered with by national governments.  In particular, the Central Bank's guaranteed independence means that it must pay its staff itself.  I have had discussions with the European Central Bank on this matter but in order to give comfort to the European Central Bank, who issued an opinion on this legislation which we sought, the amendments make clear that the Government will not, for example, use Central Bank pension contributions for other financial purposes.  This amendment, therefore, serves to uphold the independence of the Central Bank of Ireland.  It ensures in particular that the Central Bank cannot be liable for financial pension contributions for single pension members other than those in respect of its own staff.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">The definition of the Central Bank and its scope has changed over the years.  Speaking from recollection, we have dealt with legislation governing the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator in the past.  They were separate bodies but they are now under the remit of the Central Bank.  In addition to the Central Bank staff, are the staff of the Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield's section, included in this provision?  The Central Bank is in the process of taking over consumer protection in financial matters which were formerly dealt with as consumer protection by a different Department.  Some of these matters will now be dealt with by Mr. Elderfield.  Will this legislation allow staff who are employed in the consumer protection agency and who now be working on consumer rights in financial services be absorbed?  What is the definition of which staff are included now and in the future?  The remit of the Central Bank can change over the period and this legislation will not have any financial impact until almost 40 years hence when new recruits are retiring in the future, by which time there may not be an Irish Central Bank.  It is hoped there will be a real European Central Bank at that stage.  What number of staff work in the Central Bank because the staff numbers have increased significantly, even though there are fewer banks to regulate?</p>

This is pensions legislation and we are part of a monetary union whose central bank is the European Central Bank, a division of which is the national Central Bank of Ireland.  We have expanded the number of people in the Central Bank on foot of a number of oversight recommendations from groups such as Nyberg, who have made particular proposals about strengthening the oversight role.  We have also reversed some of the decisions to break up the Central Bank made during the light touch regime of a former Government.  Deputy Fleming is correct that the Financial Regulator is now part of the Central Bank structure.  In fact, Matthew Elderfield is a Deputy Governor of the Central Bank.  All of the Central Bank staff, including Matthew Elderfield and his people, are covered by this provision as is anyone who is by definition an employee of the Central Bank.  To be clear, I am advised that this legislation will only impact on new entrants.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">This amendment seeks to allow members of the new single pensions scheme to purchase years of notional service and asks that the Minister publish details of the rates of contribution for notional service before the Bill is enacted.  Many teachers, for example, come to teaching later in life and will not qualify for the 40 year pension.  I will not mention the names of the various insurance companies involved, but many such teachers choose to enter into a private scheme of additional voluntary contributions, AVCs.  These contributions are deducted, with the consent of the Department, directly from the teacher's pay and transferred to the companies concerned.  Many of those who opt to make these additional contributions to bring their pension up to the full amount on retirement are finding that the schemes offer very poor value and that the level of commission charged is high.  It would make far more sense if public servants in that position could supplement their pension contributions by purchasing additional notional service directly from their employer - that is, the State - rather than having to go through a third party.  If that could be done, the tables should be published in order that people would know how much they would have to contribute and what their entitlement would amount to at the end of each year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_58">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_114">The Deputy made a similarly compelling case when we discussed this issue on the previous occasion.  As I told him at the time, I agree that this type of purchase arrangement is a useful facility which should be facilitated.  It is, in fact, facilitated under section 18(<i>b</i>) of the Bill which states referable amounts, as provided for in the Bill, shall include “any other money as represents the transfer value of certain amounts that may be accepted on terms approved by the Minister”.  This will allow for the purchase of additional pension entitlement by way of a purchase arrangement that will be made available to staff.  It is my view that such arrangements should be overseen on an administrative rather than legislative basis.  The Bill contains an overarching enabling mechanism, but the detail will be worked out administratively.  I anticipate that the options will be to purchase additional pension amounts by lump sum, either in one moiety or over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">It should be noted that the single scheme is based on the accrual of money amounts towards pension and lump sum.  That is the whole basis of the new pensions scheme.  It effectively represents a discontinuation of service - in other words, years - as a measure of superannuation titles.  This means that rather than purchasing future years of service, employees will be buying a monetary amount and adding that amount to the value of their pension.  It would be incompatible with the design of this new scheme to insert a service-based element in respect of the purchase of benefits.  I cannot, therefore, accept the methodology set out in the Deputy's amendment, although I agree there should be a provision for augmenting one's pension through direct action.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The Deputy referred to AVCs which are a private vehicle for topping up one's pension.  That option will always be open to people, with various companies designing private schemes for various public service groups - teachers, gardaí and others - to supplement their public scheme provision.  It is appropriate that there be a mechanism for people to supplement their pension by depositing additional monetary value into the scheme or by way of independent private schemes which might prove more attractive over time.  Decisions in this regard are a matter for each individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">On the last occasion the Deputy asked whether teachers could purchase additional service.  The current position is that they can, in accordance with Department of Education and Skills Circular 0129/2006 which sets out the rules applying to such purchases.  I take the opportunity to correct the record on the issue of the provision made for serving or former Oireachtas Members in the public service superannuation scheme.  The Deputy has correctly said the age threshold was retained at 50 years for these persons when the new scheme was introduced, contrary to what I had incorrectly indicated on the basis of the speaking note provided for me.  I hope this clears up any confusion on that point.</p>

However, I remain somewhat confused by some of the specifics the Minister mentioned.  Will he clarify if I understand it correctly, that the facility will allow someone to purchase an additional monetary amount but not additional years of service?</p>

          <p eId="para_120">Will the Minister explain that philosophy?  He is saying that under the current regime teachers can purchase additional years.  People tend to understand their pension entitlement in years of contribution, with 40 years being the full provision.  The Minister is seeking to change this, which, by the way, is not necessarily a bad thing.  Will he clarify, however, how the number of years in employment will no longer be the determining factor?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_62">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_121">We are undertaking a fundamental restructuring of the scheme.  Up until now, all public servants worked towards a notional 40 years of service.  There were fast accruals and other variations, but the basic premise was that one aimed for 40 years of service, after which one received a pension equivalent to 50% of one's final salary which was adjusted into the future with reference to the remuneration of current incumbents of the position one held at retirement.  In very broad, vulgar strokes, this is the regime that has applied up until now.  Employees who would fall short of the 40 year term could opt to purchase additional years in certain circumstances, as set out in the specific schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">The basis for the new scheme is quite different, being based not on the number of years of service but the amount of money contributed.  In other words, one has a monetary value assigned to one's pension fund for every year one works, with the career average worked out on retirement.  This will constitute a person's pension provision which will be benchmarked against the consumer price index.  Again, this is a broad-brush representation of the replacement model.  Employees can purchase additional provisions in the amount of two 80ths for every year worked.  Purchasing an additional extra five years under the old scheme would amount to purchasing ten 80ths under the new, monetarised scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">I thank the Minister for his explanation.  I understand there is a mechanism in place, whereby persons transferring within the public service - say, for instance, a member of a fishery board or the board of a VEC transferring to another body or into the general Civil Service - can bring across their existing pension egg by way of a lump sum payment into their new pension scheme.  According to what the Minister has outlined, this transfer will be reckoned in terms of value of pension rather than length of service.  Will people coming in from the private sector also be able to bring with them a lump sum or will any such arrangements require the involvement of designated bodies, as is currently the case?</p>

Unlike in the past, when someone moved from one organisation to another, it will now be a single, seamless scheme.

          <p eId="para_132">Absolutely.  As the Chairman is aware, that is one of the matters we are considering in the context of the pressures on mortgage holders.  We are attempting to discover whether people might obtain access to some of the moneys involved.  The Chairman is absolutely correct.  In the vast majority of cases involving people who move from the private into the public sector, the preserved benefit would be parked and this would be paid out when they reach normal retirement age.  I am merely referring to what would be the position if there was a mechanism whereby people could liberate their money.  In such circumstances, the capacity to supplement the public scheme will be there.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">For clarity, the relevant fraction will be one 80th.  My mathematical ability let me down.  Under the old scheme, a person could get 50% of his or her final salary if he or she had 40 years' service.  After that, he or she would receive 40, 80ths.  In other words, a person accrues one 80th per year of service.  I apologise for misleading the committee in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">One of the points made in the digest relating to the Bill is that professionals transferring into the public sector are losing the ability to buy service which was available under the old scheme.  I am not disagreeing with the change in this regard, I am merely stating that it is going to make it less attractive for professionals to join the public service.  In the past, people may have taken pay cuts in order to transfer to the public service but they may have enjoyed much better pension arrangements.  Would it be possible for the Minister to supply the committee with a table on which could be listed a few examples?  If it will make matters easier, I could submit a parliamentary question in this regard.  The digest relating to the Bill merely shows what the position would be for someone on €80,000 per year under the old scheme and the new one in the context of his or her pension.  It would be useful if the Minister's officials could provide a few worked out examples of what would be the position in respect of people joining the public service at age 40 or whatever.  Would it be possible for such examples to be provided in order that we might come to grips with this matter in the context of seeing the real numbers involved?</p>

If, therefore, a person has climbed the career ladder to whatever point and if he or she buys further years of service, I presume that this will be more expensive than if he or she had bought in at a lower point.  If their are no regulations in place, this would obviously skew matters.  The entire purpose of the scheme is that the final pension payment will be a reflection of the average one is paid across one's career.</p>

The bottom two groups comprise those who are required to retire early, namely, people who serve in uniform within the State - gardaí, Defence Forces personnel, prison officers and firefighters - and who are not normally allowed to remain in the public service as long as others.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">The point is that one does not have to move up at all because one will get a career average.  If one were to enter the Civil Service now as an administrative officer, one would have no idea of what one's pension would be in 40 years' time because one would not know where one would end up and instead of it being related to one's career average, it is related to the position in which one ends up.  If one ends up as Secretary General, one will have a much more handsome pension under the current regime than one would if one ends up as a higher executive officer because one's pension is related to one's final salary.  Whereas, under the current scheme it is much flatter.  In other words, one's career average is determined from one's position, the number of years one has contributed and the monetary value of one's contribution as an administrative officer, higher executive officer or principal officer.  They are all averaged out and the top element of it is only determined by the number of years one received the pay of a Secretary General.  One will receive a flatter and fairer pension in the future.  It is a preferable system than for someone's pension rate being determined by the fact that he or she spent six or seven years as Secretary General, and for the pension rate to be based on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">I seek clarification on contributions by the Minister.  If, for example, one enters the public service with higher qualifications and goes in at a more senior level, that means one could enter at a high pay rate and then it would plateau quickly at a fairly high level but someone coming in at clerical officer level might have to work for many years to get to a similar level.  When the latter's career earnings are averaged out the pension rate will be dragged down by the fact that he or she started at a low level and was at a low level for a long time.  It strikes me that the opposite to what the Minister said is true; that the majority of public and civil servants who enter at fairly low levels will have their pension entitlement dragged down, whereas people who enter nearer the top of the scale will not suffer as badly from the switch to end-of-career figure to the career average.  That strikes me as a fairly obvious consequence.  Could the Minister explain why that is not the case?</p>

I am required to bring a report to the House, which I will do shortly, on an annual basis to justify its maintenance under financial emergency measures in the public interest.  I do not see that emergency levy as a permanent feature of their contribution.  It is dangerous for them to argue that it should be calculated as a permanent feature because there are those who would say that is fine.

However, the issue I raise is that because of the nature of the job done by these categories of public sector workers who have the right to retire early - firefighters, prison officers, gardaí and so on - they are already paying a higher contribution rate for the pensions they receive and, therefore, this is further penalising them with a higher contribution rate.  Is it not correct that they will be paying more to get less because they will also be subject to the career average provisions of the new scheme?  That is what they think anyway.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">We are now designing a scheme that will relate the contribution more closely to the benefit.  It is self-evident that if one reaches a pension through fast accrual, as a member of the Defence Forces, a member of the Garda Síochána or a Member of this House, one's contribution should be more significant because one is paying over a shorter period to get a benefit quicker.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_315">I wanted to clarify something about which Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke.  The benefit of having a career average is that it stops the practice of promoting people in the last three months of their employment, which in my experience was widespread in the local authorities, which is the area I would know best.  Far from having seven years in a job, as the Minister suggested, some of them did not even have seven months yet they retired on a retirement pension based on their salary in the last three months in some cases.  There would be rapid promotion in the last few years of their employment whereas there was no such benefit for those on the lower scales.  It was a dreadful practice.  It meant also that promotion was for the wrong reason and the wrong people were coming to the top.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">The merit of career averaging is that it stops the Rolls Royce pensions at the very high level.  That is a strong argument in favour of that method.  However, it is fair to say that everybody across the board will lose something because the scale will be flatter.  I assume the Minister has run the figures and that, relatively speaking, he figured out what is the loss for the person who spends their entire career at a clerical officer grade as against those who might move further up the system.  Has the Minister run those figures and does he have-----</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_317">By definition, the Deputy is right.  People who are on flat career averages, for example, a nurse who does not want to be a matron or a staff nurse, someone who spends their life as a nurse, will be relatively unaffected by this new scheme.  Similarly, the career average for someone who goes in as a garda and who does not become a sergeant or an inspector but retires as a garda would be very flat and would be relatively unaffected by that.  Similarly, a clerical officer is relatively unaffected.  The people who will be affected most will be the high flier who goes from administrative officer to Secretary General or from garda, and apparently one must be a garda to enter the Garda Síochána, which is a little odd in itself, to Commissioner.  Instead of that person's Commissioner salary determining his or her pension forever, it will be based on his or her career average, namely, the period of time one is a garda, a sergeant and right through.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">We have done some profiling of it.  It is immeasurably more advantageous for those on a flat career as the ones I have mentioned.  They are relatively unaffected by this whereas there is a very significant reduction for those who have a high trajectory.</p>

Amendment No. 57 should state "to insert 23* before the existing 23 in the Bill and not after.  Does that make sense?  It is on page 9 of the list where it states "Section 18".  Where it states: "In page 23, line 35" the word "after" should be changed to "before".  The same applies in amendment No. 58.  Instead of reading "after 23, to insert 23,*" it should read that it be inserted before 23,*.  The word "after" is being changed to "before" in both of those cases.  Is that understood?</p>

What if an individual forgets to apply for medical or whatever reasons and subsequently realises that he or she was not paid a pension for the preceding 12 months?  It is similar to social welfare benefits in that some people do not know they are entitled to payments.  I could envisage a situation whereby an individual assumed he or she would get the pension and because he or she was in receipt of a gratuity or additional holiday pay, only realises at the end of the year that he or she never received a pension.

For example, the Department of Education and Skills might not be aware that one of its staff is also entitled to a pension from the Department of Defence.  The requirement on individuals to apply for their pensions has always been in place but if somebody is late for health or other reasons, his or her full entitlement would accrue when he or she finally applies.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_366">"(<i>a</i>) an annual pension equivalent to the sum of the referable amounts in respect of each calendar year or part of a calendar year for the pension,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_367">and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_368">(<i>b</i>) a lump sum payment equivalent to the sum of the referable amounts in respect of each calendar year or part of a calendar year for the lump sum.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The intention of this amendment is to remove the benefits cap set out in the Bill as published, which would impose a special ceiling on pensions and lump sums of half pay on net final pay and of 1.5 times final pay on ordinary non-fast accrual on members of the single scheme.  I engaged in detailed discussions on this matter with public service unions and they made a strong case for removing the cap in light of exceptional circumstances where individuals who made contributions might find their final pensions unnecessarily abated.  I do not think the cost to the State is such that I need to persevere with the cap and I am minded to accept the arguments made by the trade unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Due in particular to its career average design, benefit accrual in the new single scheme will not usually approach the half pay limit.  This means that a true half pay ceiling is unlikely to be breached by ordinary scheme members and, therefore, the cap can be set aside without imposing an overly large burden on the State.  A cap could on occasion impose an unwarranted stalling of accrual or even a reduction of already accrued referrable amounts in cases where public servants made job switches to lower paid positions late in their careers.  This sometimes happens where an individual wants to step down to a lower position with less responsibility but does not want to retire.  That should not be discouraged and I listened to the case made by the trade unions that it is desirable in terms of fairness and labour market flexibility to provide for that option.  Where feasible, I want to allow people to step down in late career if they so wish.  I believe this is a sensible decision if we are going to push the age of retirement upwards.  By contrast with current public service schemes, pension accrual in the new single scheme will not stop after 40 years.  As long as one works in the public service one is accruing benefits and adding to one's pension.  On that basis, the retention of a half pay based pension limit, as featured in the scheme, is not appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The Bill as published provided that a career average pension will not exceed 50% of final salary.   The proposal was made in the context of this figure being the existing limit and because the Bill also introduces for all existing public servants a clear public service wide cap of 40 years of service that can be pensionable.  However a final salary link of the type proposed could be unfair to those who in late career step down in terms of grade or job responsibilities.  Accordingly, I am proposing to remove cap in this amendment without creating the risk of accruing significant additional costs to the State.  The cap will be retained for certain categories, including office-holders, politicians and judicial fast accrual classes because, given the longer expected service implicit in the higher pension ages provided for the Bill and the higher accrual rates for these groups, a long serving office-holder could conceivably otherwise breach the half pay limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The argument made earlier that I am providing more generously for office-holders then for the average public servant is reversed in this proposal but I think it is a fair amendment.  The removal of the ceiling on pay is explained by a number of key factors, including in particular the absence of the historical 40 year limit on accrual and the reality that ordinary non-fast accrual members of the single scheme are unlikely to breach pension and lump sum accrual ceilings based on the traditional 1.5 times lump sum and half pension.  The amendment simply removes the proposal in the Bill to limit the pension that could accrue based on half pay.  There will be exceptional circumstances in which people will have worked long enough to breach that cap and I will allow that to happen except in cases of fast accrual.</p>

However, in setting a clear cap on pensions my amendment would not discount this scenario.  The amendment would set a maximum of €60,000 for pensions.  This is a generous ceiling even if it falls far short of the Rolls Royce arrangements that currently exist.  The Minister removed the cap for reasons that are fair but it will no longer be limited to the specific circumstances to which he referred.  It will take account of those circumstances but it is not limited to them.  I am concerned not only that my proposal to set a cap of €60,000 will be unacceptable to him but that the arrangement has been loosened in a way that could be taken advantage of by workers who do not step down a grade.</p>

          <p eId="para_382">The Deputy raised a number of important questions.  In regard to the proposal to introduce a cap of €60,000, it is not appropriate to pick a figure to be included in primary legislation governing pensions which will only begin to be paid in 40 years' time.  I do not know what €60,000 will look like 40 years from now.  The principle of the Deputy's proposal is to reduce pensions.  The programme for Government introduced what I regard as a better formula in this regard by limiting tax supported pension contributions in either the public or private sector to €60,000.  We have not yet found a mechanism for putting that into effect but we continue to consider it in the context of finance Bills.  Such a formula would not be appropriate in this legislation because we are devising a new scheme which provides that net benefits in 40 years' time will depend on contributions.  I do know what currency we will be using in 40 years' time.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">The Minister argues that we cannot arbitrarily include a figure in this legislation but he sees merit in defining a pension ceiling, whether in the Bill or elsewhere.  My frustration comes from his response to my repeated efforts to raise the issue of excessive pensions for those who are currently employed in the upper echelons of the public service.  He has indicated that he is legally precluded from dealing with the issue because the individuals concerned have an expectation and a legal entitlement.  However, when I make a suggestion on a ceiling in the context of this new scheme he offers another argument for why it cannot be done.  Not only can it not be done but the capping mechanism is being removed other than a list of exceptions that is not exhaustive and does not deal with all the senior categories.  When, where and how do we deal with the question of setting a reasonable cap on pensions in the public service?  Notwithstanding career averaging the new scheme could still allow for a scenario in which individuals receive overly generous pensions.  I want that issue to be addressed and I am frustrated that road blocks are thrown up regardless of whether our proposals pertain to current incumbents or future entrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I accept what the Minister has to say in regard to those who decide to take a step back.  There is merit in addressing that scenario but in doing so the exemption is opened to others.  I urge the Minister to reconsider because it would have a negative outcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_397">I have an open mind but I want to get the principle right.  Deputy McDonald has not acknowledged the changes that have already been made.  Secretaries General are not entitled to fast accrual, the added years that used to available under TLAC terms have been abolished this year and the severance arrangements to which they were formerly entitled have been discontinued.  We have fundamentally altered their pension arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The Deputy is correct to note that we have taken careful advice.  The Chairman, as a competent barrister, will know better than I that pensions are a preserved property right.  We cannot arbitrarily change those constitutional rights.  We are instead putting in place a new regime that all sides of the House acknowledge as fairer.  It is a flatter regime and it will not allow for Rolls Royce pensions.  I originally provided for a ceiling but I acceded to the arguments from public service unions by tabling this amendment.  If the amendment throws up anomalies I will happily consider them but I think it is fair.  I do not see many people breaching the half pay limit.  It is somewhat anachronistic at a time when we are replacing references to pay with a contribution based model.  Should individuals be debarred from making significant contributions in order to build up a more generous pension?  I do not think so on balance.</p>

My interaction with the trade union movement was fair.  The trade unions said this is a new scheme, which moves away from relating end of career pay to level of pension, yet one is arbitrarily picking end of career pay as a ceiling on one's pension despite the move to a different method of calculation and a different timeline in terms of 40 years not being the average length of service any more.  That is a fair point.  I kept the cap because I want to be fair and I did not want people who are in some categories of fast accrual getting pensions that are more generous than is reasonable.  All in all, this is a very fair and balanced set of proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">As with Deputy McDonald, I see the rationale behind removing the cap in so far as it does not penalise ordinary public or civil servants from making some extra contributions, particularly given the fact that they may be working longer.  They should be allowed to do that and not be penalised for doing so.  That seems entirely reasonable, but I question the way in which the Minister is doing it.  First, particular categories are not included and there is nothing in the legislation to prevent those categories getting large pensions.  I have mentioned two - Secretaries General and county managers, who are high earners in the public service.  In the case of Secretaries General, a group about whom there is a great deal of anger regarding large pension entitlements, if my understanding is correct, there is nothing in the legislation, as a result of removing the cap, that stops them walking away with enormous pensions.  I would appreciate if the Minister would return to me later on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I do not have a problem with the vast majority of public or civil servants having a decent pension.  I do not have a problem with somebody who is on a fairly low salary throughout most of their career getting a pension of more than 50% of their average pay if they were earning an average of €30,000 to €40,000 per annum.  Why should they not have more than that, based on their contributions?</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_435">That is reasonable.  On the other hand, it opens it for people who are on very high salaries to make large contributions towards the end and get tax breaks on them.  If I am correct, and the Minister can clarify the position, people who make large pension contributions are entitled to tax breaks.  It would be a way for people who are high earners essentially to avoid paying a certain amount of tax and walking away with a nice substantial pension.</p>

          <p eId="para_436">The Deputy is quite right in that the intention of the amendment is to do that on foot of the request from the trade union movement to address the situation where people who have been in a prolonged career want to step back to lower paid work, but want to have the full value of the contributions made over the total time of their career.  I think that is reasonable.  I propose to maintain the ceiling, which is fairly arbitrary because why would one have half final salary in the context of this new scheme?  However, I wanted to create a ceiling for fairness.  The 50% ceiling on final salary will apply, if this Bill is enacted, to the President, all officeholders, including the Attorney General, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, members of the Government, the Ceann Comhairle, and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the people covered in section 24 which are the designated officeholders, including the Ombudsman and so on, the Judiciary and all Oireachtas Members.  Who else should be subject to the ceiling?  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned Secretaries General.</p>

Most will be a Secretary General for seven years, but it is their career average salary over 40 year to 45 years that will determine their pension.  There is no fast accrual for them.  They should not be uniquely penalised because they are in the ordinary accrual category like everybody else.</p>

Is he saying that, based on the fact that Secretaries General and similar high paid civil and public servants are not in a category that has fast accrual, they will not retire on a pension above 50% of final salary?  If that is the case, I begin to wonder at the possible arbitrariness of some of the grades that have been designated - for example, a person who is a member of the Labour Court.  Is that because the person is a judge?</p>

The advantage of setting a figure of €60,000 - in fact, I would go a bit lower, because who needs more than €50,000 when they retire - or whatever figure we choose, is that it has the advantage of being easily understood and not obscure from the public's point of view.  They may have difficulty with an obscure formula because it may be difficult to understand what it means.  The public is concerned about people, such as politicians and top level public or civil servants, walking away with massive pensions.  What is so difficult about naming a figure that is meaningful now, such as €50,000 or €60,000 and updating it periodically at budget time?  It could be based on inflation or just general appreciation of salaries and so on.  Would that not be easier for people to understand and more transparent in terms of setting a cap on the amount with which people could walk away?</p>

If pensions became subject to even 4% or 5% inflation one would be very fast running out of money and unable to put bread and butter on the table.  I ask him to remember that.  Inflation is the great killer of pensions because unless they are inflation proofed one is left literally stranded when the tide goes out and one will not put bread and butter on the table.  That is what happened pensioners in the 1970s.  It was a very real experience.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">This is one of the most important elements in the legislation because a great deal hinges on a figure of €44,944 implicit in this section.  The calculation of retirement benefits will be based on a formula, and the formula hinges around a figure in the main section 19, which deals with contributions, but there are different levels of contributions up to 3.74 times the contributory State pension.  The contributory State pension is approximately €230 per week, which is €5,000 a month, and 3.74 times that brings it up to a figure of €44,944.  The essence of that figure is very important in that it is a figure on which the Minister wanted to put some equalisation or floor in the pension contributions for public servants.  My understanding is that 3.74 times the contributory State pension is €44,944, above which the level of contribution changes.  There is one level of contribution below that figure and above it there is a higher level of contribution.  I understand the Minister's Department went to the Labour Court on this issue.</p>

I know we love to do everything by agreement but as a general principle the Minister's Department, as the employer, came up with a figure.  It went to the Labour Relations Commission.

When the Minister's Department was at the Labour Relations Commission as an employer, and the public sector unions were there representing their employees or possible future employees, who was there representing the taxpayer?  It is not always the same to wear the employer's hat because an employer's job in those circumstances is to get an agreement.  We may not like the agreement but we got an agreement and therefore we can go along with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">In terms of the purpose of my amendment, if the formula for the calculation of retirement benefits is 3.74 times the value of the contributory State pension, the Minister should publish the basis for such a formula.  In this amendment I am asking the Minister to supply to the public, not just to me, how that figure was reached.  I am not talking about it being the outcome of a Labour Relations Commission adjudication.  That is not adequate.  We know that.  I want to know the Minister's view, the case he made and, ultimately, the reason he is accepting this particular decision.  This is a financial issue, not just a labour relations issue.  I am not saying the figure is right or wrong but I do not know the discussions that took place to arrive at it.  We should know that because I would call this a fulcrum figure on which a great deal hinges in terms of the calculation of contributions and benefits that will emerge out of this process.  The Minister might give us some information on that following which I will pursue the matter with him.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">I do not believe the Deputy's amendment is necessary but he did not argue for the amendment.  He argued a different case which was to explain the basis for the calculation figures in the Bill.  The Bill sets out in section 19 how the calculation is done.  To be blunt, I am proposing a figure.  The Deputy can agree or disagree with it.  I do not have to give the rationale for the way Government arrived at that figure.  It was a figure we worked out that is reasonable.  It was a figure that went to the Labour Relations Commission.  My Department was represented there as employer and as a representative of the taxpayer.  We listened to the case.  We made our own case, and this is the figure I am now proposing on behalf of the Government that I brought to Government and on which the Government settled.  I can give the Deputy a briefing note on it that might lay it out for him but it is only the technical impact of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">On the reason we picked that 0.58% of the scheme's pensionable remuneration for that year and the actual numeric value of each one, I cannot justify every single figure and say it should have been a percentage point one way or the other.  This is what I am proposing, and I believe it is fair and reasonable.  It is what the Government has agreed and is what I am proposing to enshrine in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_457">I am genuinely amazed that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is telling this committee, which is discussing the future pension rates for public servants, and where this figure of €44,944 has been extracted as 3.74 times the contributory State pension, that he does not have to give its members the rationale for what he is doing.  I am surprised by that response.  The Minister sounded arrogant, although that may not have been his intention.  He just said, "Here is the figure".  He is telling us he does not have to explain the rationale for how it was arrived at.</p>

I am the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and my Department and the officers of my Department represent the taxpayer in these negotiations and we were involved in negotiations through the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court with the public service unions all the time.  I can give the Deputy the basis for the calculation and will give him a technical note on it.  However, if he suggests it should be a percentage point more or less, that is a matter for debate.  We believe the calculation is fair and will achieve the target of reduced pension contributions of 35% over the time we have set.  It will provide a fair basis for people in the public service in the future and is a different and flatter and fairer system of accrual.  That is the principled argument I need to give.  However, I can give the Deputy a technical note on the actual sums if that is of benefit to him and, having read it, we can report on it on Report Stage.</p>

However, my understanding is that the Department, representing the taxpayer, had a view on this issue and went to the Labour Relations Commission and that what we have here is as a result of the decision in the Labour Relations Commission, but perhaps I am wrong about that.  If that is the case, I would be happier if the Minister said that this was the figure the Department had arrived at as fair, reasonable and correct, taking all things into account.  I would accept that.  However, I have difficulty with the fact that the figure here is not the figure the Minister felt was the right one, but one decided by the Labour Relations Commission, which is an industrial relations body not concerned with looking after the taxpayer's interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">The point the Deputy appears to be making is that in advance of preparing a fundamental changed basis for the pension entitlements of public servants we should not have engaged with the unions and with the structure of industrial relations interaction that has served the State well.  The principle we brought to the trade union movement, the one the Government wanted to achieve, is to have a career averaged pension scheme accepted.  With regard to the argument put forward in terms of the numbers, we had to listen to a case, there had to be a fair base level and we had to ensure those on the lowest pay were protected.  A robust presentation was made by both sides and a recommendation was made by the Labour Relations Commission.  With regard to the principles we have achieved in this Bill, the trade union side is not happy by and large because it is not as good a pension scheme for many people as exists now.  However it is fairer.  The principles of career average, a later pension age and future pensions not being tied to final salary but linked to the consumer price index, CPI, are important principled changes into which we have bought.  We nudged figures here and there to get agreement on them and, by and large, the recommendations of the Labour Relations Commission were the ones we have accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">I mentioned salaries up to €45,000.  The chart demonstrates the figures for pensions for those on salaries up to €170,000 and we referred to it during Second Stage debate.  In essence, it shows there are no savings from salaries up to €45,000.  That is fine, because we all agree with the principle that the pension of someone on a salary of €45,000 should not be reduced as a result of this new scheme.  Most of us would agree with that.  However, the figures for those on salaries up to €170,000 show the saving will only be approximately 10%, even from someone on €170,000.  The difference between the old scheme and the new scheme would only be a reduction of approximately 10%.  However, the Minister has said the scheme will achieve a saving of, possibly, 35%.  I have not met anybody who can reconcile that with the charts produced in the digest.  They show the maximum saving at the highest salary of only 10%.</p>

Also, it will be linked to CPI in the future, as opposed to being linked to the incumbent in the position.  Those two factors are not represented in the chart.  I do not have the chart in front of me, but from what the Deputy has said, those factors are not replicated in it.</p>

They came to a similar conclusion to what is in the Oireachtas digest and could not understand how those figures gelled with those of the Minister.  We want to be able to marry the two.  There is no point in us going out and saying this will bring a saving of 35%  when other people are saying it will only be a saving of 10%.

Their point is that under the new scheme their contributions will be even greater with no extra benefit.

It is fair that people, whether members of the Defence Forces, gardaí or Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, who get their pensions more quickly should pay more for them.  That is all that is expected.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">With regard to section 25, I have met representatives of the Prison Officers Association who expressed serious concern about this section.  The multiplier being used for fast accrual groups under the proposed new single scheme does not bring their future pensions up to a similar percentage as the future pensions of grades not operating fast accrual.  I am talking about their pension scales, future pension scales and benefits.  For example, under the proposed new single scheme a higher executive officer will get a pension somewhere between 85% and 91% of the present pension.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_453">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_628">I am relaying what prison officers said to me.  I am sure they have taken account of the factors mentioned by the Minister, so that the new pension entitlement of a higher executive officer will be somewhere between 85% and 91% of the current pension.  However, the multiplier for fast accrual grades under the proposed new single scheme will bring the pension of a prison officer to only 80% of the present pension.  Prison officers acknowledge, as we all do, that the purpose of the new scheme is to reduce the pensions of future entrants into the public service.  They are saying, however, that the pensions of higher executive officers will be reduced to somewhere between 85% and 91% of the current pension while those in a fast accrual scheme will see their pensions reduced to 80% of the current pension.  It was their understanding that future entrants would be worse off, but not worse off relative to other grades.  They believe this will be the case, because the fast accrual issue is seriously affecting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">I asked the prison officers about the position of gardaí, soldiers and firefighters because I had not heard from those groups directly to the same extent.  That may be because two of the biggest prisons in the country are in my constituency.  The prison officers felt the other groups may not be aware of this effect of the new scheme and were not pursuing the matter.  Prison officers are satisfied that new entrants will be significantly worse off, relative to other public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">I am not happy with the section, in light of what I am being told by people in my constituency who have looked at the new scheme from their own perspective.  I will be submitting an amendment on Report Stage on this issue.  I did not get an opportunity to do so in time for Committee Stage.</p>

They have made the point to us.  The presentation they made to Deputy Fleming they made to us in terms of picking the most advantageous comparator they can.  We have looked at it and they are getting a very good deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The most important aspect of the deal they are getting is that they will get their pension at a much earlier age than anybody else, which was really an extraordinarily good deal.  For example, members of the Garda Síochána will get their pension entitlement at 55 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">I do not have that in front of me, but let me say this to Deputy Donnelly.  First, we are talking about select groups of public servants, for example, the gardaí.  We ask them, to use the Americanism, to go in harm's way and the State recognises that.  We want to contribute more to their support because, by definition, they must retire earlier.  They need to be physically fit.  It is a strenuous job.  They are out there on the street.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Actuarially, no doubt they are more advantaged.  I cannot give Deputy Donnelly a figure in terms of the net benefit.  We have an in-house actuary who works on all of these matters, but we are working on the basis of what is there already as well and the acknowledgement of public service duty.

For all of the reasons the Minister outlined, there are those specific categories of staff who must accrue more quickly because they work shorter service because of the nature of the function that they carry out.  In the current regime, those fast accrual groups can get 40 years benefit for 30 years service.</p>

As I understand it, they will be disadvantaged under the new regime.  Those workers understand that under the new scheme change will affect them just as it affects every other worker but it is only fair for those workers, fire fighters, gardaí, etc., that some kind of parity be maintained and that they not be disadvantaged.  Would the Minister respond because I am sure he and his Department have run the figures?  Is it true to say that fast accrual categories are disadvantaged under the new scheme or am I wrong?  Can the Minister assure us, and give us the basis for that assurance, that it still remains a 40 year contribution although 30 years service given?</p>

          <p eId="para_647">The scheme impacts on everybody.  If Deputy McDonald is asking me to compare the old scheme and the new scheme, across the board staff would be disadvantaged because we are trying to save money.  In terms of the integrity of the scheme relative to other accrual rates, however, these categories of workers are very significantly advantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">First, they have fast accrual from their first day of service.  Under the existing scheme they get double accrual after 20 years service to give them the cushion towards the end but now they will have the fast accrual rate applying to their public service pension from the first year.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Added to that, they have the really plum addition of getting their pension from a much earlier age than everybody else.  It depends on the category.  If one is in the Permanent Defence Forces, one does well as he or she gets the pension from 50.  The gardaí and prison officers will get it from 55.  Actuarially, that is a significant advantage to them.  Within the integrity of the new scheme, I can assure Deputy McDonald they are not disadvantaged relative to their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other workers under the old scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_652">The nub of this is the level of consultation in which the Minister has engaged specifically with the representatives of these categories of workers.  I am looking at figures that suggest a relative disadvantage for some of nearly 23%.  These are the figures available to me.  I presume the Minister has figures.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">People make a case, as I stated to Deputy Fleming in Deputy McDonald's absence.  These are fast accrual groups which would like faster accrual and their unions make that case.  Deputy Donnelly, on the other side, makes the case of asking what is the actuarial cost of this to the taxpayer, and it is significant.  There is a balance to be drawn between acknowledging staff, such as prison officers, members of the Defence Forces or members of An Garda Síochána, whom we put in harms way in the interests of the State and the people to give them a good deal relative to all other workers but not, as Deputy McDonald would say, a Rolls Royce deal.  It is a fair deal.  They get fast accrual.  They are advantaged in the ways of which I spoke - fast accrual from day one, a fair career average in a much shorter time and their pension paid in full from a much earlier age.</p>

The increase from seven to ten in regard to the referable amount multiplier is considered appropriate on the basis that the threshold of seven is less than the ten years that can currently be added in certain cases.  The fact that the referable amounts are calculated in the most recent year means they are more valuable than the average of the career average scheme.  It is also the case that the new scheme is not counting service and, therefore, the added years comparison is not valid and ten years will remain a cap or outside limit on the norm.

Although his amendment cannot be moved, I hope he will accept mine.  The use of the term "actual" in this context could have adverse consequences on those cases where, for example, an employer had elected to work-share or was otherwise on reduced pay immediately before death.  It would not be unusual for persons in poor health to have reduced remuneration in the period immediately preceding their death if, for instance, they were on half pay or pension-related pay.  What is intended here is that the normal pensionable remuneration attaching to the job should determine the value of the lump sum payable on death.  It is an issue Deputy Fleming has articulated very well on previous occasions.  His argument was convincing enough for me to support him.</p>

The provisions in this section are now included in the new section covering survivors' entitlement to pension, as set out in amendment No. 148.  The new section provides that one survivor's pension may be payable, save in cases where a deceased person had an entitlement to more than one public service pension.  For example, someone whose public service spouse has died would receive a pension, but this would cease if he or she remarries.  If the second spouse is a single scheme pensioner and also dies, the person would not be entitled to a pension in respect of the first former spouse and a pension in respect of the second former spouse.

I wonder, however, whether it would make more sense to have this the other way around, that is, where one is the spouse of a deceased public sector worker, one will receive the latter's pension.  If one subsequently marries a second public servant, one would not be entitled to the latter's pension on his or death, save any differential if the second pension is larger than the first.  If I understand correctly, where a first spouse dies, one is entitled to his or her pension in perpetuity unless one remarries, in which case one loses it.  That seems bizarre.

          <p eId="para_777">The distinction between the widow's or widower's pension and this is that one is a social welfare pension in recognition of somebody's family status and circumstances.  This is an occupational pension.  Can the Minister tell the committee what is the standard practice in the private sector?  This is not a question of a pension for a widow or widower; it is a survivor's benefit that has been paid for by the deceased worker over a period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The Minister will note that the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions recognises this as being as perverse as Deputy Donnelly has said it is.  The report recommended that it should be changed, not least because the traditional view of how one treats dependants had a working assumption that the remaining spouse was female with children, and that should that person remarry or cohabit it would replace the lamented departed with another provider.  It is based on an outmoded view of things.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">This is contained in section 33.  There is a distinction between a social welfare payment and an occupational payment.  I understand that in the private sector where somebody is bereaved and is entitled to an occupational benefit, it is not confiscated from that person in the event that they cohabit or remarry.  I have an associated question.  In circumstances where there is an issue in the family law courts, such as a divorce or separation, orders are placed on pensions and a deal is reached whereby the divorce or separation agreement may be granted.  Let us imagine that one fasts forward and the primary pension-holder dies, but the person has moved into a new relationship, has the Minister tested this legislation in terms of its adequacy?  Is it fit for purpose and is it in line with the body of family law?</p>

          <p eId="para_781">I am advised that the European norm is that a survivor's pension ends on remarriage.  Are there pensions whereby they can preserve pensions after remarriage?

          <p eId="para_784">I am opposing the section on the grounds that we have been discussing it as part of the amendment.  The Minister can see the disquiet involved.  I know that on the one hand, wearing his ministerial hat, the Minister is always keen to point out this generous pension scheme for public servants.  Public servants have contributed to this scheme, however.  This is not like a means-tested social welfare pension.  I know the Minister is trying to integrate apples and oranges here.  One is something where people have made a contribution, while the other is a means-tested payment which is not dependent on any contribution.</p>

It is normally Deputy Donnelly who gets agitated by these provisions.

However, both pensions could be quite small and might not even add up to the amount of a full pension.  The person might have been married for only a few years in both cases thus the amount involved would be quite minimal.  What is the Minister trying to save from this?  The previous section makes generous provision for the person on sick leave while this section makes life difficult for widows and widowers.</p>

For example, where the spouse of a public servant who dies remarries and his or her new partner is violent or a barring order is taken out against him or her and so on the saver clause can be used to reactivate the pension which had been stopped upon his or her marriage.</p>

          <p eId="para_822">Traditionally, women had to retire when they got married.  This smacks of the same type of measure.  While I understand the principle to which the Minister refers there is a different principle here, namely, where one person is working in paid employment and the other is at home raising children.  For example, a TD the husband or wife of whom is doing a huge amount of work supporting him or her, raising the children and so on, which work is unpaid and non-pensionable.  The principle would be that both of those people have essentially contributed to the pensionable earnings and, therefore, the widow or widower is paid half the pension, which is reasonable.  However, that is not a handout.  There is a whole different principle that says that that person has contributed in a wide variety of non-paid ways to the wage.  We all know as TDs that our partners do a huge amount of work in the background.  There is a different principle here which says both partners are contributing.  What this does is say we are giving the person a hand-out because we feel sorry for him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">As stated by Deputy Fleming, a widow or widower of a deceased public servant who lives with a second person for a year loses entitlement to the pension and may or may not get it back for the next 20 years.  I am asking the Minister to reconsider that provision.  I would argue that the partner has earned his or her half of the pension.  However, traditionally in our society we do not recognise that.  Perhaps the Minister would reflect on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_859">I know our amendments have been ruled out of order.  Amendment No. 110 proposed that annual lodgements or referable amounts accrued under the scheme would be increased or uprated in line with salary increases or inflation, whichever is greater.  Will the Minister consider the point we made on Second Stage on this issue?  He should respond to it on this section.  There could be negative inflation during retirement.  We have had negative inflation here in recent years.  Normally legislation is drafted on the basis that inflation will always increase.  However, it could be negative or it could be marginally above 0% with salary increases somewhat higher.  We know the idea is to break the link between pensions and current salaries but we need to consider inflation, particularly where it is negative.</p>

          <p eId="para_862">I outlined the principles behind the new scheme.  One of them is to break the link with final salary and introduce a CPI-based indexation of pensions for new pensioners.  It is an essential part of the savings we intend to accrue.  As I stated earlier with regard to the table referenced by Deputy Fleming, I do not think CPI indexation was part of the calculation but it is part of our calculation with regard to what we need to save for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">To ensure we have affordable pensions the idea is that when people enter the public service we want to be as clear as we can that at the end of their careers they will have pensions.  This is part of the reason we are making the adjustments we are, namely, to ensure a robust and fair system is in place.  The CPI is a valve; it cannot be reduced if there is deflation in any year.  It can only move forward where inflation is added to the current moiety.  I think it is a fair system.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">The Minister will decide on the timing of any pension increase under this section that results from changes in the consumer price index.  That is arbitrary.  Those who contribute to pensions in the knowledge that consumer price index adjustments may be made when they retire want a guarantee that such adjustments will happen.  This section will give the Minister discretion over the timing and payment of increases.</p>

The Minister will not have the power to decide not to increase the pension from the date on which the increase is due.  The Minister is merely being given the power to have the administrative space in which to do it retrospectively.</p>

          <p eId="para_892">It will save the State approximately 35%.  As we said earlier when we discussed the career average, it is difficult to see precisely where these savings will come from.  The switch to the consumer price index is one of the three main new elements of the pensions regime.  Obviously, the Minister thinks the State will have to pay less when a pension is linked to the consumer price index than it would have to if the pension was linked to the final salary of the recipient.  We oppose this approach for that reason alone.  The impact of the use of this system will not distinguish between higher paid civil servants and low and middle-income civil servants.  We would not subscribe to a reduction in the pension entitlements of low and middle-income civil servants.  As I see it, this is a mechanism that can be used to cut their pension entitlements.  In addition to that issue, the issue of the power that is being given to the Minister also arises.  Under the current scheme, if somebody in the relevant grade gets a pay increase, the pensioner automatically gets a proportionate increase in his or her pension.  There is no ministerial discretion - the pensioner gets the increase - and there is no time lag.</p>

Section 39(4) provides that "the Minister shall decide when any increase in pensions under this section is to be paid having regard to movements in the consumer price index, including the timing and the means by which any increase is paid".  That will give the Minister of the day enormous discretion to delay the payment of increases or, as the Minister has just indicated, not to pay them at all in what might be construed as exceptional circumstances.

In other words, it is "when" rather than "whether".  I would be concerned if the impression was given that the committee was overseeing some set of exceptional circumstances in which the making of payments under this scheme could be avoided.  That does not appear to be the case.  I am not intervening in the discussion.  Like everyone else, I am operating on the basis of my reading of the Bill and the amendments.  I am speaking for the purposes of clarification when I say I cannot see any reference to exceptional circumstances in which a Minister could determine of his or her own volition that payments due under the scheme we are legislating for should not be paid.

This would be an advantage.  The old idea was that a person got pension rises linked to pay rises.  There have not been pay rises so pensions have been flat just as pay in the public service has been - in fact it has gone backwards.  In addition, there has been a levy on pensions which is linked to the consumer price index.  Right now, therefore, if it was in operation this scheme would be much more advantageous than the existing one because pensioners would be entitled to the consumer price index increase, as opposed to being linked to a wage increase.</p>

Now, under this scheme, the wage rise will be CPI-linked so the worker will get the same in percentage terms, whether he or she is a clerical officer or a Secretary General, a retired private or a general of the Army, as opposed to the big moiety of money a Secretary General, a general of the Army, or a Garda Commissioner might get.

          <p eId="para_924">My point is that the two imperatives, the claim made by the Minister on the one hand, and the imperative to make 35% savings, which would be made by these measures, do not add up. It would be less advantageous to the pensioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">The Minister stated that the Minister for Finance could decide to be more generous to a particular class of pensioner.  Presumably, he means the Minister could distinguish between those who might need an increase more, and those who might be deemed to need it less, for whom it would be delayed.  That paints a picture of a very benign Minister.  However, the actual wording of the legislation gives the Minister total flexibility.  "Timing" can potentially equate to not paying the increase at all.  A Minister could say he or she was not paying the increase for five, ten, or fifteen years.  The wording in question allows total flexibility for the Minister to make the decision as to whether he or she will award the increase.  The Minister will decide when is the appropriate time or if it is appropriate.  That is the reality.  The excuse of an emergency or exceptional circumstances could be used at any point in order not to give people their entitlements in terms of pension increases.  That is as against the current system whereby they would have had some certainty about getting those increases.</p>

          <p eId="para_975">The last line on the section in the explanatory memorandum states: "Nothing in this section prevents the relevant authority making arrangements for the payment as its agent of any retirement benefit through another relevant authority or a third party."  Does that facilitate the privatisation of the administration of the public service pensions?  I think it does.  I can understand the reference in it to the relevant authority.  I could understand if the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government were to handle the job on behalf of all local authorities or if one body in the public service were to deal with all pensions, as I have suggested, rather than having 100 different organisations doing it and the level of duplication of administration that involves.  There could be a relevant authority but the provision allows for a third party.  It might be organised on a contract basis but it could facilitate the private sector in terms of the outsourcing of the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_976">No.  That is not what is intended.  The Deputy is correct in that pensions administration is one of the issues on our checklist for shared services.  We are doing this in respect of human resource management and payroll and we will migrate into pensions to have a common public service pension provider within the public service.  That is what the intention is but I need to capture within it the reality of the position now.  We have migrated new bodies into the public service pension scheme because of their vulnerability, as in the case, for example, of Trinity College, which has a scheme operated by Mercer, which is a private operator.  There are numerous other schemes like that which are captured in the public sector scheme but would be operated by private individuals in the interim and that might continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_986">I am not going to oppose the section but I want to speak on it.  I have an issue with it as my understanding of it is that it puts all the liability for overpayment on the payee and none of the liability on the payor.  We had a situation recently where people on various pensions were paid too much.  Many of them did not know they were being paid too much.  They were taking the money and spending it in good faith.  This sort of correction caused an awful lot of problems for people.  My concern with this section is that over a long period of years the pensioners or their survivors could get €200, €500, €1,000 or €2,000 more through no fault of their own - having completed all the paperwork, they are receiving in good faith exactly what they think they should be getting - and ten years down the line someone sees an error and tells them they owe back €20,000.  This puts all the liability for that on the person who received the money in good faith.  It does not seem balanced.</p>

I refer the Deputy to subsection (2) which states that it may be agreed between the parties concerned, with the consent of the Minister, that an overpayment may be repaid in a form including a reduction of any benefit payable under the scheme or it can be repaid in accordance with the payment schedule so that it could be averaged out over time.</p>

          <p eId="para_999">Section 39 dealt with the CPI, the consumer price index.  I understand that section 39 provides that the consumer price index may now be applied to pre-existing public service pension schemes.  This is intended to be a new system for new employees but in section 46 the Minister seems to be giving himself the power to make this change applicable to the current system.  I thought we were dealing solely with new entrants but the Minister seems to wish to be able to extend this provision to pre-existing public service pension schemes, namely, the current scheme.  The wording of my amendment is designed to discuss the issue so that a period of consultation with all interested stakeholders would apply before the Minister makes changes.  I chose that wording because if I put in what I wanted it to do, it would probably be ruled out of order.  Why is section 46 included in the Bill?</p>

If we believe in the fairness of consumer price indexing, then we need to reflect on why it would not be applied to current pensioners in the future.  The Deputy's amendment proposes consultation.  There have been detailed consultations on all the elements of this Bill.  This provision will not be possible to be activated in the lifetime of the Croke Park agreement so it will not be an immediate prospect.  I am minded to leave the authority with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to change from linking to the consumer price index future pay increases to incumbents in the job they last held for the same reason I am moving it in the new scheme that we might do it in the future.  There is no firm intent to do it; it is simply giving the authority to the Minister to do this in the future.  From my perspective, before I would activate this measure, I would certainly involve myself in discussions with the relevant trade unions in this regard.</p>

It is a power which the Minister exercises and it would require new legislation to have the calculation changed.

There was a reduction of up to 20% for anybody on a pension of over €100,000.  I would have gone further, as I have said previously, but the advice I received was that any more would have put the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation in constitutional peril.

It is concerned with pre-existing public sector workers.  Heretofore, if there was inflation in the economy, the unions would negotiate with the Minister for pay increases.  Those pay increases would be reflected in the pensions of pensioners in those grades.  To break that link is a wrong move, from that point of view, in the context of section 39, which gives the Minister of the day that flexibility.  That is one of the reasons we oppose it.  Bord na Móna workers are out on strike today demanding pay increases that they were guaranteed.  There are sections of workers who in the future may seek pay increases on the basis of inflation and so forth.  That is the reason we are opposing the section, particularly given that people have had pre-existing arrangements which they have worked with for the last 50 or 60 years.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1092">In page 50, lines 1 and 2, to delete paragraph (<i>b</i>) and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1093">"(<i>b</i>) the pensioner is appointed to a position in respect of which remuneration is paid by a public service body,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">Section 51, as published, provides that where a pension is payable by a public service body to a public service pensioner, and the pensioner receives any remuneration from any public service body, then during this time no more than the pension shall be paid that such, with the remuneration, equals the pensionable remuneration that the pensioner would have received if he or she was once again working in the position in which he or she served in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">I may remove any doubt or question arising from the section.  The section provides that I may waive the abatement provision if persons with a particular training or experience are required for particular work in the public service body concerned and it is not practical to meet that requirement otherwise than through the employing of a pensioner.  This is an important matter because there has been a good deal of debate on rehiring people.  There is an abatement rule and I am making it clear that the abatement rule should apply but there will be exceptional circumstances.  On advice that I have received from the Army, in particular, and the Garda, if there is a particular job that must be filled in the public service and I cannot get anybody to do it other than the Department of Defence or the Garda Síochána, then I have the flexibility to allow a more generous situation to apply on a temporary basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_1098">The Minister has substantially reiterated current practice.  There must be a lot of cases, especially with the requirement that people work until 68 years of age.  Let us take the example of a garda who retires in his 50s on possibly half of his salary but he could get another job in the public service, even one that is unconnected with his previous post.  His salary could be higher than half of his previous salary.  How does the provision apply to nurses who retire on a pension, receive a gratuity lump sum and return to work on the following Monday through an agency?</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">I know what the Minister will say but I am worried about the scenario.  I shall not go into detail about a particular case.  I have received a response from the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, about agency staff operating in several hospitals and the large number of agency staff used.  I know some of them personally and I know that they retired on a Friday yet they were told just beforehand that they were needed on the following Monday, they took their lump sum-----</p>

They were advised by their superior before they left that they should register with a particular agency and they would be back to work on the following Monday.  I have often pursued such issues.  How does the provision capture the person who returns for agency work?  I do not think that it does.  Does it?  Is there any way that the Minister can deal with such a scenario?</p>

          <p eId="para_1108">I would welcome any suggestion from the Deputy but I do not see a way around it.  The provision is intended to ensure that a pensioner's total income from salary and pension does not exceed the salary that he or she would have had if he or she had not retired from the public service.  In order to get a pension the bulk of your working career, presumably, would have been spent in a particular career path.  If you come back then you should not be able to get your retirement pension plus another public service payment.  It seems to me that such a move is unfair.  Most of the people to whom the provision applies would be fast accrual people-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1111">There were anomalies in the system and the Bill will rectify them.  If one rejoined the public service and worked in the same sphere as previously then a person's pension was abated but often if one went into a different sphere the pension was not abated.  It will all be abated under these provisions but prospectively and going forward rather than for incumbents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">The Deputy mentioned people who return as private employees on a contract basis.  I do not know how such a scenario can be captured but I shall reflect on it further.  I would be happy to hear any suggestion from the Deputy on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1158">Let us take the example of a person who is discharged from his or her duties but takes a case of unfair dismissal.  The objective body, the court that examined the case, then decides, due to a case put forward by the employer, that the person has breached their contract, and that the employer, either the State, body or board, was right to dismiss.   It could either be the State, a State body or board, dismissing a chief executive for not doing his or her job.  There is a point to be made if the court ruled that the dismissal was fair, based on those circumstances, and the organisation experienced a loss or the Irish taxpayer.  I know that it is a narrow point but it is a way, as part of public sector reform, to make people accountable for their well paid jobs.  The upside is that a person in a senior position earns a good salary but there should be a downside when a person does not do the job.</p>

          <p eId="para_1290">The purpose of this amendment is to provide for aggregation of public service pensions for the purpose of applying the public service pension reduction under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation.  The public service reduction currently applies separately to each individual public service pension which was in payment before 1 March 2012.  For those who retired after that date their pensions were reduced by reference to the pay cut.  Going forward, this aggregation will apply to all public service pensioners who receive two or more public service pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">Members will recall that I indicated previously that I wanted to have a 20% reduction on pensions above €100,000 and I discovered that for some categories of people, pensions were not aggregated.  If a Secretary General retired on a pension greater than €100,000, the entire pension could be abated but a former Taoiseach's two pensions - a Deputy's pension and a ministerial pension - were not aggregated.  I propose to aggregate those and all pensions in order that everybody will be treated in like manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_1297">It is only for people who have separate pensions that are not aggregated.  This is a far-reaching provision.  There are many people who will be affected by this provision - we have got to treat it in this way - who have more than one pension that is not necessarily known to the authorities.  I will have to find a formula to write to people and ask them to declare to the paying authority in each case if they are in receipt of a public pension in order that they can be aggregated for pension reduction purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">When the legislation is in place, public service pension scheme administrators will be required to forward details, for example, PPS numbers and annual pension payments of all active pension cases, at the end of the grace period.  An administrative system to facilitate aggregation will be put in place in my Department.  In essence, I want to ensure everybody is treated in the same way.  It addresses the notion that if one's pension came from one paying authority it was subject to a greater reduction than if one had two pensions payable by two separate public service paying authorities.</p>
