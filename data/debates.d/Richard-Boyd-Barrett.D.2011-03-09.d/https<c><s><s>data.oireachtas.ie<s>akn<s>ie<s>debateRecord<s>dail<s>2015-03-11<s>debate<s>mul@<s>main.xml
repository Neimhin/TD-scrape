            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</b> asked the <b>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</b> if a built heritage jobs leverage scheme will operate in 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [10554/15]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_1">
            <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_2">This question relates to the built heritage jobs leverage scheme. It was one of the good ideas initiated by the last Government, a Government which was perhaps not awash with good ideas. The €5 million put up by the Government secured private investment of €10 million for 540 projects across the country, employing 175 people. What are the prospects for this scheme in 2015?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Heritage_and_the_Gaeltacht" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Heather Humphreys)<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">In 2014, my Department was provided with a special allocation of €5 million from capital stimulus funding for a new built heritage jobs leverage scheme to assist with works to safeguard structures, in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> This scheme was administered directly through the local authorities and sought to encourage the investment of private capital in a number of small-scale, labour-intensive projects to repair and conserve historic structures and to support the employment of skilled and experienced conservation professionals, craft workers and tradespeople. </p>
            <p eId="para_5"> My Department's allocation of €5 million leveraged a further €10 million in private funding, leading to a total of €15 million being invested in 540 historic structures across the country. Information provided by the local authorities indicates that 175 jobs were created as a result of this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> The operation of a similar scheme in the future would be contingent on dedicated funding being made available to my Department. It is a good idea and I very much support the work being done.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">Implicit in the answer is that there will be no scheme in 2015, which is very regrettable and represents a failure on the part of the Minister's Department. I urge the Minister to go back to the Minister for Public Expenditure on Reform to secure the funding involved. As she quite rightly said, a fairly small figure of €5 million unleashed €10 million in private investment, which is badly needed and which delivered worthwhile jobs while allowing us to maintain the fabric of the built heritage of this country. It is very important the built heritage is retained.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> All of us in this House see buildings of historic importance across the length and breadth of this country crumbling before our eyes. The thatched cottage is a uniquely Irish phenomenon but I see those cottages falling into decay because their owners cannot afford their upkeep.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Heritage_and_the_Gaeltacht">
            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">As the Deputy said, the built heritage jobs leverage scheme was a great success, which is reflected in the statistics. The Deputy is right that Ireland's heritage and its buildings are a vital part of our villages and are towns. The Heritage Council has done great work over the years in engaging with communities. There is a much greater awareness now of the importance of heritage. Community groups across the country are getting involved and want to everything they can to protect what is very special in their areas in terms of heritage.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> I am very supportive of this scheme and, as I outlined in my response, the operation of a similar scheme in the future would be contingent on dedicated funding be made available to my Department. This was a one-off stimulus scheme last year which helped to ensure the skills of stonemasons and the skills required to maintain heritage buildings are protected and passed on. I very much support scheme and, as the economy improves, I will make the case for more funding for heritage, in particular for this scheme.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_11">We are told the economy is improving and now is the time to secure multi-annual funding. The Minister would have the support of everyone on this side of House in going back to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to demand this money. The money about which were talking, in terms of public investment, is very small but the money it can leverage from the private sector is very significant. It has been demonstrated that jobs can be created. The importance of the built heritage is beyond question and we know that many elements of that built heritage are crumbling before our eyes, so investment is needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> The Minister referred the Heritage Council, which I salute and which is doing a tremendous job. What is outstanding about the work it is doing is the way in which it engages communities. It is actively involved in a meaningful way in convincing communities that they need to take ownership of the valuable heritage resources they have. However, it is starved of cash and it needs investment also.</p>

            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">I agree with the Deputy that the Heritage Council does a great job. Since I took office, I have met all the heritage officers throughout the country because they also do a great job with the local authorities. I must acknowledge the work local authorities have done in regard to the built heritage jobs leverage scheme. A number of different organisations came together.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> The Heritage Council was awarded €4.7 million in funding in the 2015 Estimates. The built heritage jobs leverage scheme is a good scheme, which I fully support, and I will not be found wanting when it comes to looking for money for it.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">I gcomhréir leis an ngealltanas a tugadh i gclár an Rialtais, rinne mo Roinn athbhreithniú ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003. Ag eascairt as an athbhreithniú sin, thóg an Rialtas cinneadh anuraidh Bille a dhréachtú chun leasuithe a dhéanamh ar an Acht Teanga. Is í an phríomhaidhm atá ag an mBille seo ná an tAcht a leasú chun a chinntiú go leanfaidh sé de bheith ina thacaíocht éifeachtach do gach duine ar mian leis nó léi seirbhísí d’ardchaighdeán i nGaeilge a fháil ón Stát. Tá Ceannteidil an Bhille foilsithe ar shuíomh gréasáin mo Roinne, <i>www.ahg.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> I gcomhréir le polasaí an Rialtais, cuireadh ceannteidil an Bhille faoi bhráid an Chomhchoiste um Chomhshaol, Chultúr agus an Ghaeltacht. Bhí éisteachtaí ag an bhFochoiste um an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge maidir leis na ceannteidil i mí na Bealtaine seo caite. Foilsíodh tuarascáil an chomhchoiste maidir leis na ceannteidil ar an 24 Feabhra agus tá na moltaí atá inti á meas agam faoi láthair.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">Tuigim nach bhfuil deis ag an Aire Stáit déileáil leis na moltaí ar fad nó iad a mheas go hiomlán go fóill, ach tá an straitéis 20 bliain ann le cúpla bliain anuas. Tá an staidéar ar a bhfuil sé bunaithe ann chomh maith, an staidéar cuimsitheach teangeolaíochta. Foilsíodh an staidéar sin in 2007 agus sa bhliain sin dúradar nach raibh ach 20 bliain fágtha sula mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar theanga labhartha i mbaol bháis sa Ghaeltacht. Bhí deifear nó práinn i gceist maidir leis an Ghaeilge a shábháil i 2007. Anois, tá 2015 sroichte againn agus don chuid is mó den phobal, níl aon athrú mór tagtha ar an scéal, seachas go bhfuil tuairisc i ndiaidh tuairisce fós á déanamh. Níl aon ghníomh ceart déanta.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> Seachas maolú a chur ar fhoráileacha Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla mar atá i gceist, an aontaíonn an tAire Stáit liom gur cóir iad a láidriú, ionas nach bhfeicfimid Coimisinéir Teanga eile ag fágáil an phoist sin i lár a thréimhse?</p>

            <p eId="para_21">Tá cúpla pointe ansin. Maidir leis an straitéis 20 bliain, bunaíodh an straitéis sin in 2010 agus tá sí anois cúig bliana d'aois. Tá agus bhí mórán oibre ar siúl ar son na Gaeilge thar an cúig bliana sin agus ní inniu nó inné a tháinig na scéalta dearfacha aníos. Tá grúpaí ar nós Conradh na Gaeilge, Gael Linn agus Gael Uladh ag obair go dian tríd an straitéis 20 bliain. Mar atá a fhios ag an Teachta, achtaíodh Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla i 2003. Má théann sé amach ar na sráideanna i mBaile Átha Cliath nó ina cheantar féin, feicfidh sé go bhfuil an t-infreastruchtúr ann, ar nós na comharthaí bóithre mar shampla. Tá a lán ar siúl, ach aontaím leis an Teachta gurb í an straitéis an rud is tábhachtaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le baill an fhochoiste agus don Seanadóir Labhrás Ó Murchú, Cathaoirleach an fhochoiste, as an sár obair atá déanta ag an bhfochoiste. Maidir leis na moltaí, tá siad á meas agam faoi láthair.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">Tuigim an méid atá ráite ag an Aire Stáit agus aontaím leis ar bhealach amháin. Ach sa deireadh thiar thall, nach bhfuil sé níos tábhachtaí an straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm, seachas a bheith ag caint fúithi? Táimid de shíor ag caint faoi seo. Tá an t-am ag imeacht agus tá an Ghaeilge, sna Gaeltachtaí agus lasmuigh díobh, ag dul in éag. Cén uair a mbeidh toradh ar an strachfhéachaint atá á dhéanamh ag an Aire Stáit ar na moltaí sin? Cén uair an bhfeicfimid straitéis nua agus an mbeidh spriocdátaí leis na moltaí nuair a ghlacann an tAire Stáit leo?</p>

            <p eId="para_24">Níl spriocdáta agam mar tá na moltaí fós á meas agam. Tá na moltaí aontaithe agus dearfach ach tá a lán acu ann. Is é mo bharúil go ndearbhóidh muid cuid de na moltaí a bhí ar chlár an fhochoiste. Sin atá ar intinn agam agus tá m'oifigigh ag obair go dian orthu.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> Chomh maith le sin, bhí mé i dteagmháil le dreamanna eile ar nós, mar a luaigh mé níos luaithe, Conradh na Gaeilge. Bhí mé i dteagmháil leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga fosta. Tá a fhios agam agus ag an Teachta go bhfuil an coimisinéir neamhspleách ón Rialtas. Bhí comhrá maith agam leis agus tá moltaí aige fosta. Táim ag staidéar achan moladh atá ar an mbord agam anois, ó na dreamanna éagsúla, ón gcoimisinéir agus ón bhfochoiste.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> Tá mórán oibre ar siúl ar an straitéis 20 bliain. Mar shampla, tá Foras na Gaeilge freagrach as an gceantar taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus as an obair Thuaidh-Theas. Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta freagrach as na limistéir pleanála agus tá neart oibre eile ar siúl ar an dtalamh. Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt do na daoine atá ag obair ar son na teanga.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">My question is on the Royal Canal. It seeks to understand how the Minister and her Department could encourage more visual and widespread use of the canal. Could there be some training for boat owners to manage some of the locks and extended mooring between the area of Cross Guns Bridge and the basin?</p>

            <p eId="para_29">Waterways Ireland is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes. As a North–South implementation body, it is under the joint remit of my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland. The Royal Canal is one of the waterways for which Waterways Ireland has responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> I have been assured by Waterways Ireland that it is continually promoting and developing all its waterways, including the Royal Canal, as navigational, recreational and tourist attractions. It is also working closely with the tourism bodies and local authorities in developing the recreational and tourism potential of the waterways. In the case of the Royal Canal, Waterways Ireland is working closely with Fáilte Ireland, the National Roads Authority and a number of local authorities in developing a multi-activity recreational and tourism offering, utilising the existing towpath and waterway infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> The Deputy referred to training. While Waterways Ireland does not provide training for boat owners, it does provide guidance in the form of guide books, which clearly explain the operation of the locks. Historically, boat handling training and lock operation training were provided by the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> I understand that Waterways Ireland currently has no proposals to install additional moorings between Spencer Dock and Cross Guns Bridge due to the lack of uptake to date at the other locations available for extended mooring on the Royal Canal.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">Anybody who has been to cities such as Amsterdam and Bruges will have a very good idea of the potential for tourism and living on the canals. Despite what the Minister says, Waterways Ireland is very far removed from that sort of activity on the canals. The Grand Canal has a little more such activity than the Royal Canal. Given the lack of activity on the latter, it is the poor relation.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> It was very interesting to meet boat owners. A couple I met can bring their boat from Belturbet along the River Shannon and the Royal Canal into Dublin. They go through Phibsborough via Cross Guns Bridge and into the basin, and they can go back around by the Grand Canal.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> I listened to what the Minister said about the answer from Waterways Ireland. It seems it is talking to everybody except those who are actually using the canals. It is missing out on vast potential for the boat owners who use the canal. I want to see the canals being used much more.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> An issue arises over access to power, and issues can arise over water.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">There is also an issue about the extended mooring permits. If nothing else comes from today, I ask the Minister to go back to Waterways Ireland to ask it to engage with the boat owners.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">I agree absolutely with the Deputy on the potential for tourism on the waterways. It is only two weeks ago that I was able to announce the start of work on another section of the Ulster Canal. It will move now from Belturbet to Castle Saunderson, which is the first part of the route that will go to Clones. Eventually, I hope the route will go the whole way to Lough Neagh, which would bring the whole waterways system together. There is significant potential for tourism. Waterways Ireland has done a great deal of work on the blue ways. Recently, I was in County Leitrim where a new tow path has been developed as a walking route. There is a great opportunity there for tourism in terms of young people being out. That was the good thing about the extension of the Ulster Canal which will go to the scouting centre in Castle Saunderson. It will bring a whole new dimension to the international scouting centre for young people to engage in water-based activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> I take the Deputy's point about the need to talk to boat owners and users and I will bring it back to Waterways Ireland to ask if it can engage. I am sure it has been talking to many boat owners, but I will go back again and ask it to set up a line of communication so that boat owners can engage with Waterways Ireland. As the Deputy rightly says, we have a tremendous asset and we must build on it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_40">That is very important. From speaking to some of the boat owners, it appears there is an issue with the extended mooring permits. If they are for 12 months, the boat will stay in the one place, whereas if they were for shorter periods and the boats had to move, it would create more activity. The Minister referred to tow paths and it is great that they have been opened up, but the tow path from Croke Park to Phibsorough has been closed for nine months now. It has been the slowest progress, if that is not a contradiction in terms. I understand it is supposed to open shortly, but I am not too sure about that one.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> There is a need to look at the current by-laws on permits and I understand these come under the Minister's Department. I have a question on the by-laws later but we will probably not get to it. I will receive the written reply. I accept everything the Minister says, but when one walks along the Royal Canal from the North Strand to Pelletstown, there is very little boat activity notwithstanding what Waterways Ireland says. It has a massive centre down in the basin and it may be that all of its energy is directed there. It is missing out on a great deal of potential by not opening up the Royal Canal to use to a greater extent.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">The Deputy mentioned by-laws. The proposed by-laws are intended to encourage tourism and leisure craft users by supporting the investment that has already been made by Waterways Ireland in the new infrastructure and facilities along the canal. The by-laws were drafted by Waterways Ireland and went out for public consultation and are now at draft stage. My Department and Waterways Ireland are looking at the submissions that were made through the consultation process and it will be coming back to me soon. A commitment was given by my predecessor, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, to consult with the interested Deputies and Senators and I reaffirm that I will consult with them when the matter comes back to me.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">Leiríonn torthaí na bliana 2014, a d’fhoilsigh Údarás na Gaeltachta níos luaithe i mbliana, gur cruthaíodh an líon is airde post sa Ghaeltacht ón bhliain 2008. D’éirigh leis an Údarás 737 post nua a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht in 2014 agus bhí 7,682 post i gcliantchuideachtaí an Údaráis ag deireadh na bliana seo caite. Is é an sprioc fostaíochta atá ag an Údarás do 2015 ná 570 post nua a chruthú agus 7,000 post a choinneáil i gcliantchuideachtaí an Údaráis. Ní miste a rá gur éirigh liom cistiú breise de mhilliún euro a fháil i mbuiséad caipitil an Údaráis do 2015. Tá mé sásta go gcuideoidh an cistiú breise seo leis an Údarás chun poist a choinneáil ina chliantchuideachtaí sa Ghaeltacht agus chun tuilleadh infheistíochta a mhealladh go ceantair Ghaeltachta. Fágann sé seo go bhfuil soláthar caipitil de €6.687m ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta ón Státchiste in 2015, mar aon le foinsí maoinithe an Údaráis féin ó dhíol sócmhainní agus infheistíochtaí <i>.</i></p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint le tiomantas athnuaite an Rialtais i leith forbairt réigiúnach na tíre ina iomláine. Sa chomhthéacs seo, leanfaidh Údarás na Gaeltachta, i gcomhar le Fiontraíocht Éireann agus an tÚdarás Forbartha Tionscail, ag iarraidh infheistíocht shuntasach a mhealladh chuig ceantair iargúlta Gaeltachta. In 2015, leanfaidh an tÚdarás air ag maoiniú réimse de thionscadail a bhaineann le forbairt fiontraíochta agus cruthú fostaíochta, le béim ar leith ar mhicreathionscadail agus comhlachtaí atá ag tosú as an nua. Lena chois sin, aithníonn an tÚdarás an gá atá le forbairt scileanna chun feabhas a chur ar dheiseanna fostaíochta do phobal na Gaeltachta agus chun cuidiú le fostaithe i gcliantchuideachtaí an Údaráis a gcuid scileanna a uasghrádú. Cabhróidh an cur chuige seo chun táirgí nua a fhorbairt, margaí úra a aimsiú agus dá thoradh sin méadú a chur ar acmhainneacht fáis agus ar rathúlacht ghnóthaí na Gaeltachta.</p>

Tá a lán post le fáil a bhaineann le turasóireacht. Bhí ceist agam don Roinn mar gheall ar thaisteal go dtí na hoileáin, an aerseirbhís agus seirbhísí farantóireachta. An bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta níos mó airgid a chur ar fáil don earnáil turasóireachta, don taisteal, do choláistí samhraidh agus do na mná tí? Tá cúrsaí turasóireachta an-tábhachtach i mbliana.</p>

Céard a déarfaidh sé le Conradh na Gaeilge faoi na meastúcháin don bhliain seo? Mar shampla, tá méadú 8% don IDA ach tá buiséad an Údaráis á ísliú. Cé go bhfuil 7,000 post ann le cúnamh ón Údarás, tá Conradh na Gaeilge ag iarraidh 1,000 post eile sna trí bliana atá romhainn. Is dúshlán mór é sin freisin.

            <p eId="para_51">Tá stair mhór ann sa ghearrthéarma. In 2010 bhí buiséad de €18 milliún ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. Laghdaíodh an buiséad ó €18 milliún in 2010 go €6 milliún in 2011. Ní shin an leibhéal ceart. D'agair mé an cás leis an Aire Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe, an Teachta Brendan Howlin, agus an tAire Airgeadais, an Teachta Michael Noonan, go bhfuil gá ag Údarás na Gaeltachta le hacmhainní sa bhreis. Fuair Údarás na Gaeltachta €1 milliún breise anuraidh, rud a chiallaigh go raibh buiséad chaipitil de €7 milliún aige. Táim ag obair go dian chun é sin a mhéadú go €12 milliún. Is é sin an slat tomhais atá ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá ról difriúl ag Údarás na Gaeltachta freisin. Tá ról ag an Údarás i gcruthúcháin fostaíochta ach tá dualgas mór air freisin maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise agus na limistéir pleanála agus leis an teanga Gaeilge.

            <p eId="para_54">The objective of the Ireland 2016 initiative, which I am leading and which was formally launched on 12 November 2014, is to develop, co-ordinate and deliver a programme to honour and remember those who fought or died in the Easter Rising. It will also reflect on the legacy of that period and look towards our future, based on the themes set out in the Government's framework plan. I am committed, together with my Government colleagues, to ensuring that the commemorations to mark the centenary in 2016 will be inclusive, appropriate and respectful.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> A 2016 project office in my Department is engaged in an extensive consultation process across the Government, State agency and community sectors to progress the development of detailed plans for 2016. In order to facilitate engagement with local communities and people of all ages nationwide, I have met representatives of the County and City Management Association and have requested local authority CEOs to take the lead in the development of local-level plans for Ireland 2016 in their individual counties during 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> The response has been very positive. Dedicated Ireland 2016 co-ordinators and steering groups have been put in place in each local authority to help shape and drive the relevant county programmes. A series of public meetings will be undertaken in each county, at which members of the public can come together to hear about Ireland 2016, meet those involved in their community, and explore and learn about how they can get involved. I have allocated €1 million to local authorities in 2015 to support this overall process.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> Meetings have also taken place with other key Departments, agencies, local authorities and interested parties. My Department's 2016 project office is engaging with the national cultural institutions, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland and the Heritage Council to ensure that a comprehensive and diverse cultural programme is developed. Meetings and a dedicated workshop have also been held with a wide range of Irish language groups in order to develop an Irish language programme. My Department has been working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to develop an appropriate programme involving the Irish diaspora and with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure the involvement of primary and post-primary schools and third level education. My Department has also been engaging with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that the views of children are taken on board and that they have a meaningful contribution to make.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> My Department is also engaging with representatives of the various relatives groups and individual relatives to hear their views on the overall programme, and to ensure that they will have a central role in a number of the key State events.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> Over 100 proposals have been received in the 2016 project office to date from members of the public and interested parties via e-mail, postal submissions and through the project website, <i>www.ireland.ie</i>. I very much appreciate and welcome all ideas and submissions received. I look forward to continuing engagement with all stakeholders and members of the public as the Ireland 2016 initiative develops.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">I thank the Minister for her answer. I know things have progressed recently. However, it is well known that the preparations for the official launch of the 1916 commemorative programme in November were rushed and were undertaken under considerable time pressure. The website for the 100th anniversary commemorative programme for Easter 2016, <i>www.ireland.ie</i>, was only secured a week before the launch on 12 November, according to documents released to <i>The Irish Times</i> under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> The Government faced considerable criticism in the wake of the launch in November, with the official video for the launch, Ireland Inspires, being widely criticised for making no reference to the Easter Rising, even though I note the Minister's reply states that it was to honour those who fought or died in the Rising. The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht also admitted that the Irish version of the programme on the 1916 website came from Google Translate. Thankfully it was quickly removed and replaced by the correct version.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> Does the Minister agree that the sequence of events points to a complete lack of priority being given to our national 1916 commemorations? Irish people were rightly enraged by the clear lack of respect being shown at that stage to the hugely significant centenary events next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">I thank the Deputy. The plan launched last November was an overarching plan and it was not rushed, as the Government wished to allow people to engage with it. It was a high-level plan and has been highly successful in respect of the level of engagement experienced thus far. It was necessary to start with something, and while there was a lot of talk about it, I am glad about that because it means people are engaging. When people are talking about something, they are engaging, and as I stated earlier, the Department has had great engagement with local authorities. Moreover, many different groups have approached the Department and have made suggestions. This engagement process does not stop here; it will continue, because the main commemoration event will not take place until Easter Sunday 2016, which of course will be the big State occasion. In fairness, there was a lot more to the night of the launch than the video, and many other items were not picked up on. The Deputy can rest assured that the Proclamation is at the centre of the Government's commemorations. We will commemorate and remember the signatories and all those who lost their lives in 1916.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">I am sure the Minister will agree the video was something of a disaster. However, Irish people are equally outraged that as we approach the 1916 centenary, the central element in an area described by the National Museum as the most important historic site in modern Irish history has fallen into complete disrepair in an increasingly derelict site. I refer to the 1916 national monument in Moore Street, with which the Minister and her Department are familiar. The disgraceful derelict state of the national monument and the recent failed land swap proposal is proof that its current owner, Chartered Land, views the national monument as nothing more than an item of commercial exchange rather than the central element in the area. The owners have shown themselves to be unreliable guardians of our history and heritage, and their continuing ownership and future control of the monument, through NAMA funding from the public purse, should no longer be acceptable. Moreover, the failure of the State to intervene in this matter, in light of the statement by the National Museum, is a clear breach of its responsibility to act in the public interest. In her position of guardianship of the culture and heritage of this State, I ask the Minister to act on her obligations. This means protecting and preserving the national monument by whatever means are available without further delay. Can the Minister assure the people that in the lead-up to the historic 1916 celebrations next year, everything will be done on her behalf to protect the monument in order that it can take its rightful place throughout the celebrations?</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I thank the Deputy. I was deeply disappointed by the voting down of the proposal for Moore Street at a meeting of Dublin City Council. The Deputy should believe me when I state that I considered the plans to be highly impressive. It was planned to have a lovely interpretive centre that would reflect well on the entire area. This was a decision of Dublin City Council, and as they are the elected members, I must respect their decision, but I am deeply disappointed that the proposal did not proceed because I thought it was a great opportunity to have this interpretive centre in Moore Street. I should make clear that my job is to protect the national monument, and that is where my function lies.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">The objective of the Ireland 2016 initiative, which I am leading and which was formally launched on 12 November 2014, is to develop, co-ordinate and deliver a programme to honour and remember those who fought or died in the Rising and to recognise all the people whose lives were touched by the events of 1916. It also will reflect on the legacy of that period and will look towards the future, based on the themes set out in the Government's framework plan. I am committed, together with my Government colleagues, to ensuring that the commemorations to mark the centenary in 2016 will be inclusive, appropriate and respectful.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> Together with my officials, I have engaged with a wide range of stakeholders, including the mayors, cathaoirligh and senior officials of local authorities, Departments and State agencies, as well as national cultural institutions. I am also engaging with the Oireachtas all-party group on commemorations and the expert advisory group on commemorations.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> The relatives of those who fought and those who died during the Rising will play a key role in the Ireland 2016 programme, and I am actively engaging with them to ensure they will have a central involvement in a number of key State events and that their views on the overall programme are considered. My officials and I have met with a number of relatives, including representatives of relatives’ groups and individual relatives, to highlight the important role they will have in the plans to commemorate the centenary of the events of Easter 1916. My Department also is working closely with the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence to ensure that a full programme of State commemorative events is developed that is respectful to all those who were affected by the events of the Rising.</p>

            <p eId="para_73">I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply. I also mention the need to recognise the role played by Cumann na mBan and by some people who were pacifists, such as Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, as well as other people who were involved who were not necessarily in agreement but who became part of what it was at the time, which we now have inherited. The point about inclusiveness to which the Minister referred is of huge importance, as we must try to ensure that everyone is recognised for his or her own particular contribution while recognising, as Members should now, that it was not a popular thing to do at the time. There was quite an amount of antipathy towards it, but it was a landmark decision at a highly sensitive time in our history.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">I accept what the Deputy is saying on the need to recognise the role of women and, in particular, Cumann na mBan. Their contribution must be recognised. I recently visited Lissadell House, and while one can see the important role played by Countess Markievicz in the events of 1916 and her subsequent election to Parliament, and the important role women played in the Rising, one also can see how they then sort of faded into the background. I note that 100 years later, the Oireachtas has passed legislation to have women make up 30% of the names on the ballot paper at the next election. While it is very important to show the role women played, I also want people to consider how they then faded away into the background, leaving us in a position today in which we must get more women involved in politics. The Deputy also mentioned the need to remember all these people. An important aspect that emerged in other commemorations was the personal stories that people will tell. These stories also bring a greater understanding to the events of the time as to why people became involved and what encouraged them to take the stand they took. All of this is extremely important.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">We also need to be respectful and inclusive and it needs to be appropriate. I agree that it is not something about which we need to be triumphalist. It will be a solemn occasion. As we go through the year, it is important that we hear the stories. Historians and others will be interested in giving their opinions, and by listening to them we will gain a much greater understanding and appreciation of the event.</p>

To date, policymakers have almost completely ignored these studies. What concrete measures does the Minister plan on taking to implement to recommendations of the latest report? Can we believe there will be more meaningful action for our artists this time around?</p>

            <p eId="para_80">The Government appreciates the importance of the cultural and creative industries to Ireland, including the music industry. My Department provides significant support to the industry through its funding of the Arts Council, capital supports for the development of arts and cultural infrastructure, and through other financial and policy supports. I was particularly pleased that the Government introduced a 25% increase in the income ceiling for the artists' tax exemption for 2015. This important measure recognises the invaluable contribution which artists, including songwriters and composers, make to society and to the music industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> Last year, in response to a proposal from the Irish Association of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, IASCA, a capital grant of €50,000 from my Department's capital budget was awarded for the purpose of introducing a digital music system to be available to all Irish musicians and to Irish broadcasters. This system will assist in directing royalties to Irish musicians. The recent IMRO report referred to in the Deputy's question, entitled The Socio-Economic Contribution of Music to the Irish Economy, highlights the impressive contribution the music industry makes to the Irish economy. The report contains a broad range of recommendations for which several Ministers have responsibility. My Department will be examining those of relevance to my areas of responsibility. In this regard, the report will also be of relevance in the development of Ireland's first national cultural policy, which will be entitled Culture 2025, and I look forward to working further with the music industry as part of that process. I intend to publish a culture 2025 discussion paper shortly, which will be an important step in opening up the debate around how we should shape the future of the arts in Ireland, including music.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">The tax exemptions of which the Minister spoke are for people who are already on their feet in the game, whereas IMRO has focused on those trying to start up. These are the people who need to be helped. The report recognises the difficulties faced by early career musicians and has called for business training and financial support. Most of those starting their careers in the cultural industries recognise the dole as a necessary fact of life. Although they are trying to start a career, they have to declare themselves unemployed, as if they were doing nothing at all. Apart from being liable to be caught in a compulsory Gateway or JobBridge scheme to retain their dole, the point is that what they are trying to do in the music industry is not recognised and has no status. The Government must introduce a structure to change the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">I will examine the areas of the report for which I have responsibility. Business training support is provided by the local enterprise offices, LEOs, to help those who want to start their own businesses. I fully appreciate the major contribution Irish music makes to our culture. Our culture is so important to us, and appears on every brochure that leaves the country. That is why I want to ensure it is continued. This will be the first time we will have put together a cultural policy to state the importance of our culture to us and to outline all the different areas it encompasses and to which it relates. It is important that the document be published and that we get buy-in. I hope to have the draft document shortly and I want people to feed into it and make their views known.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">Although the Minister says the people in the music industry are valued, due to the lack of structure, they do not feel that their worth is being recognised. Has the Government examined other countries such as Iceland, which responded to its financial crash in 2008 by investing in a creative economy? Iceland's creative industries contribute as much to the country's economic turnover as the aluminium industry, which dominates its export market. The success is due to focusing public funding on the export of home-grown acts and the nurturing of interest in Icelandic music abroad through artists' grants and travel supports such as the Icelandic Music Export, IMX, fund. It is possible to change how things are and it would be a great investment on the part of the State. Has the Minister had any consultation with the Department of Social Protection regarding a mechanism to assist with the living conditions of artists in a way that does not require them to declare themselves unemployed?</p>

Music is very important to us and very much part of our culture and part of what we are. I have considered the social protection issue and I will discuss it with the Department of Social Protection regarding supports that can be put in place. Aosdána provides a continuous income for those artists who are part of it. I have considered the issue and will give it further consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">Last year, I established a 2016 project office in my Department which has responsibility for co-ordinating and leading on all activities relating to the development and implementation of the Ireland 2016 initiative, which is focused on the commemoration of the centenary of the events of the 1916 Easter Rising. The initiative will also reflect on the legacy of that period and look towards our future, based around the themes set out in the Government's framework plan. I have secured a dedicated allocation of €4 million in current funding to support the development in 2015 of the Ireland 2016 initiative. This allocation will be used to engage with and support a wide range of activities and events by interested groups, including local community groups and the arts, as well as Irish language and educational projects. Details of individual allocations from this €4 million are currently being finalised. The allocation of €4 million is in addition to the capital provision of €22 million, which will be allocated in 2015 to a number of flagship commemorations projects. I also secured €2 million in additional funding for the Arts Council for its commemoration programme in preparation for 2016. The national cultural institutions have also been preparing their plans for Ireland 2016, which will be supported both from their own resources and from additional allocations to be provided by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> Some €1 million of the current funding allocation of €4 million for 2015 will be to be distributed across all local authorities. The purpose of this funding allocation is to support engagement and facilitation within local communities to generate awareness of the Ireland 2016 initiative and the commemoration of the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising, and to support each local authority in developing and delivering a plan for a suitable programme of events and initiatives to take place at a county level in line with the national plans for Ireland 2016. Local authorities will be notified of individual allocations very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> To date, expenditure of more than €2 million has been incurred across the 2016 programme. This includes expenditure on capital projects, as well as the current and administrative costs arising. It does not include expenditure incurred by other key Departments and offices such as the OPW and the Department of Defence.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">I thank the Minister. My original question related to whether the Minister is confident that the various capital projects that are under way will be completed within budget by the time of the commemoration next year. I note the really ambitious programme of work that has been put in place. This programme includes the construction on an interpretative centre in the GPO. The term "interpretative centre" is one of my pet bugbears and I am of the view that what is proposed should be called a visitors centre, which, essentially, is what it will be. The programme also includes work to adapt the Kilmainham Gaol complex and the military archives at Cathal Brugha Barracks. All of this work is necessary and I am hugely supportive of it. However, is all of it achievable within the budget that has been allocated and will the various projects be completed on time? Some of the work is behind schedule. Given that the Minister was not in office when that work commenced, this is not her fault. However, the timeframe is quite tight and the turnaround in respect these various major projects is only 12 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">We have established a team within the Department which has been charged both with monitoring progress closely to ensure that the projects will be delivered on time and with monitoring costs. I am satisfied that the various projects are on target both in terms of their completion dates and the costs involved. The centre at the GPO will be a fine facility and we hope it will attract in the region of 300,000 visitors to Dublin's city centre each year. The project at Kilmainham Gaol will facilitate the expansion of the services available there. On each occasion one passes the complex, one can see a queue of people waiting to gain entry. The conversion of the adjoining courthouse will expand the facilities at Kilmainham and I am of the view that this will prove to be extremely beneficial. The project at Richmond Barracks is a community and Dublin City Council-led initiative, with support from my Department. I am in receipt of regular updates and I am satisfied that the projects remain on target.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">The initiatives to which the Minister refers are all really important in the context of the population of Ireland. People are going to feel proud when all of these historic sites are improved and upgraded in time for the commemoration. I am concerned, however, that the Ireland Inspires proposal was rejected by the Department. Essentially, this proposal revolved around a plan to attract visitors from around the world to attend the 1916 Commemoration and it was very much based on The Gathering model. I am curious to discover why the Department rejected the proposal in question and why it was not embraced as a concept to tap into the huge tourism potential that exists in terms of encouraging members of the diaspora to return to Ireland and celebrate next year's centenary. The Minister referred to the 300,000 people the new facility at the GPO is expected to attract to Dublin's city centre each year. There is huge potential to attract visitors from across the globe, both next year and beyond. It seems strange that the Department rejected the proposal.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">Many different events are going to take place in the context of 2016, one of which involves connecting with the diaspora. We are working with our embassies throughout the world to link in with the members of the diaspora. I visited New Orleans in November for the International Famine Commemoration 2014 and I am aware that there is a great interest in the 1916 commemorations. The Deputy may rest assured that we are going to connect with the diaspora. However, it must be remembered that the next year's commemorations are going to be about the Irish people and about the country itself. The events that will take place will allow us to remember those who lost their lives in 1916 and respect the sacrifice they made. If people want to visit Ireland to participate in the commemorations, they will certainly be made very welcome. I reassure the Deputy that our embassies will, with the support of Culture Ireland, continue their programme of engagement with the diaspora on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">This question relates to the level of engagement the Minister has had with groups and individuals who are concerned about her Department's continued granting of licences for hare coursing. The Minister indicated that this activity is regulated and that there are safeguards in place. However, her comments are belied by the reality. Will the Minister outline the contact she has had with individuals who might provide her with a very different view on this matter than that promoted by coursing clubs?</p>

            <p eId="para_97">The control of live hare coursing, including the operation of individual coursing meetings, is carried out under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Hare coursing is administered by the Irish Coursing Club, a body set up under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> Licences were issued by my Department in August 2014 under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club, on behalf of its affiliated clubs, to facilitate the tagging and capturing of hares for the purpose of hare coursing for the 2014-2015 season. I have received numerous representations in recent months requesting me to revoke the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club and asking me not to issue any further licences to it. I understand that the majority of these representations have been prompted by an online campaign organised by anti-blood sports organisations urging people to make such representations to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and to me. I have not received any requests for meetings on foot of these recent representations.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">I am glad the Minister verified that there has been considerable contact with her Department. This reflects the fact that the majority of people are appalled by the live baiting, mauling and killing of hares in the so-called name of sport. Hare coursing is a practice that has been outlawed in Australia, Britain, Northern Ireland and so on. I hope the Minister will agree to meet some of the groups involved. The problem is that licences are granted to coursing clubs on the basis of certain conditions. Information obtained by some of the animal welfare organisations under the freedom of information legislation shows that many of these conditions are being violated. For example, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, is supposed to monitor the activities which take place at coursing meetings. However, it only managed to monitor 23 events last year. At an event in Fermoy, an NPWS ranger was obliged to call a vet to attend because one was not present. One of the conditions of the licences issued by the Department is that vets are supposed to be in attendance at meetings. At meetings held in Gorey and New Ross, numbers provided in respect of the number of hares killed were different from those tallied by the rangers present. Again, this is evidence that the rules are being bent.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">Unlawful practices are ongoing which the Department must examine. Will the Minister meet some of the groups who have this information?</p>

            <p eId="para_101">I thank the Deputy for her question. I know this is an area she is very passionate about, but I wish to make clear that issues relating to welfare and cruelty are a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and not me as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. My interest and area of responsibility is in the conservation of the hare. The scientific evidence available tells me that the conservation status of the hare is good. I do not have any concerns about the conservation of the hare, and welfare issues are a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> I have not received a formal request for a meeting but if people wish to meet me, they can contact my office and we will try to accommodate them.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">I will certainly suggest that they do that, but I would respectfully say to the Minister that the monitoring of licences is the prerogative of her Department. Some of the conditions for the licences are being severely breached. In Mallow, for example, nobody attended the meeting arranged by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, officer to meet the coursers. In Liscannor, a ranger was intimidated when she asked to check the hare paddock, yet co-operation with NPWS officers is a condition of the licence being granted. Having a vet on call is another condition of the licence. Some animal welfare groups and information from the Department's NPWS officers verify that such breaches are taking place. I presume when that happens it is a basis for stating the licence should be revoked. There is obviously a bigger picture in the sense that the activity in its entirety should be banned, but there are issues the Department could examine now.</p>
            <p eId="para_104"> The Minister said she had no concerns about hare stocks but the figures are at variance with the real experience of the NPWS officers. I will get the groups to contact the Minister in the hope that it might assist in advancing the issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_105">I thank the Deputy. The conservation of the hare is my responsibility and the evidence I have received indicates that it is in good conservation status. From my perspective, no issues arise in terms of conservation. However, if the groups wish to contact my office, we will certainly consider a request for a meeting.</p>

            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_108">I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for raising this matter. Officials from my Department have met the Committee for the Commemoration of the Irish Famine Victims periodically in recent years. At the most recent meeting with the CCIFV last month, my officials committed to keeping it apprised of all arrangements in relation to the 2015 Famine commemoration and provided its representatives with a direct line of communication to my Department, which they could avail of to raise any matters in relation to the plans for 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> My main focus regarding the annual national Famine commemoration is to ensure that the victims of the Great Irish Famine are respected and appropriately remembered. To do so requires a high level of interaction between my officials, other Departments, local authorities and various other stakeholders. Arising from that, there has been a degree of continuity in the format and scheduling of the commemoration.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> While there has been a degree of continuity in the format and scheduling of the annual national Famine commemoration ceremony, the date of the ceremony, as well as the artistic and cultural elements, may change from year to year. It has proved possible in most years to schedule the commemoration on the second Sunday in May, to which the Deputy referred. However, it has not been considered desirable to fix the same date each year, given the factors that may need to be considered, such as the site selection process, the availability of the lead person to officiate at the ceremony and the general arrangements at community level. In 2015, the ceremony is expected to take place in the second half of the year because of those organisational imperatives. In keeping with the custom in place since the inaugural commemoration in 2008, this year's commemoration will take place in Ulster.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> The international famine commemoration is also expected to take place in the fourth quarter of this year. It will be the seventh international commemoration and is a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to ensure that the victims of the Great Irish Famine are remembered in an appropriate fashion. I expect that arrangements in relation to both events will be finalised in the coming weeks and I will make an announcement regarding locations and dates at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">My main concern is to highlight the work of the committee, which was started by two ordinary citizens in 2003. They organised a walk from what was a soup kitchen near the Four Courts in Famine times on to the quays. In 2004, they held another commemorative event and last year was the twelfth time they organised a commemorative walk. It is important to acknowledge the work of those two individuals which was not done by Governments to commemorate one of the saddest events in our history.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> Although I accept what the Minister said, it is important that we have a set date. Sometimes, when there is not a set date such a commemoration can get lost. Given all the work done by the committee, it would be a terrible shame if that were to happen. I seek a commitment from the Minister to a particular period during which the commemoration will happen, for example, the month of May.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">I acknowledge the work of the committee and the National Famine Commemoration Committee, which I chair. The event goes from place to place each year and issues always arise about timing. If we keep the date flexible it means we can give a broader range of venues an opportunity to host the Famine commemorations. A commemoration was held in my local town of Clones and it was a lovely event. A lot of work goes into such events and they are very much community driven. We do not want to set an exact date in stone yet because we get a better result if we can retain a degree of flexibility. That is the current position. I cannot give the Deputy a commitment that we will set a date for the commemoration but I accept her point. The commemoration of the Great Irish Famine is very much in our calendar and every year we have had the famine commemoration the involvement of local communities has made it a great success. The international event is always held. I attended it in New Orleans this year. It was a tremendous event. Significant engagement by the Irish in New Orleans was evident. They are so proud of their Irish heritage. It is important that the commemorative events would continue on an annual basis both nationally and internationally.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">There you are now, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">You should not tempt us because we could start talking about anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> This legislation is such a no-brainer that it is almost peculiar that the House is spending time discussing it. I am not surprised the debate is proceeding more speedily than anticipated when it was scheduled. How could anyone oppose such a rational proposition? It is almost embarrassing that the House is discussing an issue related to a personal commitment between two people. That such a commitment could be prohibited in modern Ireland on sexual orientation grounds or for any other reason is a ludicrous idea. This view is shared by the vast majority of citizens, as I hope will become clear on 22 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> I believe the groups opposed to the legislation represent a small but loud minority. They argue that no other country provides for same-sex marriage in its constitution. However, no other country imposes the same restrictions on citizens' personal lives as our Constitution does. The idea that the State would restrict the personal behaviour of citizens is abhorrent. I am glad, therefore, that all political parties and groups in the House support the legislation as it shows that there is not much to discuss.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> The issue of equality lies at the heart of this debate. How could anyone favour inequality? If people do not want to enter into a same-sex marriage, no one is forcing them to do so. How can people have the brass neck to argue they have a right to impose a restriction on marriage or deny an opportunity to somebody else? That is a reprehensible idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> The institution of marriage has changed utterly. Historically, it was linked to the transfer of property rights, with women and children deemed to be the property of the male in the marriage, which was always heterosexual. The purpose of marriage was to protect property through the use of dowries and so forth. It also had a strong basis in religion, with Catholics and Protestants prohibited from marrying and so forth. While a modern marriage may be solemnised in a religious service, nowadays it is generally a civil arrangement between two adults who wish to make a public declaration of their commitment to each other. No one else is affected. There is a strong belief that the State has failed to keep pace with the major changes that have occurred in society in recent years. The forthcoming referendum presents a positive opportunity to do something about this failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> Research suggests that the only way the referendum could be lost is if people do not turn out to vote. I would like to use whatever influence I have to appeal to anyone who cares about my opinion to please come out and vote to take this step. People have traditionally used referendums to vote against the Government because they are not happy with its work in other areas. While it is understandable that people adopt this approach, they should not do so on this issue. The referendum should send out a positive signal to the world and minority groups living here that Ireland is a society of equals. It is rare for citizens to be given an opportunity to vote for something that is good and positive and will make a difference. This is one such opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> As Deputies are well aware, the well-being of children has nothing to do with the legislation. Nevertheless, the issue has been manipulated and introduced to the debate. Marriage has nothing to do with children <i>per se</i> and it is an insult to suggest that children would be worse off if they were raised in a relationship that is not heterosexual. That view also belies the research that has been done in this area. Large numbers of people are raised in different modern family arrangements, for example, many children are raised by grandparents, a mother or father living alone, a father and-or mother with a stepfather and-or stepmother or two fathers and two mothers. Who cares? If people love their children and look after them, that is all that counts. It is laughable to suggest that people should be prevented from making a commitment to each other on the basis of their sexual orientation.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> This is the first time I have been able to welcome wholeheartedly a proposal put forward by the Government. That alone is special and I appeal to people to come out on 22 May and deliver a resounding "Yes" vote.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_68">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_130">As Deputy Clare Daly stated, this is a happy occasion because we are further expanding the boundaries of freedom, equality and self-determination and placing another example of bigotry in the dustbin of history where it belongs. I very much welcome the Bill and look forward to the referendum campaign we will conduct in the weeks ahead. I hope and confidently believe we will achieve a resounding "Yes" vote on 22 May. While same-sex marriage has been a long time coming, it is nevertheless very welcome that we have finally reached this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> As someone who has fought for choice on many issues and in many areas in the 25 years that I have been a political activist, one of favourite pro-choice slogans is "Not the church, not the State, women must decide their fate". It applies every bit as much to this issue as to pro-choice issues because it relates to people's private lives. Human beings should decide their fate without interference from religious or State institutions that believe they can dictate to people how they live their personal lives. People's lives are their own and they should have the right to live them as they wish, provided they do not hurt anybody else. In that regard, it is very welcome that we have reached this point. I hope we will achieve a resounding victory on 22 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> The hypocrisy of the "No" side is stunning. They are dinosaurs who should fold up their tent and get off the stage. The main plank of their argument against the basic idea of equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, people is that they do not mind equality for LGBT people but they want to protect children. There is an irony in this. How exactly did the institutions in question protect children when, for 70 or 80 years, they forcibly separated children from their mothers simply because their parents were not married, incarcerated children in mother and baby homes and orphanages and incarcerated mothers in Magdalen laundries where many of them were enslaved and treated appallingly? Where was the care then? The very same institutions which claim to be championing the rights of children treated women and children abominably.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> I am not targeting all religious or Christian organisations, many of which continue to fight for justice and equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Indeed, there are some brave voices within the Catholic Church who have come out in recent days to say that they will be fighting for a "Yes" vote, opposing the diktat of the Catholic hierarchy.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> Let us consider the way other people have been prevented from getting married historically, in this country and elsewhere, and who the forces were. It was not simply about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Let us consider some examples of people who have been prevented from getting married. Catholics were prevented from marrying Protestants for a long time. Was that a prohibition? Was it because of the interests of the children or the protection of the heterosexual relationship? No, it was not. It was simply pure religious bigotry, nothing more. The Queen of England is precluded from marrying a Catholic. What is that about? It is simply sectarian bigotry. Black people were prevented from marrying white people before black civil rights were established in the United States. Was that about protection of the family or children? No, it was simply racism and bigotry. Often, it was the Christian right in the United States who headed up the charge, frequently making the claim that somehow black people were lesser and that this was why white people should not marry them.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> There is a nasty subtext to the arguments being made by the opponents of marriage equality. They do not have the honesty to set out fully their prejudices and bigotry. There is a nasty subtext when they suggest that somehow marriage equality for LGBT people is going to damage children. I will not even suggest what the subtext is, but it is obvious: there is an implication that somehow LGBT people are dangerous for children. It is absolutely nasty. It represents a veiling, under an apparently progressive argument about protecting children, of a nasty prejudice.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> Let us consider the abuse of children. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to suggest that there is any greater likelihood or propensity for children to be abused by gay and lesbian people than by heterosexual people or in heterosexual family circumstances. In fact, if anything it is probably the latter more than the former in terms of the history of abuse, sexual abuse and child abuse in this country. It represents a stunning hypocrisy and dishonesty by these organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> The other thing we need to put to bed is the notion that somehow these people, in defending the heterosexual notion or norm of marriage, are actually protecting a historical norm. It is absolutely not true. Let us consider the historical and archaeological evidence of human civilisation. We have discovered that gay, lesbian and trans people have been a part of human civilisation and culture since the beginning, since the mesolithic and neolithic societies and other ancient civilisations. Indeed, in ancient Ireland there is a plethora of or overwhelming evidence that same-sex relations and trans identity and so on have been part and parcel of human civilisation and culture since the beginning. It is the norm in terms of human history and culture. It was only in the latter half of the 19th century, as Deputy Daly has indicated, that a particular notion of marriage, connected to property rights, social control and passing on wealth, which actually degraded human and sexual relations by connecting them with money and passing on property, emerged. Human relations and marriage should be about love and human interaction, not passing on property and wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> In the previous debate I referred to people like Oscar Wilde and some of the other early victims of this, as the most reactionary elements in British society, joined, sadly, by the Catholic Church, set up certain family norms. Anyone who was outside those so-called norms was persecuted in the most despicable way. I watched a fantastic film last night, "The Imitation Game", about Alan Turing, the man who developed the machine or the early computers to break the Enigma code that the Nazis used. Having saved if not the world then millions of lives through developing this machine, he committed suicide because he happened to be gay. He was jailed and persecuted despite the major contribution he had made to human civilisation. He committed suicide because of his persecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> In line with all of this, I appeal to the Government to boycott the New York St. Patrick's Day parade this weekend, organised by the ancient order of homophobes, sometimes known as the Ancient Order of Hibernians. It is absolutely despicable that the organisers of the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York refuse to allow the Irish LGBT community onto that parade. I note that Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York city, has quite rightly made the decision to boycott that parade for the second year in a row. In solidarity with the LGBT people of this country, the United States and the world, I believe we should make a political point in favour of equality and against bigotry by refusing to join that parade this year.</p>

          <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_141">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important and historic Bill. I very much welcome the publication of the Bill. I will be voting "Yes" and campaigning for marriage equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> The one thing about human beings is that we are all different the world over. Sadly, history has shown how badly we, as human beings, treat people who are different. We need only look back at how the American Indian was treated as well as people of colour, women, particularly if they were pregnant outside of marriage, disabled people, or, as they would have been known in those times, handicapped people, transgender and intersex people and finally how gay people were treated and are still being treated in some societies today.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> We are all born as we are. We come into the world as we are. We are either Irish, English or Scottish, depending on where we were born. We come in as we are, male or female. We come into the world as we are, whether we are gay, straight, intersex or transgender. We need to accept this. If we could accept the basic simple fact that we are as we are born on a worldwide basis, then I believe life and the world would be a better place.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> The type of world that I want to live in is a world where equality is at the very root, where people are treated and respected equally and where we can all be who we are. We should not have to declare that we are somehow different. For example, I should not have to let everyone else know whether I am gay and therefore have to tell them that I am gay. I want to see a world where that thinking is eradicated. I want to see an Ireland where we do not have to do that any more and where a person is as she is and is accepted as who she is.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> We are moving slowly but surely to this world of equality in small parts. In particular, I am delighted that we are discussing this here today. However, we have a great deal more to do. We have more educating to do and we have much to get across to people who are in opposition to what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> Allowing same-gender people to marry is no threat to society or to existing civil or religious marriage. Marriage has a stabilising effect on our society. As far as I am concerned, the more people who want to get married, the better. I do not mind if a person is young or old when she gets married, as long as she is old enough and sensible enough. I do not mind whether it is two men who want to get married or two women who want to get married. I believe it is good for society. The fact that people want to get married is something we should welcome rather than reject or make people feel that somehow their love for each other is less in some way. That is what marriage is all about. It is the commitment of loving each other and deciding that they are going to face the world together as a unit and grow old together. Why should people of opposite gender feel that their love is superior in some way to people who are of the same gender? Fundamentally, that is at the core of this. When I hear people talking about how allowing people of the same gender to get married is somehow going to threaten my marriage or someone else's marriage, it is an argument that holds absolutely no water as far as I am concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> I think back to when I was a child and growing into my teenage years, as well as reflecting on my own children in their teenage years, and trying to come to terms with their identity and who they are. It is difficult enough for a straight teenager but can we imagine how difficult it must be for a gay teenager? Can we imagine the children who are looking at this debate and discussion and saying to themselves: "Am I not good enough? Am I not accepted for who I am? Do I have to pretend to be somebody else to be accepted?" I want us to move to a place in our society where Ireland can show the way and be one of the leaders in the world, and will actually say: "We welcome you for who you are. We are glad that you are who you are and you are welcome in our society, and we will extend the rights that everybody else has to include you so that you can get married in a civil marriage, if you actually want to."</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> I had a very interesting discussion about this with a very nice man who came to my clinic the other day. He said he was for traditional marriage and that he could not get his head around this. I explained to him my feelings on traditional marriage and what we perceive to be traditional marriage. Was it traditional marriage where a woman actually became a possession of her husband? Was that right? No, it was not, but it happened not too long ago. In my grandmother's lifetime, it was the case that a wife could not actually own property herself and her husband automatically owned it.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> I would ask the opponents of this referendum to consider very carefully the message they are sending out. If we are sending an impression that families who are less than their ideal, such as people who are reared by widows, by widowers or by aunts and uncles, are somehow lesser families, then I believe that is a very wrong message to send out. I would ask them to consider this very carefully and to be very respectful in this discussion. We should all have respect for each other's views but I would ultimately hope that this referendum will pass resoundingly.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill. I am 100% behind the referendum because it is all about equality and we cannot and should not measure equality. We are either equal or we are not, and that is basically it. This referendum will ask the Irish people to consider whether Article 41 of the Constitution should be amended so as to allow couples to marry without distinction as to their sex, which I believe they should. The Constitutional Convention recommended the introduction of same-sex marriage and marriage equality, and I thank it for its recommendation to bring this forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> The Government has committed to putting this referendum before the Irish people and I hope they will support it. If passed, people in this country will be able to enter into civil marriage regardless of their gender. The referendum is not about religion or religious marriage. It is a contract between two people. Some may say that same-sex couples have civil partnership and then ask is this not enough. I believe it is not. Allowing same-sex couples to marry and enshrining it in our Constitution gives these couples certainty that their union is legal and recognised in law. This is about the personal lives of two citizens and an expression of their love and commitment to one another. It is about respect for each other, even if there are differences or even different beliefs and values.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Marriage is all about love between two committed adults who promise to love, cherish and protect one another. Being a married woman, I lean on my husband deeply in terms of our dreams, our hopes, our disappointment and even our anger. I believe having somebody to stand beside you in those difficult times is very important. Who am I to say same-sex couples cannot marry and express their commitment and love in the same way as heterosexual couples?</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> As a mother, if one of my children told me in the morning they were gay and wanted to marry their partner, I would support them unconditionally. Any parent only wants what is best for their children and wants them to be happy. I would be very aware of the challenges they would face and, in many ways, I would give them a little extra support.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> This Bill does nothing to undermine marriage between a man and woman, whether they marry within the church or outside. Some people have raised the question of children in the context of this referendum. This referendum has nothing to do with adoption or same-sex couples having children. It is all about equality and love, whereas all of those issues will be dealt with in the Children and Family Relationships Bill which is currently going through the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> I welcome the Bill on the grounds that it speaks about equality and it speaks about love. Most of all, it speaks about the commitment of two people in their lives to enter into a partnership, whether they are a man and a woman or a same-sex couple. I want to finish with a line I came across a few weeks ago while reading. It says that the only true measure of human success is love and, without love, even the ones who appear to be most successful are nothing more than the clouds that appear great and powerful in the morning but have disappeared by the afternoon. To me, that reflects what this referendum and this Bill are about. As we campaign for this referendum, I would urge all of the people out there to consider their own children and how they would feel if they were tomorrow asked by their sons or daughters, or by grandchildren or great-grandchildren, to love them and to cherish them as much as they did those other members of their family who marry into religious marriage.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">I am pleased to contribute to the debate. I want to deal with an area on which same-sex marriage will have an influence, which is the stigmatisation of gay people and the effect this has on their mental health and well-being. There is the whole area of how our society treats or abuses gay people, both historically and in the present. I believe same-sex marriage will contribute significantly to the de-stigmatising of the LGBT community, although it will not eliminate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Researchers have found that attempted suicide and rates of suicidal ideation among LGBT youth are comparatively higher than among the general population. LGBT teens and young adults have one of the highest rates of suicide attempts. Bullying of LGBT youth has been shown to be a contributing factor in many suicides, even if not all of the attempts have been specifically addressing sexuality or gender. In the United States, since a series of suicides in the early 2000s, more attention has been focused on the issues and underlying causes in an effort to reduce suicide among LGBT youth. Parental acceptance and even neutrality with regard to child sexual orientation can bring down the suicide rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Gay people in Ireland have a tenfold risk of self-harming behaviours and are seven times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexuals, according to 2013 research by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. Professor Mary Cannon, a psychiatrist who led this study, said the striking finding was a link between sexual orientation and mental ill health. A hugely elevated risk of mood disorders, self-harm and attempted suicide was found among LGBT youth when Professor Cannon's team followed up the study. People who engage in suicide attempts and plans are at greater risk of later suicide. In 2001, some 212 students aged 13 to 15 were randomly selected at several northside Dublin schools in a study to assess levels of mental disorder. About 80% agreed to take part in the 2013 follow-up survey. About 6% identified themselves as either lesbian, gay or bisexual. The study found that the mental health of this group was far worse than that of their heterosexual peers. There were higher rates of depression and about 50% had engaged in an act of deliberate self-harm, such as minor cutting and overdose, compared with fewer than 20% for the rest.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> A person of minority sexual orientation is at a tenfold risk of self-harm behaviours. The reason is unclear, although there is evidence that being part of a minority group suffering discrimination is itself stressful. The National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork did research which indicated that young people with worries about their sexual orientation and who are bullied had higher rates of self-harm. The disapproval of family members may also be a factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The LGBT groups seem to have identified more problems in the family environment. Those who are working had some difficulties with colleagues. Much of the difficulties are a result of young people not fitting into their environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> Other research shows the experience of being LGBT in Ireland can have a negative impact on mental health. When LGBT people experience a number of stressful situations, such as fear of coming out, a lack of support after coming out, harassment in their communities or homophobic bullying, there is an increased risk of self-harm and suicide. The GLEN Supporting LGBT Lives report is a comprehensive study of the mental health and well-being of LGBT people in Ireland to date. In addition to examining mental health, the study investigated LGBT people's experience of growing up, school, coming out, work, using health services and day-to-day experiences. The study found that 27% had self-harmed and 85% of those did so more than once. The average age of first self-harming was 16 years, 40% of females and 20% of males had self-harmed, 18% had attempted suicide and 85% saw their first attempt as related to the stresses associated with their LGBT identity. The average age of a first suicide attempt was seventeen and half years, while 24% of females and 15% of males attempted suicide at least once. Of those aged 25 years and under, one third had thought seriously about ending their lives within the past year. Over 50% had done so at some time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Helen McEntee<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_163">I welcome the opportunity to speak on what is an important and historic debate in the Chamber. If the referendum is passed later this year it will be a momentous achievement of which I will be proud to be a part. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, said: "This is not a Bill about 'gay marriage', it is about 'equal marriage'. It is not about weakening one of the strongest institutions in society, it is about strengthening it by making it inclusive and for everyone." The idea that my friends, work colleagues, neighbours, people I know or family members who we do not always know are gay might not have the same rights as me is ludicrous. The idea that someone is treated differently because he or she is gay is ludicrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> This year, every citizen in Ireland over 18 years of age will have the opportunity to change that, and I urge people to exercise their right to vote and to vote "Yes" in the upcoming referendum. Times are changing and I have been privileged in the past two weeks to speak on two Bills which have come before the Dáil, namely, the Gender Recognition Bill and the Children and Family Relationships Bill. Both Bills are reforming and show that as a people and society we are changing. While I understand that some people do not like change, and are often afraid of it and what it might mean, the only change the referendum will bring about is that we will be a more equal society, and surely that is something we should welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> As has been mentioned, in the Ireland of 100 years ago, women could not vote. Some 40 or 50 years ago in Ireland a woman's place was in the home and when women got married they had to give up their jobs. As recently as 20 years ago in Ireland, people could not divorce, if a person took his or her life, he or she was seen as a criminal, and contraception was not readily available. As someone living in the here and now, all of this seems ludicrous, but back then it did not. We are not living back then; we are living in the here and now. Right now every person in this country is not being treated equally and I want to live in a country and world where people are treated equally. To me, marriage is about two people who love each other and want to commit to each other, irrespective of their gender, and this Bill and Government shows leadership and shows the rest of the world that we treat our citizens as equals and respect each other. While we recognise that we are different, as individuals, we all want to be treated with the same respect, and so we should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> I was very disappointed by the remarks that were made over the weekend against those advocating for a "Yes" vote. Those who are opposed to marriage equality need to take a step back and consider how they would feel if one of their children, family members, brothers, sisters or best friends told them they were gay. Would they see him or her as less of a person because he or she was gay?</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> I am 28 years of age and in a committed relationship. If the next step is marriage and it is what we both want, then that option is available to us. However, it is not available to everybody. While we have civil marriage, it is not defined in the Constitution and this is something we need to change. We face a challenge in the referendum this year. Voter turnout might be an issue. The children's referendum took place only a few years ago and I understand turnout was as low as 32%. Sometimes when people feel something has nothing to do with them they take a step back. I ask people to think about what they would do and how they would feel if this affected their friend or family member and whether they would treat them any differently. </p>
          <p eId="para_168"> We are sending an extremely positive message to our young people, namely, that marriage is about two people who love each other. I would be proud to live a country that allows that to happen, irrespective of gender.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Lyons<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_169">I wish to share time with Deputy Conway. I am delighted to speak here today. I do not have a lot prepared. I received a call that I was due to speak; I thought I was due to speak later today. A number of things come to mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> The teenagers who beat Declan Flynn to death because they thought he was gay were given suspended sentences 32 years ago yesterday. That was the type of society in which we lived until recently. People are not being beaten to death for being gay today, but let us not forget that there are people who are stigmatised and cannot be themselves today because they are gay or feel they are treated differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> In 1974, a gay person was seen as having a mental disorder and had to visit a doctor to check if he or she was okay. Thankfully, we no longer have to do things like that. We have come a long way in the intervening 40 years. When the gay switchboard was set up 41 years ago, it could not have its number in the telephone directory because the term "gay" was not allowed to be printed in the posts and telegraph directory, as it might have been back then. Young people today might have forgotten or do not know about such things, but Ireland has moved on in the past 40 years. In the past 20 years it has accelerated very quickly towards legislation to protect people and minorities. </p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1993. Young people growing up today probably never realised that one could go to prison if one was gay. Those days are gone. In May, we will be asked whether we believe that every citizen in this country is equal. We all know what love feels like. We fall in and out of love many times in our lives and most of us eventually find the one. I hope Deputy McEntee has found the one for her and that he asks her the question some day. We cannot touch or see love, but we can all feel it and it feels fantastic. It warms one's belly and makes one laugh, cry and do crazy things for the person with whom one falls in love. That is love, and it is not confined to any gender or sexuality. It transcends all people who live in every country and it is the same love whether one is gay or straight. </p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Until now we have decided to say that love is not the same for gay and straight people and the love for people who are heterosexual is different from that of people who are gay or lesbian. All of us in the Chamber know that is different. We are here today because we believe that the people of Ireland, regardless of their sexuality, are equal and should be treated the same. I thank my colleagues who have spoken today and the people who have made it possible in recent times for the people of Ireland to have a referendum in May and share the view of society, namely, that the love between two loving adults, regardless of their sexuality, is the same and people should have the right to marry regardless of their sexual orientation.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Irish people are fair minded and if the people who believe in this, who are in the majority, come out in May, they will vote "Yes". People are being asked to vote on whether they want to make a difference in Irish society, make it better and ensure everybody is treated equally, or whether they want a society that treats people differently because of their sexuality.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Irish people are not stupid and it is a no-brainer for most people. I do not live in a bubble, despite what people may think. Many people favour this but they need to come out in May and endorse their point of view and the strong feeling they have for equality in the ballot box. It will be no good if most of the people in my area or other parts of the country believe this is good and we should have equality for people in accessing civil marriage but sit in their houses. They must come out and make it happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> As others have said, the sky will not fall in with this referendum. Any marriage that exists today will still be same as it was yesterday. We will allow a sector of society that is currently being treated unequally to be treated equally. These people feel love when they get butterflies in their stomach and it will be treated as equal to the love felt by other citizens in this society. I welcome this Bill and I believe the Irish people will endorse this referendum. We must not lose faith in the issue and we should ensure that we ask everybody we know to participate. That includes everybody in our phone books, on our Facebook pages and our Twitter accounts. We must ask people to come out and vote because we need them to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">My good friend and colleague, Deputy John Lyons, spoke about the equal right to civil marriage, regardless of sexual orientation and gender. Equally, it is a great source of pride for parents around the country to submit their child's wedding photograph to the local paper, whether it is the <i>Longford Leader</i> or the <i>Waterford News and Star</i>. I cannot wait for Deputy Lyons's ma to be able to send his wedding photograph to the <i>Northside People</i> when we pass this referendum in May. Not only do the "mas and das" of the country take great pride in this but it is also a great source of embarrassment for us, their children. As somebody who was relatively recently married, I cannot wait for the day when my friends, colleagues and family members can experience the wonderful joy of being a married person.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> Some of the people who speak out about this referendum talk about the issues of family and children. I ask the people who speak out against it that if a married couple does not have children, are they any less married than somebody who has children? We know they are not. It also causes great offence, as others have mentioned, to men and women around the country who have lost their partners in death and who have raised children as widows and widowers. Are these people any less of a family? No, they are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> We must be really careful with young people living at home who have listened to radio stations and television debates. They are reading online articles and newspapers and it might be argued that there is something wrong with being gay and wanting to marry a loved one. We must be very careful in looking after these young, vulnerable people that Deputy Neville mentioned who have great difficulties in coming to terms with the fact they are gay. There are adults, including opinion formers, community activists and leaders, as well as leaders of religious organisation, who argue that being gay and the associated feelings are wrong. I am glad to say that is not true. This country has taken great strides to tackle the issues important to gay and lesbian people and include them. It is a source of great shame that it took until 1993 to decriminalise homosexuality; although that is a number of years ago, it is a relatively recent change to our Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> I am very proud to be part of a Government that is putting this question to the people of Ireland: do we believe that people who love each other should be allowed to make a declaration to say "I do"? Regardless of gender and sexual orientation, everybody in this country should be entitled to that day out. Every ma in the country should be entitled to wear her hat and every dad should be entitled to tremble at the thought of making a speech at that wedding. I believe strongly in this and for the first time in a long time in politics, I am excited about this campaign. There is a great sense of positivity and we are doing something good and momentous. We will be the first country in the world to put this question to a popular vote. It is a risky strategy but I hope and know the Irish people will be able to deliver on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I have been engaging with a really wonderful family lately who told me about a young son whom they adopted from Russia. He is gay. The family brought him to this country for a better life and the family members told me, with great distress, that if he was still living in Russia, he would be imprisoned, beaten up or maybe killed by the regime over there. This family and the son's friends want Ireland to send a signal that we are a progressive country that treats all our citizens equally. For that young man, his family and families right around the country, the people of Ireland must come out to vote "Yes" in May. It is important to realise that the people who will vote "Yes" and have made up their minds cannot just speak to each other. We need to get out and talk to people who do not have this on their agenda. Perhaps these people have not made up their mind. We must ensure a good turnout and make this a real issue. We never know what is down the track for our children, our nieces, nephews, brothers, sisters, mothers or fathers. We do not know what will happen or who may come out in years to come. I know that I want to be part of an Oireachtas that will give the equal right to say "I do" to all our citizens, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. I thank the Minister for her efforts on this and I look forward to working with her until polling day in May.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to this very important matter. I was in my office earlier wondering what I would say about this and what I could pack into the short few minutes I have to speak. A copy of the Proclamation was on the wall so I took it from its frame and brought it with me. It begins by addressing "Irishmen and Irishwomen". It does not refer to "straight Irishmen and straight Irishwomen" and it does not differentiate between gay, bisexual and transgender people. It repeats "Irishmen and Irishwomen" in a couple of places. Further down, it indicates that the "Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally". That says it all, and I quoted the part about cherishing all the children of the nation equally approximately three years ago when I spoke on this issue. I asked at that time that in a nation that cherishes all of her children equally, this matter should not really be such an issue for debate. I very much welcome the opportunity to put this to the people. It is a major step forward, although unfortunately long overdue, coming almost 99 years after the Proclamation was written. This is the year to which Marty McFly went "Back to the Future"; and I hope this will be the future of Ireland. We may not have hoverboards but I hope we will have marriage equality. That is fundamentally important for every citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> I ask for respect in the debate between now and 22 May, with all sides being given the opportunity to make their views known. All sides must respectfully listen to the opposite views, as well as opinions along the spectrum. There are many differing views in this regard. I encourage people in my constituency in Kerry to support the referendum. It is fundamental to achieving equality in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">It says a lot about us as a people. I commend the very powerful contributions by my colleagues. I acknowledge the importance of marriage. I am a married man. It is very important to me and I could not imagine not having that opportunity at some stage in my life because of my sexual orientation. As a straight man, I have never had to come out and put that on the record as a public representative. Unfortunately, even today, some of my colleagues have felt compelled to do that. Maybe the day will come when that does not happen or is not an issue. Progress and evolution are slow, but I like to think we are getting there. This Bill is a huge step along the way. </p>
          <p eId="para_185"> I have been watching Deputy Mathews, who likes to bring books into the Chamber. I have brought in a little book called <i>Keel - A Gathering of Images</i>. My good friend, Gráinne Murphy, and I put it together in Keel in Castlemaine, where I come from, to mark the year of The Gathering in 2013. It is a collection of approximately 1,000 photographs dating back to the 1860s from the parish of Keel up to the present day. Tucked unassumingly into a corner on page 169 is a photograph of a couple who were the first couple in Keel to live in a civil partnership. We put it in with photographs from all over the parish, wrote the caption and thought no more about it. We did not realise how important it was to those people in the photograph who made a public point about this, saying it might not have happened ten years ago. That is a measure of how we are coming a long way as a society, and changing. It also shows that we should not underestimate how much little things mean to people, whether small positive things such as that little photograph, or big positive things such as bringing this matter to a referendum and hopefully getting the right result. On the flip side, there are the hurtful things. We should not underestimate how hurtful some of the things being said during this discussion can be to people. We all need to bear that in mind, and I add that to my call for a respectful debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> I acknowledge some Members, past and present, who have recently made very powerful contributions to this debate that carried a little more weight because of their personal circumstances. I refer particularly to a fellow Keel man and former Minister, Pat Carey, who recently made a very powerful contribution to this debate. I congratulate him on his contribution. He has an important role to play in the rest of this campaign. </p>
          <p eId="para_187"> As the father of a young child, and hopefully from June, of two children, I realise that this Bill affects not only this generation, but also future generations. It is about the type of country we want our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren to grow up in. I urge a "Yes" vote in May and urge those who have made up their minds to vote "No" to reconsider, to listen to other views and to think about the country they want their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren to grow up in, and about what will be best for them. I urge them to think about eventualities and make sure they will have all the freedoms that most other citizens have. If people do that, it might change their minds or help them come to a different decision. We need to live and let live and love and let love.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I thank the Deputies who have contributed to this debate on the referendum Bill. It has been a very moving debate. We can be very proud of the values articulated here. The heartfelt, passionate and personal contributions by Deputies on all sides of the House were striking. I welcome the broad support across the House for this Bill. It has been a very considered and thoughtful debate. I hope that will be reflected in the debate that takes place when the people discuss, and are asked to decide on, this issue. Deputies represent all strands of our society. I hope their constituents will hear their very powerful contributions to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> The response to this debate shows that this is a Bill and an issue for our time. As many Deputies have said, it is overdue. It is an issue whose time has come. It is time for the people to decide whether to extend the right to marry to all couples who wish to do so. That will be offered to the people in May. It concerns marriage equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> I agree with many speakers that it is a fitting commemoration of the legacy of 1916 that we as a nation should get the opportunity to cherish all our people equally. Deputy Griffin brought in the Proclamation and read from it, making some very relevant points. We have the chance, as legislators, to follow in the footsteps of Daniel O’Connell, who, as the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, reminded us last night, fought for decades to combat inequality. O’Connell understood that a society is measured by its readiness to extend rights to all. Once in a generation the people get the chance to define who they are, to decide the boundaries of the rights that underpin our society. The decision is in the people’s hands. I hope the people will exercise their characteristic generosity and fairness and will vote on 22 May in favour of equality.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">Since the publication of the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment, some media commentators have raised issues regarding the Irish version of the text. Their principal argument is that the Irish version of the text carries the risk of applying only to same-sex couples - that it would provide for marriage only between same-sex couples. The Oireachtas translation service is of the view that the Irish version as produced is robust and encompasses a right to marry for opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples. The Irish wording in the published Bill was produced by the Oireachtas translation service, building on the existing precedent of the Irish language version of "without distinction of sex" used in Article 16 of the Constitution. The Government, however, is moving the amendment to the Irish wording of the proposed thirty-fourth amendment so that the new Irish wording will be a more literal translation of the English wording, which is "Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex." This is to try to ensure that the sole focus of the debate will be on the wording proposed to be inserted in the Constitution rather than whether there may be differences between the Irish and English language versions.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The new wording is as recommended by the Oireachtas translation service and I have briefed the Opposition on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The following are the key elements of the amendment proposed to the Irish wording. The phrase "cibé acu is fir nó mná iad" would be replaced with the phrase "gan beann ar a ngnéas". That phrase is a more literal rendering and one which is without distinction as to their sex. The phrase, which translates literally as "without regard to", has been previously used in a proposed article 42A in relation to children.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> The phrase "conradh pósta a dhéanamh" would replace the phrase "conradh a dhéanamh i leith pósadh". That is intended to clarify that the provision only relates to contracts of marriage, and to remove any possibility that it could be taken as referring to other contracts relating to marriage, such as pre-nuptial contracts.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">Baineann an cheist atá agam don Taoiseach inniu le cúrsaí fostaíochta. Is léir go bhfuil líon na ndaoine atá dífostaithe sa tír faoi láthair ag laghdú. Fáiltímid ar fad roimhe sin. Is léir freisin go bhfuil líon na ndaoine atá fostaithe ag ardú, go háirithe anseo sa chathair seo agus sna contaetha timpeall na cathrach. Nuair atáimid ag éisteacht leis an CSO, foghlaimímid go bhfuil a mhalairt ag tarlú in iarthar na tíre, sna ceantracha timpeall an Teorann agus i gcontaetha ar nós Loch Garman agus Port Láirge, áit ina bhfuil poist fós á gcailliúnt.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> In many areas outside the greater Dublin area, the retail sector continues to employ people and support employment in local communities. However, many of those jobs are part-time or otherwise temporary in nature. Dunnes Stores is our largest indigenous retailer with 107 stores nationwide, employing about 5,000 people. Many of those are in part-time, temporary employment. Some 76% of Dunnes Stores' employees are on flexible employment contracts. </p>
          <p eId="para_224"> In the past 30 minutes, as the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, completed the passage through this House of the marriage equality legislation, I was struck by the fact that such equality is exceedingly difficult for people working in Dunnes Stores. That is because those working there on zero-hour contracts cannot face into marriage and cannot get a mortgage. Among the many difficulties of operating on a zero-hour contract is that they cannot even enter into a rental agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> The workers have engaged with the Labour Relations Commission but Dunnes Stores, as their employer, has refused to engage. What will the Taoiseach, his Government and more particularly the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, do about this most unacceptable situation that primarily affects women?</p>

          <p eId="para_226">Tá a fhios go maith ag an Teachta go bhfuil ardú céime ag teacht ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta na tíre le tamall beag anuas. Ceithre bliana ó shin, ní raibh sé ar ár gcumas poist ar bith a chruthú. Tá cúrsaí eacnamaíochta i bhfad níos láidre anois. Is fíor a rá go bhfuil feabhas mór tagtha ar chúrsaí fostaíochta anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath agus i nGaillimh. Tá Luimneach ag ardú go láidir ag an bpointe seo. Tá Corcaigh agus Port Láirge ag teacht aníos freisin. Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil straitéis réigiúnach leagtha amach ag an Rialtas ó thaobh cúrsaí infheistíochta ó thíortha thar lear. Táimid ag iarraidh cabhair a thabhairt do na comhlachtaí ar fud na tíre atá in ann easpórtáil a dhéanamh. Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil cúrsaí talmhaíochta agus eacnamaíochta á láidriú freisin, ó thaobh na scéimeanna áirithe atá leagtha amach in áiteanna ar fud chuile chontae.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil suas le 500 duine ag obair sa chomhlacht a luaigh an Teachta. Ní hé seo an chéad uair go raibh stailc ag teacht, nó curtha ar bun ó thaobh vótaí na n-oibritheoirí, sa chomhlacht sin. Bhí mé ag caint le hoifigigh an cheardchumainn faoin deacracht seo le déanaí. Tá an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Nash, ag déileáil le cúrsaí dlí fostaíochta ó thaobh na n-oibritheoirí nach bhfuil conarthaí seasmhacha acu. Tá sé ag obair ar an ábhar sin faoi láthair. Tá a fhios ag an Teachta go bhfuil coimisiún curtha ar bun dóibh siúd a bhfuil pá íseal acu. Cuirfear tuarascáil an choimisiún sin faoi bhráid an Rialtais roimh mhí Iúil. Tabharfaidh an Rialtas freagra ar mholtaí an choimisiúin roimh an mbuiséad agus ag am an bhuiséid.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> Tá na heagrais Stáit a luaigh an Teachta réidh, agus bhí siad réidh, chun déileáil am ar bith leis an gcomhlacht seo, leis na fostóirí sa chomhlacht agus go deimhin leis na hoibritheoirí sa chomhlacht. Cé go bhfuil na hoibritheoirí tar éis a gcuid vótaí a chaitheamh, tá súil agam go mbeidh siad in ann déileáil go cruinn leis an deacracht atá ann ionas go mbeidh faisnéis shoiléir agus sheasmhach ag na hoibritheoirí atá ag obair don chomhlacht seo. Tá cuid acu ag obair ann le blianta fada anuas. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé indéanta an fhadhb seo a réiteach idir an chomhlacht agus na hoibritheoirí. Muna bhfuil siad in ann é sin a dhéanamh, tá na heagrais Stáit ann chun tuilleadh cabhrach a thabhairt dóibh.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">Ní dóigh liom go mbeidh na daoine atá ag obair sa chomhlacht atá luaite againn róshásta leis an bhfreagra a thug an Taoiseach dúinn. The issue for Dunnes Stores workers is not just about pay. It is also about their working conditions and the hours available to them in any given week. It is about being able to build a life for themselves and their families in which they can plan a future. If one does not know from week to week whether one will have five, ten or 25 hours of work, one cannot plan a life, run a household or organise a family.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> Does the Taoiseach think it is acceptable, in this day and age, that a company with the reputation and standing that Dunnes Stores undoubtedly has is right in refusing to sit down with Mandate? Does he think that his Government has done enough to date to address this issue, which is critical to the Irish people. The public look to Dunnes Stores as our major national retailer. It is not setting a very good example for other employers in the retail sector if this is how Dunnes Stores is going to behave. </p>
          <p eId="para_231"> I put it to the Taoiseach that it is not sufficient to pass the buck to the Minister of State, Deputy Nash. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has a role to play in this matter as well. I call on the Taoiseach to ensure that he engages with the management of Dunnes Stores as a matter of urgency. This zero-hour situation should be rectified so that people do not go on strike on 2 April losing the very small money that they can ill afford to lose.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">Tá sé fíor le rá gur chóir go mbeadh faisnéis soiléir ag chuile oibrí atá ag obair leis an gcomhlacht seo. Níl sé sásúil nach bhfuil an t-eolas sin le fáil acu. Níl sé mar chumas ag an Rialtas brú a chur ar chomhlacht ar bith agus ordú dóibh í a chur ar fáil. Aontaím leis an Teachta maidir leis seo. Tá sé seo déanta ag comhlachtaí eile ar nós an ceann a luaigh an Teachta le fada. Tá faisnéis soiléir tugtha acu siúd dá n-oibrithe. Ba chóir go mbeadh an rud céanna le fáil ag na hoibrithe atá ag obair in Dunnes Stores. Níl an Rialtas ag cur brú ar an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Nash. Tá dualgas dlíthiúil agus bunreachtúil aige ón Rialtas agus is faoi chúram an Aire Post, Fiontar agus Nuálaíochta, an Teachta Bruton, an rud seo chomh maith. Tá an tAire Stáit ag obair go dian maidir le ceist na n-oibrithe nach bhfuil ach pá íseal acu, coimisiún a bhunú agus na conarthaí gearrthéarmacha atá ann faoi láthair. Sin atá i gceist agus sin an dualgas bunreachtúil agus dualgas rialtais atá ann. Tiocfaidh an tAire Stáit chuig an Rialtas nuair a bheidh an tuarscáil ar fáil agus nuair a bheith moltaí le cur os comhair an Rialtais aige.</p>

Ba chóir go mbeadh an t-eolas sin ar fáil. Tá an Teachta ceart sa mhéad ina bhfuil á rá aige. Ba chóir go mbeadh na mná seo in ann a rá lena gclanna na laethanta agus na huaireanta sa lá a bheidh siad ag obair.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">Nuair a tháinig Fine Gael agus Páirtí an Lucht Oibre i gcumhacht, gheall siad tabhairt faoin ghéarchéim morgáiste. Mar an gcéanna le gearchéim fiacha an Stáit, theip ar an Rialtas go dona. Dúirt an Banc Ceannais go bhfuil 37,000 duine go dona i bhfiacha agus faoi bhrú ag an dlí anois. I mo dháilcheantair, tá na bainc ag iarraidh 249 teach a bhaint de theaghlaigh. Sin drochscéal. Nuair a foilsíodh na figiúir i mí Mheán Fómhair 2012, ní raibh ach 20,000 duine i gceist. Ní hionann scéal an Rialtais agus na scéalta faoi dhaoine atá ag cailliúint a dtithe agus atá faoi bhrú ag na bainc. Is iad seo na bainc chéanna a thug an Rialtas airgead dóibh. Rinne an Rialtas an praiseach seo. Níor chuidigh an Rialtas leis na daoine agus na teaghlaigh atá ag calliúint a dtithe lena pholasaí. Níl biseach ar an scéal nuair atá daoine ag cailliúint a dtithe gan aon áit le dul acu agus fiacha móra orthu. Ba cheart do chásanna na ndaoine seo atá i dtrioblóid a bheith réitithe. An gcuideoidh an Rialtas leis na daoine seo atá faoi bhrú agus atá imní orthu faoin Acht?</p>

Mar a dúirt mé inné agus mé ag freagairt cheist an Teachta Martin, tá athbhreithniú déanta ag an Rialtas ar na seirbhísí atá ar fáil faoi láthair.

Níor theastaigh ón Rialtas go dtógadh teach ar bith ó chlann ar bith. Is é sin an príomh rud. Ba chóir go mbeadh na socruithe a bheidh ar fáil luaite agus faisnéis fúthu curtha os comhair gach duine. Tiocfaimid ar ais go dtí an Teach seo i mí Aibreáin le cuid eile socruithe a theastaíonn ón Rialtas a chur ar fáil dóibh siúd a bhfuil deacrachtaí acu.

D'athraigh an Rialtas an dlí chun go bhféadfadh leis na bainc tithe a thógáil ó theaghlaigh. D'athraigh an Rialtas an dlí chun é a dhéanamh níos éasca do na bainc tithe a bhaint de theaghlaigh. Tá veto ag na bainc. Thug an Rialtas an veto dóibh. Dúirt roinnt daoine nach raibh sé sin ceart, ina measc Sinn Féin. Tá sé an-soiléir go gceapann na bainc gur féidir leo faic a dhéanamh toisc nach bhfuil aon chosaint reachtaíochta ann do theaghlaigh. Banks will do what banks do. Caithfidh an Rialtas an veto a bhaint de na bainc. An mbainfidh an Rialtas an veto de na bainc agus cosaint níos láidre a thabhairt do theaghlaigh nuair a thiocfaidh an Rialtas ar ais go dtí an Teach an mhí seo chugainn?</p>

D'athraíomar an dlí agus d'ísligh an Rialtas an méid ama a bhí ag baint leis an gcóras sin ó 12 bliain go trí bliana. Tá Bille nua luaite ag an Teachta Penrose a athródh é seo go bliain amháin. Aontaíonn cuid mhaith de na Teachtaí leis an méid sin. Tá sé sin ráite ag cuid mhaith de na Teachtaí le cúpla seachtain anuas. Chun é sin a chur i gcrích, beidh ar an Rialtas an dlí a athrú. Beidh sé sin á phlé chomh maith le na moltaí a chuirfear os comhair na Dála an mhí seo chugainn. Tá sé tábhachtach nuair a théann cás os comhair na gcúirteanna go mbeadh an cead ag an mbreitheamh - tá sé seo sa dlí faoi láthair - scrúdú a dhéanamh ar na moltaí atá déanta ag an personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, go neamhspleách.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">In December, it was reported that President Higgins raised the issue of human rights violations with the Chinese President during his visit. Last month, the Taoiseach spoke highly of the legacy of the former Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr. Séamus Mallon, and Mr. John Hume, and stated that both were outstanding examples of persons who were unafraid to stand up for human rights, equality, dignity and political progress. I want to know whether the Taoiseach will use his visit to the White House next week to raise human rights issues with President Obama.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> The Americans started a perpetual war in 2001 and today it is the single biggest source of misery and suffering on the planet. The Obama Administration conducts operations all over the world. In 2014, US special operation forces deployed to 133 countries riding roughshod over international treaties, laws and human rights obligations. The war on terror is responsible for the deaths of over 1 million people and has caused the displacement of millions more. The only winner is the arms industry which helped to put President Obama in power.</p>

          <p eId="para_257"> Not only is President Obama's drone programme one of the most glaring acts of terror being perpetrated on Earth today, it is one of the best recruitment instruments for those who may be willing to take up arms against US forces and its allies.</p>

There is no logic to how the US military machine is operating. They may be giving us jobs here through American business but it does not change the fact that we should have a problem with children being murdered and slaughtered in the interests of promoting the arms industry and controlling resources. We should have an issue with it. We should have some streak of independence and neutrality.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> Obama has used the Espionage Act twice as many times as all other US Presidents put together. Whistleblowers and courageous journalists are being hunted down like never before.

          <p eId="para_316">Tá dhá cheist agam don Taoiseach. In ainneoin go bhfuil ceannaireacht léirithe aige le linn Cheisteanna na gCeannairí, níl mórán ar an gclár Rialtais i dtaobh na Gaeilge. Is é ceann de na gnéithe atá luaite ann ná go bhfuil an Rialtas chun athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an nGaeilge mar ábhar don ardteistiméireacht. An bhfuil an t-athbhreithniú sin déanta? Má tá cad atá ar intinn aige agus an bhfuil moladh ar bith ag an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna nó ag an Rialtas?</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> I wish to raise a second issue in the context of the criminal justice Bill. We all recall the appalling story of Maíria Cahill, which moved us all last year, and the moving debate that took place in this House. Last night on the "Spotlight" programme we heard Paudie McGahon's account of having been raped and subsequently threatened by the IRA. We have heard stories of the cover-up by Sinn Féin of these happenings and are aware that the kangaroo court involved in this particular case took place in 2002, four years after the Good Friday Agreement. It was only 13 years ago; it is not ancient history. In light of what has been emerging and what we believe will continue to emerge over time, and in order to stop the drip-drip of information, would the Taoiseach and his Government consider establishing an independent statutory inquiry to examine these accusations of sexual and other abuse carried out by members of the IRA?</p>

          <p eId="para_324">Tá dhá cheist agam don Taoiseach. Baineann mo chéad cheist leis an gclár Rialtais agus sláinte go háirithe. Sa bhliain 2011 gheall Fine Gael agus Páirtí an Lucht Oibre go mbeadh córas sláinte againn a bheadh bunaithe ar riachtanas amháin, seachas ar airgead. Níor tharla sé seo. Tá éigeandáil sna ranna éigeandála. Níl aon acmhainní ann agus tá na dochtúirí féin ag rá an méid seo leis an Taoiseach go poiblí. Cathain a chomhlíonfaidh an Taoiseach agus a Rialtas an gealltanas tábhachtach seo?</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> Gheall an tAire Comhshaoil, Pobail agus Rialtas Áitiúil an tseachtain seo caite go dtabharfadh sé reachtaíocht isteach chun cíosanna arda san earnáil príobháideach a smachtú le haghaidh dhá bhliain agus chun tabhairt faoi na harduithe cíosa. Cathain a foilseofar an reachtaíocht seo? An mbeidh sé mar dhlí roimh an gcéad olltoghchán eile? </p>
          <p eId="para_326"> Táim cinnte go ndeachaigh scéal Paudie McGahon go mór i bhfeidhm ar gach duine a bhí ag breathnú ar aréir. Dúirt an Teachta Ó Fearghaíl go raibh "cover up" ann le Sinn Féin. Ní raibh ar chor ar bith. Dúirt an Taoiseach go mbeadh ceisteanna le freagairt ag Sinn Féin. D'fhreagair mé na ceisteanna seo. Táim fíorchinnte go raibh baill Fhianna Fáil tríd na cúirteanna, agus daoine ó Fhine Gael fosta. Is í sin an fhírinne. Táimid fíorshásta nach raibh aon duine a dhein an drochúsáid ghnéasach ar Paudie á dhéanamh i m'ainmse, in ainm Shinn Féin nó in ainm na bpoblachtach. Má tá eolas ag éinne ar bith - faic ar bith, scéal ar bith ag dinnéar ar bith - caithfidh siad an t-eolas sin a thabhairt don Gharda Síochána nó do na póilíní sa Tuaisceart. Níor fhreagair an Taoiseach faic ar bith le Máirtín Mac Aonghusa faoi scéim a chur ar aghaidh chun taca a thabhairt do na daoine seo.</p>

Déanfar é sin faoi cheann cúpla seachtain. Tá an scéal a luaigh an Teachta Ó Fearghaíl uafásach ar fad. Tharla sé i gContae Lú, i ndáilcheantar an Teachta Mac Ádhaimh. Ba chóir dó labhairt amach faoi thithe sábháilte.</p>

Ní fheicim é ar an gclár reachtaíochta. Bhí sé ann nuair a tháinig an Rialtas i gcumhacht. Bhí sé ann ar feadh dhá bhliain. Anois tá an cuma air go bhfuil sé imithe.</p>

Ba chóir go mbeadh na treoracha seo trasuithe sa dlí roimh Aibreán an bhliain seo chugainn. Gabhann siad le soláthar poiblí, fóntais agus lámhaltas. Is iad sin procurement, utilities agus concessions. Rinneadh athruithe ar an gclár SICAP, social inclusion and community activation programme, le déanaí. Dá mbeadh an reachtaíocht seo i bhfeidhm, b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé go hiomlán difriúil. Is treoracha ón Aontas Eorpach iad.

          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_382">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_383">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act 1988; and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">We, the people of this great nation, have stood at many crossroads. Of late, however, we have danced at very few of them. We have subsisted to survive but we need no longer survive in order to subsist. Our country's battle has been against overwhelming odds. It has been against the gombeen men of international finance and those foreign forces which arrayed themselves to take what chunks they may from the body of Ireland. Ireland has honoured any obligation she has to the international community and well the members of that community know it. The international community has taken its pound of flesh and supped the blood of this fair land. Yet still we stand. Let no man deceive us or tell us that our victory is certain - we still stand. We are rebuilding and we are recovering. However, we need to do a great deal more for many more of our people and we need to do it now. That is why I humbly bring this Bill before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> Our economic collapse caused devastation and havoc and gave rise to significant levels of stress and distress, all of which hang like a cloud of poisonous gas over this great nation. This has been ongoing for a period equal to the entire duration of the First World War and most of that of the Second World War added together. Far too many have carried far too great a burden. Far too many have been forced to emigrate. The fire that sparks this nation has been doused in far too many homes. Too many have gone to bed hungry. Too many have gone without heat. Too many have gone without light. Too many have cried themselves to sleep with dreams of fear and foreboding rather than with more pleasant thoughts. This has not gone away and it remains the daily experience of middle Ireland; of the people who do not shout their embarrassments from the rooftops but who live the daily horror of fear and dread. No longer are the plain people of Ireland those who eat their dinner in the middle of the day. The plain people of Ireland, if I may use that archaic term, often have no dinner.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> The destruction of wealth and society and the lives of families, farmers, professionals and civil and public servants has asked more of the Irish than any nation has a right to demand of her people. For too long and for too many, the soul of this nation has been suppressed. Those to whom I referred earlier have failed to extinguish the soul of this great nation, which flickers like a guttering candle. It is high time to cup our hands around the small flame of recovery. This is a task of the first magnitude. We need to sustain the flame's energy and to put fire back into the bellies of our people. It is time for Ireland to look after her own.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> With the passage of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2012 and the amendments it made to the Bankruptcy Act of 1988, the Government brought about a revolution in the law and in the public perception of bankruptcy. I salute it for that. Long gone, and rightly so, are the days when bankruptcy was seen as being shameful. The establishment by the Government of the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the reduction of the period of bankruptcy from 12 years to three are matters for which this House, the Taoiseach and the Government can take just credit. However, this House and all the parties in it ought not to be in the business of taking credit for matters of this nature. Everyone in this House should be in the business of providing leadership and remedying glaring legislative defects. It is our obligation, as legislators, to anticipate the next steps and deliver the legislative response that will best exploit those steps for the good of the country. That is our task. It is no burden, it is our bounden duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Consider the banks and financial institutions. Their motive is profit, their bible is greed and their god is money. Their ways are not our ways. Just as we believed it was recovering, Ireland is, at a stroke coming under renewed attack. This country faces another wave of financial attacks and it is the obligation of this House to level the playing field. We have an obligation to protect our people. This obligation is one from which no Member of or party in this House can shirk. We are all collectively responsible. We might not be able to stop the sale of loans but the House can certainly level the playing field.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> The proposals contained in the Bill are modest and simple and they will prove effective. All I am seeking to do with this Bill is to reduce the horrible and unrelenting levels of stress which are still holding the people of this country prisoner. With all-party support, the Bill will have an immediate, positive and direct impact on emigration, marriage break-ups and suicides. It would be a major boon to the very large number of people in middle Ireland who live in constant fear and terror of the knock on the door. It would also facilitate the return to Ireland of entrepreneurs who previously fled her shores. No one is immune from the hardship which has affected all sectors of society. I have no time for, and even less interest in, arguments about who has been hurt the most or who should be made to feel the hurt a little more. I have no interest in the media circus that might surround high-profile cases of people who previously had great wealth but who are no longer rich. I would much prefer it if that media circus followed the trials and tribulations of families in every constituency. I refer here to families of all backgrounds whose members want to sleep safe in their homes at night, do an honest day's work and enjoy this country as it should be enjoyed. The citizens of this country should be able to enjoy it as much as the tourists get to do. Each day in our constituencies we are reminded of whose voice we are and we know whose collective voice we must become.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> The Bill proposes reducing the current three-year term of bankruptcy to a single year. We have a common rugby team, a common cricket team and we have a common goal to do the best for our people, North and South. This Bill will simply harmonise the period of bankruptcy throughout Ireland. It will also harmonise the position in Ireland with that which obtains in the UK, our nearest neighbour and greatest trading partner.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> A certain number of people will take advantage of the Bill. I hope they do so. We must shift our bankruptcy culture from one of shame and embarrassment to one that recognises that sometimes things do not work out the way they were intended, that somehow the giving of the loan by the bank was imprudent given the overview the bank ought to have had on the economy. This Bill will remove the poisoned cloud of fear that stalks so many homes. It will enable people to take their rightful place in society, to learn from failure, to build again and to give rise to the rebirth of this great nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> This Bill will have a profound although intangible impact on the economic fortunes of this country, which the Taoiseach is trying to promote, and the lives of a great many others who will never need to avail of bankruptcy. I could show Members all the correspondence I have received. It will have a far broader and more positive impact on society than we could imagine or measure. The legislation will empower the distressed borrower, who in many cases just needs time to think, to get his mojo back and to start again. It will level the proverbial playing field because bankruptcy will have lost its fear and stigma for many, thus strengthening their bargaining position with unregulated hedge funds and banks in general. These funds will be constrained to appreciate the new commercial reality of a more balanced negotiating position which would encourage them to reach sustainable deals in a shorter time period which would allow people get their mojo back and to create jobs again and allow our recovery to grow exponentially.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> I have no doubt that for every one person who would contemplate bankruptcy under this proposed legislation there would be legions who would feel empowered by its very existence. It would bring about an immediate and exponential bonus of rallying to the flag of the recovery of middle Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> I caution this House about fixing an arbitrary longer period for let us say, 18 months or two years, for such a political compromise would be seen for what it is and what it would be, a mere flapping about the edges undoing the great good that this proposal would deliver to a great many people.</p>

        <heading>Animal Protection (in relation to Hares) Bill 2015: First Stage<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T13:00:00+00:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_403">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_404">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Wildlife Act 1976.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">I rise today, as the late Deputy, Tony Gregory, did in 1993 when he introduced a Private Members' Bill on wildlife to ban hare coursing. He spoke then about "the welfare of the vulnerable and defenceless in nature's creation". While greyhounds today are muzzled, the cruelty continues for the hares. That is the reason the Bill I propose will make it unlawful to engage in live hare coursing.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> Hare coursing involves the terrorising of one animal by another. It causes unnecessary cruelty every year to thousands of hares through stress, injury and death. It is a total contradiction that on the one hand the hare is protected under the Wildlife Act but the Act also protects hare coursing. The legislation states that it is illegal to trap and sell hares other than for the specific purpose of coursing them. On the one hand the hare is protected, except when it comes to coursing.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> Let us examine the procedures involved in coursing. I am sorry, a Cheann Comhairle, but I just noticed that the clock is not running.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanBarrett" eId="spk_225">
          <from> An Ceann Comhairle<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_408">Okay. Deputy O'Sullivan is all right. I will let her finish her contribution.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_226">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_409">Thank you. Some time before each coursing meeting the club members go out into the countryside to collect the hares in a process that is known as netting. They shout and they yell as they herd the hares into the net and then the hares are put into boxes to be transported to the coursing venue. Netting and handling are cruel. The hare is a very timid and delicate creature and it is cruel to net an animal that is used to the freedom of nature. Hares have been injured and have died in this process. Then there is the training of hares, which must happen to produce what is considered to be better sport. The hares are familiarised in the field so that when the coursing does happen, they will run up the centre of the field, which makes for good coursing.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> In the few weeks before the coursing event, the hares are kept herded in an enclosure, which adds more stress and cruelty because hares are strictly solitary creatures and they do not live together in groups. During the weeks of being herded, they are prone to disease which spreads very quickly due to them being enclosed. There is no doubt that the practice of blooding continues. Often it is hares but at other times it is rabbits and kittens. Some greyhound owners are against coursing but they must register with the Irish Coursing Club, which skews the level of support for coursing. Many independent surveys and opinion polls indicate that people are opposed to coursing. That position is not confined to urban Ireland because there are cases in urban areas of cruelty to animals but there are people in rural areas who do not like the practice of hare coursing.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> All the animal welfare organisations are opposed to live hare coursing and only three countries in Europe in total, including Ireland, allow it. What is involved in both open and enclosed coursing is hares running for their lives. The hare does not know that the greyhound is muzzled and that it cannot be killed. Both Deputy Clare Daly and I raised a number of issues relating to coursing with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, during Question Time this morning. As I have done previously, Deputy Daly pointed out that there have been breaches of the licences granted to the coursing clubs. They do not get a slap on the wrist or a fine and their licence is not revoked. People continue to get licences. We are told the welfare issues are a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. If there are breaches of the licence conditions, surely the logical conclusion is that a licence would not be granted? If a pub, restaurant or nightclub breached licensing conditions their licence would be revoked.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Some months ago the weather prevented the last day of a coursing event. It is acknowledged that the event was being monitored and the ground was deemed to be unsuitable. Instead of it being a reprieve for the hares, they were kept in captivity for a further week until the weather improved. This is not about destroying the greyhound industry; it is about using live hares in this cruel way, which has led to injury and death as documented by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. There have been occasions when the staff of the NPWS have been intimidated and they have been inhibited in doing their work by coursing enthusiasts. This is a very clearly defined remit. There is an alternative to live hare coursing. In Australia and the United States they have drag coursing. I do not understand the attraction for men - it is mainly men - who get pleasure in seeing a defenceless animal running for its life.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> There are also injuries to greyhounds. We know what happens to greyhounds who do not reach the mark in either coursing or racing, unless they are rescued by people involved in animal welfare. The greyhound is also a gentle creature, until it is introduced to blooding for coursing. This is one occasion - there have been others - when I wish the Bill introduced by Deputy Peter Mathews had been accepted, because I do not believe the majority in this House are in favour of coursing. If my Bill does proceed to Second Stage, I hope we can have a full and frank debate on this very cruel practice.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_420">I am pleased to address the House today ahead of the spring European Council, which takes place on 19 and 20 March. The discussions at this meeting will focus on three key issues: energy union, the 2015 European semester, and external relations, to include Russia, Ukraine, the forthcoming Eastern Partnership summit in Riga, and Libya.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> As Members are aware, EU Heads of State and Government also had an informal meeting on 12 February. In the early hours of that same day, a package of measures to halt the fighting in eastern Ukraine had been agreed in Minsk. This news was warmly welcomed. More than one month on, our priority will be to assess the extent to which this second Minsk agreement has been implemented on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Counter-terrorism was also discussed in February. A joint statement, issued by Heads of State and Government after the meeting, committed to the safeguarding of our common values and reinforcement of action against terrorist threats.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Finally, we had some reflection on how economic and monetary union has developed and on how it might be strengthened further, with Commission President Juncker presenting an analytical note on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">A further discussion at senior official level is taking place in Brussels this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Looking ahead to next week’s meeting, the question of how to advance energy union will be a key focus of discussion. Energy union, with a forward-looking climate policy, is one of the five strands of the strategic agenda for the Union as agreed by Heads of State and Government last June. The ambition of realising a meaningful energy union has never been more relevant. Geopolitical events in the Union’s neighbourhood, global energy competition and the realities of climate change all provide significant impetus for forging a much deeper level of co-operation between member states on energy issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> Discussion at the European Council will be informed by a communication recently published by the Commission on a framework strategy for a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy. This important strategy has five dimensions: energy security, a fully integrated European energy market, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and research and innovation. The different dimensions are all mutually reinforcing and closely interrelated.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> What does energy union mean for Ireland? As a peripheral and, in energy terms, poorly connected member state, Ireland stands to benefit significantly from efforts to enhance Europe’s energy security. Our current relatively high dependence on oil and gas leaves us vulnerable to price and supply shocks. Therefore, EU policies on security of supply, resilience, global energy markets and diversification align well with the emerging themes in Ireland's revised energy policy framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Development of adequate infrastructure to promote diversification of energy routes and sources is essential for Ireland and other peripheral member states. Access to financing for this infrastructure, including from the Connecting Europe Facility and the European fund for strategic investments, will be necessary if the full ambition of energy union is to be realised and its benefits shared across all member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Ireland also very much welcomes the European Union's ambition to become the world leader in renewable energy. This is important not only with regard to improving climate efficiency and increasing our security of supply but also in terms of economic impact. Across the EU, renewable energy businesses employ more than 1 million people and have a combined annual turnover in excess of €120 billion. In Ireland, we intend to play our part in realising the EU's ambition of becoming the number one player in renewable energy technologies. Our offshore renewable energy resources, such as wave energy, are among the best in the world, and our researchers and entrepreneurs are at the cutting edge of developments in this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> Completion of the internal energy market is key to realising energy union and is likely to be an important focus of discussion next week. Improved energy flow across borders, supported by an effective regulatory framework and greater marketplace competition, stands to deliver real benefits for Europe’s consumers, ensuring affordable prices at household level while also supporting the competitiveness of European businesses. Ireland strongly supports the early completion of the internal energy market. However, we must also be careful to ensure the necessary safeguards and flexibilities are in place for small member states and that there is sufficient regulatory stability and policy clarity to encourage major infrastructural investments by the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> At the end of this year, the critical United Nations climate conference will take place in Paris. The European Union has already clearly articulated its targets through the new EU climate and energy policy framework agreed by the European Council last October. I welcome the further agreement at last week's Environment Council on the EU's intended nationally determined contribution, INDC. The INDC is essentially the EU's pledge for the UN process of preparing for the Paris conference. It sets out the steps the EU will take in reducing harmful emissions, as well as addressing other issues such as how it will adapt to climate change impacts. Crucially for Ireland, the INDC includes within the EU's targets the important area of agriculture and land use and land use change and forestry, as agreed at the October European Council. Agreeing the EU's pledge so early in the process has sent a strong signal of our intention to lead by example in the global negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> In the months ahead, it will be important to scale up and build alliances with partners outside the European Union with a view to achieving a legally binding global agreement on climate change in December. The President of the Council, Mr. Tusk, has proposed that the European Council discuss how best to co-ordinate diplomatic outreach and action to maximise the Union’s leverage in the run-up to the Paris conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> The March European Council will conclude the first phase of European Semester 2015, the Union’s annual cycle of economic policy co-ordination. It will specifically provide guidance to member states for submission in April of their stability programme updates under the Stability and Growth Pact and national reform programmes under the Europe 2020 Strategy. This agenda item will also provide for a broader discussion of economic developments in the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> There is now welcome evidence that the EU is finally emerging from protracted recession. This is the first year since the onset of the crisis in which all member state economies are expected to record economic growth. The Commission’s latest forecasts are for GDP growth this year of 1.3% for the euro area and 1.7% for the European Union as a whole. We can expect that lower oil prices, the expanded asset purchase programme recently announced by the European Central Bank and the depreciation of the euro will all contribute positively to what is still a fragile recovery. Importantly, there are signals that the more positive economic outlook is beginning to feed through to Europe's labour markets. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the euro area was 11.2% in January, the lowest rate since April 2012, and 9.8% in the Union as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> A more positive economic forecast for the euro area is welcome news for Ireland, because prolonged weakness in the euro area is a key risk to our recovery. Ireland's recovery, while still incomplete, remains firmly on course. The Commission's 4.8% estimate for Irish GDP growth last year is the highest in Europe. </p>
          <p eId="para_436"> I expect that the European Council will give strong political reinforcement to the key pillars of European Semester 2015, as set out in the Commission's annual growth survey, namely, boosting investment, a renewed commitment to both national and EU level structural reforms, and continued fiscal responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> The speed with which work is progressing on the establishment of the European fund for strategic investments, EFSI, is evidence of the high political priority being afforded to the investment agenda, not only by the Commission but also by member states. I welcome yesterday's statement by finance Ministers on the Council's position on the EFSI, and negotiations with the Parliament should now begin swiftly. The EFSI, through mobilising extra private sector funding, can be expected to directly support and underpin a range of EU strategic priorities, including the infrastructural investments which are crucial to realising energy union. The Government is studying very carefully whether EFSI lending might complement other sources of funding for potential Irish programmes and projects. </p>
          <p eId="para_438"> The Commission has presented a comprehensive assessment for each member state under the 2015 cycle of the European semester. In Ireland's case, the assessment in the new country report is a broadly positive one, reflecting the strength of the economic recovery under way and highlighting that the recovery is also feeding across to the labour market. The report also points to the decline in public debt, diminishing financial sector challenges and the considerable strengthening of our external accounts, among important positive developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> The purpose of the country reports, while recognising progress, is deliberately to identify whether further work is needed or where imbalances remain. In Ireland’s case, for example, the Commission points to the need to pay attention to unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. Job creation, as articulated in the Action Plan for Jobs, is a major priority for the Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_440"> The Commission also points to the need to ensure that small and medium enterprises can access the finance they need. The Government recently put in place the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland specifically to address this challenge. Furthermore, the country report finds that progress is broadly on track in addressing the seven country-specific recommendations provided to Ireland last year. </p>
          <p eId="para_441"> Importantly, thanks to a streamlining of the semester process, we have a window of more than two months before draft proposals for the next round of country-specific recommendations are produced by the Commission. This window allows for stronger national level engagement with the Commission’s assessment, including by key stakeholders and national parliaments. This should encourage greater national ownership of the semester process. Yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, had a consultation with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs on issues relating to the semester.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> At this point, I do not expect the position in Greece to feature prominently on the European Council agenda, as negotiations continue to be taken forward in the Eurogroup.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Agreement last month on a four-month extension of the Greek programme was a welcome development. I understand that, as of today, technical negotiations are taking place between the institutions and the Greek authorities in Brussels.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> Under the external relations heading, the European Council will consider three important foreign policy issues, in particular, relations with Russia and the situation in Ukraine, the forthcoming eastern partnership summit and Libya. The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will consider the latter two issues in his wrap-up remarks. This will allow me to focus on Russia and Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> The specific direction and scope of European Council discussion on EU-Russia relations and the conflict in Ukraine will depend largely on developments on the ground over the coming week. An initial priority will be to review implementation of the 12 February Minsk agreement, which was brokered thanks to the tireless diplomatic efforts of Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande. I believe that the package of measures agreed in Minsk provides the basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> When President Poroshenko addressed the EU Heads of State and Government at our meeting in February, he painted a disturbing picture of the human impact of this conflict, which has claimed over 6,000 lives and forced one million people from their homes. However, thankfully, after a troubled beginning, the ceasefire now appears to have taken hold. While there are some sporadic violations in certain parts of the conflict zone, the overall assessment of the OSCE monitoring mission is that the situation is relatively stable. Prisoner exchanges have taken place since the ceasefire was announced and both sides have begun withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> This situation is still fragile. It is crucial that the OSCE monitoring mission is given full and unhindered access to all areas of the conflict zone in order that it can be in a position to verify definitively that weapons have been withdrawn and to where they have been moved. The EU is committed to strengthening the capacity of the OSCE mission to undertake the enhanced monitoring role it has been given under the 12 February agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> The question of sanctions against Russia is likely to feature in European Council discussions. President Tusk and his team have engaged in intensive consultations with all member states in recent weeks. Following a video conference with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the US on 3 March, he said that the leaders had underlined the close linkage between sanctions and the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, and that the EU was ready to decide on further sanctions if the agreements were further violated.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> Ireland has consistently supported the dual-track approach adopted by the EU, involving political dialogue and robust, scalable sanctions. Moreover, we attach considerable importance to maintaining the unity and consistency that has characterised the EU response to the crisis to date. This is critical to its influence and effectiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> Depending on developments, Heads of State and Government may also consider broader aspects of the Union's important but complex relationship with Russia. This would build on a debate which took place at the Foreign Affairs Council last January. At that meeting, Ministers recognised the advantages of maintaining co-operation with Russia on important global and regional foreign policy issues like Syria, Libya and Iran. However, it was clearly stated then, and it remains the case now, that any reflection on EU relations with Russia should not be interpreted as a return to business as usual, and that any resumption of dialogue with Russia will be selective, gradual and conditional.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> I look forward to hearing the comments and perspectives of Deputies. I will report back to the House after the meeting has concluded.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_452">Tá áthas orm an deis a fháil cúpla focal a rá ar an ábhar tábhactach seo agus sin cruinniú Chomhairle na hEorpa i mí an Mhárta. Is oth liom a rá go bhfuil sé ag tarlú le déanaí nach bhfuil ráitis den chineál seo á ndéanamh roimh nó i ndiaidh cruinnithe den Chomhairle. Ní maith liom go dtarlódh a leithéid amach anseo. </p>
          <p eId="para_453"> This has been a time of continued turbulence in Europe. There have been highly dramatic negotiations that have gone to the heart of whether Europe can tackle the economic, social and political crises of the moment. The fact that the Dáil has been kept out of these discussions in recent times is unfortunate and, I suggest, is a consistent policy of the Government in marginalising this democratic Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> This week's summit will not take any dramatic decisions but it is an important meeting none the less. The citizens of this country and of the Union as a whole are waiting on their leaders to show that they can bridge gaps and demonstrate a common resolve. The summit is due to sign off on the latest round of the fiscal oversight procedure. By terming it "the European semester" one could believe that there is a policy of making it as inaccessible as possible for people who are trying to understand what is going on. The documents to be signed-off on contain vital decisions about budgets and growth. Thankfully, there has been some flexibility shown and the rigid and damaging insistence on immediate cuts has been watered down.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> Over the coming months we are due to hear more electioneering from the Government with an unprecedented abuse of the Civil Service to formulate what is to be, in effect, Fine Gael's election manifesto. This week, the Government has been engaged in its now usual and still ineffective habit of congratulating itself and claiming to have delivered economic progress. The Taoiseach's article on Monday was a classic of this type. Again, it ignored the reality of a Government which has not delivered recovery but rather delayed a recovery built on the skills of the people and made it as unfair as possible. People would have every right to be confused if they were to take the time to compare the Taoiseach's words on Monday with those of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, yesterday, when he suddenly went from insisting that existing targets would be hit to demanding greater flexibility in October's budget. His mixed statements about the flexibility won by other countries reinforce the fact that the Government has yet to make any agreed statement about the medium-term fiscal objectives. In fact, the only formal multi-year agreement reached between the Labour Party and Fine Gael has been on the implementation of targets set by the late great Brian Lenihan.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I call on the Taoiseach to speak up at this summit in favour of ending avoidable austerity. Where countries can manage a higher debt to support increased investment they should be encouraged to do so. This is especially true of Germany, where the failure to tackle low demand has much wider implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> The situation with Greece remains critical. There is no doubt that the Syriza movement took the easy populist line during the election. The party promised that all that was needed was to stand up to foreigners and gave the impression that there were no hard decisions to take. By acting as if it was the only Government in Europe with a mandate, it has caused understandable offence. The new habit of making public attacks on the leaders of other member states serves as divisive, damaging and, at times, insulting. Some of the worst enemies of Greece have been the country's supposed friends, who continue to use hype and empty rhetoric to present anyone who disagrees with Syriza as being heartless and cruel. The failure of the Greek Government to publish plans quickly for what it is willing to do in return for foreign support suggests that it did not undertake a fraction of the preparations for government which it claimed to have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Anyway, the fact remains that there needs to be a new policy towards Greece. Greece needs and deserves a credible return to growth which can create jobs and restore the social safety net. The current plans and policies will not do this. It may well be that the Greek Government is unwilling to genuinely reform anything in return for support, or that it makes demands which the democratically elected governments of other countries cannot support. However, there is a duty at least to be generous and to recognise that not all of Greece's debts are its own fault.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Ireland has a rather different situation. Someday the Taoiseach and his Ministers might have the honesty to acknowledge that they voted against the measures that delivered the fiscal correction which, he now maintains, saved the country. He might also acknowledge the core strengths of the economy rather than indulge in the nonsense of claiming to have delivered every job that has been created. Throughout the recession our internationally trading sectors continued to do well. Even in the worst years IDA Ireland attracted significant inward investment. These sectors have been the core of this recovery. Ireland has every right to sell itself internationally but the politically focused message is selling us short. It promotes a short-term political message ahead of one of the long-term strengths of our most important resource, our people. It also undermines the case for full justice for Ireland on banking-related debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> In Paris in 2012, the Taoiseach said Ireland was a special case because "Ireland was the first and only country which had a European position imposed upon it, in the sense that there wasn't the opportunity if the Government wished to do it their way by burning bondholders". For some reason he is reluctant to repeat it. Over the past few years there has been regular announcements of breakthroughs on the bank-related debt and claims of widely-inflated amounts being saved.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Ireland has received zero in concessions on the special nature of its bank related debt. In fact, it is now the Government's position that it will not seek any retrospective aid. The lengthened maturities and reduced interest rates on much of the debt were the application to Ireland of agreements negotiated by others. As for the promissory notes, those debts have simply been converted to sovereign debt. However, because the Central Bank of Ireland is now selling them to the market at a rate faster than originally announced, much of the saving on the arrangement may be lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Ireland's fiscal situation is better than it was but it is not strong. Our domestic economy remains weak and the Government's policy of ignoring critical problems like household debt and implementing regressive budgets has caused real damage. The Taoiseach owes it to the people to explain why he is no longer even asking for any debt relief. One of the principal funding routes for proposals to help Greece is to return to it interest on bonds held by the ECB. If this is done, then Ireland must demand equal treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Developments in Ukraine over recent months will again be considered at the summit. Thankfully, the fighting has receded but it is looking likely that Russia has once again succeeded in creating conflict in a former client state and freezing a<i>
						</i>de facto partition. Fianna Fáil last week raised the issue of the murder of the Russian opposition leader, Boris Nemtsov. Whatever story the prosecutors come up with, there will be no way of covering up the fact that he and others have been systematically attacked and demonised by the Russian state. Denouncing people in the state-controlled media as traitors and fifth columnists leads directly to them being under threat. Boris Nemtsov himself pointed out how the Russian opposition has been attacked so much by the state, including in show trials, that they are now in effect dissidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> This week President Putin admitted that he and his Government lied repeatedly during the process of occupying and then annexing Crimea. In doing this, Russia ripped up a recent international treaty whereby it guaranteed not to touch Ukraine's borders if it agreed to give up nuclear weapons. Ukraine gave up the third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, yet Russia has shown that it respects no treaties and no laws when it comes to asserting its right to control the destinies of other countries. How are countries to be expected to agree to valuable actions like disarmament if basic agreements can be unilaterally ripped-up?</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> The House should note that, since we last discussed this matter, Russia has adopted the policy of encroaching on the air and marine space of other countries. This has included neutral countries such as Ireland and we have shown ourselves to be incapable of addressing the problems those incursions present. Behaviour towards Baltic states has been actively threatening, including the kidnapping of an Estonian official. The bullying and neo-imperialist behaviour of Russia is one which we should stand united against. Ireland, as a country which has experienced a hard struggle to win independence and an imposed partition, should appreciate this more than most. The obligation to stand with Ukraine and against aggression is absolute, yet there are those who have tried to stop Russia facing any consequences. They have argued for the need to do nothing and, in effect, to legitimise Russia's actions. The fact the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy actually tabled a plan to normalise working relations with Russia without any roll-back of its partition of Ukraine is, quite frankly, outrageous. Thankfully, the leadership of President Donald Tusk and others has meant that the basic moral duty of the EU towards its threatened members and Ukraine is being upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> What there has not yet been a reaction to is the propaganda of the extreme right and left. If we look throughout Europe, we see that the loudest voices against sanctions and for defending Russia are those of the far right and far left. The National Front in France, UKIP in Britain, Jobbik in Hungary and every party in the former communist group in the European Parliament are united in their defence of Russia. The National Front in France has actually taken a large loan from a Kremlin-linked bank to fight regional elections this year. In Greece, there is a position where both the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party and the majority of Syriza oppose any action against Russia for annexing Crimea. At the UN, Israel refused to support a motion condemning the annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> It is a sad fact that there are those here who have followed this collection of extremist groups in refusing to stand against Russia's behaviour. There are significant voices here who have consistently worked to ignore, play down or relativise Russian partition of Ukraine. The propaganda slanders against the Ukrainian people that they were controlled fascists were repeated here in this country. Groups which have no problem demonstrating outside any number of embassies have left Russia's embassy undisturbed. Despite mounting repression on minorities in Crimea and the outlawing of the right to protest against the annexation, still we hear nothing. The argument that Russia should have been allowed to dictate the foreign and security policies of its former imperial subjects is offensive, yet it has been said in this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Missing from Sinn Féin's long list of statements of solidarity last weekend was one standing against this partition - so, anti-partition at home but no problem with partition abroad. In fact, they have said that the EU and US are co-responsible for Russia's action. We look forward to Sinn Féin representatives interrupting their fund-raising in the United States to repeat this absurd idea there.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> The people of Ukraine freely and repeatedly said they want to live in a European democracy and we have a duty to stand with them. The Taoiseach should use this summit as an opportunity to call for a significant increase in direct aid for Ukraine, and I suggest he should make such a commitment on Ireland's behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> The energy issues to be discussed are closely related to the Ukraine. Russia has shown that it will use energy as a geopolitical tool. Europe must diversify supply and it must invest in reducing demand for energy. The energy union should be activated as quickly as possible. It has the potential to reduce our energy bills, which are disproportionately high and causing real hardship for people throughout this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">I long ago lost confidence in the Taoiseach's ability to make any real leadership impact at European summits, either in Irish interests or in the interests of working people across the European Union. Therefore, I suppose the best I can wish him is a good and a safe trip. I notice his absence from the Chamber, which shows disregard for the Dáil and, in particular, for the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> He mentioned earlier the European semester and the EU country report for 2015. What he did not say was that this report pointed out major issues still facing our economy. This report and the previous one make very clear that, despite claims by the Government, there is no imminent return to Irish economic sovereignty. The report makes the point that growth figures are unreliable, public debt is still very high and the financial sector is not lending to the real economy. There are some positives, granted, but the overall picture is one of an economy divided by inequality.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> On poverty and children, the report reveals that almost a quarter of people live in households where nobody is working, which is a point that bears repeating, or they are working for just a few hours a week. This is the highest proportion in the EU and, while the figure was high before the crisis emerged, it has doubled on the watch of this Government. We also have the highest number of children living in jobless households, a figure that has risen from 26% in 2007 to 34% in 2013. The report states: "Studies show there is a wide range of household joblessness in need of tailor-made measures going beyond labour market activation interventions." Is this not a damning indictment of the Government's approach to the unemployment situation?</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> The report is also critical of the very high cost of child care here, which means that only one parent can work outside the family home.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">In 2013, the average child care fee was €152 per child per week, amounting to almost €16,000 a year for a two-child family. The report notes that as a percentage of wages, child care costs are higher than in any other EU state. Access to full-time child care is famously limited and the quality of services remains a problem, because backup, training and decent pay for the people in the sector remain an issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_478"> The data on youth employment is particularly negative and raises serious issues with regard to the type of society being built here for the future. We have one of the highest percentages of young people not in employment, education or training, and an increasing number seem to have lost hope. Despite the fact that a third of companies employ IT professionals, 42% of the Irish workforce have few or no digital skills. Last year, half of all companies, the highest rate in the EU, said they had problems trying to recruit IT workers. </p>
          <p eId="para_479"> The report is very critical of a range of issues, not surprisingly, in our health care system. It points to its two-tier nature, which it says is very different from the system in other European states. It notes, for example, that the private system covers the highest share of people in any EU state for supplementary health services and that spending on health care was higher than the EU average, yet life expectancy and infant mortality are no better than in the rest of the EU. </p>
          <p eId="para_480"> An issue we have tried to get the Government to respond to positively for some time is the fact that half of the proposed mortgage solutions in this State involve legal proceedings. I have listened to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Taoiseach trying to play down the significance of this issue. They both tried to claim that the banks are only using the legal process to force people to re-engage. That is offensive. A person in danger of losing his or her house wants to engage and save the family home. No one I know who is trying to help people to deal with their debt agrees with the Government's propaganda. They do not agree because they have seen a wave of repossessions taking place recently. The Government's policy facilitates the banks. It rejected Sinn Féin proposals on this issue. We would have ended the bank veto. That shows that the Government's priorities lie with the elites rather than with families at risk of having their homes repossessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The Commission also warned about the precarious situation with Irish Water and pointed to the lack of clarity about its financial future. The Commission said there were questions as to whether Irish Water would have the power to borrow on open markets. All of this reflects badly on the Government and exposes its propaganda on these matters. </p>
          <p eId="para_482"> The Minister, Deputy Noonan, now thinks some of the rules for dealing with the smaller states are too inflexible and that they need a break. My suspicion is that as he continues to crank up the pre-election auction politics, he fears the tax cutting plans for some may fall foul of the expenditure benchmark. It is a bit late in the day for him to try to argue that he has the interests of smaller states at heart. </p>
          <p eId="para_483"> On his way into Monday's Eurogroup meeting, the Minister said the Greek finance Minister would no longer head Greece's negotiations. I do not know what business it was of his, but he was wrong. It was widely reported and, quite rightly, resulted in a very strong reaction from the Greek Government. Will the Government take the opportunity to apologise to the Greek Prime Minister for that offensive remark?</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> I wish the Taoiseach well on his visit to the USA. Perhaps the Minister of State will extend my good wishes to him. I ask that he raise the need for immigration reform while he is there and explain to the diaspora why his Government has resiled from the commitment given, which is in keeping with the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention, that Irish citizens living outside the State be given votes in presidential elections.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_237">
          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_485">I had a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade this morning, and I welcome his comments about the Irish citizen Ibrahim Halawa, particularly his statement that the only successful and acceptable outcome to his case would be his release and early return to Ireland. We would all mirror those remarks, which were quite helpful. It is quite clear that unless he is released, Ibrahim Halawa will face a mass trial with no possibility of getting a fair trial or justice. I urge the Minister of State to raise this case at the European Council when external relations are being discussed and to make every head of state aware that an Irish and EU citizen has had his human rights violated and is languishing in jail without any real prospect of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> I note that the European Council will also discuss EU relations with Russia and the situation in Ukraine. We are extremely concerned about hostilities in the east of Ukraine which have killed and injured civilians and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes. The UN says that more than 5,600 people have been killed in the conflict since April, but there are fears that the death toll could be much higher. Therefore, it is very welcome that the ceasefire negotiated between France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia is, by all accounts, now holding. It offers the potential for peace and a glimmer of hope to the Ukrainian people. It is a step in the right direction. However, it is only one step, and there are many outstanding issues to be resolved. The humanitarian situation and the real chance of flare-ups and the outright conflict still remain. It is important that at this sensitive time, further arming of any side is not considered. Foreign states need to remove themselves from negatively interfering in Ukraine's domestic political process to advance their own selfish interests, and support the fledgling Ukrainian peace process. Britain has recently announced that it will send military personnel to Ukraine in the coming weeks. According to David Cameron, they will be there to provide training and advice to the Ukraine military. It is believed the force will amount to around 75 soldiers. The US has already said it is planning to send a battalion of soldiers to train three Ukrainian battalions. This is not helpful, as I said to the Minister yesterday. We know from our own experience of conflict resolution that demilitarisation, rather than greater militarisation, is needed. Will the European Council discuss this? What is Ireland's position on EU countries providing direct military support for Ukraine? Let us be clear: we all condemn Russia's military involvement in support of the rebels, but direct military intervention, particularly from NATO states, is counterproductive. I say that for the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Member who has left the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> Since the last European Council meeting, a motion was unanimously passed in the Dáil and Seanad calling on the Government to recognise Palestine. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade recently visited Israel and Palestine. Surely a meeting between the Government and its EU partners is an opportune time to inform them that Ireland will officially recognise the State of Palestine, in line with the wishes of the Oireachtas and the vast majority of the people of Ireland. Can the Government outline whether it will use the opportunity to recognise the State of Palestine, or will it continue to ignore the clear demands of the Oireachtas and Irish citizens?</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> Yesterday, Israeli authorities demolished EU-funded shelters in occupied East Jerusalem. EU funds helped to pay for some 200 temporary buildings used as shelters in villages inhabited by Bedouin communities just outside East Jerusalem.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Israel, in its efforts to displace Bedouin communities, moved in the bulldozers. Will the Irish side raise this issue, ensure the human rights of the Bedouin are protected and seek reparations from Israel for the destruction of EU-funded shelters?</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> The European Council will also discuss the energy union. Sinn Féin is fully committed to the development of renewable energy, not just in Ireland but throughout Europe and the world. There needs to be a secure price for renewable energy sold from Ireland in any future project. Ireland has massive potential in renewable energy development, but developing this energy for export is only viable if it is economical. This must be a key component in any future deal on a connector between Ireland and France or Europe in general. Will the Minister of State raise Ireland's concerns, particularly with regard to fracking, during these discussions? Will the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources work with the European Commission to investigate how an integrated energy market would work and assess if and how an integrated energy market would benefit Ireland and Irish citizens?</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I wish the Minister of State well at the Council meeting. Clearly, many issues must be discussed, and the Minister of State must stand up for Ireland at the meeting.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_492">I wish to share time with Deputies Shane Ross, Paul Murphy and Michael Fitzmaurice.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> I have a quiz for the Minister of State. Which dangerous political force in the Middle East is in favour of beheading, summary execution and the indiscriminate killing of civilians? One answer is "ISIS" but the other is "Israel". That is now official. This week, the Israeli foreign Minister called for Palestinian Arabs who are not loyal to the state of Israel to be beheaded. He said: "[T]hose against us, it cannot be helped, we must lift up an axe and behead them". He went on to say that political prisoners on the Palestinian side involved with what he calls terrorism against Israel should be executed. In Israel, a person can be executed on the word of one Israeli soldier, and 99% of those prosecuted for terrorist acts against the Israeli state are convicted. We are talking about a dangerous rogue state which, in the past week or two, has done everything it can to scupper even tentative reconciliation between the West and the Iranian state.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Why does our Government and the European Union continue to buy arms from Israel and sell military components to them, conferring favoured economic status on the State of Israel? For example, why has Ireland bought €14.7 million worth of weapons from the Israel Defence Forces when its foreign Minister believes that political opponents should be beheaded? Israel has unleashed the most appalling assault on the people of Gaza three times in the last decade, with the most recent destroying 20% of the houses in the area. Such has been the destruction of the infrastructure of Gaza that new microbes and infections are developing that doctors have never seen before and that they cannot treat because antibiotics cannot deal with them. There is absolute barbarism ongoing in Gaza, yet we are doing business with those people. We would not do business with ISIS, so why are we doing it with Israel? There are people outside the gates of Parliament today calling for an end to economic trade, and particularly military trade, with Israel. I ask the Minister of State to raise the issue at the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> In that context, I cannot help hitting back at the unbelievable hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil, which should get off the flipping stage. Its members spoke about people supporting warmongers and accused those of us who raise questions about Europe's role in the Ukraine as somehow being supporters of Russia. I say to Deputy Ó Fearghaíl that I was outside the Russian Embassy in 1989 when the people of Russia overthrew the Stalinist regime, supporting the revolution. I have attended protests supporting Pussy Riot and other people who have been victims of Putin's regime, and I have never seen a Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy or flag in attendance. I am 100% on the side of Russian people who want to overthrow the oligarchic and autocratic regime of Vladimir Putin. That does not excuse European military manipulation in the Ukraine, which is stirring up conflict in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> The militarist intentions of Europe were further underlined by Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker's comments about a European army, which Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael argued would never come about. The President of the European Commission has now openly called for such an army, and officials have reiterated that point. I hope we will stand up against that. Let us be consistent in opposing war, rogue states, beheadings, summary executions and trade with rogue states. We must be consistent across the board.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">A very valuable lesson about the real qualities of democracy in the European Union and the economic and monetary union has been delivered in the past month's dealings between the European authorities and the Greek Government. All of the democratic values that the EU supposedly stands for were quickly forgotten when faced with a Greek Government elected on a programme of breaking with austerity. Instead, that Greek Government was met with a statement from the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, that there could be no democratic choice against the European treaties. The German finance Minister, Mr. Wolfgang Schäuble, indicated that elections change nothing and there are rules. These are rules of neoliberalism, written into law by successive European treaties, the six-pack and the two-pack. They are precisely the rules that caused the establishment parties here and across Europe to laugh at us for suggesting that they would lock in austerity policies. Now look at the position; it is just as Henry Ford said when he indicated that people could have whatever colour they wanted for their car, as long it was black. The European authorities are indicating that countries may have elections and elect any kind of government, as long as it implements austerity policies. That is not democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> As Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned, we were also laughed at for saying that there was a process of militarisation across the European Union, but two days ago the most powerful politician within EU structures made an open call for an EU army. That is also a valuable lesson about the nature of the Irish Government: utterly pathetic, craven and treacherous. It is helping to deliberately, consciously and repeatedly stab the Greek Government and ordinary working people in this country in the back in order to get a pat on the back from Merkel and keep up the lie that Ireland is a good pupil of austerity. That is despite the fact that working people here share with the Greeks an unsustainable and odious debt burden, and the same interests in lifting that burden. What happened in the past month and half was a co-ordinated assault by capitalism to effectively annul the election results in Greece. The rich took their money from the banks in Greece at a tremendous and increasing rate on a daily basis, and the attack dog of European capitalism, the European Central Bank, bared its teeth. These are the same people who effectively co-ordinated a silent coup, getting rid of previous governments in Greece and Italy and replacing them with government by the banker for the banker.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> The ECB threatened to bring down the Greek banking system and put a gun to its head by threatening withdrawal of emergency liquidity assistance. At the Eurogroup meetings, Merkel and her allies, including the Irish Government, demanded total retreat and humiliation from the Greek Government. The result was a deal in which very significant concessions were made by the Syriza Greek Government, including procedures with the troika, which continues but is renamed as "the institutions". There is acknowledgement of the debt and the refusal of any unilateral changes to austerity. The only significant concession was a reduction of the primary surplus requirement, which may allow the Greeks to implement a programme to ameliorate the very worst elements of the humanitarian crisis. Even that will not satisfy European capitalists, and they will return in June for more, using the same methods of blackmail and threats again and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> There are very profound lessons in this for us in the Chamber and those across Europe who are fighting for a different sort of Europe, where the millions come before the millionaires. This EU is fundamentally undemocratic.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The rules of the economic and monetary union and of the EU are a neo-liberal straitjacket designed to enforce adherence to right wing economic policies. Any left government must therefore be prepared to break those rules. It must prepare people for a confrontation with those rules and with the bankers and bondholders in Europe and their political representatives for whom those rules are written. A left government will have to pursue its demands for debt repudiation to the end without being scared of the threat of bringing down the banking system or being pushed out of the euro. We cannot be blackmailed. We have to say austerity has to end and stand in solidarity with those elsewhere in Europe who are doing that.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">I am beginning to get a little bit weary of these supposed debates that we have before the Taoiseach heads off to Brussels for summits. One reason I am getting weary of them is summed up in his last sentence, “I look forward now to hearing Deputies’ comments and perspectives”. Where is the Taoiseach? Is he listening to us somewhere else? He left the Chamber the moment he finished speaking. That shows his contempt for the messages he is getting from the Opposition. He is not listening. We know that. He read a script today which singularly and deliberately avoided in any way addressing the key questions of Europe. Who wrote this script for the Taoiseach? It reads as if it was written by someone in the European Commission. There is absolutely no mention in it – I am open to correction – of any initiative that Ireland will take at this European Council meeting, of anything the Taoiseach intends to say or of any word or voice of dissent from anything the European Commission does. The Commission is mentioned in virtually every paragraph with approbation and applause and Ireland is mentioned only in the context of continually siding with, and supporting, what the Commission says. That tells us that Ireland’s voice in Europe is ignored because the Taoiseach and the Government have accepted the role of being some sort of satellite of France or Germany or whoever they choose on the day. We have become the eunuchs of Europe. We say nothing. We have no independence. We held a debate on neutrality recently which was constructive and interesting but was totally and utterly ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> To get some indication of how we are treated in Europe, one needs to consider the issue the Taoiseach did not address and should have addressed. Yesterday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in Europe, accepted and supported an extension for France for being a serial offender in breaking the debt to GDP rules. He not only did that, but he supported the same for Italy and Belgium. He is saying, “It’s okay, tie my hands behind my back but don’t do it to the big nations”. We are frightened of saying even “Boo” to the French. In a pathetic gesture, he grabbed Mr. Schäuble at the edge of one of the meetings to tell him he thought Ireland should maybe get the same treatment. It is a bit damn late to be telling Mr. Schäuble that. He says Mr. Schäuble got the message, which means he told the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to go off and have a cup of tea somewhere and come back to him in six months when he would see what he could do.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> Ireland is a pathetic creature on the European stage. Ireland’s voice does not count and we see that not only in the Taoiseach’s speech, but in what happened yesterday. Our attitude to the Greek situation is symbolic of that. We should naturally be allies of the small nations.</p>

In a referendum a few years ago we were told European armies would not be put together, that it could not happen. Now we learn what is being said from media reports. I have not been here long but Deputies who go on trips to other countries tell me Ukraine is a corrupt country and of other countries supported by the European project which are corrupt, but we turn a blind eye to that. We do not want to see it because that is in the best interests of this so-called European project. We joined a community in Europe. Anywhere in the world community is seen as good because it involves people working together constructively, aiming for one goal and looking out for each other. </p>

          <p eId="para_514">We are exceptionally proud to be Irish, although one would not think so listening to some of the commentary particularly from the Independent Members, especially Deputy Ross, who quoted the Taoiseach’s statement but seems not to have read or heard it. While criticising the Taoiseach, who is launching a very important initiative in the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, the Deputy has also scurried out of the Chamber. He says he is weary of what the Government has reported here before and after European Council meetings, yet despite our having the fastest growing economy and creating more jobs than any other country in the EU, he is still happy to criticise the Irish people and the job Ministers have done with the occasional support of some in the Opposition. I have rarely heard a constructive point on any issue connected with our economy from Deputy Ross who seems to be only concerned with his own platform as a journalist.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> There is €25 million of assistance going to the people of Ukraine with a further €15 million pledged over the next few months. It is essential to develop a co-ordinated approach to the reconstruction of Ukraine. That depends on the continuing peace process.</p>

          <p eId="para_520">The European Council will review preparations for the upcoming summit, providing a steer on its objectives and the way forward concerning some other key issues. On Europe's neighbourhood policy and expansion in general, I was in the Dáil when we voted on the ambitions of three nations to share in democratic and free membership of the European Union. They were represented by their ambassadors on behalf of the people of their respective countries. Unfortunately, a number of Deputies voted against the motion on that occasion. The ambassadors later told us they were very frustrated that, although they were representing their democratically elected governments, their ambitions were being stifled by those Members, one of whom is present in the House today. It is very unfortunate that this took place in Dáil Éireann at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> The Council will revert to the issue of Libya and the broader discussion of the southern neighbourhood. Deputies will be aware that the task of building a democratic future for the people of Libya has been extremely challenging. However, elections took place in June and there is evidence people want to see a secure, stable and democratic Libya. Unfortunately, in recent months we have seen a number of factions fighting for political legitimacy and seeking control of Libya's cities and its infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> I will be attending the General Affairs Council and the Foreign Affairs Council on St. Patrick's Day next week, the day before the European Council meeting which takes place on Thursday and Friday. Tomorrow it is the Justice and Home Affairs Council. I listened to Deputy Ó Fearghaíl refer to the reputation of this Government but it is frequently reported to me, as Minister of State, that the performance of Ministers in the previous Government, who failed to attend important Council meetings, caused significant damage to our reputation. We are working very hard to undo the significant damage caused by the Fianna Fáil Party which negotiated such an appalling deal for the people. We have successfully managed to renegotiate that in many ways and we will continue to work to do that.</p>

            <p eId="para_524">In 2010, Ireland submitted what is known as a tentative list to UNESCO, which is an inventory of properties we asked to be considered for nomination to the world heritage list. That list is as follows: the Burren; the Céide Fields and north west Mayo boglands; the monastic city of Clonmacnoise and its cultural landscape; the historic city of Dublin; early monastic sites, including Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra - which lies in Lough Derg and is of particular interest to me - Kells and Monasterboice; the royal sites of Ireland, which comprise Cashel, Dún Ailinne, the Hill of Uisneach, the Tara complex, the Rathcroghan complex; and the western stone forts.</p>
            <p eId="para_525"> Ireland is spectacularly under-represented on the UNESCO world heritage site list. Italy has 50 sites on the list, while Germany has 39. Afghanistan, much of which has been war-torn since Ireland ratified the World Heritage Convention in 1979, has the same number of sites on the list as Ireland. We have had the unfortunate troubles in Northern Ireland, but they have not hindered the progress of this State to the same extent as Afghanistan has had its progress hindered.</p>
            <p eId="para_526"> There is little excuse for the lack of progress in getting Irish sites onto the tentative list. Much of that lack of progress occurred long before the current Minister's tenure, but I am not entirely convinced that there has been much of an improvement under this Government. I had a meeting off my own bat with UNESCO officials in Paris and they were surprised to see somebody from Ireland, given the lack of interaction from here. Very little progress has been made to advance the Irish tentative list since it was handed over in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_527"> I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and I am grateful for her reply. It told me what I already knew with regard to a couple of those sites. The Burren, in particular, largely due to the activities of Clare County Council, is advancing, which is very welcome. Likewise, it looks like the historic city of Dublin may also advance, or what was left of it after the wanton destruction that took place under previous city managers. Again, that was long before the Minister's tenure in politics. Wood Quay was destroyed but it almost seemed to be a point of pride for certain city managers.</p>
            <p eId="para_528"> Now, however, the relevant local authority does not seem to want to advance Clonmacnoise. As a result, the early monastic sites cannot advance either since Clonmacnoise is one of them. Similarly, the local authority in Kerry does not seem to want to advance one of the western stone forts there, which means that they will all fail to advance.</p>
            <p eId="para_529"> Local authorities should recognise the benefits of advancing such sites. Most locations get a 30% increase in tourism numbers in the year following their designation as UNESCO world heritage sites. That increase in tourism would be hugely advantageous for any such locations here, although it is up to individual local authorities to adopt their own approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> Clare County Council is advancing the Burren and is also proposing to purchase Inis Cealtra. I welcome the council's initiative in that regard, which is being done with its own funds. The State could and should play a role in seeking to get world heritage status for sites. It would be an important recognition of our heritage that we should be proud of and seek to promote. Such a designation also has a monetary value through the increase in tourism. What does the Minister's Department propose to do in this regard? If it does not propose to do very much, could it devolve some responsibilities and funding to local authorities that want to advance such sites? I appreciate, however, that some local authorities are not as interested in UNESCO designation, for whatever reason.</p>

            <p eId="para_532"> Having a site progressed from being on a national tentative list to its inscription by UNESCO on the world heritage list is a long and involved process that requires comprehensive management plans for the site, full agreement with local interests, significant local authority actions and support and, finally, the production of highly detailed nomination documents that require significant financial investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> Each stage of the process has to be quality controlled and checked by experts to ensure that the nomination documentation reaches the high standards laid down by UNESCO. We are working at all times to UNESCO standards and requirements and not to any local framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_534"> Ireland's current tentative world heritage list has come about from a very comprehensive, thorough and inclusive process undertaken by a panel of Irish and international heritage experts specifically appointed for that purpose. The process included full public consultation and an in-depth review of all proposed candidate sites. The tentative list, as the Deputy outlined, produced by the expert group contains the following sites: the Burren, the Céide Fields, the monastic city of Clonmacnoise, the historic city of Dublin, early medieval monastic sites, the royal sites of Ireland, and the western stone forts.</p>
            <p eId="para_535"> In September 2013 my Department held a seminar to explain the next steps in the process to the local authorities and local groups from the areas with proposals that had successfully made it on to the tentative list. The objective was to gauge the extent of the support that would be available to advance these proposals and also to set out the work that would be involved and the associated costs. After the seminar, the representatives that are now most actively engaged with my Department in pushing on with their proposals are those from the Burren and the royal sites of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_536"> In both these cases, initial technical evaluation reports, financed by the local authorities, have been produced to ensure that all are aware of the strengths and weaknesses in their proposals. The fundamental requirement is that each site must be capable of demonstrating outstanding universal value to UNESCO. Technical evaluations have been produced for each of the six sites forming part of the royal sites serial nomination. The Burren representatives are working on their version. My Department has arranged for the royal sites technical evaluation to be examined by an acknowledged expert. This process, financed by my Department, will be repeated in the case of the Burren evaluation later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> The next steps will involve developing management plans for each site, which is a UNESCO requirement, and the designation of core and buffer zones in each case. At each stage local consultation is required. This process will also have to take into account the fact that some sites will be managed by the Office of Public Works, others by local authorities and two monuments on the royal sites list are privately owned. Another, Eamhain Macha in Armagh, is in another jurisdiction with different laws and heritage practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> The culmination of these steps will be the creation of the full nomination documents for each site. These will also be evaluated by experts and a recommendation made as to whether the dossier, as it is called, is of sufficiently high standard to make it through the UNESCO evaluation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_539"> Our built and natural heritage legacy is a key component of our tourism offering in Ireland. It gives us a distinct comparative advantage that sets our tourist offering above and apart from those of other nations. Additional world Heritage sites would add further to that advantage and I am committed to supporting the current proposals in every way that I can.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> The process is a lengthy one and we must remember that all of the work at every stage must be supported and developed from the local level up, with stakeholder buy-in and commitment at each stage. While this will add to the timescale, it is infinitely preferable than a top-down approach that fails to engage with local communities. It also ensures a far better chance of best care and support for the protection and preservation of these marvellous sites into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_541"> I am pleased to be able report the progress that has been made to date in this area, and I will continue to help the process in every way I can.</p>

            <p eId="para_542">It is clear from what the Minister has said that the road to getting UNESCO designation is long and difficult, but in the case of some of the sites on this list, it is simply a road to nowhere. The local authority in Kerry has said that it is not interested. In the Minister's letter to me, and I appreciate she might not have been adequately briefed by her officials, she states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_543">Kerry County Council informed the Department that it did not wish to be involved in progressing the potential Western Stone Forts nomination (which includes Cahercommaun in Co. Clare) ... This was also the case in Clonmacnoise, which had obvious implications both for the potential nomination of the site in its own right, as well as for its status as a crucial element of the potential serial nomination of the Early Medieval Monastic Sites, which of course includes Inis Cealtra.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">If Kerry or Offaly County Councils, or whatever county councils, are not interested in this, that is their right. The Minister did say it should not be a top-down approach and should involve local communities and local authorities, but if they do not want to move forward, surely that should not affect every other site on the early monastic list, which includes Glendalough, Durrow and Inis Cealtra, which I am most concerned with because it is in my constituency. There was also a report into promoting Lough Derg and one of the findings was that it lacked an iconic site that could be used as the centrepiece of marketing it. That is clearly the beautiful early monastic site of Inis Cealtra, and Clare County Council is at an advanced stage in seeking to acquire it. Can we move forward with that without Clonmacnoise? Can studies be done on it? In my letter to the Minister I outlined that UNESCO had said there is an upstream process where rather than incurring all the expense of going through the nomination process only for it to be refused, experts can be engaged at an earlier stage to examine whether it is feasible to do this.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> Can funding be devolved to our progressive county councils who want to move this forward both because they recognise the important heritage, which is a huge value in itself and also its tourist value?</p>

            <p eId="para_547">Can funding be devolved to move this forward or are we going to allow, in effect, a power of veto on the part of some county councils which simply are not interested in their own heritage or in national heritage?</p>

            <p eId="para_548">I listened carefully to the Deputy and I share his views on the importance and value of securing world heritage status for these sites as quickly as possible. I take on board what he said about the progressive county councils. When county councils work with us, it does make it much easier. When we have their assistance it is preferable, but my Department will continue to push for progress on the sites that are moving ahead while staying in touch with the others on the tentative list, with a view to getting them to move on should they wish to do so. We will engage with them, and we will try to move them along.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> We are working closely with the local authorities and the local interest groups, as the Deputy knows, in regard to the Burren and the royal sites. I am also aware that the historic city of Dublin nomination is being actively followed up by Dublin City Council, and my Department is engaged with the council to help and guide them with the process. Once the nomination documentation has been sent to UNESCO, it usually takes about 18 months for it to be examined and for the related site visits and reports. It is only at that stage that the UNESCO World Heritage Committee is in a position to decide on whether to approve a nomination for inscription on the world heritage list.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_559">I will address with the Minister of State the important issue of hospice services in the four midlands counties - Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath. Hospice services are struggling in those four counties. We have excellent local hospice committees and local hospice groups. The problem is that those groups are carrying a significant proportion of the burden of trying to provide services.</p>
            <p eId="para_560"> At present, we do not have enough specialist support staff in the community, such as support nurses, social workers, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. We have no inpatient level 3 services. There is a small amount of inpatient level 2 services in the region. Despite being one of the top five areas prioritised by the HSE in 2009 for such a level 3 service, it still has not been provided and the only option is for beds in acute hospital care settings to be used. This option does not come cheap.</p>
            <p eId="para_561"> As the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will be aware, this is causing problems in the system. It is costing a lot of money. No money is being saved by having patients remaining in acute hospitals who should not be in them. Not having the hospice inpatient unit is costing money. In the midlands regional hospitals in Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise, an average of 6,411 bed days a year are being used for palliative care. The lack of a hospice level 3 unit in the region to take those persons is causing a significant problem. Home care nurses, social workers and staff are being funded by local hospice groups. There is no day care service. Such a service one day per week would be excellent, if we could have it. I ask the Minister of State to look at the Cuisle centre in Portlaoise as one venue that could be considered in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_562"> Our region has the lowest investment in palliative care of all the regions in the country. In the mid-west region and the north-west region, on average €30 <i>per capita</i> is being used to provide palliative care whereas in the midlands it is less than €9. The 2007 figures are the most recent ones available but I am told by those monitoring it that there has been little variation in it since. As a result, the region has the highest rate of cancer deaths in acute hospitals. Although it is a morbid subject to be talking about, those near the end of life wish to die at home.</p>
            <p eId="para_563"> A 2001 report from the national advisory committee on palliative care stated that each region should have comprehensive palliative care services, that is, home care, primary care, acute hospital and inpatient specialist services. Fourteen years later, we still do not have it. Two internal HSE reports, in 2007 and 2012, set out the need for palliative care services to be developed specifically in the midlands. There is a significant problem here. The population in the midland counties of Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and Longford is wondering why it is not being given the same priority and why these basic services are not there. For those reaching the end of life and their families, it is important that we provide these services at that crucial stage of life. I ask the Minister of State to address this issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_564">I thank Deputy Stanley for raising this matter. He will be aware that I have a particular interest in palliative care and end-of-life treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_565"> It is the intention of the Government that all people will be provided with the type of palliative care services they need regardless of their diagnosis, how old they are or whether they die in a hospice, an acute hospital, a nursing home or, as is the preference for most, at home. Specialist palliative care services in the midlands are provided through the community-based specialist palliative care team led by a consultant in palliative medicine and including a clinical nurse manager, specialist palliative care nurses, a senior social worker, senior physiotherapist and administrative support. The team provides input across the range of care settings and operates an open referral system, with referrals prioritised on the basis of need - there is no waiting list.</p>
            <p eId="para_566"> In 2013, funding to develop a model for the planning and delivery of specialist palliative care services in the midlands was provided by the Irish Hospice Foundation. A comprehensive plan was developed, integrating specialist home, acute and hospice care with generalist services, all working in collaboration to deliver a quality palliative care service. The most significant gaps identified were the need for a second consultant in palliative medicine, the absence of a specialist inpatient unit and associated day care services, the need for palliative care clinical nurse specialists in each acute hospital and the need for specialist occupational therapy services in the home care teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_567"> In 2015, the HSE will provide funding for a second consultant in palliative medicine for the midlands. The consultant will be based at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, covering the Longford-Westmeath area, and will work closely with the existing palliative care consultant. In addition, clinical nurse specialists for Portlaoise and Tullamore regional hospitals are currently being recruited.</p>
            <p eId="para_568"> Within the midlands, five local hospice groups currently provide funding on an annual basis for agreed core services and service development initiatives. The provision of a specialist palliative care inpatient unit remains a priority for the region. Recent research suggests that a 16-bed unit, with an option for an additional four to six beds, would meet the needs of the population in Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath. The midlands palliative care consultative committee, chaired by the director of public health, has developed draft plans for the building of a hospice for the midlands. They are drawing on the experience of the Mayo and Waterford hospice movements regarding the overall size of the unit, architectural design and location. The site for the unit will be identified when the design brief has been completed. The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, met a delegation from the Irish Hospice Foundation on 26 February and among the issues discussed was the need for a comprehensive service plan for palliative care in the midlands.</p>

            <p eId="para_569">The Minister of State addressed some of the issues I raised in my opening remarks.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> I was aware that there were plans for a second consultant post. The Minister of State confirmed that there is funding for it. When is that likely to happen? Is the recruitment under way or when will it begin? When can we expect to see that second consultant? While the consultant is to be based in the Longford-Westmeath part of the region, the appointment will improve matters in Laois and Offaly because one consultant will be able to dedicate himself or herself to palliative care for the counties of Laois and Offaly.</p>
            <p eId="para_571"> The Minister of State said research suggests we need a 16-bed unit. As far back as 2001, this was flagged in the report from the national advisory committee on palliative care. The report stated that we needed such a centre and also set out other matters that needed to be addressed. We need to provide this unit now. It is important to do so at a human level, but there are economic and management reasons for doing it also. Some 6,000 plus bed days are being taken up with patients who should be in palliative care. The unit would free up these beds. The Minister of State does not need me to tell her how bad things are in these acute hospitals, and that beds need to be freed up. That is not the primary concern here. The human need is the biggest concern but we must address this aspect also.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> When can we expect recruitment of the second consultant and to see him or her in place? Why is there such a continuing low level of investment? I want the Minister of State to address why the spending on providing palliative care in the region is down at €9 per person when it is €30 per person in other areas. Why is each county not served by a full community multidisciplinary palliative service? It is recommended each county should have such a service. Why is there not even a firm plan in place at this stage?</p>
            <p eId="para_573">The HSE has substantial land resources in all four counties. Why is there not a plan in place already to locate this proposed unit? Why are we not progressing with these plans? Around the country, the Minister of State knows that they are either in place or are being progressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_576">Once we have decided to do it, the request will go into the national recruitment service in Manorhamilton. It will then be put on an order of priority. There clearly are priority lists and lesser priorities. As soon as one becomes available and a suitable candidate identified, there should be no blockage other than whether the person can take up the post. There are all sorts of variables. The only thing we can control is whether there are sufficient funds available and I am told by the HSE that there are.</p>
            <p eId="para_577"> The other area relates to specialist nurses and physiotherapists within the community-based teams. These are hugely important because most people now get their palliative care or end-of-life care within a community setting. I take the Deputy's point on the expense of an acute hospital bed, but these are only used when looking to stabilise the person and to get the medication and the process right. Usually most people go on to live within their own communities. The situation is managed in that way. </p>
            <p eId="para_578"> Why is the midlands getting less than other areas? Who knows? Perhaps it is because the teams are not fully developed. Perhaps it is because there is no inpatient unit. There could be a multiplicity of reasons. I do not have the answer in front of me. If the Deputy, however, were to table a question, I am sure that if an answer is available we will do everything to get it to the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_583"> Tá gach eolas faoi imeachtaí fhéile na bliana seo sa chlár oifigiúil <i>Sult 2014</i> atá á eisiúint leis an nuachtán <i>Irish Daily Star</i> i mí an Mhárta. Tá ailt, agallaimh, míreanna spóirt, ceoil agus teicneolaíochta san iris dátheangach seo atá iontach d’fhoghlaimeoirí agus do dhuine ar bith a bhfuil suim acu i bhforbairtí úr maidir leis an Ghaeilge. </p>
          <p eId="para_584"> Cuireann sé áthas orm go bhfuil an Ghaeilge á cur chun cinn ar fud na tíre ar bhealaí éagsúla úr-aimseartha. Níl bealach níos fearr ná úsáid na teicneolaíochta faisnéise agus cumarsáide chun daoine a choinneáil ar an eolas faoi chéard atá ag tarlú sa phobal. Ar ndóigh, tá Seachtain na Gaeilge chun cinn sa réimse seo agus aip úr ar fáil anois ar iTunes agus ar Google Spraoi chun daoine a choinneáil ar an eolas faoi imeachtaí na seachtaine. Ní raibh sé riamh chomh éasca imeachtaí agus ócáidí a aimsiú.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> Nach iomaí casadh atá tagtha ar an saol ó bunaíodh Conradh na Gaeilge os cionn 120 bliain ó shin. Ní raibh an réamhfheiceáil ag ár sinsir ar na hathruithe móra a bhí le teacht ar an saol ó thaobh na teicneolaíochta faisnéise de agus an éascaíocht a chuirfeadh sé lenár saol. Cá bhfios cén dóigh ina mbeidh daoine ag maireachtáil 120 bliain chun cinn sa todhchaí ach tá súil agam gur ag cumarsáid trí Ghaeilge a bheidh siad. Má choinníonn muid ar fad ag labhairt trí Ghaeilge, ní fheictear dom cén fáth nach mbeidh sé sin amhlaidh.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Ó ceapadh mar Aire Stáit mé, tá mé ag spreagadh daoine agus ag uchtú daoine chun teacht liom ar m’aistear leis an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim arís. Luann muid go minic an grá atá againn don teanga. Má tá spéis ag daoine í a fhoghlaim, nó í a athfhoghlaim, tá an cuireadh tugtha do dhaoine chun tosú anois le linn Sheachtain na Gaeilge. I ndiaidh tréimhse a chaitheamh i rith an tsamhraidh i nGleann Cholm Cille, i dTír Chonaill, chuir mé roinnt pointí agus noda úsáideacha le chéile chun cabhrú le daoine, agus tá siad le fáil ar shuíomh Idirlín na Roinne faoi mo bhlag. Is é atá ar intinn agam ná gur féidir le duine ar bith a bhfuil suim acu inár dteanga náisiúnta nádúrtha tabhairt faoin turas foghlama seo in éineacht liom. Tá súil agam go mbeidh daoine spreagtha dá bharr chun dul i ngleic leis an teanga.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> Seo leanas roinnt pointí a d'fhoghlaim mé ó thosaigh mé ar an turas foghlama seo. Tá an Ghaeilge thart orainn in achan áit, mar shampla ar chomharthaí bóthair agus ar na meáin chumarsáide. Is é an rud is tábhachtaí domsa ná a bheith ag smaoineamh as Gaeilge. Bíonn eagla orainn uilig botúin a dhéanamh. Is cinnte go ndearna mé cúpla botún achan lá ach níor lig mé eagla roimh bhotún a dhéanamh mé a choinneáil siar.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Tá fíorshuim ag daoine ar fud na tíre san aistear seo, go háirithe daoine atá ag foghlaim na teanga iad féin. Tá a fhios agam fosta go bhfuil ciorcail chomhrá ar siúl i mbailte agus ag pobail éagsúla ar fud na tíre agus ba mhaith liom na grúpaí seo a mholadh go mór don chur chuige oscailte agus cairdiúil atá acu i leith daoine a spreagadh agus a uchtadh chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt. Cuidíonn siad go mór leo siúd nach bhfuil mórán muiníne acu chun dul chun cainte i nGaeilge le daoine eile. Is iad na daoine seo agus na grúpaí seo a bhí ar intinn agam nuair a thug mé faoin bhlag a scríobh agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ina chuidiú dóibh. </p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Agus an óráid seo á thabhairt agam inniu mar chuid de Sheachtain na Gaeilge, ní miste dom a rá gur dóigh liom go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar cheann de na hachmhainní is nádúrtha agus is luachmhaire atá againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Creideann an Rialtas go bhfuil tábhacht ag baint le pobal láidir labhartha Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta a chothú chun saibhreas oidhreachta na teanga a choinneáil beo agus a thabhairt shlán don chéad ghlúin eile. Tá an Taoiseach, gan trácht ar cheannairí na bpáirtithe polaitiúla eile, ag tabhairt dea-shampla dúinn uile ó thaobh úsáid na Gaeilge sna Tithe seo. Is cinnte gur féidir linn uile féachaint ar an dóigh gur féidir linn féin níos mó úsáide a bhaint as ár gcuid Gaeilge le linn ár gcuid oibre laethúil sa Dáil agus sa Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> Cé go bhfuil an Rialtas tiomanta gach a dhéanamh laistigh dá chumhacht chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, tá todhchaí na teanga ag brath go príomha ar an phobal. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil dearcadh dearfach ag tromlach an phobail i leith na teanga. Tá orainn timpeallacht a chothú ina mbraitheann daoine muiníneach a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid, cuma cén leibhéal cumais atá acu inti. Tá sé riachtanach go leanfar ag baint leas as an teanga mar theanga phobail agus teaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht agus go gcuirfear an teanga chun cinn ar bhonn níos forleithne taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> Ar ndóigh, bíonn an-áthas orm bualadh le cainteoirí Gaeilge agus mé ag taisteal ar fud na tíre, sa Ghaeltacht agus lasmuigh di. Bíonn áthas orm fosta nuair a chloisim daoine ag déanamh a ndíchill úsáid a bhaint as an méid Gaeilge atá acu, mo dhála féin. Tugaim faoi deara na hiarrachtaí atá á ndéanamh ag daoine chun an teanga a chur chun cinn. Aithníonn na daoine seo an tábhacht a bhaineann lenár dteanga. Is siombail an-tábhachtach dár bhféiniúlacht í an Ghaeilge. Ós rud é go bhfuil sí ar cheann de na hacmhainní is luachmhaire atá againn, creideann daoine go bhfuil géarghá leis an teanga a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt. Is eol domsa go maith mar Aire Stáit gur teanga bheo phobail<b>
						</b>agus theaghlaigh í an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil an Ghaeilge á cur chun cinn i gceantair éagsúla taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht fosta.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> Ní miste a nótáil gur díol suntais é go bhfuil tacaíocht tugtha ag gach Rialtas don Ghaeilge ó bunaíodh an Stát os cionn 90 bliain ó shin agus ní haon áibhéil a rá nach mbeadh sí chomh láidir agus atá sí inniu in éagmais na tacaíochta sin. Ní miste a mheabhrú dúinn féin go bhfuil go leor dul chun cinn déanta le roinnt blianta anuas ó thaobh na teanga de, lena n-áirítear bunú RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4; achtú Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla agus Acht na Gaeltachta; bunú Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga, Fhoras na Gaeilge agus Údarás na Gaeltachta; an t-aitheantas don Ghaeilge faoi Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta i dTuaisceart Éireann agus an t-aitheantas don Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil agus mar theanga oibre san Aontas Eorpach.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> Ó ceapadh mar Aire Stáit mé, is í an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge an chloch is mó ar mo phaidrín. Ós rud é gur foilsíodh an straitéis i mí na Nollag 2010, beidh an straitéis cúig bliana ar an fhód ag deireadh na bliana seo. I bhfianaise a thábhachtaí is atá an straitéis mar chloch choirnéil don Ghaeilge, leanfaidh mé orm ag plé le mo chomhghleacaithe aireachta le cinntiú go dtugtar tosaíocht don straitéis sna Ranna ábhartha. Ina theannta sin, leanfaidh mo Roinn uirthi ag obair i gcomhpháirtíocht leis na Ranna sin chun na bearta éagsúla a bhaint amach thar shaolré na straitéise.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> Mar is eol don Teach, is ar mo Roinn atá an fhreagracht uileghabhálach an straitéis a chomhordú agus a chur i bhfeidhm i gcomhar le réimse mór páirtithe leasmhara éagsúla. Aithnítear sa straitéis<i>
						</i>féin<i>
						</i>go bhfuil gá le cur chuige céimneach chun bearta éagsúla na straitéise a chur i gcrích. Is léir domsa go bhfuil cur chuige soiléir ann maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise agus go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh go staidéarach agus go stuama laistigh de na hacmhainní atá ar fáil. Ar ndóigh, tá dúshlán anseo dúinn uile agus ní mór dúinn na céimeanna cuí a thógáil de réir a chéile. Mar a deir an seanfhocal, an té nach gcuirfidh san earrach, ní bhainfidh sé san fhómhar.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> Léiríonn na tuarascálacha atá foilsithe ag na Ranna ábhartha, 12 acu san iomlán, go bhfuil cur chuige soiléir ann maidir le feidhmiú na straitéise a mbeidh tionchar dearfach aige ar an teanga san fhadtréimhse. Is údar sásaimh ar leith dom é go n-aithníonn na Ranna go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh líon áirithe foirne atá in ann seirbhísí a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge i ngach Roinn agus go bhfuil gealltanas tugtha acu go n-aithneofar ina gcuid scéimeanna teanga amach anseo faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla na poist nó na réimsí oibre lena mbaineann riachtanas inniúlachta sa Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Ní miste dom a dheimhniú don Teach gur scríobh mé i mí na Samhna 2014 chuig na hAirí uile ag lorg cruinnithe déthaobhacha leo le plé a dhéanamh ar chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise agus Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Tá ag éirí go maith leis na cruinnithe déthaobhacha atá eagraithe go dtí seo. Is léir go bhfuil toil i measc na nAirí dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ar chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise. Cé go dtuigim go maith go bhfuil comhoibriú leanúnach ar siúl idir na Ranna i gcomhthéacs chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise, tá mé ag machnamh go gníomhach, ó ceapadh mar Aire Stáit mé i mí Iúil seo cáite, ar conas a d’fhéadfaimis feabhas breise a chur ar an obair thábhachtach seo. Is sa chomhthéacs seo atá na cruinnithe déthaobhacha á reáchtáil agam.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> Cuireann Acht na Gaeltachta an chreatlach reachtúil ar fáil chun tabhairt faoin phróiseas pleanála teanga ar bhonn comhordaithe. Faoin Acht, beidh an pobal, an earnáil dheonach, an earnáil phoiblí agus an earnáil phríobháideach ag obair as lámha a chéile chun tacú leis an Ghaeilge sna ceantair éagsúla atá agus a mbeidh aitheanta faoin Acht. Is trí phleananna teanga a ullmhú agus a fheidhmiú ag leibhéal an phobail a thabharfar tacaíocht don Ghaeilge mar theanga phobail agus teaghlaigh i gceantair Ghaeltachta agus i gceantair eile taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Tá áthas orm a rá go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh faoin bpleanáil teanga faoi Acht na Gaeltachta. Tá tús curtha go hoifigiúil leis an bpróiseas pleanála teanga i 13 limistéir phleanála teanga Ghaeltachta. Tar éis don Roinn próiseas comhairliúcháin a reáchtáil, d’fhoilsigh mé, i mí na Nollag 2014, liosta de na bailte is fóirsteanaí a d’fhéadfadh a bheith aitheanta mar bhailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta. Tá iarrtha agam ar Fhoras na Gaeilge agus ar Údarás na Gaeltachta tús áite a thabhairt do chathair na Gaillimhe, Leitir Ceanainn agus Daingean Uí Chúis. Tá Foras na Gaeilge ag lorg léirithe spéise faoi láthair ó eagraíochtaí i gceantair a d’fhéadfadh a bheith aitheanta mar líonraí Gaeilge amach anseo.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> Mar is eol don Teach, rinne mo Roinn athbhreithniú ar an Acht Teanga a foilsíodh i mí Aibreáin 2014 in éineacht le ceannteidil an Bhille teanga. Is é príomhaidhm an Bhille ná an tAcht teanga a leasú chun a chinntiú go leanfaidh sé de bheith ina thacaíocht do gach duine ar mian leis nó léi seirbhísí d’ardchaighdeán i nGaeilge a fháil ón Stát. Cuireadh na ceannteidil faoi bhráid an Chomhchoiste um Chomhshaol, Chultúr agus an Ghaeltacht iad, i gcomhréir le polasaí an Rialtais. Tá tuarascáil faoin mBille foilsithe anois ag an gcomhchoiste agus tá moltaí na tuarascála á mbreithniú agam faoi láthair. Tá an próiseas dréachtaithe don Bhille ag leanúint ar aghaidh fosta agus an Bille ar liosta A de chlár reachtaíochta an Rialtais. Rinneadh roinnt moltaí fiúntacha le linn an phróisis chomhairliúcháin phoiblí maidir le tionscnaimh pholasaí a meastar a chuirfeadh le stádas agus le húsáid na Gaeilge. Tá sé aontaithe ag an Rialtas go bhféachfaí leis na tionscnaimh pholasaí seo a thabhairt chun cinn chun tacú le cur i bhfeidhm an Acht teanga. Tá plé ar siúl ag mo Roinn faoi láthair leis na páirtithe leasmhara maidir leis na tionscnaimh sin a fhorbairt ar an mbealach is éifeachtaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Is aidhm lárnach pholasaí de chuid an Rialtais é úsáid na Gaeilge a threisiú agus tá sé ina ghné thábhachtach den pholasaí sin go mbeidh baill fhoirne atá inniúil sa Ghaeilge ar fáil sa Státchóras. Ar ndóigh, tá an cheist maidir le cumas comhlachtaí poiblí seirbhísí a sholáthar trí Ghaeilge agus ceist na hearcaíochta don Státchóras fite fuaite lena chéile. Mar thoradh ar chinneadh a thóg an Rialtas i mí Dheireadh Fómhair 2013 chun cumas na Gaeilge sa Státseirbhís a threisiú, tá an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe ag iarraidh ar Ranna agus ar oifigí Rialtais sainaithint a dhéanamh ar phoist agus ar réimsí oibre ina dteastaíonn oifigigh le Gaeilge mar chuid den phróiseas pleanála don fhórsa oibre. Táthar ag iarraidh ar Ranna aird ar leith a thabhairt ar phoist atá lonnaithe i gceantair Ghaeltachta nó a dhéanann freastal ar cheantair Ghaeltachta. Beidh an próiseas seo lárnach chun a chinntiú de go ndéanfar foráil dhóthanach i gcomórtais earcaíochta amach anseo do cheapacháin i bpoist ina dteastaíonn oifigigh le Gaeilge. Ina theannta sin, sonrófar na poist sin ina dteastaíonn oifigigh le Gaeilge i scéimeanna teanga faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 amach anseo. Anuas air sin, tá socruithe nua á gcur i bhfeidhm ag an tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí do chomórtais earcaíochta don Státseirbhís. </p>
          <p eId="para_602"> Bhain an Ghaeilge aitheantas amach mar theanga oifigiúil agus oibre de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh ar an 1 Eanáir 2007. Tiocfaidh deireadh leis an maolú atá i bhfeidhm don Ghaeilge ag deireadh 2016. Is maolú é seo d'institiúidí an Aontais Eorpaigh ón dualgas atá ann gach téacs dlíthiúil a aistriú go Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Beidh cinneadh le tógáil faoi dheireadh na bliana 2015 faoi thodhchaí an mhaolaithe atá i bhfeidhm faoi láthair maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge in institiúidí an Aontais Eorpaigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Mar fhocal scoir, mar tá brú ama orm, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl arís as an deis a fháil léargas a thabhairt don Dáil ar an méid atá ar siúl faoi láthair chun aidhmeanna na Straitéise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge a bhaint amach. Is gnéithe fíorthábhachtacha dár n-oidhreacht chultúrtha iad an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht. Is onóir agus pribhléid domsa an deis a fháil mo chion féin a dhéanamh mar Aire Stáit sa Rialtas chun tacú le caomhnú, cosaint agus forbairt na hoidhreachta sin. Aithním agus tuigim go maith gur ag obair i gcomhar lena chéile is fearr a bhainfidh muid torthaí fónta amach chun an oidhreacht bheo seo a thabhairt ar aghaidh don chéad ghlúin eile. Tugann Seachtain na Gaeilge deis iontach dúinn obair le chéile chun ár n-oidhreacht a chur chun cinn trí Ghaeilge a labhairt.</p>

          <p eId="para_629">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an deis an díospóireacht seo a bheith againn. B'fhéidir nach dtarlódh sé ach go bhfuil Seachtain na Gaeilge ag tarlú freisin.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> Tá an ceart ag an Aire Stáit nuair a deireann sé go bhfuil muid go léir ag iarraidh na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn. Sin aidhm Pháirtí Fhianna Fáil le blianta. Chomh maith le Gaeilge a labhairt, tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeidh muid in ann an Ghaeilge a thabhairt do na glúine atá le teacht, agus sin an fáth go bhfuil an Straitéis 20 Bliain againn. Tá an straitéis seo mar bhuncloch do pholasaí Fhianna Fáil agus don Rialtas freisin. Mar sin, táimid ag iarraidh go mbeidh Aire sinsearach don Ghaeilge sa Rialtas. Caithfidh go mbeidh duine ann le freagracht a ghlacadh don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht. Ní ceart an straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm gan airgead a chur ar fáil chomh maith. Níl mórán airgid i gceist. Tá an straitéis againn ón am a bhí an Teachta Ó Cuív mar Aire agus chuala mé sin uaidh cúpla uair.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> Caithfimid deireadh a chur leis an maolú ar an nGaeilge san Aontas Eorpach chomh maith. Bhí daoine ag cur brú le blianta ar an Aontas Eorpach go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar theanga oibre ann. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire Stáit in ann tacaíocht a thabhairt maidir le sin freisin.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> Bhí scéimeanna éagsúla Gaeltachta againn, ach tá cuid mhaith acu curtha ar ceal. Labhair mé ar maidin faoi na seirbhísí go dtí na hoileáin, seirbhísí aeir agus seirbhísí farantóireachta. Tá díomá ar dhaoine nach bhfuil scéimeanna fadtéarmacha ar bun do na seirbhísí sin ach go dtéann siad ó bhliain go bliain.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> Níor luaigh an tAire Stáit Údarás na Gaeltachta. Bhí díospóireacht againn ar maidin faoin ábhar seo. Ba chóir go mbeadh na baill don údarás tofa ag an bpobal agus ba chóir tacaíocht a thabhairt don údarás níos mó post a fháil le gur féidir cúrsaí eacnamaíochta a neartú. Chuir mé ceist ar an Aire Stáit ar maidin maidir le méadú 8% ar an airgead don IDA, ach airgead don údarás a bheith ag ísliú. Tá an IDA ag déanamh go maith as, ach níl an t-údarás. Tá súil agam go mbeidh muid in ann Foras na Gaeilge a neartú freisin agus go mbeidh muid in ann tacaíocht a thabhairt do na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge. Chuir mé ceist freisin mar gheall ar airgead don fhoilsiúchán, <i>An tUltach</i>, ach ní dóigh liom gur thug an tAire Stáit freagra ar sin. Labhair sé faoin Idirlíon agus cuirim fáilte roimh aon tacaíocht d'fhoilsiúcháin ar an Idirlíon, ach ní freagra ar gach ceist é an tIdirlíon. Baineann a lán daoine taitneamh as <i>An tUltach</i> a léamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> Is cóir smaoineamh a dhéanamh freisin ar an mhéid a dúirt an t-iar-choimisinéir teanga, Seán Ó Cuirreáin, nuair a d'éirigh sé as oifig. Dúirt sé nach raibh reachtaíocht ann chun seirbhís a chur ar fáil don phobal le gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge. Tá seo an-tábhachtach. Nuair a tháinig Seán Ó Cuirreáin go dtí an comhchoiste sa Teach seo, labhair sé faoin straitéis agus faoin gcaoi nach raibh daoine in ann gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge. Nuair a bhíomar ag caint faoin straitéis agus faoi iarracht níos mó daoine a spreagadh chun Gaeilge a labhairt dúirt sé: "It would be difficult to meet anybody who thinks the target is realisable." Bhí rudaí eile le rá aige mar gheall ar na scéimeanna teanga. An rud deireanach a dúirt sé, mar gheall ar na daoine sa Ghaeltacht ná: "Speak Irish among yourselves, but don't speak it to us." Sin rud a chur isteach air.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh Sheachtain na Gaeilge agus an leabhrán seo a fuair gach duine sa Teach ag cur síos ar na deiseanna nua agus na hócáidí nua atá ann chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil freisin leis na scoláirí a tháinig anseo ó scoileanna éagsúla. Tagann grúpaí scoláirí go dtí comhchoiste anseo gach bliain le ceisteanna a phlé trí Ghaeilge le Seanadóirí agus Teachtaí Dála. Is maith an rud go bhfuil Seachtain na Gaeilge ar siúl mar b'fhéidir nach mbeadh seans againn díospóireacht as Gaeilge a bheith againn ach amháin sin.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach. Fáiltím roimh na hiarrachtaí pearsanta atá á ndéanamh aige an Ghaeilge a labhairt. Ní aontaím fós leis an gcinneadh a rinneadh duine a thoghadh in aon phost go bhfuil Gaeilge riachtanach gan an cumas sa teanga a bheith acu roimh ré, ach molaim iarrachtaí pearsanta an Aire Stáit.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Caithfidh mé a rá go raibh sé mar bhunchloch sa Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge go mbeadh Aire sinsearach freagrach as an nGaeilge agus as an nGaeltacht. Rinne an Taoiseach an cinneadh sin a chealú. Cé go bhfuil Gaeilge ag an Taoiseach, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an oiread sin tuisceana ná an oiread sin measa aige ar an teanga. Bhí ceapachán an Aire sinsearach sa Roinn seo mar cheann de na bunchinntí a rinne sé an chéad lá. Ní hamháin go ndearna sé uair amháin é - rinne sé faoi dhó é. Má théann Fianna Fáil ar ais i Rialtas, cuirtear é sin ina cheart agus déantar cinnte de go mbeidh Aire sinsearach freagrach ó thaobh cúrsaí Gaeilge ó lá go lá. Déarfaidh an tAire Stáit liom nach bhfuil aon neart aige sa chomhthéacs seo, agus go bhfuil sé chomh maith Aire Stáit agus Aire a bheith sa phost seo. Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, tá an tAire sinsearach ag bord an Rialtais nuair atá an chreach dá roinnt agus na buiséid á socrú. Tá a fhios aige nach bhfuil aon airgead curtha ar fáil ó cuireadh an Rialtas seo ar bun, in ainneoin an méid atá sa Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> Tá cleasaíocht ar bun, go deimhin, ó thaobh cúrsaí airgid. Deirtear liom go raibh an oiread seo airgid a bhí curtha ar fáil do phleanáil teanga bainte as ceannteidil eile Gaeilge de chuid na Roinne. Mar sin, is féidir a rá go bhfuil iarraithe ar na pobail an straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm go háitiúil trí phleananna teanga a réiteach, ach gan aon airgead ceart a bheith ar fáil acu siúd agus an t-airgead atá ann goidte ó imeachtaí eile Gaeltachta. Níl an straitéis á cur i bhfeidhm ag an Rialtas. Tá sé sin dubh agus bán d'éinne a léann an straitéis. Níl aon mhaith bheith ag iarraidh an dubh a chur ar an mbán. Is eol dúinne a bhfuil a fhios againn céard atá sa straitéis nach bhfuil aon chuid dó á cur i bhfeidhm. Tá toil ag teastáil le haghaidh cuid den straitéis agus tá airgead ag teastáil le haghaidh an chuid eile de. Níl ceachtar acu ar fáil. An dtógfadh sé mórán airgid? Dá mbeadh poll i ndíon na hiarsmalainne, agus dá mbeadh scrios á dhéanamh ar na séadchomharthaí is luachmhaire a bhfuil againn, an mbeadh €3 mhilliún nó €10 milliún ar fáil le cuí a chur air? Bheadh sé ar fáil, agus is ceart go mbeadh.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> Caithfimid a thuiscint muna dhéanaimid beart láithreach, beidh Gaeilge ann go deimhin ach ní bheidh cainteoirí dúchasacha Gaeilge ón gcliabhán ar fáil i bpobail labhartha Gaeilge, ní éireoidh linn an deis atá againn pobal cearta Gaeilge a bhunú taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a thapú ach ní bheimid in ann gréasán labhartha Gaeilge a bhunú sna cathracha agus sna bailte móra. Go deimhin féin, tá soláthar in Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, a thug an Rialtas seo isteach, a bhaineann leis na gréasáin seo. Rinne an tAire Stáit fógairt orthu. Mar is eol d'éinne a bhreathnaíonn ar an straitéis, bhí plean comhtháite le bheith ann - bhí an Stát chun airgead a chur ar fáil le haghaidh, mar shampla, naíolanna, naíonraí agus na rudaí seo ar fad. Ní féidir leis na pobail é a dhéanamh. Cén fáth go mbeadh orthu é seo ar fad a dhéanamh? Tá na hionaid phobail tábhachtach ionas go mairfidh pobal labhartha Gaeilge istigh sa chathair.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> Bhí an cheart ag an Aire Stáit nuair a dúirt sé gur féidir le daoine in áit ar bith ar domhan an nuatheicneolaíocht agus na hathruithe móra atá tagtha ar an saol mar atá sé i láthair na huaire a úsáid leis an nGaeilge a labhairt. Buíochas le Dia, is féidir le daoine atá imithe ar imirce bheith i dteagmháil leis an mbaile, rud nach bhféadfaidís a dhéanamh 50 bliain ó shin. Is cinnte nach mbeidís in ann a leithéid a dhéanamh, seachas le litir, 100 bliain ó shin. Is maith an rud é gur mar sin atá anois. Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil áthas orm go bhfuil cúpla ag mo mhac agus an bhean atá aige san Astráil. Is í an Ghaeilge atáthar ag labhairt leo sa bhaile. Nach breá an scéal é sin? Is féidir iarracht an-mhór - iarracht dochreidte pearsanta - a dhéanamh. An gcaithfimid i gcónaí a bheith ag brath ar íobairtí daoine? An bhfuilimid sásta na moltaí a bhí sa straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm?</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> Nuair a chuireadh an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge le chéile, sheachnaíomar rudaí nach bhféadfaí a dhéanamh. Chaitheamar bliain ag dul anonn is anall idir na Rannaí Stáit éagsúla. Nuair a cheadaíodh an straitéis ag deireadh na bliana 2010, i lár na géarchéime eacnamaíochta, shíl an Rialtas ag an am go raibh sé sách práinneach mar rud go gcuirfí i bhfeidhm é go hiomlán agus go gcuirfí na hacmhainní chuige sin ar fáil. Bhíomar den tuairim go raibh na páirtithe eile san Oireachtas ag an am taobhach leis an méid a bhí idir lámha againn i dtaobh na straitéise. Dúirt siad go raibh.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> Ní raibh de thaithí ag an Aire Stáit go fóill ach a bheith sa Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta. Tá caiteachas an-bheag - €300 milliún nó rud éigin - ag an Roinn sin. Bheadh €4 mhilliún nó €5 mhilliún ag teastáil leis an straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm. Ní chosnódh sé aon airgead na hathruithe cuí eile a chur i bhfeidhm. Caithfear é sin a chur i gcomhthéacs. Caitheann an Stát breis is €50 billiún sa bhliain - sé sin, €1 bhilliún in aghaidh na seachtaine. Is mór an méid é €5 mhilliún don Aire Stáit. Mar a fuair mé amach, ní bheadh sé le háireamh suas ná síos sa Roinn Coimirce Sóisialaí, mar shampla. Níl aon mhaith a bheith ag rá linn an t-am ar fad, mar atá an Rialtas seo ag rá linn le ceithre bliana, go gcaithfimid fanacht go mbeidh borradh ar an eacnamaíocht. Má fhanann muid rófhada, beidh dochar nach féidir a leigheas déanta. Dá bhrí sin, ba cheart tosaíocht a thabhairt don straitéis.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> Má chailltear an Ghaeilge mar theanga pobail - má chailltear an Ghaeilge dhúchasach - beidh ceann de na seoda is luachmhaire atá againn go stairiúil caillte againn. Fiú má bhreathnaímid air ó thaobh cúrsaí airgid de, is mó agus is mó spéise atá ag eachtrannaigh agus daoine a thagann anseo le haghaidh turasóireachta i gcultúr agus in oidhreacht na tíre seo. Bítear ag caint ar infheistíocht a dhéanamh i ngalf, i siúlóidí agus mar sin de, agus is maith ann iad. Rinne mé go leor den obair sin. Nuair a chuirtear ceist ar thurasóirí cén fáth go dtagann siad go hÉirinn, deir siad go dtagann siad anseo le haghaidh an chultúir agus le haghaidh na hoidhreachta. Sílim gur cheart don Rialtas cinneadh a dhéanamh, ina bhliain dheiridh agus muid ag druidim i dtreo Lá Fhéile Pádraig na bliana 2015, go gcuirfear an straitéis i bhfeidhm go hiomlán. Nuair a shocraíomar ar an straitéis, ní biachlár a bhí i gceist ach rud gur cheart a chur i bhfeidhm go hiomlán. Dá ndéanfadh an Rialtas a leithéid, bheidís ag taispeáint an omóis is fearr a d'fhéadfaidís do laochra 1916.</p>

          <p eId="para_644">Iarraim chuile bhliain go ndéanfaimid iarracht gnó an Oireachtais ina iomláine a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge lá ar leith.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Níor éirigh liom go fóill agus tá mé anseo ó 2002. Tá beagáinín den obair déanta againn. Le cúpla bliain anuas, tá ceisteanna na gcinnirí den chuid is mó as Gaeilge in ainneoin nach mbíonn Gaeilge ag gach duine sa Teach. Uaireanta casann siad ar an Bhéarla agus is trua í sin. Nílimid ach ag lorg lá amháin den bhliain a mbeadh Gaeilge amháin á húsáid. Ní thuigim conas nach féidir linn gnó na dTithe seo a eagrú chun go mbeadh an méid Gaeilge atá ag gach uile Teachta sa Teach á úsáid. Ní chóir dó bheith chomh deacair sin. Muna bhfuil Gaeilge líofa acu nó muna bhfuil ach fíor-bheagán nó fiú cúpla focal acu, tá an córas ateangaireachta an-mhaith sa Teach agus tá sé ar fáil do chuile dhuine ar mian leo é a úsáid. Níl an córas ateangaireachta dírithe ar cad tá á rá agamsa as Gaeilge a aistriú go Béarla amháin. Tá an bealach eile ar fáil chomh maith. Tá sé de cheart agamsa cad tá á rá i mBéarla a chloisteáil i nGaeilge. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil ansin ach brionglóid agus go ndúiseoidh mé.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Sa deireadh thiar thall, ní fheicim go dtarlóidh sé. Mar an gcéanna, ní fheicim go mbeidh mór-obair déanta maidir le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla nó tarrtháil na Gaeilge nó na Gaeltachta i mbliain deireanach an Rialtais seo. Is mar an gcéanna a bheadh sé má bhíonn an páirtí a bhí i gceannas roimhe seo i gceannas arís. Bhí an deis ag an Aire Stáit agus ag an Rialtais le ceithre bliana anuas. Bhí a pháirtí mar chuid den Rialtas cheana féin. Bhí an deis ag chuile Rialtas ina raibh Fianna Fáil ó bunaíodh an Stát seo freisin.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> Tá an Ghaeilge anois in ísle brí. An aidhm a bhí ann nuair a bunaíodh an Stát, agus b'fhéidir nach raibh sé réalaíoch, ná go mbeadh Gaeilge amháin á húsáid. Ní hé sin an aidhm inniu. Bhí Aire Gaeilge sa chéad Dáil. Ní raibh a leithéid ann ó shin. Dá bhféachfaidís siar, an chéad mhórathrú a tharla ná an t-aitheantas go raibh fadhb ann in 1965. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil mé ag dul i bhfad siar but tiocfaidh mé ar fáth eile faoi sin. Is fada go bhfaighimid a leithéid seo de chaint in aon pháipéar dá shórt anois. Sin an méid a bhí le rá ag an Ollamh Seán Ó Coileáin agus é ag caint ar Scoil Merriman i mí Eanáir an bhliain seo. Bhí sé ag déanamh tráchta ar phíosa a bhí sa tuarascáil deiridh de Choimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge. Dúradh sa tuarascáil sin:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_648">Ós í an Ghaeilge an teanga náisiúnta dlitear tús áite a thabhairt di, agus déanfar gach dícheall chun a húsáid a leathnú agus a mhéadú. Mar sin féin, go ceann tamaill mhaith fós, is é an Béarla an teanga is mó a bheidh á húsáid taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht i ngnóthaí éagsúla.... Ní bheimis ag tabhairt aghaidh ar an bhfírinne ach oiread mura n-aithneoimis gur gá, mar gheall ar shuíomh na tíre agus ar an gcóiriú atá ar ár gcaidreamh eacnamaíoch agus sóisialach, go mbeadh eolas inniúil ar an mBéarla ag daoine, fiú amháin nuair is í an Ghaeilge is mó a bheidh á labhairt.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Sin a dúradh in 1965. Is fada uainn 1965, but is fada aon trácht eile ar athbheochan na Gaeilge. Táimid anois ag caint faoi tarrtháil na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta. In 2007, deineadh tuairisc teangeolaíochta. Luaigh an staidéar sin nach raibh ach 20 bliain fágtha chun an Ghaeilge a tharrtháil sa Ghaeltacht mar theanga labhartha chuile lá. Ní aontaím go huile is go hiomlán nach raibh ach 20 bliain againn. Foilsíodh an tuairisc sin seacht mbliana ó shin. Tháinig an straitéis 20 bliain i bhfeidhm in 2010. Sin cúig bliana ó shin, bhuel, ceithre go leith bliana ó shin. Fós, níl spriocdhátaí ann. Níl acmhainní ann. Níl deifir nó fuadar faoin Státchóras nó faoin Rialtas chun an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a tharrtháil. Ní gá ach féachtaint conas mar a chaith siad leis an athbhreithniú ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Tá obair mhaith déanta ach níl aon deifir faoi. Fógraíodh an t-athbhreithniú sin i mí na Samhna 2011. Anois, i mí an Mhárta 2015, níl fiú bliain fágtha ag an Rialtas agus níl tada déanta de réir sin. Caithfear an t-airgead a chur ar leathtaobh. Caithfidh na maoinithe a bheith tugtha. Caithfidh na hacmhainní a bheith tugtha, mar ní gá i gcónaí airgead a bheith i gceist. Caithfidh meon an Státchórais a athrú mar tá an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht i mbaol. Ní hé nach bhfuil gníomhairí ann. Ní hé nach bhfuil daoine ann le grá don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht. Táimid ann, but ní féidir linn é a dhéanamh as ár stuaim fhéin.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Ní féidir linn é a dhéanamh má tá an Státchóras drogallach. Ba léir é sin domsa, thar na blianta, ó thosaigh mé ag caint. Bhí mise beagánín mall chun cainte i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla. Thosaigh mé ag caint nuair a bhí mé trí bliana d'aois. Deirtear nár stop mé ó shin. An fhadhb ná nach raibh an Státchóras ann chun cuidiú iomlán a thabhairt dom. Gach uile áit a chuaigh mé, is ag troid ar son cearta teanga a bhíos nó a bhí mo chlann. Tá pobal bríomhar ann. Tá daoine bríomhaire ann agus tá siadsan sásta an troid a dhéanamh ar son na teanga, ach ní chóir go mbeadh siad ag troid ag an staid seo. Tá an oiread sin acmhainní ann anois ó thaobh na nua-theicneolaíochta de nó fiú caiteachas an Stáit gur féidir é sin a mhúnlú agus a athrú go dtabharfadh sé an chosaint sin dúinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> Is féidir linn féachaint ar thíortha eile a dhein tarrtháil ar a dteangacha. Is tíortha iad seo ar éirigh leo teanga a athbheochan ó thús i gcásanna áirithe. Fiú is féidir linn díriú ar an méid a bhfuil ag tarlú sna Sé Chontae. Is áit í seo a bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag teacht chun cinn in ainneoin an Státchórais agus in ainneoin dreamanna atá ina choinne go huile is go hiomlán. Ba chóir go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó déanta in Éirinn agus ba chóir dúinn iomlán tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh. Ba chóir dúinn glacadh leis an sampla atá ar fáil acusan. Níl gach rud in ísle brí.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> Ceann de na príomhghnéithe gur féidir leis an Stát díriú ná go bhfuil níos mó daoine ag freastal ar Ghaelscoileanna agus Ghaelcholáistí, ach is lastigh den Ghalltacht nó san breac-Ghaeltacht an chuid is mó dóibh san. Sa Ghaeltacht, tá líon na ndaltaí scoile atá ag freastal ar scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge, idir bhunscoileanna nó an naíscoileanna agus meánscoileanna, ag íslú.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> Ó thaobh na hollscoileanna de, níl aon mhórfhás tar éis teacht ar sin. Má tá an deis ag an Aire Stáit, iarraim air féachaint ar an méid a bhí le rá ag an Ollamh Seán Ó Colleáin san eagrán <i>Feasta </i>na míosa seo faoi an tslí ina bhfuil na hollscoileanna ag caitheamh leis an nGaeilge le blianta anuas. Ní ar leasa na Gaeilge atá siad ag obair. Don chuid is mó díobh, is cuma sa tsioc leo. B'fhearr leo go mbeadh an Ghaeilge gafa i roinn folklore nó a leithéid agus curtha ar leathtaobh mar ní thuileann sí airgead dóibh. Sin an fhadhb is mó ó thaobh ollscoileanna de. Tá siad ar fad dírithe ar conas is féidir leo airgead a thuilleamh toisc nach bhfuil siad maoinithe i gceart ag an Státchóras. Caithfidh athrú teacht ar an réimse sin maraon le gach uile réimse agus gach uile Rannóg Stáit. Caithfidh athrú meoin a bheith ann sna Rannóga Stáit, go huile is go hiomlán. Foilsíodh Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla in 2003. Ní raibh mé cinnte faoin Acht seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Dúirt mé nach n-éireodh leis, nach ndéanfadh an Státseirbhís an cur chuige ceart, agus nach mbeadh na pleananna nó na scéimeanna teanga go léir curtha faoinár mbráid. Bhí an ceart agam. Toisc nár chloígh siad le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, tá siadsan ag cur brú ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas seo maolú a dhéanamh, seachas a bheith sásta cur leis an méid dualgas agus spriocanna atáimid sásta glacadh leo. Níor chloígh an Státchóras ná na comhlachtaí pobail leis an dlí mar a bhí sé agus anois tá an cuma ar an scéal go bhfuil an Rialtas ag smaoineamh ar mhaolú a dhéanamh nuair a fheicimid Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla eile. Ní bheidh mise nó mo pháirtí sásta le haon mhaolú agus má tharlaíonn sé sin beimid ag cur go huile agus go hiomlán i gcoinne sin. Ba chóir go mbeidís ag déanamh cinnte go bhfuil sé níos daingne. Ní hamháin go bhfuil sé de cheart ag gach duine sa Ghaeltacht déileáil leis an Státseirbhís as Gaeilge. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé uathoibreach domsa nó d'éinne eile é sin a dhéanamh. Níl sé éasca agus déantar níos deacra é.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> Ba chóir chomh maith, agus luaigh mé é seo thar na blianta, go mbeadh sé de dhualgas ar an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna éileamh a chothú do Ghaelscoileanna agus do Ghaelcholáistí. Muna dtarlaíonn sé sin, beidh siad ag brath ar éileamh atá cruthaithe ag tuismitheoirí agus mar gheall ar na rialacha nua maidir le bunscoileanna, ní bheifear in ann Gaelscoileanna nua a chothú amach anseo. Ba chóir go mbeimis ag dul i dtreo difriúil mar feicimid cheana féin sa daonáireamh chuile bhliain go bhfuil líon breise Gaeilgeoirí sa Stát. Is é an dúshlán domsa agus don Rialtas ná iad siúd a mholadh agus a mhealladh, sa chaoi go mbeidh siad ag úsáid na Gaeilge sin de shíor mar braitheann sástacht na ndaoine, agus na Státseirbhíse bogadh sa treo eile, ar an méid a úsáidtear an teanga.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> Is trua liom go ndearna Rialtais thar na blianta a bhí Fine Gael agus Páirtí an Lucht Oibre gafa leo athruithe áirithe maidir le seasamh na Gaeilge sa Státseirbhís. Tá sé sin fós ag tarlú, mar shampla trí na marcanna breise a bhí ar fáil don líofacht sa Ghaeilge sa phróiseas earcaíochta den Státseirbhís a bhaint. Sna 1970í fuarthas réidh leis an riachtanas dhá phas a fháil chun an ardteistiméireacht a fháil. Ní raibh gá ann é sin a dhéanamh. Cuireadh deireadh freisin leis an ngá Gaeilge a bheith ag duine chun post a fháil sa Státseirbhís. Ba chosaintí iad sin ar fad agus bhí siad ann toisc, ó bhunú an Stáit agus roimhe sin, tuigeadh go raibh gá ann go mbeadh Gaeilgeoirí sa Státseirbhís. Fiú leis na spriocanna atá leagtha amach, ní thiocfaidh aon fhás ar líon na nGaeilgeoirí sa Státseirbhís ar an slí go mba chóir go mbeadh sé. Ba chóir go mbeadh 25% ann ar a laghad. Ní tharlóidh sé sin thar oíche. Caithfear é a mhaoiniú ach caithfear riachtanais a bheith ann freisin agus tá an cuma ar an scéal nach bhfuil an Rialtas sásta go mbeadh riachtanais teanga ann amach anseo.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> Is é an cáineadh is mó a rinneadh ar an Rialtas seo ná nuair a d'éirigh an Coimisinéir Teanga as a phost anuraidh. Ní cáineadh díreach ar an Aire Stáit nó ar a Rialtas a bhí ann, ach cáineadh ar Rialtais roimhe sin. Bhí sé tinn tuirseach den slí a bhí an Státchóras ag caitheamh leis agus leis an nGaeilge. Shíl sé nach raibh sé in ann aon rud eile a dhéanamh toisc nach raibh sé ag fáil tacaíochta ón Rialtas nó nach raibh sé ag fáil tacaíochta reachtúla chun a dhualgais a chomhlíonadh. Is gá é sin a athrú go hiomlán mar beimid ar ais anseo chuile bhliain agus beidh mé ag cáineadh an Rialtais seo nó na Státseirbhíse go deo na ndeor mura dtagann brostú faoin tarrtháil atá ag teastáil agus ansin nuair atá an tarrtháil déanta go gcasfaimid athuair ar athbheochan ó athréimiú na Gaeilge.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_658">An méid atá le rá agam inniu, tá sé ráite agam cheana, an bhliain seo caite agus an bhliain roimhe sin agus an bhliain roimhe sin arís. Is í an fhadhb atá ann ná nach bhfuil aon fheabhas tagtha ar an ábhar seo. Dúras ansin go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá mbeadh níos mó ná lá againn i rith Seachtain na Gaeilge, go mbeadh níos mó iarrachta á dhéanamh againn i rith na bliana maidir leis an nGaeilge. Dúras freisin gur theip ar gach Rialtas ó bhunú an Stáit maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge agus inniu ní labhraíonn ach mionlach sa tír seo Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> Rud eile a dúirt mé, dá mba rud é go bhfuilimid i ndáiríre maidir leis an nGaeilge, ba cheart dúinn tosú le cúrsaí oideachais. Ba chóir go mbeadh gach bunscoil ina Gaelscoil i gcomhair trí nó ceithre bliana ar a laghad agus ansin bheadh gach dalta scoile in ann labhairt as Gaeilge. Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil fadhbanna móra sna scoileanna. Tá a fhios againn nach bhfuil a lán daoine in ann Gaeilge a labhairt tar éis ar a laghad ocht mbliana sa bhunscoil agus trí bliana sa mheánscoil, fiú na daltaí a dhéanann an cúrsa ardleibhéil Gaeilge san ardteistiméaracht. Ba cheart go mbeadh líofacht acu go léir sa Ghaeilge ach níl. Tá jab sármhaith á dhéanamh ag na Gaelscoileanna, na cinn atá lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht ach go háirithe.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> Tá fadhb eile sna scoileanna toisc nach bhfuil grá ag go leor daltaí don Ghaeilge. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh suim sa Ghaeilge agus grá di ag daltaí i scoileanna lán-Bhéarla. Caithfidh ranganna Gaeilge a bheith beomhar, cultúrtha agus praicticiúil. Muna bhfuil suim ag daoine sa Ghaeilge agus muna bhfuil grá acu di, ní fiú an páipéar ar a bhfuil an straitéis sin scríofa. Táimid ag brath ar an nGaeltacht, ar na hoileáin sa Ghaeltacht agus ar na Gaelscoileanna chun an obair a dhéanamh agus n'fheadair an bhfuilimid ag tabhairt dhóthain tacaíochta don obair atá á déanamh acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> Uaireanta ceapaim nach bhfuil meas ag daoine atá líofa sa Ghaeilge ar na daoine a bhfuil ag iarraidh Gaeilge a labhairt. Níl na daoine sin líofa ach tá grá acu don Ghaeilge agus bíonn siad ag déanamh a ndíchill Gaeilge a labhairt agus úsáid a bhaint as na focail atá acu, cosúil liomsa. Bhí an t-ádh liom go raibh múinteoirí maithe agam sa mheánscoil. Bhí grá acu don Ghaeilge agus is dócha gur cainteoirí dúchais a bhí iontu. Spreag siad grá don teanga ionam agus i mo chairde. Ba mheánscoil trí Bhéarla a bhí inti ach toisc go raibh grá againn don Ghaeilge, bhíomar ag caint as Gaeilge cuid mhaith den am. Roimh an Drochshaol bhí 7 milliún daoine ann a labhair Gaeilge mar a gcéad teanga gach lá. Tá níos lú ná 20,000 duine á húsáid sa lá atá inniu ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> Dúirt an tAire Stáit go raibh an tseachtain seo fíorthábhachtach nuair a bhí sé ag caint ach má tá sé chomh tábhachtach sin, cén fáth nach bhfuil níos mó rudaí ar siúl sa Dáil? Níl ach cúpla uair a chloig i gcomhar na Gaeilge i rith na seachtaine. Tá níos mó rudaí ar siúl lasmuigh den Oireachtas. Caithfidh mé a admháil nár aontaigh mé le cad a tharla ar maidin leis an Teachta de Bhailís. Dúirt sé nach raibh Gaeilge aige. Tá a lán daoine sa tír seo atá cosúil leis agus nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu i ndiaidh an 13 bliain sa bhunscoil agus sa mheánscoil. Dúirt sé é sin ach lean an Taoiseach ar aghaidh ag freagairt as Gaeilge. Bhí ceist thábhachtach ag an Teachta agus ba chóir go mbeadh níos mó tuisceana ag an Taoiseach le haghaidh daoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil Gaeilge líofa ag an Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> Is teanga álainn í an Ghaeilge, a litríocht, a filíocht agus a ceol. Tá obair iontach á déanamh go háirithe ag TG4, Raidió na Gaeltachta agus Raidió na Life i mBaile Átha Cliath. Tá a lán rudaí suimiúla sa straitéis ach cá bhfuil sí ag dul? Níl sé ró-dhéanach an teanga a shábháil ach aontaím go bhfuil easpa deifre ann leis an obair seo.</p>

          <p eId="para_666">I wanted to speak in this debate because I believe it is an important one that comes up once a year. I am not a fluent Irish speaker; I am not even an Irish speaker. Deputies Aengus Ó Snodaigh and Maureen O'Sullivan raised many interesting points about where the Irish language is going. To my mind, unless a language is a living language, and unless it is nearly the primary language in a country, it is very hard to hold on to that language as a cultural and traditional language. I fully commend people who speak fluent Irish, those who teach it, those who love it and those who live their daily lives through the language. However, the reality is it is not the primary language of Ireland. There is a population of 4.5 million, yet the aim is to increase the number who speak Irish daily outside the education system from 83,000 to 250,000 in 20 years. I cannot see the practicality of that in the way we are implementing this at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> An issue raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh is how we make it become part of the workplace, part of the Civil Service, part of the education system and part of family life and general life so that we need to learn it. I would love to be able to speak French as I visit France quite regularly. However, the only way for a person to learn it is to force themselves to speak and actually engage in it. Other than that, a person is not going to learn it. There has to be a recognition of this by the Government and future Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> We must ask whether there is a basis for putting huge resources into the language. Is it the case that economic issues will become predominant and it will not be needed? For example, the multinationals and the Civil Service might not see the need for Irish in the workplace. When I came through education, we got the blackboard with Máire and the madra, and so on. I am not sure whether it has come on much from there, although there is probably more engagement in the classroom now. However, we would need to have a real injection of the type of radical measures Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan spoke about, such as schooling being through Irish for the first three years and Irish being spoken in crèches. That would mean huge investment and mean that teachers and crèche workers would all have to be able to speak fluent Irish. I do not know that the Government is willing to put that type of money into this.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> There is a huge question around the language. If the position stays as it is, it will not be any sort of a living language, even in some of the Gaeltacht areas. This is because these areas will be highly influenced by the economic influences from elsewhere, as well as by the practical point that people have to converse in English in industry, economics, trade and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> In my remaining time, I want to focus on the subject of Irish Sign Language, ISL, which has not had much mention in the debate. We know the Irish Sign Language Bill was debated in the Seanad in 2013 but it did not go through. This involves a small cohort of people, with 5,000 deaf people and up to 40,000 others using it daily. The situation to date is that no deaf child can fully learn Irish Sign Language as not all teachers are fluent or qualified in it. I raise this issue because, if we are not going to deal with Irish as a language, we are certainly not going to be able to deal with Irish Sign Language. The programme for Government stated: "We will examine different mechanisms to promote the recognition of Irish Sign Language." In the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan 2013-15, there are only two references to sign language and only four references to deafness.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> The question is what the Government is doing about Irish Sign Language. If it will not do anything for the Irish language, what will it do in a practical way to get Irish Sign Language onto the agenda again? Will it bring in a Bill to recognise Irish Sign Language? Will it introduce the structures that are needed in the schools, such as teachers and other supports that are needed for people to converse in Irish Sign Language?</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> This involves a group of people who are very cut off. The practical chances of them getting jobs within the community are insignificant when compared with the chances of others. Are we going to leave this group aside and say we are putting nothing into this? Only 8% of those who use Irish Sign Language are fully conversant in it. How are we going to address this? I have not heard anything to date that will even go near to dealing with this. I would like an answer in this regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_673">I believe Government policies since the foundation of the State, rather than strengthening the Irish language, have left it to drift and then plummet downwards. Following our independence, our language was in a fairly healthy state. The oral tradition in non-Gaeltacht areas was still strong in the early 20th century. The older generation had a reasonable command of the language and it was actively spoken in homes and communities, and was still regarded at that time as being our official language. However, the economic climate before and after the Second World War left us in dire straits and it did not help matters that there was forced emigration. Even during the war years, a huge number of labourers and carpenters from rural Ireland were trying to maintain Britain, London in particular. There was a huge exodus of the younger generation. That led to a mindset whereby the Irish language was not seen as being of much use. There was no other option but to get out of the country because there were no possibilities here given the knock-on effects of the war. Therefore, people felt it was futile to foster the language in homes and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> At that time, people felt their livelihood would have to be made abroad. I believe we are in a similar mindset today given thousands of our younger generation are exiled. A certain amount of that is what we would call forced emigration, and it is again giving a negative view of the Irish language as being of no use to those perhaps going to the Continent or further abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> In the previous century, the Irish language was only taken seriously at national school level by those going on to second and third level, where there was a need to enhance their progress, especially for Civil Service jobs. It was a necessity for those striving to undertake further education but, outside of this cohort, there was huge negativity and apathy towards the language. In many cases, people were not going to carry on beyond primary school education or beyond second year of secondary level. The introduction of free secondary education gave a mild boost and was a help. There was a compulsory aspect if a person wanted to carry on to third level to get the job they desired, and that was also some help in fostering the language.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> We can learn from the Welsh experience. There is a huge revival of the Welsh language which has been achieved through active engagement in the community and also through co-ordination with the school system. We should look at the model they have developed there because the Minister of State might be able to make that model work in the Irish system. We can certainly take a good example from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> I compliment the Minister of State on developing his language ability.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">The Minister of State would have performed excellently in another Department, as well as if not better than he is doing currently. In regard to matters pertaining to Gaeltacht areas, I believe proficiency in the language is essential. The Minister of State is certainly getting towards that now.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> The approach taken shows the Government attitude. The Irish Language Commissioner resigned recently and we are not meeting the 3% target of proficiency in the public service. The Government commitment is lacking and needs to be re-examined.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_680">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta McHugh, agus ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil sé ag saothrú go díograiseach ar son na teanga. Tréaslaím leis as an dea-obair sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> Tá áthas orm a bheith ábalta páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht thábhachtach seo. Tá an straitéis don Ghaeilge bunaithe ar thuairimí gach páirtí san Oireachtas. Is í an chéad aidhm atá ag an straitéis ná an méid daoine a úsáideann an Ghaeilge de gnáth a ardú, ó 83,000 go 250,000; an méid daoine a labhraíonn Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí a ardú 25%; agus na daoine a úsáideann seirbhísí trí mheán na Gaeilge a ardú. Sa gcomhthéacs sin, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil Teilifís na Gaeilge agus Raidió na Gaeltachta ag déanamh sár iarrachta agus ag cur clár den chéad scoth ar fáil. Molaim sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoi chúrsaí oideachais agus an Ghaeilge. Fuair cigirí na Gaeilge amach go múintear Gaeilge trí mheán an Bhéarla i 33% de bhunscoileanna. Tá sé tábhachtach é sin a athrú agus cúrsaí inseirbhíse a chur ar fáil do mhúinteoirí chun go mbeidh muinín acu astu féin ag úsáid na Gaeilge an t-am ar fad. I Meán Fómhair 2016, beidh curaclam nua do na ranganna sóisearacha againn. Tá méadú ó 20% go 40% ar an mhéid marcanna don bhéal scrúdú sna meánscoileanna do scrúdú an teastais shóisearaigh. Tá cuid mhaith scoileanna agus micléinn ag baint triail as an áis seo agus is fiú sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> Tá sé tábhachtach an ceangal idir an Ghaeltacht agus na coláistí oiliúna a choimeád. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé riachtanach d'ábhair oidí níos mó tréimhsí a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht, ionas go bhfaighidís grá, spreagadh agus líofacht sa teanga. Go ginearálta, caithfimid béim mhór a chur ar thréimhse a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht. Téann mo chlann féin ann agus baineann siad sult as an gcuairt. Is fiú go mór sin a dhéanamh. Caithfimid na deontais a choimeád chun go mbeidh gach dalta ábalta dul ann. Ba chóir go ndéanfaí iarracht sna scoileanna mic léinn a mhealladh go dtí na Gaeltachtaí. B'fhéidir gur fiú teastais nó marcanna breise a úsáid chun iad a mhealladh ann. Níl aon rud níos éifeachtaí maidir le hathbheocan na teanga ná tréimhse a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> Tá Teilifís na Gaeilge ag déanamh jab iontach agus ba chóir leanúint ar aghaidh le tacaíocht don stáisiún. Tá éagsúlacht sna cláir a bhíonn ar siúl. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh clár amháin sa seachtain ar gach raidió áitiúil trí Ghaeilge agus go mbeadh ár gcultúr agus ár dteanga mar ábhar lárnach ag an gclár sin. B'fhéidir gur cóir deontais a thabhairt do stáisiúin áitiúla chun seo a dhéanamh. Ba mhaith liom mo stáisiún áitiúil féin, Northern Sound, a mholadh, mar rinne sé iarracht seo a dhéanamh ó thosaigh sé. An rud is tábhachtaí ná go mbeidh meas agus grá don teanga i measc an phobail uilig. Sílim go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar sin, ach caithfimid iarracht bhreise a dhéanamh. Molaim don Aire Stáit an cheist seo a scrúdú, go háirithe i gcomhthéacs chomóradh Éirí Amach 1916. Sílim gur fiú béim a chur ar an Ghaeilge agus ar an teanga labhartha ar an ócáid sin agus an seans sin a úsáid.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> Ba mhaith liom tréaslú le Foras na Gaeilge agus le hÉamonn Ó hArgáin as an sár obair a dhéanann siad. Tréaslaím chomh maith le Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann agus Cumann Lúthchleas Gael as an obair a dhéanann siad freisin. Tá na heagrais seo ag déanamh sár obair agus molaim don Aire Stáit obair leo chun an Ghaeilge a fhorbairt. Tá tionchar acu agus dlúthcheangal acu le tromlach mhuintir na tíre. Tá an-mheas agam ar obair an tSeanadóir Labhrás Ó Murchú as an obair a dhéanann sé don chultúr agus don teanga. Is cúis áthais agus bróid dom go bhfuil mo sheanchara agus comharsa, Aogán Ó Fearghaíl, ina uachtarán nua ar Chumann Lúthchleas Gael. Tá an-mheas agus grá aige don teanga agus d'oidreacht agus do chultúr na tíre. Cabhróidh sé go mór leis an teanga sna blianta atá le teacht. Mar fhocal scoir, má oibríonn muid le chéile cosúil le meitheal, beidh torthaí iontach againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> With the Chair's permission, I will now make some comments in English as my political assistant has insisted I do so in order to get our message out. I have great admiration for the work the Minister of State is doing, for how he has hit the ground running and for how genuinely passionate he is about our language and culture. I wish him well with his efforts in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> I made the point that we should have a weekly programme in Irish on every local radio station, with an emphasis on our culture. I suggest to the Minister of State that he should look into organising and supporting this initiative financially. Perhaps he could sponsor it to ensure it happens. I congratulate my local station, Northern Sound, which has from its inception attempted to run a successful Irish programme every week. It is vital we have this type of programme on local radio stations throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> I also pointed out that it is important we put a significant emphasis on going to the Gaeltacht, both for trainee teachers and school students. In the case of teacher education, trainee teachers should have to spend mandatory periods in the Gaeltacht and this should be supported and encouraged by the Department. Anybody who intends to teach Irish in either primary or secondary schools should have had significant immersion in our living Gaeltachts. I urge the Minister of State to work with the Minister for Education and Skills and teacher training colleges to ensure this happens. This immersion is vital. It is also important that young secondary school students spend time in the Gaeltacht on a regular basis. My own sons have done this with great effect. Spending time in the Gaeltacht is important and I commend this practice to the Minister of State. This will involve support for the mná tí, the women who take these students into their homes. The Department must offer support to make it financially attractive for mná tí to take in these students and to make it possible for children across the country to go to the Gaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I suggest the Minister of State should, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Skills, consider some form of certification or extra marks for students who attend the Gaeltacht. There should be recognition and support for them to encourage the take-up of such a scheme. A child who goes to the Gaeltacht will have and never lose a love of Irish and will retain a sense of his heritage and culture. There is no substitute for that. This cannot be simulated in a city classroom elsewhere in Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_690"> I made the point that we have wonderful organisations in this country that work for our culture and heritage, for example, the GAA. I am proud my neighbour, Aogán Ó Fearghaíl, has become president of the GAA as he has a great love for the Irish language. We also have Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, through which Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú and the people working with him do excellent work. We also have Conradh na Gaeilge. These are all voluntary bodies. </p>
          <p eId="para_691">There is more potential to propagate the language through those voluntary bodies. They have language officers etc. We should look to strengthen that because they have access to people in recreational conditions, which is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> There should be more in-service for teachers who have difficulty teaching Irish, particularly at primary level and through the medium of Irish. In two thirds of classrooms, teachers teach through Irish but in the third where they do not, it is not that teachers do not appreciate the importance but rather that they are not confident or fluent enough to do it. They need support through in-service and Gaeltacht opportunities. That question needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> Respect for the language is growing and we should all work together as a meitheal or team. We must include the voluntary sector, Ministers, State agencies and people in education, and in doing so we can do much in the coming years. We should not consider this as a job that cannot be done, as we can succeed if we have the heart and will to do it.</p>

        <speech by="#RuthCoppinger" eId="spk_309">
          <from>Deputy Ruth Coppinger<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_694">I am sorry I have to speak in English but I am probably representing the majority of the population, who do not have sufficient confidence and ability to speak in Irish. In Stratéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge, there are many very high-minded aims and ambitious targets to increase the use of the Irish language but we must be extremely sober as well. The document states that Ireland is a bilingual State, as it is, but the majority of people like me have emerged through an education system without being able to speak it with confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> Some 3% of the population uses Irish as the main language of household and community, with 42% having a certain ability to speak Irish. I would even question how much of an ability exists in that 42%, and I am sure the use of the language varies widely. This leaves 55% of people in this country who do not have the ability to speak Irish. Despite this, there is much goodwill towards the Irish language. Survey after survey indicates that people feel the language is very important for the country and personally. The aim of the strategy is to increase the number of people with knowledge of Irish from 1.6 million to 2 million and the number of daily speakers of Irish from 83,000 to 250,000, multiplying the current figure by three. These are massively ambitious targets but I am sorry I do not see any sign that this can be achieved. Frankly, it is a pipe dream, unless radical steps are taken. Among these radical measures would be a major investment of funds required to make this happen, as well as an end to austerity, which is killing the Gaeltacht very slowly.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> The aim in Gaeltacht areas and among bilingual or native Irish speakers is to increase numbers of people speaking Irish on a daily basis by 25%. The Gaeltacht is being slowly murdered through mass emigration, which has been an historic problem but which under the current and previous Administrations, has become a severe problem. There is also mass migration of young people from Gaeltacht areas to the cities, with an ongoing failure to create jobs that would sustain communities in Irish-speaking areas. The effects can be seen in the traditional industries of fishing and agriculture. I am on the environment committee and we saw how a traditional pastime that allowed Gaeltacht families boost their income, working with seaweed, was taken when Údarás na Gaeltachta handed the rights to the product to a multinational company. That speaks volumes of this Government's commitment to maintain jobs and livelihoods in Gaeltacht areas. Even public sector jobs have been decimated in the Gaeltacht, and it is shameful for the Government to turn around and argue that it wants to encourage the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> What about the use of Irish in the general population not in Gaeltacht areas? Page 7 of the document indicates the aim of creating positive circumstances for greater use so that people can have the ability and the opportunities to use Irish. I would certainly welcome this but a previous speaker hit on an issue that is a major bugbear of mine. Why is going to the Gaeltacht currently the preserve of the middle class? Before coming here, I checked the price of sending a child to a Gaeltacht for a week, which is €240 for one of the Donegal schools. Students would have to go for much longer than a week really to come into contact with Irish as a living, spoken language in everyday life. It is essential for this to be part and parcel of the education system if we really want to encourage and develop Irish. That would involve the Government giving grants to working class students in order to go to the Gaeltacht, or alternatively making it free and part of the education system. That would take it from the hands of the well-heeled, who have the funds to send their children to the Gaeltacht schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> There has been ongoing gutting of education in the past seven years which was begun by the previous Government. The result is that classes have become much bigger, with a larger pupil-teacher ratio. A number of supports have been taken from education. Smaller classes are absolutely vital to encourage more people to use Irish as a spoken language. One of the aims of the document is for the oral component of Irish to be 40%, with certification and marking reflecting that. We would want very small classes to be able to do that, and in many classrooms in the country, there are 30, 31 or even 32 students per teacher.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> One of the findings of the surveys was that 25% of teachers feel they have less confidence in their ability to teach Irish. A previous speaker called for much more training of teachers and visits to the Gaeltacht but there is no money for that in the strategy document. I struggle to see how it will be possible to increase the number of Irish speakers by 300% without any funding going in. It has been mentioned that partial immersion would become the norm in schools. As well as Irish being spoken during the Irish lesson portion of the school day, other subjects would also incorporate Irish language. That would also require much investment in education, including funding for existing and additional teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> Will the Government provide free classes around the country for adults who would like to learn Irish? Many people passed through a system that was rural-oriented. We all know that poor Peig is being blamed for many of the ills in Irish education, although I am not suggesting it. I went through school in an urban environment and the curriculum, because of its history, was rural-based and seemed quite irrelevant and outdated for many students. We know there was an emphasis not so much on oral skills but on written language and grammar etc. Many adults would like to go back and they would be more encouraged to help their children, and we would also need free classes.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Investment is not just needed in the public sector: what will happen within the private sector? This Government and previous Administrations with a neoliberal mindset have always gone on about the private sector but has the Minister of State insisted that banks and other agencies should be able to provide a bilingual service for customers? What is being put in place in that regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> I have much goodwill for the Irish language and I would like to see it developed, maintained and encouraged as outlined in the document. I do not have much hope, based on the fact that the Government has not outlined how it will provide the major inputs needed for the education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">It is critical that we give young people an opportunity to go to the Gaeltacht because that is the only way Irish can seem relevant to their daily lives. An effort needs to be made to ensure going to the Gaeltacht is not just the preserve of the privileged, but is a right for every young person in this country. Accessing one's heritage, language and culture should not be the preserve of the middle class and the wealthy in this country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_704">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta McHugh. Déanaim comhghairdeas leis as ucht an dul chun cinn atá déanta aige lena chuid Gaeilge. Tá an bheirt againn ag foghlaim. Tá sé deacair dúinne nár tógadh le Gaeilge sa bhaile an teanga a labhairt chuile lá. Tá a lán daoine cosúil linn sa tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Tá áthas orm cúpla focal a rá maidir leis an dul chun cinn ata á dhéanamh leis an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge. Tá muid i mbliain a cúig den straitéis. Mar a deirtear, tá a lán déanta agus níos mó le déanamh. Nuair a d'fhoilsigh an t-iar-Rialtas an straitéis, bhí an tír briste agus bhí an Ciste Airgeadaíochta Idirnáisiúnta inár measc. Anois, tá an tír ar an mbealach ar ais, a bhuíochas den Rialtas agus go mórmhór de mhuintir na hÉireann. Tá feabhas ag teacht ar eacnamaíocht na tíre. Tá níos mó airgid ag an Rialtas chun an straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm. Caithfimid é sin a dhéanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> Tá dul chun cinn á dhéanamh ó thaobh na bpleananna teanga faoin Acht teangan. Tá na ceantair ag ullmhú na bpleananna áitiúla, ag leagan amach an chaoi ina bhfuil an teanga á cur chun tosaigh acu agus ag míniú na bpleananna atá acu chun a gceantair a láidriú. Tá sé de dhualgas ar gach ceantar fanacht laistigh den Ghaeltacht. Ní ar an Rialtas atá an dualgas, ach ar an bpobal. Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil na ceantair ag ullmhú na bpleananna de réir an Achta. Mar a dúirt mé ag an gcomhdháil cearta a d'eagraigh Conradh na Gaeilge i lár mí Feabhra, agus mar atá ráite agam leis an Aire Stáit, tá an cuóta de 6% atá leagtha síos d'earcaíocht sa tseirbhís phoiblí i bplean an Rialtais ró-íseal. Tá an moratóir i bhfeidhm ar feadh tamaill anois. Seachas earcaíocht san earnáil phoiblí, mar shampla, múinteoirí, gardaí agus réimsí spriocdhírithe eile, níl aon ardú suntasach déanta sa tseirbhís phoiblí. Beidh sé sin ag athrú sna blianta amach romhainn. B'fhearr liom cuóta níos airde, mar go dteastaíonn sé chun an difríocht atá á teastáil a dhéanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> In aon fheachtas earcaíochta, mar shampla in áiteanna Gaeltachta ar nós Gaillimh, ba chóir go mbeadh sé riachtanach go mbeadh cuóta earcaíochta níos airde i dtaobh Gaeilgeoirí laistigh de na húdaráis áitiúla, an tseirbhís sláinte, srl. Níl aon spriocanna ar leith i nGaillimh i dtéarmaí líon an phearsanra i seachadadh seirbhísí. Bíonn rudaí níos deacra nuair a chailltear daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu, de réir príomhfheidhmeannach Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe. Dúirt sé go mbeadh fáilte aige roimh fheachtas earcaíochta poiblí. Mar is eol do dhaoine, tá an moratóir ann le tamall fada. Tá níos mó daoine le Gaeilge agus gan Ghaeilge ag teastáil sa tseirbhís poiblí. Tá sé ráite ag an Aire Dlí agus Cirt agus Comhionannais, bunaithe ar eolas ón Garda Síochána, go bhfuil 10% do na hearcaigh nua sa Gharda Síochána líofa sa Ghaeilge. Tá sé i gceist go mbeidh na gardaí sin ag obair sa Ghaeltacht ar feadh tréimhse, mar atá leagtha síos ag Coimisinéir na nGardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> Is oth liom a rá go bhfuil daoine sa tír seo atá in aghaidh na teanga náisiúnta. Tá daoine sa Státseirbhís agus b'fhéidir sa pholaitíocht a bheadh níos sásta gan an Ghaeilge a bheith againn sa tír seo. B'fhéidir go gceapann siad go mbeadh saol níos éasca acu gan an teanga. Is é sin an fáth go dteastaíonn an straitéis uainn. Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil aidhmeanna leagtha síos agus go bhfuil ar an Rialtas glacadh leo. Tá breis airgid ag teastáil chun cuid de na spriocanna atá leagtha síos sna pleananna a bhaint amach. I gcásanna eile, tá athrú ar pholasaí an Rialtais nó polasaí na Státseirbhíse de dhíth.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> Tá seans againn poist nua a chruthú ó thaobh sheirbhísí aistriúcháin san Eoraip. Tá maolú ann ón am a rinneadh an cinneadh chun aitheantas a thabhairt don Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil san Eoraip. Caithfimid deireadh a chur leis an maolú sin. Tá sé leagtha síos i gcuspóir 10 sa straitéis go dtabharfar "gach cúnamh agus tacaíocht don Aontas Eorpach i bhfeidhmiú an chinnidh an Ghaeilge a bheith ina teanga oibre agus ina teanga oifigiúil san AE". Tá a fhios agam go raibh díospóireacht ag Conradh na Gaeilge ar an ábhar seo le gairid, le linn an chomhdháil teangan. Is léir ón eolas atá agam go bhfuil sé ráite ag feidhmeannaigh ón Roinn nach bhfuil an oiread sin daoine ar fáil chun na poist sin a líonadh. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé seo fíor, ach caithfimid tuilleadh a dhéanamh chun poist a chruthú do dhaoine le Gaeilge agus gan Ghaeilge. Caithfimid an seans atá againn poist ghairmiúla a chruthú a thógáil. I mo thuairim, caithfear deireadh a chur leis an maolú sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> Tá sprioc leagtha amach ag deireadh na straitéise ó thaobh saol eacnamaíochta na tíre. Chuir mé síos ceist Dhála maidir le pacáistíocht dhátheangach le déanaí. Dúradh liom go bhfuil an Roinn ag obair le Foras Na Gaeilge agus le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta chun an sprioc seo a chur i bhfeidhm. The reply stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_711">An Foras Teanga, has a key statutory role in the provision of resources and support for the Irish language on an all-island basis... Foras na Gaeilge is currently compiling an e-book on best practice in bilingual packaging. The recommendations in the e-book entitled "Pacáistíocht Dhátheangach – Treoir ar an gCleachtas is Fearr" are based on research commissioned by Foras na Gaeilge and carried out by the Dublin Institute of Technology. The e-book is aimed primarily at private sector companies and will demonstrate how bilingual packaging can be used to competitive advantage... Foras na Gaeilge has already produced an e-book on best practice in bilingual signage... a voluntary code of best practice for businesses that wish to use the Irish language, Q-Mharc Gnó le Gaeilge, is being developed by Foras na Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Údarás na Gaeltachta is also giving grant assistance to client companies in the Gaeltacht. There are specific conditions in the grant agreement that relate to the use of the Irish language. A comprehensive language plan, incorporating bilingual labelling and packaging, has been agreed by Údarás na Gaeltachta with all its client companies. It has also compiled a business guide, Gnó le Gaeilge, to encourage and assist companies to increase and consolidate the use of Irish in the workplace and to implement language plans in the workplace. It is worth noting that bilingual labelling and packaging is a central part of the marketing strategy of many of Údarás na Gaeltachta's client companies, including household names like Bácús Uí Bhaoill, Rí na Mara and Iasc de Brún. This issue is part of the strategy. If one sees bilingual packaging at the breakfast table everyday, one is learning everyday. It is part of the strategy in so far as it relates to the economic life of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> As I said earlier, it is very positive that 10% of those recruited to the Garda Síochána will be fluent Irish speakers and will be stationed in Gaeltacht areas for a period of time as determined by the Garda Commissioner. It is to be hoped that they will continue to be based in such areas. Obviously, it is important for Gaeltacht people to be able to speak to the local garda as Gaeilge, in line with their general desire to be able to avail of Irish language services in their own communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The progress report produced by an Roinn Comhshaoil, Pobail agus Rialtais Áitiúil, which relates to the period up to the end of September 2014, states that the Department has been in discussions with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Údarás na Gaeltachta since late 2013 regarding "Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) that have Gaeltacht areas in their respective local authority area and regarding a possible implementation role in LEADER, SICAP and other local development programmes in the Gaeltacht". That certainly did not happen in Galway, unfortunately. It is regrettable that no representative from Údarás na Gaeltachta was put on the Galway local community development committee. That should have happened but it did not, unfortunately.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> I would like to mention a few other things before I conclude. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has reported that it "is in the process of drafting a protocol with Údarás na Gaeltachta regarding the Local Enterprise Offices". This is a welcome development. According to the Department, the "protocol will underpin the Government decision that Údarás na Gaeltachta will maintain responsibility for micro-enterprise and small business supports in the Gaeltacht as well as having appropriate access to supports from the new Local Enterprise Offices". That is welcome. The Department has said that while it has "a number of staff who are fluent in the Irish language, it has not to date identified any specific posts within its business services which currently require fluency in Irish". I think that response is typical of the responses we received when we tabled parliamentary questions to a number of Departments. It is regrettable because there is a role for people with fluency in Irish in every Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">I wonder if there is scope to extend the co-operation between the Department and Údarás na Gaeltachta to ensure that services can be provided through Irish, because both obviously have a job creation remit. It is a 20-year strategy, not a three-year, four-year or five-year strategy, and while we want to see progress in every area, not everything can be achieved immediately. Some things can be achieved because the economy is improving and money will become more available, but others require changes in policy. I highlighted the issue of the derogation on the translation of documents in Europe. There is great potential for job creation in that area and the derogation should be removed as soon as possible. The fact that these jobs are there means that, even if people are not ready at the moment to take them up, the potential is there and, over time, people with the necessary competence and ability will become available.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_311">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_717">I welcome the 20-year strategy. I am not a knocker and I like to see the positive side of a Government, but at the beginning of this Government's term in 2011 I was very worried about the policies of Fine Gael and its commitment to the Irish language. I had concerns that they were abandoning the Irish language, but I welcome the work that has been done on this strategy. I believe it takes us in the right direction and I now believe the Government appreciates that the Irish language is terribly important to us in a number of different ways. Culturally, we have to protect our national tongue, but the Gaeltacht areas themselves have to be protected and enhanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> I wish to talk about the service provided over many years by our mná tí. I remember being in Kilnamartyra in the house of Bean Lehane, God be good to her - she has now gone to her eternal reward. She was one of many people who opened up their houses to young students and who spoke Irish with them from morning until night whether they liked it or not. They drilled the language into them, but they were very kind and caring people. I would love the bean an tí system to be protected and enhanced with the necessary incentives so that people continue to open up their homes. The money they make out of it is very small and, as the Minister knows, it is more of a vocation than a job. They are also deeply committed to the Irish language and to the education of young people and they provide an excellent service. I urge the Government to ensure our mná tí are still there in five, ten or 20 years' time, and their children after them.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> The Irish language should, of course, be kept as a compulsory subject for the leaving certificate, because there is no other way we can ensure young people embrace the language. There should also be a requirement for certain professions such as teachers, gardaí, civil servants and public service jobs in general. We should ensure the public service has a requirement as regards the Irish language. </p>
          <p eId="para_720"> At the time they came to power I thought Fine Gael was saying that money invested in the Irish language was wasted. It is not wasted. Any money we put into the Gaeltacht areas and the Irish language is an investment in our future. I know the Minister of State believes that, but I want to ensure that some of our urban Ministers appreciate it as much. The Minister of State may have to be more forceful in imposing his views on his colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> Some farm smallholdings in Gaeltacht areas have been lost in the past few years and young people are emigrating. The last hope for the survival of these areas is the Irish language. The local economy of Ceann Trá and west Dingle is reliant on the Irish language and its survival. When I hold clinics there I am able to go to the ceilí sessions in my local hall and see youngsters enjoying their culture, their set dancing and the Irish music. I was once such a youngster myself in Ballyvourney and it was very special to see them all doing these very important things.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> There should be an increase in funding for Tús Maith, as it encourages small children to learn their subjects through Irish. I would appreciate the Minister of State's support for that. Cúntóirí teangan are very important to enable native speakers to talk to children outside the Gaeltacht areas and encourage them to use our native tongue. I ask the Minister to ensure that future funding for this is ring-fenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> As regards the provisions of child care as Gaeilge, there should be a strong emphasis on ensuring childminders are available who are fluent in the Irish language to take care of our young people. I spoke with a family living in a Gaeltacht area who wanted a childminder who was fluent in Irish to take care of their child but, despite their best efforts, they were unable to find one.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">There is an opportunity therefore to ensure that employment is provided to people. That is because if childminders were fluent in Irish, they would be able to get such work. The Government should encourage young people who are being educated in the childminding sector to learn Irish. If they educate themselves to be fluent in the language, it might enhance their employment opportunities. It is an important thing for the Minister of State and the Government to consider. </p>
          <p eId="para_725"> As I have said, I am not a knocker. Four years ago, I was worried that the Government would throw the Irish language to one side due to the bad economic situation when it took office. I appreciate, however, that the Government now says it will do everything it can to enhance the language and protect Gaeltacht areas by investing in them. Together with my constituents and those in the west Cork Gaeltacht, I warmly welcome any such work by the Minister of State and his officials. We are grateful for any steps to protect the Irish language.</p>

          <p eId="para_726">Go raibh míle maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to statements on the 2020 strategy for the Irish language. I disagree with Deputy Healy-Rae about compelling people to do something against their will because compulsion belongs to another era. We are living in the 21st century and people should have free choice. People should be educated, not forced or driven like herds of cattle. I hope Deputy Healy-Rae does not think one can drive people into doing something against their will. I would not like to see that happening in a modern society.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I have had a fair deal of experience of issues relating to the Irish language and the Gaeltacht in recent years. I have always believed that the Irish language is an emblem of our national identity and we should always recognise its value and cultural importance, together with our customs and other aspects that give us our Irish identity.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> The importance of Irish is enshrined in our Constitution, Article 8.1 of which states: "The Irish language as the national language is the first official language." Many decades before these words were written, however, the shift from Irish to English as the main language had already begun. One of the key aims of the 2020 strategy is to strengthen the position of the language within our education system. According to recent reports, teaching inspectors have judged that Irish was taught to a good or very good standard in only half of the primary classrooms inspected. In addition, pupils in just over half of the lessons were able to express themselves to a satisfactory level in Irish. This point is reinforced by the Harris report of July 2007. It found that a little over half of pupils were competent in oral communications in 1985 in English-medium schools, while less than one third had mastered them in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> The study also found a marked decline in teachers' confidence, with almost 25% of teachers in English-medium schools rating their own standards of spoken Irish as weak. This is a fundamental problem, so we really need a comprehensive reform of teaching Irish. We must reform the curriculum and focus on the teaching of Irish as a living language, a language of modern communication. We need to overhaul the way in which Irish is taught at primary and second level schools. We must ensure teachers are equipped with the right tools to instil a love of the language for all students. In addition, the curriculum must be designed to inspire students to continue speaking Irish after leaving school. Reinventing the way we teach Irish will encourage more students to engage with it once they leave the classroom.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> The Government's strategy will focus on supporting the development and preservation of the language by a long-term commitment to ensuring its future as a living, spoken language with a firm position in the education system. Such a firm position can be achieved when steps are taken within the strategy. The steps include, for example, the proposal of a new Gaeltacht scholarship scheme to be introduced for primary teachers to attend intensive courses in the Gaeltacht or when the tuition time and attendance of student teachers who attend Gaeltacht courses is increased. These are a few small steps that we can take as part of a much wider framework to ensure the Irish language achieves a much firmer and more sustained position within our education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> I also welcome the series of initiatives and State supports designed to bolster economic activity and entrepreneurship among the Irish-speaking community. The new Irish language and Gaeltacht authority will facilitate the creation of a business network for Gaeltacht and other Irish-language businesses. This network will work to support businesses providing services through Irish in order to raise awareness throughout the business community of the link between the language and economic development.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> We should remember that the Irish language was once spoken the length and breadth of this island. It was once our true native language. In the 21st century, we should seek to increase the number of families throughout the country who use Irish as their daily language of communication. That should be our aim. I commend the Minister of State on all his work on this matter, to date. In the last few years he has become very proficient and fluent in the language. He will encourage other Members to become involved in language tuition.</p>

          <p eId="para_734">I have a little bit of Irish thanks, but we could all do with learning a little more. It is a nice language and many foreigners who have come here appreciate it. I have been surprised by the grasp of, and love for, the language by foreign students in our schools. Some of those students are ten or 11 years old, yet they can speak four or five languages. Some of them are the best Irish speakers in their class at 11 or 12 years of age. We should take note of this because when people love a language they will grasp it.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> Our problem dates back to the educational systems that were in place in bygone days. People either loved or hated the subject, but the model for teaching the language in schools had a big impact on people not grasping or using it as an everyday language.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an seans seo agam cúpla focal gairid a rá faoin straitéis 20 bliain dár dteanga, an Ghaolainn. Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire Stáit. Nuair a chuir an Taoiseach glaoch ar an Teachta McHugh cúpla mí ó shin chun an post mar Aire Stáit um ghnóthaí Gaeltachta a thabhairt dó, bhí a lán daoine ag tabhairt amach nach raibh Gaolainn ró-fhlúirseach aige. Bhí an tAire Stáit i nGaeltacht Mhúscraí cúpla seachtain ó shin agus bhuail sé le han-chuid daoine, idir pháistí, mhúinteoirí agus daoine ag obair i monarachain. Bhuail sé le cumann peile Naomh Abán, cumann peile Chill na Martra agus a lán daoine eile chomh maith. Bhí na daoine go léir lánsásta leis an mblas a bhí ag an Aire Stáit agus an dul chun cinn a bhí déanta aige maidir le labhairt na Gaolainne.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Teachta Coppinger agus tá an ceart aici. Tá grá don Ghaolainn againn go léir ach b'fhéidir nach mbíonn an seans ró-mhinic againn í a labhairt. Bíonn muid saghas intimidated ag na daoine a bhfuil á labhairt gach lá. Is iadsan na daoine is mó a bhí ag tabhairt amach faoin Aire Stáit nuair a bhfuair sé an post. Is dóigh liomsa go bhfuil apology deserved ag an Aire Stáit. Bhí na daoine seo mí-cheart. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí. Sin seanfhocal. Mol an tAire Stáit agus tiocfaidh seisean freisin. Is saghas linguistic imperialism atá ag cuid de na daoine a chuireann eagla ar ghnáthdhaoine nach bhfuil an Ghaolainn ró-mhaith acu. Táimse an-sásta a rá go raibh na daoine as Gaeltacht Mhúscraí lánsásta leis an Aire Stáit agus an blas Gaeilge a bhí aige agus é ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> Bhuail an tAire Stáit le roinnt daoine agus tá siad fós ag fanacht chun chloisteáil uaidh maidir le rudaí ar a labhair siad leis, ina measc cumann peile Naomh Abán. Tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil comórtas peile na Gaeltachta ag teacht go dtí Baile Bhúirne in 2016. Tá deontas á lorg ag an gclub chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh maidir le na dressing rooms atá acu agus cúrsaí eile mar sin. Is dóigh liom go mbeidh an tAire Stáit in ann cuid airgid a thabhairt dóibh. </p>
          <p eId="para_739"> Tá mise cosúil len a lán daoine eile. Tá cúpla focal agam ach is dóigh liom nach bhfuil mé ábalta caint continuously as Gaeilge. There are a few points I would like to make in the context of the strategy which I think are important. Bhí cuid de na daoine eile ag caint faoi education. Tá sé sin an-tábhachtach. Is dóigh liomsa go bhfuil seans an-mhór againn anois language tourism a chur sa straitéis dár dteanga féin, an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge. Tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh grá ag daltaí ár dtír féin don Ghaolainn. Tá a lán daoine ar fud an domhain gurb Éireannaigh iad, a bhfuil a dtuismitheoirí as Éirinn nó atá grandparents acu as Éirinn. Tá timpeall 40 million people in America who claim Irish descent. It is the same in Australia, New Zealand and Canada and on our doorstep in the UK. There is major interest in cultural tourism. Given the success, for example, of the Wild Atlantic Way, we could backfill it. Along that coastline we could also dot Gaeltacht Mhúscraí and Coláiste na Mumhan. Bhuail an tAire Stáit le daoine as Coláiste na Mumham. Is coláiste samhraidh é sin. We should link together the Wild Atlantic Way and language tourism as attractions. We should link in with models which are already well developed such as the Fulbright Scholarship and the Irish Canadian Fund. With a little bit of imagination, we could link in with other universities. I understand Harvard University has an interest in this concept. We could be on to a real winner. We should not just teach in a sterile learning environment like a university lecture theatre. We should bring people into these Gaeltachts and teach the language in the context of the culture of the area. There is tremendous opportunity for this. It should form a key component of the strategy for the Irish language. Economic opportunity in the Gaeltacht consolidates its population and its work opportunities. This is the surest contribution we can make to ensure the language survives and prospers in the Gaeltacht and outwards from the Gaeltacht subsequently. </p>
          <p eId="para_740"> The Minister of State could not have been but impressed, when he visited the Gaeltacht, by the level of local entrepreneurship. We visited the industrial estate in Baile Bhúirne, which has been developed substantially by Údarás na Gaeltachta. I wish to salute, in this Chamber, the efforts over many years of the now retired former board member, Mícheál Ó Scanaill. He made a sterling effort over many years in a quiet, efficient and diligent way to assist and develop the industrial estate. It was not just in Baile Bhúirne, but in Ballingeary and in Cill na Martra also. He contributed to the creation of economic opportunity for local people to find work locally. I do not hear enough recognition of the role of Údarás na Gaeltachta in the context of the Government's efforts to regionalise job opportunities. This is a criticism which needs to be taken on board. Údarás has a significant track record in working in the most peripheral and disadvantaged areas with some considerable success. It needs to be woven into the efforts which are being made to promote industry in the regions. </p>
          <p eId="para_741"> We saw Folláin jams in the Múscraí Gaeltacht are building a fabulous new facility and expanding. On the one hand, we have a food industry such as this. There is also the micro-food industry, Putóg de Róiste, which is also growing and expanding quickly in a short period of time. We have long established companies such as Firebird and new companies such as EuroFoil. This full range of industries in a small local community is a real testimony to the knowledge and skill of the people in Údarás na Gaeltachta. We should tap into this knowledge if we are serious about regional development in difficult areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_742"> Níl mórán ama fágtha agam but to conclude, ba le Naomh Abán an first cruinniú a bhí ag an Aire Stáit agus ba shin an cruinniú is tábhachtaí, is dóigh liomsa, ar an lá sin. Impím ar an Aire Stáit gan dearmad a dhéanamh ar an deontas atá á lorg acu chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh roimh chomórtas peile na Gaeltacht 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> In conclusion, the Minister of State is a great example to all of us who have latent capacity to speak the language. It is regrettable that people abused the Minister of State and criticised him on his appointment. We should not use the language as a badge of exclusivity. We should be much more welcoming and encouraging. There is, as I said at the outset, a latent capacity in all of us, as a result of the drip-drip of the language, to speak it. I could get into the debate on compulsion versus nurture of a loved language. There is a capacity in all of us to speak the language because we all went through the education system, primary and secondary. We probably should be better at it, but we do not get enough opportunity. The Minister of State is an example to everyone of what can be achieved and I wish him continued success in his post.</p>

Gabhaim buíochas le gach duine a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht. Thug 12 Teachta eolas agus moltaí dom sa díospóireacht, as Béarla agus as Gaeilge. Tá cúpla nóiméad agam agus ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le chuile dhuine sa Teach seo, sa Seanad agus taobh amuigh de Theach Laighean faoin bhfíoriarracht a rinneadh ar son na Gaeilge.

Níor tharla an sárobair inniu nó inné. Tharla sí thar na blianta. Cuireadh fíoriarracht isteach sa chlár agus tá clár mór ann. Labhair mé san óráid faoin Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge, faoi na limistéir pleanála agus faoi na líonraí sna ceantair lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht atá Foras na Gaeilge freagrach astu. Tá ról mór ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta Ó Críod. B'fhéidir go bhfuil ról mór againn maidir leis an obair dhearfach a dhéanann sé a chur in iúl do dhaoine. Mar shampla, i mo cheantar féin tá Randox sa Chlocháin Liath. Bhí ceangal mór idir an chomhlacht seo agus Údarás na Gaeltachta agus anois tá Randox ag lorg oibrithe agus tá scéal dearfach ann.</p>

Tá Gaeilge sna ceantair Ghaeltachta agus tá daoine lasmuigh de na ceantair Ghaeltachta le Gaeilge acu. Is é sin an rud is tábhachtaí, go mbeadh na daoine atá Gaeilge acu á húsáid. Ná bí buartha faoi bhotúin. Cinnte déanaimse botúin. Rinne an Teachta Ó Críod cúpla botúin freisin, ach tá sé ag déanamh fíoriarrachta agus is é sin an rud is tábhachtaí.

          <p eId="para_752"> I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_753">This Bill sets out to amend the Constitution to allow the voting age for presidential elections to be lowered to 16 and for the voting franchise in such elections to be extended to citizens in the North of Ireland and to the Irish diaspora throughout the world. These recommendations were put forward by the Constitutional Convention and should now be put before our citizens. </p>
          <p eId="para_754"> Approximately 70 million people around the world claim to be of Irish descent. The Irish influence abroad has been important right down through history. Perhaps the first important impact of Ireland on the world stage was when we sent our learned monks to educate those on the European Continent and further afield during the Dark Ages. Right across Europe, the Irish kept the flame of education and knowledge alive while feudal landlords on the Continent burned down places of learning. When Europeans began arriving on the American Continent, many of those who travelled were of Ulster Scots tradition. Those who made their way across the Atlantic did so to escape penal laws imposed by the British on Ireland which discriminated against dissenting religions such as Presbyterianism. Many of the founding fathers of the United States were of Ulster heritage and it is even believed that some spoke with a distinctive Ulster accent. </p>
          <p eId="para_755"> The next wave of migration from Ireland was spurred on by the disastrous effects of the potato Famine of 1848. From about 1850 onwards, over 1 million people fled Ireland and hunger to find new homes in the United States, Canada, Australia and Britain. Once the floodgates opened, more and more Irish began to leave and it became the cultural norm for all children of a family, except the child who was to inherit the farm, to leave Ireland as soon as they got the opportunity. At one stage New York was a predominantly Irish city, as was Boston and other cities across the United States. To this day, residents in parts of Newfoundland in Canada speak with a distinctly Irish accent. Since the Famine, emigration from Ireland has become part of the fabric of life in many ways. While the early years were dominated by the need to escape hunger and disease, later emigration offered the chance to earn a living and proper wages. Bustling industrial cities around the world were built by Irish labour. The later part of the 20th century saw Irish people emigrate because the opportunities for educated young people were practically non-existent in Ireland. When the economic crash occurred in 2008, the flow from the country returned once again and thousands of our young people have now set up home in Australia, Canada and even the Gulf States. </p>
          <p eId="para_756"> For all the millions of Irish who have emigrated from these shores in the past two centuries, there has never been political representation for them at home. The official policy of the State could be described as "out of sight, out of mind". While at several points throughout our history it has been money sent from abroad which has helped keep our economy afloat, those who were sending the money home were never represented here politically. This Bill offers us an opportunity to change that. </p>
          <p eId="para_757"> At the partition of Ireland, Irish voices north of the Border were silenced. Little opportunity was given to Irish people living in this country to have a voice in the institutions of this State just because they were living north of the Border. The former President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, could not vote in her own election. The impact this had on both parts of this country has been profound. In the North, the Nationalist community was rampantly discriminated against by a Unionist ascendency. Nationalists could not get equal access to jobs or housing and were effectively ghettoised in their own country. The State south of the Border did little or nothing to help this situation. It effectively ignored those living only a few miles up the road and abandoned them to sectarian rule. The impact of northern voices being removed from the southern State has been damaging. The Protestant tradition in Ulster had a proud history of enlightenment, spawning important figures in science, engineering and revolutionary politics through the United Irishmen. The hegemonic State which took hold in Ireland post-1922 might not have happened if we had had the dissenting voices of Ulster properly represented in these Chambers. This Bill proposes to extend the voting franchise for the presidential election to the Six Counties. Some people will say that this is the thin end of the wedge and I would unashamedly say, "Yes, it is the thin end of a wedge". I and my party would argue that all Irish people should be represented in this Parliament and in Áras an Uachtaráin and representation in Áras an Uachtaráin is an important step on that journey. </p>
          <p eId="para_758"> We need to stop paying lip service to young people and start putting faith in them. The youth of today are very switched on to what is happening not just in their own country, but in the wider world. They have a level of access to information unlike that of any previous generation. Therefore, it is a progressive step to lower the voting age in presidential elections to 16. Voter turnout is something I am sure every politician in this Chamber is concerned about and, unfortunately, some of the lowest turnout levels are among young people. A positive step in encourage voting is to develop a pattern of voting among our young. We can get them registered to vote while they are still in school and this should tie into a wider programme of discussing politics and political activity in schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> In the past three weeks, I received two questionnaires from two secondary schools in County Sligo. I do not know if other Deputies and Senators received those questionnaires but they were drawn up by the students. I met and spoke with the students in one of the schools last year and got a tremendous response from them. They showed a keenness to learn more about politics and the political system. In the questionnaire they sent to me, they asked very simple but quite profound questions. When I thought about it, I did not just fill in the answers to the questions or tick the boxes very quickly. The questions prompted me to question whether I had enough respect for those young people who sent me the questionnaire. It relates to whether we consider young people enough in this Parliament, whether we are really concerned about the younger generation, whether we welcome or fear the voices of younger people being put forward and whether we think young people should have a hand in the process of elections and politics in this country. If we were to answer "Yes" to those questions and if we truly respect those young secondary school students, we would have no hesitation in reducing the voting age to 16 initially for presidential elections and subsequently for general elections.</p>

          <p eId="para_760"><b>
						</b>Tá mé sásta bheith ag caint ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. The representation of the diaspora and our citizens in the North is long overdue. The appropriateness of their right to vote in presidential elections has been mentioned and included in the programme for Government of Fine Gael and Labour who talk about being a reforming Government. When the Constitutional Convention was established, the Taoiseach described it as a significant historic event in the political and democratic life of this country which put the people in their proper place at the very heart of the process because it is to them that the Constitution of our country belongs.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> I attended every session of the convention except for one. It was a very uplifting process even though the convention was set up by the Government and did not go as far as Sinn Féin proposed. It did propose serious constitutional changes, including this one, which is to extend voting rights in presidential elections to Irish citizens in the North and the diaspora and those aged 16. The Government then chose to ignore it. It broke the public commitment it made. Instead, it has chosen to put to citizens a referendum on an issue for which there is no public demand or urgency, namely, reducing the age of eligibility for candidates for the presidency to 21. There is no mad rush about doing that. We have a good President at the moment and long may he live healthily. We have a significant number of people scattered throughout the world and the convention proposed that they should be accorded the vote, as should people in the North. </p>
          <p eId="para_762"> The failure to extend voting rights to citizens in the North, where I am from, is the result of a deeply partitionist mindset. Many people there, some of whom spoke at the convention, will feel very let down at this Government's U-turn on this issue. President Michael D. Higgins and former Presidents Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese spoke and acted as Presidents of all of this island. It is not an accident that when Queen Elizabeth II visited the North, the President was there because he is the President of the island of Ireland, not just the Twenty-six Counties, as in some mindsets. That is how our Presidents are regarded by citizens there, even those from a Unionist background. </p>
          <p eId="para_763"> Is féidir le ball fóirne ó Thír Eoghain, Ard Mhacha nó an Dún imirt i gCluiche Ceannais na hÉireann, agus bualadh le hUachtarán na hÉireann, i bPáirc an Chrócaigh ach ní féidir leo vóta a chaitheamh don Uachtarán. Ní raibh muintir Thír Eoghain agus Ard Mhacha in ann vóta a chaitheamh do Mary McAleese nuair a shroich siad Páirc an Chrócaigh agus í ina Uachtarán. Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil sé seo mícheart. If former President Mary McAleese had still been living in her native Belfast at the time of her election, she could not have voted for herself. Martin McGuinness could not have voted for himself. When Tyrone was playing Armagh in Croke Park, neither the President nor the players - All-Ireland competitors and All Stars - had a vote. They were as Irish as anyone in any part of the world. It is very irrational and illogical. Sinn Féin is not just looking for voting rights for republicans or Nationalists. If Unionists want to exercise that right and put forward a Unionist candidate for the presidency, they will also have the right to exercise that entitlement. </p>
          <p eId="para_764"> The decision of the Constitutional Convention to extend voting rights was really important emotionally because it recognised that this convention of citizens from this State recognised that people in the North were part of the nation. The nation is not the State. The nation is the nation. It is wider, bigger and arguably more important than any state. There is a unique historic opportunity to end this disenfranchisement of emigrants and to do something concrete about involving citizens in the North in the political life of this State. During the Good Friday Agreement negotiations and afterwards, I and others negotiated with the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, to allow MPs to come in here to speak on dedicated issues. They could not, of course, vote or use anything other than speaking rights, but the Government of the day reneged on that as well. </p>
          <p eId="para_765"> The two biggest failures of successive Dublin Governments are bound up in the failure to deal with emigration and their willingness to embrace it as a policy option for Government and the failure to end partition or even to have a strategy for ending partition. When a strategy has been devised to end partition under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, we do not even have a Government that is happy to advance that strategy and build upon it. The embracing of emigration has long been the policy of successive Governments because it is a great safety valve. Some 500,000 people out of a tax base of 2.5 million people have been forced to emigrate in eight years; 500,000 potential taxpayers are out of the place. These are bright, committed and mostly young people with significant potential who could be a bulwark against the type of social change and inequality this Government has introduced so it is little wonder it is happy to see young people scattered throughout the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> In 1987, the late Brian Lenihan senior said that we cannot all live on a small island. Why not? It is because Government policy does not allow us all to live on a small island. The argument put forward by successive Governments to account for their failure to deliver on voting rights that citizens abroad do not have sufficient connections with their home country is disgraceful and patently untrue. This is a Government that will say it supports this and the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention and that will travel to the four corners of the world to meet the diaspora to celebrate our national feast day.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Most of the people Ministers will meet would never have left these shores had it not been for the economic policies of this Government and those of the Administrations comprising Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party which preceded it.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> If the Government were serious about bringing our emigrants home, it would give them a stake in the country in the first instance by giving them a vote. There is a new generation of emigrants fighting back. Organisations such as We're Coming Back are actively campaigning for voting rights for the Irish abroad. More than 120 other states have legislated to allow their citizens abroad to cast their votes in elections at home. Once again, we are out of line with the international trend. We all know people who have come here to live and work who vote in elections in their home countries at the appropriate time.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> The Government launched its diaspora policy last week. Next week, Ministers will be highlighting it in various countries throughout the world. It must be noted, however, that they have completely abdicated any responsibility in respect of these crucial issues. When I previously challenged the Taoiseach to review his decisions, he arrogantly claimed that people would be put off - let us face it, the people are stupid - by too many referendums being held on the same day, that they would not understand what was being placed before them, that they would need more time and that, perhaps, they are not that interested in referendums at all. That is the Taoiseach's attitude to the citizens he is supposed to serve in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> We favour a reserved Dáil constituency for citizens in the North and for members of the diaspora. Such an approach would allow the Government to deal with voting rights, with limited disruption to the current electoral system. The Government should now drop all of its lame excuses and deliver voting rights in presidential elections for Irish emigrants, citizens in the North and those citizens aged 16 and upwards, as recommended by the Constitutional Convention.</p>

          <p eId="para_771">Tá an-áthas orm an Bille seo de chuid Shinn Féin a phlé sa Dáil. Léiríonn sé na gnéithe is fearr de chur chuige mo pháirtí. Is iad sin an dóchas, an oscailteacht agus an fháilte roimh shaoránaigh uile na tíre. </p>
          <p eId="para_772"> This Sinn Féin Private Members' Bill represents the very best of that for which the party stands, namely, representation for all citizens of Ireland and openness to and a valuing of our young people and those who have left Ireland in search of work across the globe. We aim to amend Article 2.2 of the Constitution to allow the voting age for presidential elections to be lowered to 16. We also want to introduce votes in presidential elections for citizens in the North and those living beyond the shores of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> In July 2012, the Government established the Constitutional Convention. In September 2013, the convention met to discuss presidential voting rights for citizens resident outside the State and all citizens in the North of Ireland. The result of the ballot vote at the end of the session was that a clear majority of Constitutional Convention members favoured a change to the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections, with 78% in favour, 21% against and 1% undecided. On voting rights being extended to citizens in the North, there was also a clear majority, with 73% in favour, 20% against and 7% undecided. Despite this clear support for an extension of voting rights, the Government has so far failed to bring any report forward to the Dáil and Seanad in this regard. I must admit that I am disappointed - not surprised perhaps - by the statement by An Taoiseach that he feels this issue is one with which the next Government should deal. If that is the case, I hope that he will not be a member of that Government and will thereby be prevented from further fudging the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> Regarding younger voters being welcomed into the electorate, this would increase voter turnout, particularly among those in the 18 to 24 age group. This would help make the Dáil more representative of our younger generation. There is also evidence that a reduction in voting age increases voter turnout in general. This must be viewed as a positive. Across the world there are 115 countries and territories that have varying systems to allow their emigrant citizens the right to vote. We should join this group that extends its franchise, widens its potential and allows all to take part in the democratic process. Many of those to whom I refer in the context of this country have been driven away by the failed policy of nationalising debt and pushing the burden onto all citizens which has been pursued by the current Government and that which preceded it.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> During the past five years, various Governments, including the one currently in office, stood by while 240 people left the State each day. A total of 40,000 people emigrated in the past five years, which is a terrible scandal. We must do more to let them know that their skills, qualities, ambitions and spirit are valued and needed, now more than ever. We must invite them to take part in helping us to build a republic for all who know this island as home. Why would the Government oppose this? These are provisions that enjoy wide popular support and, as already stated, that are available in numerous jurisdictions. Why is the Government opposed to that? The answer is that it is afraid of giving rights to the Irish all across the world and concerned about the response they might receive if they give a voice to those citizens who were effectively exiled. The answer they might hear is that such people are no longer happy with the same old narrow definition of politics and no longer satisfied with the same old dance which, like that in the song "Lanigan's Ball", involves Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil stepping out while the other steps in again.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Ireland has changed. This Bill will help our democracy to change and grow. It will also allow the Irish across the globe to contribute to it. Sinn Féin urges the Government to accept the Bill and ensure its transition through the Houses of the Oireachtas in order that we might hold a referendum that would be of great importance to all the people of Ireland, not least those who have been obliged to leave this island through the years.

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_777">I do not believe there is a single Deputy from a rural constituency who is not well acquainted with the position in respect of emigration or with the loss of our youngest and brightest people as a result of the economic circumstances that prevail. Despite Government spin about a so-called recovery, the available data shows that the number of people in employment in the south west fell by 5,000 last year and that, more significantly, emigration has resulted in a corresponding drop in the number of people available for work. The pain of emigration is not felt only by emigrants. There is a generation of parents and grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews across this State who are grieving for those who have left these shores into find decent work. Wives and children have also been left behind by husbands who have been forced to go abroad in search of work. Not all of those who left were unemployed. However, many were without jobs and many more were involved on those schemes and scams that the Government likes to refer to as "employment" or else they were working in jobs for which they were over-qualified and were, perhaps, on zero-hour contracts. They left to search for work for which they are suitably qualified.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> At my constituency office or when I attend local events, I often speak to the people who have been left behind and I can see that their loss is like a hidden bereavement. When their loved ones go across the sea, the people left behind grieve. The fact that we have been obliged to put up with emigration for generations does not make it any easier. The fact that we are not obliged to wait for the postman to bring a handwritten letter from our loved one across the sea and can see them on a computer screen or send them a text does not mean that we are not suffering their loss. The fervent wish of families left at home and of most of those who go away is that they will return. However, we all know that even with the best will in the world, people lose touch because of the thousands of miles separating them from home.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> One of the factors that contributes to this separation is the fact that people who leave also become distant from the political process in their homeland. Citizens should be encouraged to remain in contact with all aspects of life at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Families who want their relatives to come home try to keep them in touch with the local GAA team and on how things are doing in the home place, partly to keep them engaged in the political process. One of the most popular ways of keeping people in touch is by means of local newspapers, which people send abroad to keep relatives in touch with events happening in their community at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> Involvement is an important part of maintaining the relationship with home. Involvement in public life is good for emigrants and for those of us left at home without them. It is unfair that going abroad means automatic disenfranchisement. The Government has set about appointing a Minister with responsibility for the diaspora, but has not taken what would seem to be the natural step of upholding the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention, which recommended that Irish citizens would have the right to vote in presidential elections. That is surprising given that the convention is composed of members from all political parties, among others, and that it offered unanimous support to bring about such a measure. The extension of the franchise to Irish citizens abroad is a popular recommendation of the Constitutional Convention. On seeing that, a good Government would lead from the front and implement the recommendations, but as with many aspects of its work, the Government is being dragged forward by citizens at home and abroad who are now disappointed by the lack of willingness to restore their right to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> Extending the vote to all Irish citizens overseas and those living in the North will strengthen Irish democracy. As previous speakers have said, in recent years approximately 500,000 mostly young people have emigrated to Australia, the United States of America, across the water to the United Kingdom, and to many other areas. Let us compare the situation with rights afforded to emigrants from other countries. More than 120 nations have extended voting rights to their emigrants. They include 36 European countries, 21 African countries, 13 in the Americas and 15 Asian countries. When one contrasts that with what we have not done, it is an embarrassment for any Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Other countries seem to have no fear of keeping their emigrants close. Some countries even have created constituencies in their national parliaments for their citizens living abroad. Such constituencies then go on to represent the interests of the diaspora. All the representative organisations for emigrants are in favour of extending voting rights in presidential elections and people at home are in favour of it. It is time the Government responded to the call of the people to implement voting rights for our citizens in presidential elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> The link between citizenship and political representation is one of the most fundamental principles of democracy. We see how Irish citizens in Britain - members of the Irish community - can vote in Britain but not in Ireland. British citizens living in Ireland can vote in Irish elections and are also entitled to register as overseas voters to participate in British elections. The law as it stands creates a second class of Irish citizenship for the Irish in Britain and in other parts of the world as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> Prior to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, we had a constitutional claim to jurisdiction of the Six Counties, yet following the implementation of the Agreement - some aspects of it have yet to be implemented - there has been a denial of the right of people who live there to vote in presidential elections. As Deputy Adams said, we would like the Unionist tradition to field a candidate and for all those in the North to have such voting rights. It is part of what the Good Friday Agreement is all about, namely, creating harmonisation within the island of Ireland and also giving equal rights to everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> One must also take into account the more than half a million people who have left this country since the beginning of the recession. While the State failed citizens miserably for a considerable time, it continues to fail them by denying them the right to vote in elections on this island. In the 1930s, Peadar O'Donnell said more than half a million people had left in similar circumstances because of the economic situation in the country. Most of those people hardly ever returned. They left behind a lot of pain and suffering, yet they had no political connection to the State. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, will take on board what has been said. If he does not wish to listen to Sinn Féin, at least he should listen to the Constitutional Convention, some of whose members are members of his party, which has made the same recommendation. The motion offers an opportunity to the Government. It would be a tremendous statement to those people whom the Government and previous Governments have failed by creating an economic collapse that has forced so many to leave this country. I hope the Minister of State will take on board everything that has been said. I commend the Sinn Féin Party on tabling the motion. I welcome the support of everybody in this House to bring about what we seek.</p>

          <p eId="para_787">On the weekend of 28 and 29 September 2013, the Constitutional Convention held its sixth plenary meeting to discuss presidential voting rights for citizens resident outside the State at Irish embassies or otherwise. The convention considered a huge volume of submissions from members of the public and heard presentations from experienced academic and legal experts. Advocacy groups of the Irish communities in Australia, Germany, France, Canada and the United States of America also participated and contributed. The session on the North of Ireland also heard a number of detailed insights from convention members from the Stormont Assembly, including Martin McGuinness and other contributors from across the North. The result of the ballot vote at the end of the meeting was that a clear majority of 78% of convention members favoured a change to the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> On voting rights being extended to citizens in the North, a clear majority of 73% was in favour. Indeed, even President Michael D. Higgins stated during his own election campaign that voting rights should be extended to those living abroad. In a speech at the London Irish Centre, he said members of the diaspora had made "a central contribution to the development of our country", and that their voices should be heard at the polls. He suggested that people already on the electoral register should be able to vote in "some or all of our elections" for five or ten years after leaving Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> The right to vote in presidential elections should be extended to general elections as well. More than 106 other states, including Italy, Australia, the USA, the Dominican Republic and Ghana, allow their citizens an overseas vote. Britain actively encourages its citizens to vote from overseas. These states not only correctly realise political engagement is essential if they intend to benefit economically from their diaspora, but also recognise that emigrants continue to be citizens of their nations and deserve to have a say in the directions taken. Our Government, in contrast, seems to distrust emigrants. There is no impetus or willingness to give citizens voting rights in general elections either. Could that be because the Government fears the huge numbers forced to emigrate from our shores might not vote favourably for those implementing the very policies that forced them to leave? Something will have to give sooner or later. Today's Irish abroad, especially the younger generation, are too politically aware to continue accepting that their voices remain unheard while most other EU nations are allowed theirs.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The reality is that emigrant voting is now an international democratic norm. The Government must face up to this reality and facilitate political participation for all citizens. Despite the convention recommending that the Government would legislate and hold a referendum on presidential voting rights for all citizens resident outside the State, the Government has failed to bring any report to the Dáil and Seanad in this regard. It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to say now that the issue of presidential voting rights is for the next Government to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">It is ludicrous that the system does not allow for citizens in the North to participate in presidential elections. As a former holder of the Office of President, Ms Mary McAleese was eligible to stand for election as President to represent all the people of Ireland, yet remains unable to vote in any presidential election since leaving office. This is a monumental contradiction which requires constitutional change. On 3 March last, following public consultation, the Government launched a new global diaspora policy, which fails to address the issue of presidential voting rights in a substantive manner and does not instil confidence that the issue will be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> Jennie McShannon of Irish in Britain, which represents more than 100 Irish community and voluntary organisations across the United Kingdom, stated that not allowing emigrants who had moved abroad to look for work to vote amounted to "disenfranchisement which ought to end." Ms McShannon added:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_793">We want to play our part, make a difference. So many have such a real stake, including houses and families here at home. If citizenship means anything in a democracy, it means the right for all adults to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The chairwoman of the Votes for Irish Citizens Abroad campaign, Mary Hickman, speaking to the Constitutional Convention in 2013, stated that while a vote for Irish citizens abroad in presidential elections would be welcome, emigrant citizens should also be given a say in Dáil elections. She added:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_795">This issue of emigrant citizens voting in general elections isn't going to go away. It is the avenue, the gateway, for a far better balanced relationship between the Irish nation and its diaspora.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">It is time the Government moved forward on both issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">This is a short and significant Bill. It is significant for citizens resident inside and outside the State. There are few more important matters than the right to vote. It goes to the core of our democratic system and society. Debating this Bill tonight is timely as it follows on from the Government's recent announcements on diaspora policy. The debate allows us all - Government and Opposition Deputies - the opportunity to address fundamental issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> The Government recognises the importance of voting rights for our diaspora. The Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, spoke about this issue when he launched the new diaspora policy last week and discussed it again in the Seanad yesterday evening. While the Government will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage, before progressing it through further Stages of the legislative process, the full range of practical and policy issues that will arise in extending the franchise, as proposed in the Bill, must be analysed. The analysis required will be undertaken by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in co-operation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> What are the issues to be analysed and evaluated before a Bill proposing such a significant amendment to the Constitution should be passed in the Oireachtas and put to the people for decision? It would be useful to outline these issues in order that there is a good understanding of the work that has to be undertaken. They come under two broad headings, namely, the minimum age for voting and the extension of the franchise in presidential elections to citizens resident outside the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> The Bill provides for a lowering of the voting age in presidential elections to 16 years and provides for all citizens resident outside the State to have the right to vote in a presidential election. The existing position is that all citizens over the age of 18 years who are registered to vote and residing in the State may vote at a presidential election. The age requirement of 18 years applies across the board to all other elections and referendums.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> Let us first reflect on the proposal to reduce the voting age to 16 years. Last month, Deputies had an opportunity to debate a Bill introduced by Deputy Brian Stanley which proposed that the voting age in general should be reduced to 16 years. The Government did not oppose the Bill on its Second Stage reading because we had agreed in 2013 that a referendum should be held on the proposal to reduce the voting age to 16 years. However, for the reasons outlined by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, during the debate on the Bill, it would be premature to proceed with a referendum on the voting age in May of this year. Essentially, the impact of lowering the voting age across the policy spectrum requires further consideration before the proposal is put to the people in a referendum. The issues arising and potential impacts were discussed and considered by many of the contributors to the debate on 6 February last.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> It is useful to remind the House of some of the main points made by the Government side in the debate on Deputy Stanley's Bill. While made in the context of the voting age generally, they clearly also apply to the proposal in the presidential voting Bill to lower the voting age to 16 years for presidential elections. First, a careful examination of the implications of lowering the voting age is needed. The Government indicated that this examination would be undertaken in preparing the relevant legislation. This work is under way but has not yet been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> The age of majority, the age at which a person is recognised as being an adult, is 18 years. The work we are doing is focused on the possible issues that could arise for other legislation or age-related schemes or initiatives. International experience and available research on lowering the voting age to 16 years is also being examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> Questions have been raised about the wisdom of setting the voting age at 16 years when the age of majority is 18 years. We need to weigh up the argument that a change in the voting age could lead to a demand for a lowering of the age threshold in other areas. Legislation in the spheres of most direct influence on the affairs of the younger population, namely, the areas of education and children and youth affairs, defines a child as a person under the age of 18 years. A number of examples of the dichotomy this presents were noted in the debate last month. For example, parents or guardians would continue to have specific rights and responsibilities for their children aged under 18 years in the education system, while the same young persons could vote at 16 years. Other examples can be found in the social welfare system, where the minimum age for entitlement and access to most social welfare schemes is 18 years. Sales of tobacco and alcohol are also linked to a requirement that the purchaser be 18 years. Clearly, these matters need to be thought through thoroughly before progressing any referendum on lowering the voting age.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> It is also interesting to note from the debate last month the different international experiences in countries where the voting age was reduced to 16 years. Many of the points aired in this respect emerged from the consideration given to this matter by the Convention on the Constitution established by the Government. Only one country in the European Union, Austria, provides for voting by 16 year olds in national elections. Other European countries allow 16 years olds to vote in sub-national elections at local or regional level. Not surprisingly, much of the research in this area was undertaken in Austria where a positive link was found between lowering the voting age and participation rates. The Austrian research also found that schools were particularly important in influencing political interest. On the other hand, studies in the United Kingdom, Norway and Australia came to different conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> While there is no international consensus on the impact of lowering the voting age, an important dimension of any decision to do so would involve the education system. Education can play an important role in generating the interest and maturity required among younger people that would be necessary to make a success of a decision to lower the voting age. This was borne out in the recent Scottish referendum where the voting age was lowered to 16 years. Research subsequently undertaken in Scotland revealed that the level of interest among young people was equivalent to those of adults. The decisive factor, however, was the link to education.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> The second dimension to the Bill is the proposal that all Irish citizens, irrespective of their place of residence, be given the right to vote at presidential elections. This is a matter to which the Government has given consideration in the context of our diaspora policy, Global Irish - Ireland's Diaspora Policy, launched by the Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade just last week. This is the first ever statement of policy on diaspora issues. The connection to our global family remains central to Government policy. Representation was a key theme running through the submissions that were received as part of the consultation process for this new policy. The appointment last July of a Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs goes some way towards recognising this demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> In launching the policy last week, the Minister of State outlined the Government's position on voting rights for the diaspora. He acknowledged that the issue of voting rights is of enormous importance to many citizens abroad and noted that the topic was frequently raised with him in his direct engagement with the Irish diaspora over many years, as well as more recently in his role as Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> As Deputies will be aware, the issue of voting rights for citizens resident outside the State was also considered by the Convention on the Constitution. The convention, in its fifth report, recommended that citizens resident outside the State should have the right to vote in presidential elections. The Government has recently considered this recommendation and has decided that it is necessary to analyse the full range of practical and policy issues that would arise in any significant extension of the franchise before any decision could be made on the holding of a referendum. This is the responsible approach to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> Clearly, an extension of voting rights to citizens resident outside of the State would be welcomed by many in the diaspora. It would allow them to deepen their engagement with Ireland and to play a more active role in Irish society. It would further the wider goal of enhancing diaspora engagement. However, it would be challenging to introduce and manage. I am keen to share with Deputies some of the issues that need to be considered before the Bill could progress through the further stages of the legislative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> An amendment of the Constitution would be required to enable citizens who are not resident in the State to vote at presidential elections. Deputy Adams proposes that all such citizens should be given this right, as did the Constitutional Convention. However, having regard to the sheer potential numbers involved, this requires careful consideration and analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> It will be necessary to consider which citizens resident outside the State should be entitled to vote in presidential elections. It is not uncommon for countries to set limits, usually time limits, on the right to vote of citizens resident outside the State. The following questions arise for us to consider. Should all citizens resident outside the State have the right, as proposed in this Bill? Should it be passport holders? Should it be citizens who are absent from the State for a period? If so, what period would be appropriate? Would it be five, ten or 20 years, for example? Should it be for citizens born on the island of Ireland or confined to citizens previously registered to vote in the State? This is not an exhaustive list of questions that arise when considering this issue but we must consider the numbers involved when making decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> The wider Irish diaspora is estimated to stand at 70 million people. This must be a particular consideration in any decision to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections. While those persons who are part of the Irish diaspora only through heritage and cultural connections would not be entitled to Irish citizenship, all others would. The number of those among the 70 million who are entitled to Irish citizenship is simply unknown. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has estimated conservatively that 1.65 million Irish citizens, inclusive of those born in Ireland and abroad, are resident abroad. The number could be far greater. Many who would be entitled to citizenship but have not taken up that entitlement are not included in that figure. Adding the conservative 1.65 million figure to Northern Ireland's population of 1.8 million gives an estimated potential 3.5 million citizens resident outside the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> I have adverted already to the diaspora policy and to voting rights in that context. However, any consideration of extending the presidential election franchise to Irish citizens overseas would have to include people resident in Northern Ireland. This Bill and the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention embrace all citizens resident outside the State. The implications for Northern Ireland would differ from other parts of the world where the numbers of Irish persons potentially eligible to vote in a presidential election would only be a small percentage of the total population of the host country. By contrast, in Northern Ireland the potential electorate would be sizeable given Northern Ireland's current population of approximately 1.8 million and an electorate of more than 1.24 million, the vast majority of whom have a birthright to Irish citizenship. Evidently, this would present significant practical challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> It remains the case that in the House of Lords at Westminster there are hereditary peers whose titles and seats are derived from places in this jurisdiction. For many, this is a sensitive issue. In addition, Ireland and Northern Ireland have a unique constitutional relationship since the Good Friday Agreement and any examination of the franchise would need to be considered fully in that context. This would include considering the political sensitivities there may be about legislating for the electorate in the North to vote in an election in this jurisdiction as well as the need to ensure that any proposal is fully consistent with the State's recognition of the current constitutional status of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> More generally, extending the franchise at presidential elections to citizens resident outside the State will give rise to a range of practical operational matters to be considered. Arrangements made for voting by citizens resident outside the State must be workable. Let us reflect on some of the issues arising and take a closer look at the registration of new voters as well as the methods of voting that might be made available to citizens resident outside the State. Voter registration in Ireland is undertaken on an annual basis by local authorities, acting as registration authorities, for eligible persons who are ordinarily resident in their administrative areas. New arrangements would have to be put in place for the registration of citizens resident outside the State. Such arrangements would have to be robust to ensure the integrity of the ballot. Options would need to be explored. For example, one option might be to allow for registration in the area in which the citizen last resided in the State or the area where the citizen or his parent or grandparent was born. However, this would not be feasible for Northern Ireland Irish citizens. New and separate arrangements for their registration as voters at an election in the State would need to be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> Many countries provide for registration of out-of-country voters at the embassy or consulate in their country of residence. Whether this option would be appropriate would depend on the method of voting put in place for citizens resident outside the State. There is no escaping the fact, however, that compiling and maintaining voter registers at diplomatic missions could have resource implications, in particular, in countries with significant Irish populations.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> There are of course many ways of facilitating voting by citizens resident outside the State. These include voting in person at diplomatic missions or other designated places, postal voting or e-voting. Voting in person at embassies or consular offices or in other designated places is common throughout the world. This approach would have an attraction where there is a large concentration of citizens living in the vicinity of the mission. However, it makes no allowance whatsoever for countries where Ireland has no embassy or for countries where citizens might have to travel long distances to cast a vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> Postal voting is another option. Voting by post is not considered to be as secure as voting in person at a diplomatic mission in the presence of state officials. However, if postal services are reliable, the method, while still incurring significant costs for the State, may not be as costly as setting up polling stations in other jurisdictions. Moreover, it has the potential to ensure a wider coverage of voters than in-person voting. Careful consideration would need to be given to any e-voting options given the relatively recent Irish experience with electronic voting.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> I will conclude by referring briefly to our diaspora policy. The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, will speak on the matter presently but suffice it for me to say that some of the commentary has tended to overlook the great strides that have been taken in advancing our diaspora policy. Significant measures are being taken to recognise the importance of our diaspora and we should not overlook these in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> The focus of the Bill is extending the franchise in presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State, and the Government is not opposing the Bill. However, we firmly believe that a proposal to amend the Constitution should be accompanied by a full and considered analysis of the implementation proposals. The potential consequences of the amendment and the estimated costs arising need to be fully analysed and considered in a responsible way as well. This work will be undertaken before the Bill progresses through the further stages of the legislative process.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_822">While the focus tonight is on the Bill before the House and while this is of course an important issue, some of the commentary has tended to overlook the great strides that have been taken in advancing our diaspora policy. As the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, said, it is only a week since our first statement of policy on diaspora issues was published. I am pleased to have the document before me. It has been widely received in a positive way by countries throughout the world and by all the interested parties in Ireland as well. The document outlines some significant measures that are being taken to recognise the importance of our diaspora and these should not be overlooked in the debate about extending the franchise.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> For example, communications was a key theme running through the submissions received during the consultation process for the diaspora policy. To help Irish people abroad stay in touch with home and their heritage, a new resource in the form of an online portal on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website was launched in conjunction with the policy. The portal provides signposts for Irish people and people of Irish descent and affinity to information that might be helpful to them in their lives overseas or for those thinking of coming home. The portal and a new Irish newsletter, which users can sign up for on the portal, are the first steps in improving our communications with the diaspora.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">In addition, RTE recently launched a video-on-demand service for the Irish diaspora, RTE Player International. This online service will offer over 500 hours of indigenous Irish content. Users can access over 100 hours of free content, refreshed daily, and the full content offering of 500 hours will be accessible through a small monthly subscription. RTE Player International is RTE's second dedicated Irish diaspora service, following the very successful launch of GAAGO last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> Emigration has always been a feature of the Irish experience. However, the nature of that experience has changed over the years. While previous generations departed in the knowledge that they might never see their homes or families again, today we have other means of keeping in touch. Despite this, the challenges involved in starting life in a new country are daunting and are faced by many Irish every day. We are very conscious of these challenges and are committed to keeping welfare at the heart of the Government's engagement with the diaspora. As part of the diaspora policy, a Global Irish Civic Forum will be convened in Dublin to bring together diverse organisations from around the world that are facing similar challenges but are not yet connected to each other. It will also provide a valuable opportunity to hear perspectives from the ordinary Irish emigrant. This forum will take place on 3 and 4 June of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> The Government is in a position to assist many of these groups through emigrant support programme funding. In 2014, almost €12 million was provided to organisations supporting Irish emigrants in making the best lives possible in their countries of residence. This brings support to emigrants through the emigrant support programme to over €125 million since the programme was established in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> There is also tremendous support provided from within the community to those Irish who find themselves in difficult situations, or at times of illness or bereavement. A powerful spirit of community and solidarity can be witnessed in Irish communities across the world, and our network of embassies and consulates around the world works with and alongside these communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> The diaspora are not a homogenous group, and our new diaspora policy acknowledges this, with a range of new initiatives to help us connect with as many of the diaspora as possible. We are finalising the details of a new global media fund to support media coverage of diaspora and emigration-related experience, which will broaden our engagement with the diaspora and increase awareness of the Irish people overseas. We will build better and stronger links with alumni from Irish institutions, both Irish graduates overseas and international students who have studied here, as they have enormous potential for the institutions and for Ireland as a whole. In 2015 we will launch an alumni challenge fund to provide seed funding to new collaborative initiatives by Irish institutions to target their Irish and non-Irish graduates working internationally. We are also open to receiving proposals on how to connect with new diaspora communities to help the Irish there retain their identity. This policy will evolve. Our Global Irish portal will evolve to meet the needs of our emigrant population and the entire policy will be reviewed after two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> Earlier today I held the first meeting of the interdepartmental group, which brings together stakeholders across the public system to ensure that our policy on the diaspora represents a joined-up, whole-of-government approach, taking account of all of the issues facing emigrants before they leave, while they are away and when they return. I am delighted that we have in place, for the first time, a comprehensive statement of our policy that is relevant to all who make up our diverse diaspora around the world - the global Irish.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> The Minister of State, Deputy Nash, referred to the motion in depth. The Constitutional Convention was very strong on this issue. The Cabinet considered it and I issued a statement last week in conjunction with the publication of the diaspora policy. The line Minister is Deputy Alan Kelly. He, with the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and myself will meet immediately to discuss how we can advance the proposal. We have to look at the logistics, who is eligible to vote, where they will vote and how they will vote, which was all dealt with by the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, in his contribution. In order to get to the next stage, we have to make that consideration. We have learned with two recent referendums that if we put a referendum to the people the mechanics of which we cannot explain fully, as happened with the referendums on the Seanad and on compellability of witnesses in Dáil investigations, or if there is a doubt about it, it will be rejected by the people. We want to go to the people with what we propose being very clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> I would also remind the House that the next presidential election is in 2018, so there is plenty of opportunity to prepare properly for it before we go to a referendum. I am on record in the House as saying I am very much in favour of extending the franchise to our citizens overseas in whatever form. However, we have to approach it very carefully and properly. As well as that, our President is a very important person. It is not just a ceremonial function. The President is head of our armed forces, for example, and signs into law all the Bills that come through this House. The President is recognised all over the world as our Head of State. When President Higgins went to the UK, for example, we saw the recognition he got. In the past, Taoisigh may have visited the UK, but a President is different and is received in a different way all over the world as our Head of State. It is a very important position, and that is something we have to consider very seriously when we are moving to a referendum of the people. The people would want to know for sure who would vote, who is on the register of electors, how that is decided on and where will they vote. That is all very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> I welcome this opportunity to address the matter. As the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, said, the Government is not opposing this motion, which will give us an opportunity to consider not only the issue of voting but also other issues. I am open to further consideration of the diaspora policy, which, as I said, is an evolving policy. It is a work in progress and is building on the work already done by previous Governments. For example, the emigrant support programme and the Irish abroad unit, which were set up under Deputy Cowen's brother back in 2004 when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, have proven very successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> There are several issues apart from the voting issue, but this has obviously exercised people's minds. Among the people I have come in contact with around the world, it is an issue for some but not for all. Nonetheless, it is a very important issue for some. I can see how this would connect people back to Ireland and give them a feeling that they had a say in what was happening in Ireland. Apart from a vote in presidential elections, which requires a constitutional referendum, there is also the proposal to provide three seats in the Seanad to members of our diaspora, something I have supported in the past in this House, with one seat for the Americas, one for Europe and one for Australia and the rest of the world. There is a very strong proposal from the Irish in Britain that was sent in to the Chairman of the committee set up to look at Seanad reform, the former Senator Maurice Manning. That is a real and important consideration and, under the next Government, this could probably be done by nomination if we do not have a process in place for electing Senators directly.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> In conclusion, I thank Sinn Féin for tabling the motion, which gives us all an opportunity to reflect on diaspora policy. I sincerely hope the Opposition will acknowledge that this is the first comprehensive policy that has ever been produced. I hope they would be magnanimous enough to do that and then to move on to the other challenges we have to deal with regarding our diaspora and how we communicate and connect with them.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_327">
          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_835">Fianna Fáil supports the proposal of the Constitutional Convention to extend voting rights to Irish citizens abroad and in Northern Ireland for presidential elections. We must acknowledge the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, and I belatedly congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well in his role. I want to further acknowledge that since he has taken up that role, like many Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade before him, he has engaged and consulted widely with the diaspora, various stakeholders, immigrant support groups and successful entities, bodies and companies which have Irish backgrounds and are very committed to Irish projects in terms of the assistance they can provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> It is, as he said, the next step, following the initiatives of predecessors since 2004 and the various support groups put in place to help stakeholders and those who assisted the Irish abroad in various locations throughout the world. There is much to be welcomed in the policy. It is important that it was formulated in the manner in which it has been - that is, a statement of intent by Government to initiate the various issues that have been brought to its attention not only in the recent past but over many years. It probably does not go far enough. However, I accept the good faith and intentions of those who helped to bring it to this stage, insofar as they can now consult the rest of the Government and its various agencies and Departments with a view to addressing the issues that various representative groups of the Irish diaspora throughout the world have cited.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> There was a call for another consultative report on extending the vote, citing complexities from legal and administrative perspectives. That may be construed by many to be disingenuous to the very group it seeks to assist. The Government has to instill more confidence in the House and, by association, the general public of its intent in this regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_838"> We have reservations about the proposal in the Bill to extend the vote for presidential elections to all citizens who are 16 years of age. Given that only citizens over 18 years of age can currently vote for the President, the question of the rights of citizens abroad or in Northern Ireland is separate and deserving of consideration on its own terms, without being muddled with the question of the voting age. While there is merit in reducing the voting age, it should be done for elections in Ireland before it is tried abroad. </p>
          <p eId="para_839"> At the establishment of the Constitutional Convention, the Government committed to respond to its various reports by way of ministerial statements to the Dáil within four months of the receipt of a report. In this case, that deadline has been missed and no Dáil debate has taken place. Instead, we have been told in the Government's new report that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_840">An extension of voting rights to Irish citizens outside the State would be challenging to introduce and manage. A range of issues will arise in this context, including policy, legal and practical issues. For example, a key policy issue is the precise eligibility for any extended franchise. Ireland has a large number of citizens resident outside the State and generous conditions for passing that citizenship down through the generations, including to those who have never visited or engaged with Ireland. There are also significant practical issues which must be given due consideration. The Government has decided, therefore, that the matter is to be given to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in cooperation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Diaspora Affairs to analyse the policy, legal and practical issues arising and to report back to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Yet again it could be construed that the Government is ignoring the demands of Irish citizens abroad and in Northern Ireland for recognition from the Irish State. It could well be construed that the report is patronising towards many of these citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Elements that are absent from the policy document published this week are the setting of targets or deadlines for reporting back so that the document's contents can be analysed and seen to be working or not. In many other reports, no matter how much we might disagree with them across various areas or Departments, there has been a commitment to adjudicate on progress at regular intervals, determine what achievements have been met and set targets. That is lacking in this report, and I ask the Minister of State to consider an extension in order to set targets, deadlines and timeframes by which some results could be analysed.</p>

          <p eId="para_844">Maybe that could be divided into three different reviews of the various elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> With regard to the call for another consultative report with reference to issues of complexity, this is something we have had ample time to analyse and consider, and I am sure it was debated during the period of negotiation, consultation and engagement with the diaspora and its representatives abroad since the Minister of State came into office. </p>
          <p eId="para_846"> When the economic crisis began to pinch, we were quick to look to the diaspora for a helping hand through The Gathering and the Global Irish Economic Forum, which was of major benefit to all concerned, including the tourist, industrial and scientific sectors and many others. We are happy, as usual, to wear the green and shuffle up to Irish communities around the world on St. Patrick's Day for the access it gives us to political and business leaders around the world. We acknowledge and pay tribute to that, and we milk it for all it is worth, to the envy of many of our competitors throughout the world. </p>
          <p eId="para_847"> We have tried to engage more with Irish abroad by creating a new role for the Minister of State, that of responsibility for the diaspora, which has to be seen as more than an optical illusion. In order to gain the trust, support and commitment of the Irish diaspora, there must be a better effort to allow for those who wish to be eligible to vote in a presidential election to be facilitated. I acknowledge that the Government does not oppose the Bill, which leads one to believe that there is an intention to follow through on the commitments it made in this regard. It is important that concrete measures be put in place to adjudicate on that commitment. </p>
          <p eId="para_848"> In his first trip to New York last November in his current role, the Minister of State told an Irish-American audience that the right to vote in presidential elections would be confirmed by the start of 2015. He said he saw no reason the vote could not be extended to Seanad elections and that the diaspora might eventually be allowed to vote in Dáil elections.</p>

          <p eId="para_858">That must be emphasised. It was mentioned that the Government is examining the French model, where seats are reserved in parliament for nationals living abroad, with the promise that Irish citizens living abroad would be given a vote very shortly. We acknowledge the commitment is progressing, no matter how slowly it may be doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> It is over a year since the Constitutional Convention recommended that a referendum be held on extending voting rights in presidential elections to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and Irish emigrants. Despite the Oireachtas resolution establishing the convention and the four-month timeframe in which the Government had to respond to the recommendations, it has not happened in this case. That is despite the fact that were it not for the putting down of this Bill by the Sinn Féin Party, we would not be talking about the issue tonight. Reports of the Constitutional Convention are particularly important as it was made up of 66 ordinary citizens who gave their time for no personal reward and engaged, in good faith, with politicians in a process of deliberation. We owe it to them at least to allow a Dáil debate on the merits of the recommendations, as has been promised by the Government, as opposed to me or anybody on this side of the House. Why have they not been given the courtesy of that hearing, having conducted some hard work deliberating on the matter? It should be discussed in the national Parliament as promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> The final report indicates that the convention made several constitutional recommendations in important areas, such as giving voting rights to citizens abroad. Instead, we are going to use the opportunity of a referendum to discuss leadership qualities and debate whether a 21 year old can be President of Ireland. The Government took the easy option by dealing with only one tricky topic at a time. The marriage equality issue must be answered, as we acknowledge, but the decision on the minimum age for a President is only an illusion, as I stated earlier. If we are serious about making politics and the presidency more relevant, engaging the multitude of young Irish who have emigrated in Irish politics by giving them a stake in who is elected to the office should surely be of higher priority than reducing the minimum age for presidential candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> In an international context, it is important to read into the record the position in many other countries throughout the world. A 2006 study from the Institute for Democratic and Electoral Assistance of countries that allowed emigrants to vote included the findings that 21 African nations do so, as well as 13 North American and South American countries, 15 Asian countries, six Pacific countries and 36 European countries. Of these countries, 65 allow external votes for everybody, while approximately 25 place restrictions based on factors such as whether a person intends to return permanently or how long people have been away. Citizens from the US can vote no matter how long they stay away, whereas citizens of Britain are disqualified after 15 years away. There is form and a wide range of experience that can be drawn on from those countries which have engaged successfully in the practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> With regard to the limitations in voting ages, my concern is that given Irish citizens must currently be 18 to vote for a President, we do not support extending the right to vote to all 16 year olds. As I stated earlier, there is merit in reducing the voting age but it should be done in Irish elections before it is trialled abroad in the first instance. A number of other limitations could be considered to address the fears expressed about the disruptive impact in the short term on presidential elections, including limiting the number of expatriates to those who were born in Ireland. That would reduce the potential disruptive impact on expanded voting rights. Expatriates should vote in the Irish Embassy of a country in order to limit numbers and there should be a time limit related to the last point at which the person resided in Ireland. For example, it could be as it is in the UK at 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> I thank the proposers for putting forward this Bill, which is timely, considering the Minister produced his own policy document in the area this week. Although it did not contain the commitment to extend voting rights, it demonstrates a willingness to do so. The exact weight of the willingness can only be measured in time. I hope the Government will use more stringent timeframes and measures to analyse what progress, if any, is being made in the area. Only then can we begin to properly criticise the Government for inaction in the area. There are many other issues within diaspora policy that one would welcome. As I indicated, it is a natural progression from the extension of the emigrant support programme established in 2004, as the Minister of State alluded to. I hope this can be expanded and more funding can be allowed by the Government to assist these people. I also hope every effort will be made to encourage many of those who I hope will be successful in returning to the country to partake in its recovery over time.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">I wish to share time with Deputies Thomas Pringle, Finian McGrath and Michael Fitzmaurice.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> The right to vote is one of the most fundamental political rights of citizens. It is part of the fabric of democracy and when people are disenfranchised of that right in other countries that are not democratic, we are up in arms. Nevertheless, we disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of our citizens around the world. Very many of those lost the right to vote through no fault of their own because they had to leave the country in which they were born. Some Irish have no voting rights despite the fact that approximately 150 countries have systems in place to allow emigrants to vote. It is interesting that even countries with high rates of emigration, like Italy and Mexico, have recently allowed expatriates to vote. I am speaking in broader terms, and I support the motion, but Irish citizens should have the right to vote in all elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> It is interesting that in 2006, a study of countries that allowed emigrants to vote included 21 African countries, 13 North American and South American countries, 15 Asian countries and 36 European countries. Astoundingly, we are not in that group of countries and we have not even considered over the past number of years the rights of citizens. I was recently in London on behalf of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, which is chaired by Deputy Dominic Hannigan. We met representatives of an organisation that was the voice of Irish people seeking the right to vote. They made very compelling reasons and it was astounding how up to date they were on politics in Ireland. They explained that many people, particularly those who are relatively young - perhaps aged from 18 to 30 years or 35 to 40 years - had no choice about leaving the country but still wanted a say in how the country is run. They do not have that say, which is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> The European Commission had indicated that citizens should not lose their right to vote in national elections when they move to another state. It is inevitable that there will have to be a debate in the Oireachtas on the rights of hundreds of thousands of disenfranchised Irish citizens who want to have a say in the politics of their country. When we were in London, the point was made that we have elections in Ireland where sometimes 40% of people do not bother to vote. The percentage of people who do not vote is certainly in the region of 30% when there is a low turnout. There are highly educated people whose families lived in the country for generations and they want a say; they are willing to vote but cannot have their say, which is appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">I most certainly support this Bill and would like to have more time to speak on it but I need to allow other speakers contribute. I am glad the Government is not opposing it because it is worthwhile and very well put together. It is inevitable that we will come back to the fact that the European Commission has said it is wrong not to allow our citizens who have left the country to vote in all elections.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_869">I am pleased to speak in support of this legislation which proposes to extend the franchise in the presidential election to all Irish citizens, regardless of where they live, and to lower the voting age to 16 for all citizens in the presidential election. The Convention on the Constitution has debated extending the franchise to all citizens for the presidential election. The convention teased it out and voted in favour of it and gave it to the Government to consider. I am amazed by the difficulties in its implementation the Minister outlined in his speech. It is amazing that 150 countries allow non-resident citizens vote if it is so difficult and there are so many considerations prior to doing so. It seems the Government wants to accept this Bill in order to let it die whenever this Dáil ends and that sometime in the term of the next Dáil, or maybe never, it will be revisited. That, unfortunately, seems to be the rationale.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> The Government has accepted only one or two proposals put forward by the Convention on the Constitution on which to vote, which makes one wonder what was the point of the convention. It was a very positive exercise and contribution, which the Government should have taken more fully on board. The real fear from a Government point of view is that it cannot control how these people and 16 year olds will vote. Emigrants would probably not vote for the establishment parties that have been in power in this State for so many years. That is the main reason it will not seriously consider extending the franchise.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> It is amazing too how many difficulties and issues have to be teased out, thought about, discussed and considered before extending the vote to 16 year olds can be put to the people. The most pressing point in this proposal is that the earlier we get people to engage and participate in the electoral system, the better our chance of having a dynamic system that represents everybody. It is constantly said that 18 to 25 year olds do not vote or not in such big numbers as other cohorts. That is because at that age one does not think politics influences one’s life. Only when one thinks about settling down, buying a house or starting a family does one realise that politics has an influence. It is then that those people start to vote. If people vote at 16, they are more likely to continue to vote and if we provide a vote for emigrants, they will be able to vote when they have to emigrate. It will be of great benefit to them and to our society to allow this to happen. Unfortunately, this Bill will die with the Government and will not see the light of day again.</p>

          <p eId="para_872">I commend Sinn Féin on this Bill. I acknowledge that the Government has appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and Deputy Deenihan has forged links with groups in different countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> We should give people in these countries the choice of casting a vote because they are there through no fault of their own. Many of them keep up an interest in, and are as up to date as anybody else on, what is going on in Ireland. It is their home and they have a genuine passion for being involved in their country. I understand that there are issues to be teased out but we should try to get around the obstacles.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> One way to show we are interested in doing this is, at the election next year, to put out the hand and have, as Taoiseach’s appointees to the Seanad, people in those countries to represent them. We need to show we are interested in doing this rather than kicking the can down the road for a few more years. All youngsters in secondary school study politics and many know a great deal about it. People might wonder if at the age of 16 they are fit to vote, but because they are learning about it, they know a fair bit about it. One has to commend the system on that. I understand the constitutional difficulties but our first step should be to give people outside the country the opportunity to vote and we can try it with the 16 year olds.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> We can overcome the problems because there is unanimity in the House, which is good to see, that we need to look outside the box and give our youngsters a chance. We should be like the 150 countries that give their people who have moved to other places the opportunity to cast a vote. It gives people the feeling of being included, which is very important because some day many of these people will come home. Some countries have different stipulations for people who have been gone for five or ten years. Those are matters we can work on constructively with the diaspora.</p>

          <p eId="para_876">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I commend Deputy Seán Crowe and Sinn Féin on bringing the legislation before the House. I welcome the debate as I feel very strongly that Irish citizens resident overseas have a great contribution to make to Irish life. This debate is part of that process. We all need to open our minds to the huge positive potential of this process and in particular the great potential of the Irish abroad. I also commend those in America and other countries who were very supportive of the start of the Northern Ireland peace process. They led and delivered by supporting the talks at that time. We should never forget that in this House, even though at times many do.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> I would like to see an end to the disenfranchisement of recent migrants, a facilitation of a diaspora vote in the presidential election, provision for their representation in the Oireachtas and Ministers dealing with these issues. Votes for people in the Six Counties is an important issue. This island is small enough that they should be allowed to vote in all elections, particularly the presidential election. If we are serious about honouring the men and women of 1916 we would all in this House agree on that. These are sensible proposals and should be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> There is consensus across the political and ideological spectrum that Irish well-being and economic recovery depend on our openness and global reach.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">We all know the Irish diaspora is a vast living resource not just in terms of trading Irish products for Irish consumers but in the fact that they have another vision. They know about new markets, fresh ideas and products, branding, investment opportunities for growth and for Irish enterprise and they have professional networks. Many of them do very well in foreign countries. The Irish around the world believe strongly in being Irish and in supporting Ireland and that is a resource we do not tap into enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> From life-saving remittances in times of hardship to The Gathering in 2013, Irish migrants have displayed a profound generosity to all their families and to the people and the places they left behind. On a daily basis, hundreds of thousands of Irish migrants volunteer and willingly assist as ambassadors for the arts, sports and culture right across the island. The Irish abroad contribute economically, boost Ireland's influence and enrich Irish culture. The Irish Government should recognise that it is in its interest to engage and sustain the diaspora. </p>
          <p eId="para_881"> It is very important that we give strong consideration to this proposal. The Central Statistics Office reports that Ireland has lost some 300,000 citizens in the past four years, mostly adults. An estimated 420 were arriving in England each week in the highest level of migration in 22 years. Among the recent Irish emigrants aged between 25 and 34, more than 60% were graduates. Education and training, paid for by the Irish taxpayer, are in danger of being lost to the country. These are all the positives of what is behind the debate on this legislation. We need to open our minds and support this Bill. I urge all Deputies to do so and I welcome that the Government is not opposing the Bill at this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_882">I wish to share time with a number of Deputies. Tá áthas orm bheith anseo anocht chun an t-ábhar seo a phlé. I am delighted to speak on this proposal to extend voting rights in presidential elections to our diaspora. The matter was discussed in detail during the fifth report of the Constitutional Convention. Three quarters of the membership of the convention recommended that we extend the franchise to citizens resident in Northern Ireland and overseas. The Government has been far too slow to move on this. Not opposing the Bill is the minimum we should do. Across Europe, 40 countries provide voting rights to their citizens who live overseas. Last year the European Commission criticised our Government for not allowing citizens who are resident in other EU member states to vote in our national elections and it claimed this might impinge on the freedom of movement of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, which I chair and of which Deputy Crowe is a member, examined this issue. We held a number of meetings with academics, political parties, ambassadors from other member states resident in Ireland and representatives of the Irish diaspora overseas. We published a report in which we recommended that the Government extend voting rights. Last week our committee visited London in the context of the "Should we stay or should we go?" discussion they are having <i>vis-à-vis</i> the European Union, or "Brexit versus Bremain" as it has also been referred to. We met with a number of people, including Jennie McShannon of the Irish in Britain organisation, and Dean Duke and others from Votes for Irish Citizens Abroad. They impressed upon us that they felt their citizenship was being impaired due to their inability to vote. As somebody who was a member of the Irish diaspora for 17 years, I know exactly how they feel. I share their views and I believe it is time we righted this wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> Last week, the Government, in the form of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, published a paper outlining the issues to be faced in order to proceed with extending the franchise. He posed a number of questions. First, he asked how we would determine the electorate for presidential elections. A full implementation of the recommendations of the constitutional convention would include all citizens resident in the State and citizens resident outside the State, equating to 4.5 million voters within the State and 3.5 million outside the State. That would mean some 43% of the electorate would be living outside the State. That is an issue for some people, who see 43% as high. When my committee published our report several non-committee members of the Oireachtas approached me accusing the committee of handing over the presidency to another political party. I will not pull any punches here - they felt that giving people outside Ireland the right to vote would mean the Sinn Féin candidate had an advantage. As an ex-member of the diaspora I find that view point patronising in the extreme. As someone who spent almost two decades living outside this country I was still able to maintain my knowledge of what was going on at home and my judgment about who and what was right and wrong for our country. As far as I am concerned, a chameleon is a chameleon whether one is looking at it from one mile away or from 1,000 miles away. Our President represents our country and people decide on their votes wisely. They do not waste their votes, as we saw with the election of President Michael D. Higgins. I know what our diaspora looks like and I know what makes them tick. I trust them with their votes. </p>
          <p eId="para_885"> The Minister also raised practical issues such as the costs involved in organising voting for people resident outside the State. We can be clever here. There are many systems now in place worldwide which allow for secure Internet voting and I have had discussions with providers who do this in many different countries. Granted, we have had a poor experience with electronic voting but time has moved on, technology has improved and acceptance has increased. The next presidential election should allow Internet voting at home and abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> The Minister of State with special responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, also mentioned the potential legislative and constitutional changes that would be needed. I do not think these issues will be contentious as all our citizens would support them. No family is without relations who live overseas, many of whom want to return and all of whom treasure their Irish identity. I have no illusion about whether we will see progress on this before the next election. Sadly, I do not think the Government will push this as a priority but I hope that in the absence of progress in the next year this will form part of the election manifestos of the main parties in the country. Within the Labour Party I will work to ensure it forms part of ours.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamonn Maloney<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_887">I commend my constituency colleague on introducing the debate on this issue but otherwise we will swim in different directions. The existing Constitution is almost 80 years old and this would be the 34th amendment. The Constitution itself has only 50 articles. The existing Constitution has no kinship with what life was like in 1937. This country has changed utterly, some of it for the better and some of it not so. We should have a Constitution that reflects modern Ireland and not one that belongs to another age, although that is a question for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> Two suggestions have been made. First every citizen of Ireland would be able to vote, irrespective of where he or she lives, be it in Australia, in Canada or elsewhere. I am not aware of any other country that has implemented a scheme that would allow the franchise to be extended to every part of the world. From the experience of someone who had to get up and leave during a particular time in his own life and live under the Queen, I can tell Deputies that those of us among the working Irish in London spent very little time thinking about whether we had a vote back here. That is not to say it was not referred to. It was referred to and it was part of an ongoing political debate. However, among those who leave the country, especially those who establish themselves in Australia, Canada or England and can retain a connection with this country through their families or the GAA, I do not think there is a yearning or a burning ambition to have a say in the election of a President in a country in which they do not live. </p>
          <p eId="para_889">References have been made to the connection with Northern Ireland, but if one were to talk to Ulster Protestants about extending the franchise to them to vote for a President down here, they would say it was none of their business. Many nationalists in Northern Ireland, being practical Ulster people, would not get too excited about whether they had a vote in a presidential election here. We have to have a Presidency under the Constitution, but the office has never had power, although it has some influence, which is important in politics; I am not dismissing that. Some of the best speeches in modern Ireland were made by Presidents, irrespective of what their politics might have been. We are not living in France, so the Presidency does not have that sort of influence in this country's political life. I do not like using the word "token", but the Presidency is pretty limited; it has influence but no power.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> I have no difficulty with lowering the voting age to 16. I went to the young scientists exhibition in January and saw a stand operated by teachers from a secondary school that both Deputy Crowe and I are familiar with. Their project was on 16 year olds voting. The greater proportion of those interviewed by the school students - I think it was 73% - either said they did not care or would not vote. People may say things in polls, but I am not saying that would apply if they had the opportunity to vote. </p>
          <p eId="para_891"> Those of us who are involved in politics, from all sides of the House, are aware of a big change taking place in this country. The issue is no longer the turnout but the fact that more and more people do not vote. That is a real issue for all of us. I will use my own constituency of Dublin South-West as an example. In last year's local elections almost 68% of voters stayed at home. In a by-election in the same constituency, 65% of people stayed at home. We keep talking about turnout, but that is no longer the problem for us as politicians; it is the fact that more and more people do not vote. While I have no difficulty with lowering the voting age to 16, we must all face up to some truths about the nature of Irish politics and address the fact that so many people do not vote. That says something about everyone here, and, irrespective of whether we think we know what is happening, that is the reality on the ground. In last year's European Parliament election for the Dublin constituency, 56% of people did not bother to vote. Ireland has done pretty well out of the EU, but the majority did not even go out to vote for it. I find it extraordinary because the trend is only going in one direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> I have no difficulty with the principle of giving 16 year olds the opportunity to vote. However, while we say we will lower the age to allow younger people to vote in presidential elections, at the same time in the Constitution we tell 16 year olds that they must be 34 before they can be a presidential candidate. That is a complete contradiction. If we think it is good enough for 16 year olds to choose TDs, MEPs or the President, why can 16 year olds not be presidential candidates? I think we have to look at that.</p>

          <p eId="para_896">I welcome the debate on this important initiative to extend the franchise to a wider section of society. There are many restrictions on voting rights and, as the Minister of State is aware, not all Irish citizens have those rights. For instance, those under 18 do not have the right to vote. Most migrants have limited voting rights in this State. In addition, those who are forced to emigrate, mainly as a result of the infliction of austerity on them and their families, have no real capacity to influence the political process within this State. They cannot bring about a situation in which they feel comfortable enough to come home and secure a living here. It is unfair, so as legislators we have a responsibility to rectify this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> I fully support extending the franchise to 16 and 17 year olds. Those aged 16 are deemed competent enough to consent to medical treatment or opt out of it, and I do not have an issue with that. However, it is odd that while they are deemed competent to make life-and-death decisions on personal health and safety, the State does not view them as competent to decide who they believe should make health policies. </p>
          <p eId="para_898"> I know the Bill will be supported tonight and will go to Committee Stage, but some people, both here and in our broader society, say it is too radical a step to allow 16 year olds to vote. They say such an age cohort are children and could not possibly have the competency to vote in any type of election. None the less, governments are happy enough to acknowledge the maturity and capacity of 16 and 17 year olds and consider them as adults when it suits them. For instance, the Children Act ensures that the age of criminal responsibility in this jurisdiction is 12 years. It is hard, therefore, to comprehend why children are judged to be mature and responsible enough when it comes to committing a crime, but not to cast a vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> As Sinn Féin's education spokesperson, I have met many students under the age of 18. In my dealings with them I have been presented with no credible argument as to why 16 and 17 year olds should not be allowed to vote. I do not believe that if we gave them the vote they would make a wrong decision. There is no right or wrong decision when one casts a vote. That is a person's right.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> People may also argue that those aged under 18 have no experience of engaging with political structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">I know from dealing with many cases in my own constituency involving people under 18, whether it was to do with SUSI grants, access to education, trying to secure a reader for children with special educational needs sitting the leaving certificate or cuts in funding to local organisations they may be a part of, that they have a wide engagement with the political spectrum.<b>
						</b>All of the political parties have a youth structure. We have a vibrant growing youth structure in our party, and thousands of people aged 16 to 18 are engaged in political activity every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> There is also research to suggest that allowing 16 and 17 year olds the right to vote will establish a lifelong habit of voting and as mentioned by the previous speaker, if we are genuine about trying to engage young people and get them into the habit of voting, and reversing those trends in the numbers of people who are not engaging in the electoral process, it makes sense, given the research, to reduce the voting age to 16 and 17 year olds. In that way we can address some of those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> Schools are teaching civil, social and political education, CSPE, and there is even greater scope for a broader teaching of politics within our education system. I am confident that our young people can engage with these subjects in a positive way. To put it simply, they understand what they are dealing with when they are given the knowledge within schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> I am confident that 16 and 17 year olds can exercise the right to vote, and the sky will not fall in. It is clear that the fear of giving them the vote stems from a major underestimation of their capabilities and capacities. Young people played a very important part in the recent Scottish referendum, and it is clear that young people will engage in the political system if given the opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> There was a time when it was considered appropriate that only people over the age of 21 should vote. We lowered that age because we recognised that people between the ages of 18 and 21 should be allowed to vote. It is now time for further recognition of people between the ages of 16 and 18, and we should make that change accordingly. We should follow in the footsteps of many of our European counterparts on the issue of the voting age. For instance, in Austria, in seven of the 16 states in Germany, and in parts of Switzerland people aged between 16 and 18 have the ability to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> On the broader issue of voting rights for Irish citizens in presidential elections, I remind the Government Members that they established the Constitutional Convention and asked it to examine this very issue. It gave an overwhelming response to the issue, with 78% voting in favour of extending voting rights to citizens within the Six Counties. That was generally accepted by the Constitutional Convention, and its make-up would reflect broader society. That indicates a desire to change the law accordingly. However, despite the Constitutional Convention's recommendation that the Government should legislate and hold a referendum on presidential voting rights for citizens resident outside the State, the Government has failed even to bring the report before the Chamber for it to be debated, never mind give a commitment on holding any such referendum. The Taoiseach has publicly stated that he believes this is an issue for the next Government to deal with. I have asked him on the Order of Business when we will have that debate but we have yet to be given a timeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> While I welcome that this issue will be allowed go to committee, it is important that we do not allow it to be set aside. There is much scope and merit for it to be expanded on. I listened to the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, earlier in which he highlighted some of the difficulties he envisages in terms of this legislation. That is something we can deal with in committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> I agree with the previous speaker on the disengagement of some people from politics. There are many reasons for that, and we all have to bear some responsibility in that regard, but one of the key ways of reversing that is to develop a lifelong habit of voting and the earlier we give people the opportunity to cast that vote, the more likely they are to continue that trend. For that reason alone, we should consider supporting the Bill and having a referendum not only on extending voting rights in presidential elections but also lowering the voting age to 16.</p>

          <p eId="para_909">Tá ár gcóras polaitiúil ag teip ar na daoine is laige. Tá sé le feiceáil go bhfuil sé ag seasamh ar thaobh na ndaoine is saibhre inár sochaí. Feileann eisimirce an córas seo agus sin an fáth nach bhfuil an Rialtas toilteanach vóta a thabhairt d'aon duine lasmuigh den tír i dtoghchán uachtaráin. Tá sé scanallach nach bhfuil Éireannaigh thar sáile ábalta vótáil le haghaidh uachtaráin. Freisin, an rud is mó a chuireann náire orainn ná nach bhfuil ár ndaoine sna Sé Chontae ábalta vótáil inár dtír.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> Tá an ceart ag gach duine inár sochaí páirt a ghlacadh in aon phróiseas vótála atá ar siúl sa tír agus tá an chumhacht acu rialtas a vótáil isteach nó amach más mian leo. Gan amhras, thaisteal muid bóthar fada, ach níl ár dturas críochnaithe. Tá daoine soiniciúil i dtaobh na polaitíochta agus braon de na bréaga a gcloiseann siad nuair atá toghchán ar siúl, agus ina dhiaidh. Féach, mar shampla, ar Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre agus an damáiste atá déanta mar thoradh ar na gealltanais a thug sé chun an toghchán deireanach a bhuachan. </p>
          <p eId="para_911"> Tá sé tábhachtach don daonlathas go nglacann daoine páirt i ngach gné den tsochaí in ionad a bheith ag tarraingt siar ó institiúdí an Stáit. Tá dream mór den daonra, go háirithe i gceantair bhochta ag diúltiú vótála mar nach bhfeiceann siad aon tairbhe ann dóibh. Ní fheiceann siad aon rud i ndán dóibh sa saol seachtas streachailt agus bochtanas. Tuigeann siad go bhfuil gach duine agus gach páirtí mar an gcéanna. Tá polasaithe déine ag cur isteach ar dhaoine, go háirithe daoine ar phá íseal nó meán agus daoine ar shochar leasa shóisialta. Níl aon stair againn sa tír seo airgead a lorg ó na daoine is saibhre. Níl aon fhís ag an Rialtas ach cumhacht agus uaillmhian.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> Séard atá á iarradh ag an mBille seo ná ceart ag gach duine ceangailte don tír seo páirt a ghlacadh i reifreann. Tá ár saoránaigh ag feitheamh; tabhair seans dóibh. Tá Oifig an Uachtaráin siombalach seachas tábhachtach, ach tá sé raidiceach sa tslí go dtugann sé guth do dhaoine nach bhfuil guth acu. Ó 2007 go dtí an lá atá inniu ann, d'fhág beagnach 500,000 saoránaigh an tír seo. Tá siad scaipthe ar fud an domhain. I ndeireadh na dála, d'fhág daoine an tír seo go drogallach. Tá croíthe an chuid is mó acu sa tír seo. Tabhair seans dóibh vótáil lena gcroíthe sin. Tá vótáil le haghaidh uachtaráin tuillte acu. Is céim mhór í seo. Tabhair tacaíocht dúinn agus don Bhille seo.</p>

          <p eId="para_913">Is Bille rí-thábhachtach é an Bille seo atá os ár gcomhair. Ní hé seo an chéim dheireanach, ach an chéad chéim má tá sé i gceist againn dul ar aghaidh agus leanúint leis na cinntí seo. Ní hamháin go mbeidh muid ag lorg vóta i dtoghcháin uachtaránachta, beidh muid ag lorg vótaí i reifrinn ghinearálta chomh maith. Más saoránach duine, is saoránach i gcónaí é, cuma más sa tír seo é nó thar lear.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> Is trua liom an meon atá á léiriú ag roinnt de na Teachtaí ar thaobh an Rialtais maidir leis an mBille seo. Tá cineál choimeádachais i gceist i measc na bpáirtithe bunaidh i leith saoránach.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">Tá eagla orthu céim chun tosaigh a ghlacadh. Ní sin amháin ach tá an cuma ar an scéal go bhfuil siad ag féachaint ar shaoránaigh nach bhfuil sa Stát seo mar shaoránaigh den tarna grád agus is rud scanallach é sin. Ní gá ach féachaint ar an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Nash, agus é ag caint faoin mBille seo níos luaithe. Dúirt sé that we must decide which citizens should be entitled to vote. Is saoránach saoránach agus ba chóir go mbeadh na cearta céanna acu. Dúirt an tAire Stáit chomh maith gur 70 milliún duine atá i gceist agus sinn ag caint faoi diaspora na hÉireann. Dúirt sé go mbeadh fadhbanna praiticiúla ann. Ní 70 milliún an líon saoránach atá thar lear mar ní shaoránach gach duine acusan. B'fhéidir go mbeadh siad i dteideal saorántacht but b'fhéidir nach bhfuil sé sin á lorg acu agus nach bhfuil pas eisithe dóibh go fóill. Tá súil agam, amach anseo, go mbeadh siad. Ansan ba léir don domhan cé chomh láidir is atá Éire agus na daoine seo thar lear.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> Ní raibh mé ag súil le haon rud eile ó Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre nó na páirtithe eile. Is iadsan na páirtithe a dhíbir saoránaigh na hÉireann thar lear agus ar imirce. I gcás Fhine Gael, nuair Cumann na nGaedhael a bhí ann, dhíbir siad daoine toisc gur poblachtánaigh iad. Dhein siad neamhaird dóibh thar na blianta. Ó bunaíodh an Stát, dhein siad neamhaird do shaoránaigh Éireannacha sna Sé Chontae ach go háirithe. Dá mbeadh an meon atá acu athruithe, thuigfeadh siad go bhfuil tairbhe le baint as saoránaigh atá thar lear. Dá mbeadh meas acu orthu, thuigfeadh siad, idir ghlas agus oráiste, gur saoránaigh iad. Bheadh siad tar éis eagrú sna Sé Chontae, ach ba chuma sa tsioc leo. Níl spéis ar bith acu i saoránaigh sna Sé Chontae ach amháin nuair a shíleann siad gur féidir leo iad a úsáid i gcoinne mo pháirtí. Sin atá á dhéanamh acu le blianta anuas.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> Ba léir ó na hóráidí a rinne na hAirí Stáit, an Teachta Nash agus an Teachta Deenihan, gur cuma leo a lán de. Bhí siad ag teacht suas le constaicí maidir le cén fáth nach bhfuil siad sásta bogadh ar aghaidh. Ní raibh ach ceisteanna acu. Bliain go leith nó breis is bliain go leith atá ann ó chuir an coinbhinsiún tuairisc fénár mbráid. Dúradh go raibh 78% dóibh siúd a bhí ag an gcoinbhinsiún i bhfábhar leathadh an vóta do shaoránaigh lasmuigh d'Éirinn agus 73% dóibh i gcás saoránaigh sna Sé Chontae. Tá tacaíocht dó sin le feiceáil sna pobalbhreitheanna a bhí ann roimhe sin agus ina dhiaidh. Cén fáth nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag obair de réir an chinneadh a ghlac an coinbhinsiún nó ag obair de réir na bpobalbhreitheanna? Cén fáth nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur chun cinn an méid dúirt seisean agus páirtithe eile ina gcláir thoghcáin, ní amháin an toghchán seo ach roimhe sin. Is é an fáth ná, i slí amháin, gur cuma sa tsioc leo. Is féidir leo na ráitis a dhéanamh agus ansin ní gá dóibh aon obair a dhéanamh maidir leo. </p>
          <p eId="para_918"> Tá muideanna ag rá gur gá ní amháin an Bille seo a rith ach gur gá an obair eile ar fad a bheith déanta ag an am céanna. Níl muidne ag tnúth go mbeidh toghchán ann ar maidin agus go mbeidh gach rud ceart sa ghairdín. Caithfimid cinnte phraiticiúla a dhéanamh. Ba chóir go mbeadh an díospóireacht sin ag tarlú. Ní amháin sin ach ba chóir go mbeadh sé tairlithe. Ní chóir dúinn bheith ag tosnú leis agus an díospóireacht seo agus í á húsáid mar constaic i gcoinne na reachtaíochta seo a rith chomh tapaidh agus is féidir. Tá deis againn i mí na Bealtaine, más mian leis an Rialtas é a dhéanamh. Measaim féin nach mian leis an Rialtas é. Cuirfear ar athló é. Fanfaidh sé sa choiste go dtí pé am a chríochnaíonn an Dáil seo agus fágfar é, mar is spéis leis an Taoiseach é, don chéad Rialtas eile. Is trua í sin mar tá an deis ann. Tá tacaíocht ann sa Teach seo, sa Seanad, go bhfios dom, agus i measc an phobail, i gcoitinne, chun bogadh ar aghaidh leis an gceist seo. Maidir leis na ceisteanna phraicticiúla a luadh, chuaigh gach uile Stát eile a bhfuil vóta thar lear dá shaoránaigh i ngleic leis na ceisteanna phraicticiúla seo. Tá 150 tír timpeall an domhain a thugann vóta dá saoránaigh atá thar lear trí bhealach amháin nó bealach eile. Tá roinnt de na tíortha seo níos mó ná Éire agus tá roinnt eile acu níos lú. Aontaím go mbeidh ceisteanna maoine ann. Ach ní hí sin an cheist is mó. Consnaíonn daonflathas airgead. Má táthar sásta tacú leis an daonfhlathas, caithfear an t-airgead a chur ar leathtaobh chun vóta a thabairt agus an deis vótála a thabhairt do saoránaigh uilig an náisiúin. Is trua í nach bhfuilimid ach ag caint faoi sin faoi láthair. </p>
          <p eId="para_919"> Fáiltím go bhfuil an Rialtas tar éis glacadh le seo ach impím air bogadh ar aghaidh gan meon an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Nash. Ní chóir don Rialtas bheith cóiméadach. Ní chóir don Rialtas bheith ag lorg fáil amach constaicí eile chun cur i gcoinne é seo. </p>
          <p eId="para_920"> Caithfimid féachaint ar an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire Stáit maidir le vótaí sna Sé Chontae. An leithscéal a d'úsáid sé maidir le sin ná the vote in the Six Counties presents significant practical challenges. Tá sé seo scanallach. Dúirt sé that for many it would be a sensitive issue agus nach chóir aon rud a dhéanamh because of political sensitivities. Is Éireannaigh iad. Is saoránaigh iad. Tá sé de cheart acu, agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé de cheart acu, vóta a chaitheamh, ar a laghad i dtoghchán uachtarántachta. Tá súil agam nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag glacadh le seo just toisc go mbeadh náire air thar lear agus go mbeadh sé ag dul ar chamchuairt timpeall an domhain an tseachtain seo agus an tseachtain seo chugainn agus é tar éis vóta a chaitheamh i gcoinne é seo. Tá súil agam go bhfuilim mí-cheart maidir le sin agus go bhfuil sé dáiríre faoin gcinneadh a ghlac sé agus go bhfuil sé chun leanúint agus bogadh ar aghaidh leis an gcinneadh os ár gcomhair anseo. Dúirt urlabhraithe na bpáirtithe ar fad go raibh siadsan sásta é seo a bhogadh ar aghaidh, agus ní anuraidh agus ní ag an gCoinbhinsiún Bhunreachtúil ach le linn an toghchán deiridh a dúradh é seo. </p>
          <p eId="para_921"> Ba chóir don Rialtas seaseamh leis an ngeallúint a thug sé do phobal na tíre in 2011. Ba chóir don Rialtas beart a dhéanamh de réir a bhriathar. Is é seo an beart. Ní amháin ligean dó dul go dtí an coiste. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé á phlé sa choiste chomh tapaidh agus is féidir. Then déileáil leis na ceisteanna phraicticiúla. Tá daoine eile tar éis déileáil leo cheana agus tá moltaí ag daoine tar éis achainí a chur isteach os comhair na bpáirtithe difriúla thar na blianta. Is féidir é a dhéanamh agus is féidir é a dhéanamh cuíosach gasta. Tá ambasáid againn timpeall an domhain agus áiteanna nach bhfuil, bíonn muid ag roinnt seirbhísí ambasadóireachta. Fiú, níl an córas poist chomh dona sin. Ní leithscéal é sin. Nuair a smaoinítear air, nuair atá vóta ann don Seanad, cad a tharlaíonn? Bíonn vóta poist ar fáil. Mas céimí duine in Argentina, Malawi, nó pé áit eile ar domhan ina bhfuil an duine sin gafa, tá sé ceart go leor. Níl fadhb ar bith. Is féidir leis an duine sin vóta a chaitheamh don Seanad. Níl aon fhadhb ann maidir le seo fé láthair. Tá vótaí ar fáil do shaoránaigh Éireannacha áirithe atá thar lear cheana féin. Níl sé ann don ghnáthphobail agus don ghnáthshaoránach. Impím ar an Rialtas, mar sin, bogadh ar aghaidh. Ba chóir don Rialtas beart de réir a bhriathar a dhéanamh. Ní chóir don Rialtas bheith diúltach faoi seo mar a bhí na hAirí Stáit, na Teachtaí Nash agus Deenihan, níos luaithe. Ba chóir don Rialtas a bheith fuinniúil agus é seo á chur chun cinn.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_922">The Government is not opposed this Bill. We firmly believe, however, that before processing the Bill through the further stages of the legislative process, the full range of practical and policy issues that will arise in expanding the franchise as proposed in the Bill must be analysed.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> The Government recognises the importance of voting rights for the diaspora. Following the launch of the diaspora policy last week, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for diaspora affairs, Deputy Deenihan, released a statement detailing the range of issues that require further consideration. He also spoke in this debate about the diaspora policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> The Bill gives rise to two broad issues for consideration, namely, the minimum age requirement to vote in elections and referendums and the extension of the franchise in presidential elections to citizens resident outside of the State. While supportive of a referendum on the proposal to reduce the voting age to 16, the Government indicated during the debate on Deputy Stanley's Private Members' Bill on 6 February last that there were outstanding issues requiring further analysis before an amendment to the Constitution would be recommended to the people. These include the wisdom of setting the voting age at 16 when the age of majority is 18. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, outlined in his contribution to this debate some specific examples of areas where further analysis is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> I accept that an extension of voting rights to citizens resident outside the State would be welcomed by many in the diaspora. I also know, however, that it would be challenging to introduce and manage. For example, while citizens resident outside the State should be entitled to vote in presidential elections, the wider Irish diaspora is estimated by some at 70 million people and the number of those who are entitled to Irish citizenship is not known. Any consideration of extending the presidential election franchise to Irish citizens overseas would need to include consideration of people resident in Northern Ireland. The implications for Northern Ireland would differ from other parts of the world. Voter registration options to accommodate voters resident outside the State would need to be explored. We would also need to consider the ways in which voting might be undertaken. References were made to voting at diplomatic missions, for example, and to postal voting options.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> The diaspora debate is wider than the franchise issue. It was only last week that our first ever policy statement on diaspora issues was published. The policy document outlines the significant measures that are being taken to recognise the importance of our diaspora. We should not overlook these in this debate. I repeat that the Government is not opposing this Bill. Any proposals to amend the Constitution should, however, be accompanied by a full and considered analysis of the implementation of the proposals, the potential consequences of the amendment and the estimated costs arising. There is a job of work to be done on this and it will be undertaken before this Bill proceeds through the further stages of the legislative process. We will not oppose the Bill, which has given us the opportunity to have a very worthwhile debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_352">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T20:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_927">Tá áthas orm nach bhfuil an Rialtas in aghaidh an Bhille seo. I am very pleased that the Government is not opposing this Bill. That is positive, as is the launch of the diaspora policy to which the Minister of State referred. If I am correct, this is the first concrete, positive response from the Government in respect of the decision of the Constitutional Convention. We have waited some time for this. Indeed, I and some of my colleagues questioned An Taoiseach very consistently to try to establish the Government's view on the proposal from the convention that the franchise for the presidential election be extended to citizens resident outside the State, but the Taoiseach fairly resolutely refused to give an on the record position or view on that recommendation. I hope we can take it from the decision not to oppose this Bill that the Government views that recommendation in a very positive light, and that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> It is very unfortunate, however, that the Government did not move on this matter itself in response to the Constitutional Convention. It a great pity that these matters will not be put to the people by way of referendum during the lifetime of this Government. I regard that as truly a wasted opportunity. I do not say that to be adversarial for the sake of it but because I believe that the diaspora, the global Irish community, is a huge asset to this country. In the course of this debate I heard several Deputies articulate the drawbacks and the technical and practical difficulties the Government envisages in allowing an extension of the franchise. I hope people do not take a myopic view or become blinded by what they perceive as challenges and miss the bigger picture. I am sure the Minister of State will remember the summit that was held a number of years ago at Farmleigh House. Some of the big hitters from around the world were invited, not least from the United States of America. Our message to them at that stage was that we were in deep economic trouble and we needed their solidarity and assistance. That was fair enough but it cannot always be one-way traffic. It strikes me that if we were thoughtful, inclusive and a bit smarter in terms of our global community, it could only prove to be a huge positive for this country, socially, culturally and economically. There are massive dividends that can be realised.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> The Minister of State is absolutely right that the franchise issue is not the only diaspora issue. She is correct in that, and issues of welfare, for instance, for the Irish in Britain and further afield, still loom very large and could do with greater resources. The franchise issue is not the only issue but it is a very big one. Anyone who travels to Britain, the USA or Australia and talks to members of the diaspora, whether they are recent emigrants or families who have lived outside the home country for generations, will be left in no doubt that the franchise is a very big issue. Needless to say, for Irish citizens living in Ireland, the extension of the franchise is critical. The Good Friday Agreement recognises identity in its fullness, in an inclusive manner, as Irish, British or both, which is the case for some. The extension of the right to vote in presidential elections would be a further development of and building on the peace agreement and a recognition of the whole of the nation by giving all Irish citizens living in Ireland a stake in a key democratic institution and constitutional office.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2015-03-11T20:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_930">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí ar fad a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo. Chuir Sinn Féin an Bille seo chun tosaigh mar go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh deireadh a chur leis an gcaoi ina bhfuil imircigh agus Éireannaigh sna Sé Chontae in aicme eile.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> Sinn Féin firmly believes in the core republican principle of equal citizenship and we therefore support the right of all Irish citizens of voting age to vote for the Irish President regardless of their place of residence. We also seek to reduce the voting age to 16 to energise and mobilise young people to engage with the political system. Some speakers asked earlier why we would want to do that and I would point them to the example of the recent Scottish referendum and the energy that young people in Scotland brought to that campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> Cuirim fáilte roimh an scéal nach mbeidh an Rialtas ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille seo. However, the Rialtas needs to work urgently and actively towards ending the disenfranchisement of Irish citizens. Many speakers spoke positively about the Constitutional Convention, which was warmly welcomed by Members of this House and by the majority of Irish citizens. However, the Government missed deadlines in issuing responses to recommendations from the convention, refused to hold referendums on many of its recommendations and held a referendum on the future of the Seanad without the support of the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">Many felt it treated the convention as a talking shop. We know that in January 2013, the first ballot of the members of the convention saw delegates vote in favour of lowering the voting age from 18 to 16. In September 2013, 78% of members of the convention voted in favour of giving citizens resident abroad a vote in Presidential elections, and 73% voted in favour of giving Irish citizens resident in the North a Presidential vote. The Government should have faced up to the democratic demands of that convention to end this disenfranchisement. We still believe there is a need for those referendums. While I welcome the Government's acceptance of this Bill, the onus is on it to move it forward and not bury it on Committee Stage, as it has done with other Opposition Bills. The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, spoke earlier on. To use football parlance, he has the ball. What decision will the Government take? Will the Minister of State stay in his own half or will he move the ball forward? People want us to move this issue forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> Speakers mentioned the difficulties relating to this. Yes, there are challenges, but challenges can be overcome. This is the approach I would like to see the Government adopt. It is done all over the world. I do not see why it cannot be done in Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_935"> Last month, I spoke here in support of a Bill introduced by Deputy Stanley to extend voting rights to 16 and 17 year olds. Again, this issue has been ignored, and it does not seem to be going anywhere. In July 2013, the Government gave a commitment to do this. The then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, said that the Government committed to holding a referendum before the end of 2015 on a proposal to amend the Constitution to provide for a voting age of 16. I suppose it is relevant to ask what has happened since then. Clearly, the Government has reneged on its promise. Again, while the Government supports the Bill today, I am calling on it not to renege on this commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> The Good Friday Agreement states that this Government recognises the right of all people born in the North to identify as Irish citizens if they want. We should not be treating them as second-class Irish citizens but as full Irish citizens with full voting rights. Again, it was voted for by the Irish people. We are talking about an inclusive Ireland rather than an exclusive one. It is reaching out to everyone, including Unionists. Some speakers say that people would not use the franchise. We must ask them and we must give it to them. There is a similar proposal in Cyprus. The Cypriot Government will give the opportunity to vote to people on the northern, Turkish side. It is about reconciliation.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> Many citizens in the diaspora actively contribute to the economic, social and cultural life of Ireland from afar in the form of remittances or investment, active support of the peace process or participation in and promotion of Irish heritage and culture through philanthropic, community and voluntary activities, language, arts and sporting organisations. The diaspora is a fundamentally important part of the Irish nation in both historical and contemporary terms. Extending voting rights and allowing the Irish diaspora to express their democratic voice is one of the inclusive actions that the Government can take to help improve and strengthen its relationship with the diaspora. It is not a one-way street. Many people would say that Governments in the past have seen the diaspora as just a cash cow. It is a matter of pulling those people in and embracing them.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> A total of 115 countries have systems in place to allow their emigrants to vote, so we are not reinventing the wheel. It has happened in other countries. Deputy Hannigan spoke about how the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs had heard from representatives of other Governments and how it is learning from them. Again, I ask that we move this forward. </p>
          <p eId="para_939"> I also call on the Government to do more in its efforts to get legalisation for the undocumented Irish. This comes on the back of a video conference that many of us were involved in today with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR. People ask what that has to do with this country. It concerns the diaspora and is probably the big issue in respect of those 60,000 to 70,000 people living in the US. The message that came across was that the Government lacks a plan or a worked-out strategy relating to the undocumented Irish. The ILIR has sent a letter to the US ambassador to Ireland requesting that he adopt a more flexible approach and waive the three- and ten-year unlawful presence bars for undocumented people in the US, not just the undocumented Irish. US embassies in Mexico, Venezuela and many South American countries have adopted this flexible, proactive and inclusive approach to those presenting in the embassies. Given that we are approaching St. Patrick's Day, we ask that this be part of our strategy, and that we formally ask the embassy to adopt this position. We ask that when Irish Ministers travel around the US they deal with this issue and lobby formally rather than just patting people on the back. The ILIR thought a formal submission had been made, but only recently learned that this was not the case. Again, the ILIR argues that this is long overdue. We all know the story of Irish people who are trapped in the US and cannot come home for important events such as funerals, deaths and marriages - all the happy and sad times. It is something positive that the Irish Government could do coming up to the St. Patrick's Day celebrations. It is not about problems; it is about problem solving. Clearly, if we approach these issues in that manner, we can resolve the issue of the diaspora and how we embrace its members and involve them more in politics and Irish life. That is what we all want to see. The argument used against giving the vote to 16 year olds could have been used against giving women the vote. Women would not know anything about politics or economics. The same argument is being put forward in respect of 16 year olds, who in many cases are probably more clued in than many of us older people.</p>
