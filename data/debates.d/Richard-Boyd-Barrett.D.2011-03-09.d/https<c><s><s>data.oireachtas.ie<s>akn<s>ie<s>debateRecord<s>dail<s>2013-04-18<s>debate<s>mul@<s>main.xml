        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, is assuring everyone that the health service is getting better and waiting lists are getting shorter. He assures us that patients who are waiting the longest for treatment are in fact being treated. Unfortunately, the facts and figures confirm that since taking office, the number of adults waiting for surgery in the country's hospitals has actually increased by a dramatic 40%. The latest figures show that 13,435 adults were waiting longer than six months at the end of March. This is a damning indictment of the stewardship of the Minister, Deputy Reilly. There now are more patients waiting for treatment for longer than six months, eight months and nine months. When contacted about this situation, the Department of Health has confirmed and states it is due to severe pressures on emergency departments although this is another area the Minister, Deputy Reilly, stated recently was under control and getting better.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> On the ground, however, nothing could be further from the truth. For example, in the past three weeks alone, all elective surgery except for paediatrics has been postponed in Cork University Hospital. In that hospital, a daily e-mail is being sent to the wards telling them to cancel all elective surgery. This includes cardiac, orthopaedic and neurosurgery and, most shockingly, it includes cases for the treatment of cancers. Consultants inform me that it is practically impossible to plan any elective surgery as the accident and emergency department is so busy.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> That hospital is finding it extremely hard to cope and while three wards are closed in that hospital alone, 84 wards are closed across the country's public hospitals. In addition, 408 patients were on trolleys yesterday in accident and emergency units across the health system. Yet again, this is an area the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, states is under control.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> Is the Minister, Deputy Reilly, in denial or is he living in some fantasy land? Does the Tánaiste accept that severe issues now face the health service and that the centre within the health service can no longer hold? At present, 2,277 public beds in the health service are closed and elective surgery, even in cancer cases, is being postponed as a result.</p>

          <p eId="para_6">These are not my figures but come from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which, on entering office, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, indicated he would accept as being the official figures in respect of trolley count, enclosures and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">Does the Tánaiste acknowledge the health service is now under extraordinary strain and requires dramatic intervention by the Government to arrest the crumbling across the board of all aspects of the service it attempts to provide for the people?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_9">First, from the very outset the priority of the Government has been to unblock access and to improve the flow of patients because patients are its number one priority. As set out in the programme for Government, the Minister for Health established a special delivery unit immediately on foot of the Government entering office. The aim of the special delivery unit is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system. The Government's commitment to improving access is clear and part of it pertains to the reform of hospital services.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> However, it is important to be clear about the facts in this regard. A figure of 13,435 adults waiting for planned procedures has been quoted in the media and Deputy Martin repeated it this morning. I am informed that this figure is incorrect. The actual figure I have to hand is 10,002 at the end of March and that has been published on the National Treatment Purchase Fund's website,<i> www.ntpf.ie</i>. This constitutes an increase of 4% from the figure of March 2011 and not 40% as the Deputy has alleged.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> However, when considering these numbers, one must take into account both the numbers of people who are on the list and the period of time they have been waiting. In March 2013, the median waiting time was 2.4 months, which was a decrease from the equivalent figure of three months in March 2011. Moreover, when the special delivery unit was set up in July 2011, a total of 6,277 patients were waiting for more than nine months for inpatient or day case treatment, and this was a legacy left by Deputy Martin's Government. However, by December 2012, just 109 patients were waiting for longer than nine months, and this is an achievement that ought to be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> However, the Government is not complacent. The progress does not mean the problem has been solved. The Deputy asked me whether the health service is under strain and the health service always is under strain. The Government is addressing that strain, reducing the length of time that people are waiting and dealing with the situation on the ground. There has been an increase in the number of people presenting at emergency departments over the past couple of months.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">As Deputy Martin knows, that is a seasonal phenomenon. The Minister for Health and the HSE are working to bring the number down. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">The first thing the Minister did when he came into office was change the targets. The internationally recognised targets for waiting lists were three months and six months. He unilaterally said it is 12 months. He had to massage the figures and perpetrate a con trick. That is what he did. The SDU has refined his machinations to nine months and over. The figures for three months and over and six months and over have rocketed over the past two years. The trolley count has also rocketed in the past few weeks. There is a fundamental problem which is more than just a case of the services being stretched. The Tánaiste has not commented on the fact that there is an e-mail going around a major acute tertiary hospital telling consultants and the wards not to do elective surgery. Elective cardiac and cancer surgery and neurosurgery is lifesaving surgery. It is unacceptable that this should be happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> A further cut of €750 million is lined up this year for the health service. The centre cannot hold in the health service. Private health insurance is unravelling as thousands cancel it every week. The public hospital system cannot cope with the demand. This is what consultants, nurses and people on the ground are telling us.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">It is important to put aside the spin and acknowledge that a dramatic intervention is needed. The Government needs to stand back from this, assess the crisis and then work out a proper pathway towards resolving it to ensure that as a minimum in difficult times we can provide a basic health service to our public and that operations that are needed are carried out.</p>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_18">At the end of 2012 there had been over 20,000 fewer people on trolleys than at the end of 2011. That was an improvement of 24%. Up to 5 April 2013, 2,600 fewer people had been on trolleys compared with the same period in 2012. There are strains on the health service, particularly at this time of year. We have come through a period of particularly unseasonable weather. Winter time and winter weather put additional pressure on emergency departments and on the hospital system.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">As I have said, in the health service there are always strains and demands and the question is how best to manage them. The Minister for Health and the HSE are managing as best they can. If the Minister needs to turn somewhere for advice on how to manage better it will not be to Deputy Martin because he, of all people, was not able to manage the health service in the best of financial times, when he was Minister for Health and had plenty of money available. He left a legacy of the HSE and mess that we are doing our best to clean up.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_19">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">The Croke Park II deal, negotiated by the Tánaiste's party colleague Deputy Howlin, was overwhelmingly rejected by the public sector trade unions, many of which are affiliated to the Tánaiste's party. As a former trade union official and a lifelong union member the Tánaiste will fully understand that the nurses, teachers and firefighters who rejected the deal did not do so lightly. They did so because they understand that the deal was bad for them and for their families and for the public services on which we all depend and for our domestic economy. Yesterday, after its meeting, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions made it very clear that it would oppose any attempt by the Government unilaterally to impose pay cuts through legislation. Yesterday, the Taoiseach refused to say whether he would respect the outcome of the union ballot and he also refused to rule out legislating for pay cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Will the Tánaiste, as leader of the Labour Party, respect the outcome of the trade union vote on Croke Park II? Will he, as a lifelong trade unionist, oppose any unilateral attempt to introduce pay cuts through legislation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_20" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_29">As everybody is aware just over two years ago this Government inherited the biggest financial and economic crisis ever to face this State. We determined that we would fix the problem. We have made a lot of progress in that respect. We are now 85% of the way there. There is a piece remaining to be completed, approximately €3 billion in savings in public expenditure. The pay and pensions bill of the State is approximately 35% of expenditure so we took the approach that a third of the remaining savings to be made in order to fix our problem should come from the pay bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> In negotiations a set of proposals was developed which provided for reductions in pay for those employed in the public service at the higher end of the pay scale and some additional working hours for those on the lower amount of working time. Approximately 87% of employees in the public service who earn less than €65,000 would not have their core pay reduced under those proposals. We felt that the proposals were fair and reasonable but they have not been accepted in a ballot of trade union members. That is disappointing but it is a reality. It is also a reality that the savings must be made. A saving of €300 million needs to be made in the payroll this year, and €1 billion between now and 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> We now have to reflect on the decision made. We need to hear from the trade union movement about the reasons for the rejection of the ballot and the Government will have to consider those. It is important that we do not put at risk what has already been achieved. We are now seven months from exiting the bailout. If we had not done what we have done, and certainly if we had taken advice from Deputy Ó Caoláin's party, we would be seven months from entering a second bailout. This is a time when we should not put at risk what has been done, either by failing to complete what needs to be completed or by walking into conflict and confrontation. This is a time for calm, reasoned, reasonable reflection on the outcome of the ballot and that is what the Government will do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_21">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">Very clearly the Tánaiste has not taken the opportunity to give clarity on his and his party's position on the possibility of legislation to impose cuts in public sector pay. He has taken exactly the same position as the leader of Fine Gael. I am hugely disappointed because I fail to understand why he would continue to act as a crutch for a party whose policies he is assisting to implement and that are very bad for the interests of the ordinary people. I ask the Tánaiste again to make it clear that no Deputy of any party will be asked to vote in this House on a Bill that would further punish low to middle income public sector workers who have already taken major pay cuts and many of whom are struggling to pay excessive mortgages, to heat their homes, to provide for their children's education and for health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">That is the reality we are in. I am talking about what the Tánaiste has taken as a fall-back position. Any time Sinn Féin asks him a question, he refers to fairytale economics. There has been a list of fairytales coming from him in recent times but the most clear one was Labour way's or Frankfurt's way.</p>

An overwhelming majority of workers stood up to the Government parties' threats - threats, incidentally, enthusiastically championed and broadcast by their friends in the media - and yet workers faced them down, which was an act of defiance that has served as a shot in the arm for all of their victims, including lone parents, disability payment recipients, home owners and pensioners, because public sector workers demonstrated that there are a lot more of them than there are Government Members. They debunked the myth that it is not possible to take on the Government. The reason for their defiance is simply that there is no more blood to be taken from that stone. How could it be otherwise when a majority of public sector workers who earn between €23,000 and €45,000 a year have endured a 22% pay cut and the Government wants to impose more on top of that?</p>

          <p eId="para_72">Where is the Government going? The labour and trade union movement was built on solidarity and sacrifice. The ambitions of people like Connolly and Larkin were not just about defending wages and conditions but also about developing a vision of a better society which puts the interests of ordinary people first. The Tánaiste has completely failed and abandoned that tradition.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> More than 100 years ago in Wexford, the constituency of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, future Labour Deputy, Dick Corish, led a strike of 700 workers at Pierce Foundry. It was a titanic strike for six months that won union recognition during which workers were bludgeoned on the streets. What would these self-sacrificing heroes think of the Minister? What would Dick Corish think of his county man, Deputy Howlin, imposing pay cuts of 7% at the behest of international financiers?</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> Since the Tánaiste does not believe in struggle and solidarity, is it not time he did the honourable thing and followed the path of the tradition that he is firmly in and, like Michael O'Leary before him, go off and join Fine Gael and bring the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with him?</p>

          <p eId="para_99">There is a huge problem of unemployment. The Government inherited a very big, deep financial problem when it was elected. When one has problems of such a scale one can either rant and chant about them, as Deputy Clare Daly does, or one can try to fix them, as the Labour Party entered government to do and is doing. Let us take the issue of youth unemployment. The Deputy is correct that the level of youth unemployment is much too high. Far too many young people coming out of college and university cannot find the type of employment their qualifications justify. One can either shout slogans about this or try to solve the problem. The Labour Party placed the idea of a youth guarantee on the agenda of the European Union and succeeded in negotiating a package of €6 billion to support the guarantee and enable us to put in place practical measures to resolve these problems. This is the reason, for example, that we work so hard to try to attract investment to this country and provide employment for young people coming out of college.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> It is remarkable that one can go through constituency after constituency and one will find the ultra left opposing every single proposal for industrial development or the location of industry. In my constituency, for example, a proposal by a company to provide additional employment is being actively opposed by Deputy Daly's colleagues on the benches opposite. The Deputies cannot have it both ways. They cannot chant, rave and shout slogans about youth unemployment and then oppose every single measure that is taken, whether to correct the public finances or locate a particular industry in a particular area to try to solve youth unemployment. </p>

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that in relation to the Maternity Protection (Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas) Bill 2013, the Second Stage of which shall be considered tomorrow, the following arrangements shall apply: the opening speech of Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl, or a Member nominated in his stead, and the main spokespersons for Sinn Féin, the Technical Group and a Minister or Minister of State, who shall be called upon in that order and may share time, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 15 minutes and such Members may share time; a Minister or Minister of State, who may speak twice, shall be called upon not later than 1 p.m. to make a speech which shall not exceed 15 minutes; and Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl, or a Member nominated in his stead, shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.</p>

          <p eId="para_109"> The last time a Private Members' Bill was taken on a Friday, I stated it was a shame that we were getting into the habit of ordering business in this fashion. It is for a Member to present a Private Members' Bill and the Government to indicate whether it is accepting it. I feel strongly about this matter because the House should order its own business.

          <p eId="para_111">The idea of a Private Members' Bill is that Members rather than parties have a right to introduce legislation. This procedure worked well when we were allowed to call speakers as they indicated, irrespective of whether they wished to speak for two minutes or five minutes. It is wrong that the House is going down the road of ordering everything. Private Members' Bills are not about the Opposition and Government having their say.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">I beg the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence for a moment. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I express sympathy to people in the town of West, near Waco in Texas, on the appalling tragedy that is unfolding as we speak as a result of an explosion at a fertiliser plant. The enormity and scale of the tragedy is truly shocking. I extend our sympathies to all those who may have been bereaved or severely and gravely injured as a result of the explosion.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> On domestic matters, thankfully Chief Justice Susan Denham yesterday evening announced a new forum for communication between the Judiciary and Executive. The Government has accepted her proposal and, having called for such a forum two days ago, I welcome this development. I hope common sense and decency will prevail and the forum will prevent the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, from losing the run of himself from time to time. The Minister has isolated the Garda and annoyed the Judiciary and more groups may come. The publication of the mediation Bill has never been so eagerly awaited as mediation is clearly required. Will the forum announced by Chief Justice Denham require the enactment of the mediation Bill? Will the Tánaiste provide a timeline for its publication?</p>

Our thoughts are with those who are no doubt worried with regard to what has happened there. I was informed about this matter early this morning by our consulate in Chicago, which covers Texas and which is in contact with the authorities in Texas. The staff of the consulate and my Department are available for any Irish citizens or families who may be concerned about loved ones who may be in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> I wish to make two points in respect of the other matter to which Deputy Martin refers. Matters relating to discussions and contacts - whether formal or informal - between the Judiciary and the Executive should not be aired on the public airwaves.</p>

There is great concern with regard to this legislation, particularly as it relates to the future of municipal authorities. When will these Bills be presented to the Houses for debate?

          <p eId="para_123">What is the envisaged timescale with regard to the publication of the legislation to make provision for the judgment in the X case? Will it not be necessary to expand this legislation to embrace issues relating to the health of women in view of the evidence given by the clinical director of the National Maternity Hospital in the Coroner's Court in Galway yesterday to the effect that the law of this land actually threatens the lives of women? I refer to the assertion regarding the blanket ban on termination in circumstances where the health of a woman may be seriously compromised before it becomes evident, with certainty, that her life may be lost. Does the Tánaiste accept that a new issue has arisen in this regard and that the forthcoming legislation must embrace it?</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I commend the Ceann Comhairle on the remarks he made with regard to the ordering of business for tomorrow. I congratulate him on the way he has attempted to defend the rights of ordinary Members of the House. Since they were introduced, the Friday morning sessions have worked outstandingly well. A great deal of important legislation - introduced by ordinary Members from all parties - has been successfully ventilated in the House. I commend the Ceann Comhairle on defending the rights of ordinary Members in recent times. I refer, in particular, to those Deputies who no longer take the party Whip. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is present and I am of the view that a key step we could take would be to reform significantly the, in many ways, obnoxious Whip system. It does not matter whether they are members of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Socialist Party or the Labour Party or whether they are Independents, as elected representatives of the people all Deputies have inalienable rights. I hope the successful Friday sessions, without the imposition of the Whip system, will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> Will the Tánaiste indicate when it is intended to bring forward the criminal justice (corruption) Bill? In light of the huge recent public interest in reports which appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> over a number of weekends in respect of matters which apparently were not brought to the attention of the Moriarty tribunal, will it be possible for the House to obtain from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, an update in respect of what is happening in respect of the reports published by the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals last year?</p>

          <p eId="para_210">I am sure the Tánaiste is aware that many problems are developing with the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and rent supplement. Many landlords are looking for their premises back. Their tenants are at risk. Is there any way to introduce the important housing Bill instead of putting it off until the end of the year, as we are repeatedly told? This is a serious situation. This week, at least seven people in this position have approached me.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">The Government is introducing three housing Bills. The housing (amendment) Bill will amend section 1 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. Its heads have been approved by the Government and its publication is intended for this session. The housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is meant to strengthen the regulatory framework for social housing, including statutorily underpinning the new scheme of housing assistance payments. Its heads are expected shortly and its publication is expected for this year. A second housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will be published next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2013 to the House today. The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 so as to align certain provisions more closely with international standards, in particular those contained in the recommendations of the financial action task force, FATF. The Bill also aims to amend other provisions to reflect the experience gained from the operation of the Act since 2010. The legislation that we have in place to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing is already robust, effective and of the highest standard. This Bill will merely strengthen some of these provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> I would ask the House for its co-operation in ensuring the speedy passage of this Bill so that it may become law by the middle of June. This will allow us to inform the FATF at its June plenary of the legislative changes that have been made to the existing statutory framework. It will also enable the introduction of other necessary legislative measures that I intend to bring as amendments to the Bill at subsequent Stages of our deliberations.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 which came into operation in July of that year represented a radical overhaul of the system that was then in place. The Act responded to changes in how crime is committed and how the proceeds of crime are laundered. We all know that some criminals are quite sophisticated in the way they operate and adept at recognising opportunities for exploiting financial systems for their own benefit. Money laundering by its nature can be a quite complex crime; it happens in countries throughout the world and does not respect national boundaries. It is a global phenomenon which can only be addressed in any meaningful way with by an international response.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> On both the European and wider international stage significant work has been, and continues to be, carried out with the objective of preventing and tackling money laundering. The financial action task force, FATF, is an intergovernmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF standards, known formally as recommendations, are applied by its 36 members. More than 180 countries participate in its efforts through a global network of regional bodies. As part of its mandate FATF carries out evaluations of member states' compliance with its recommendations. Ireland was evaluated in 2006 and placed in what is known as the regular "follow-up process". FATF reviewed the 2010 Act after its enactment and has suggested a number of technical changes to it. In February 2011 the Department of Finance, which represents Ireland at FATF, submitted an action plan to FATF identifying action to be taken, including legislative amendments, to resolve these issues. The amendments to the 2010 Act in the Bill are, in the main, aimed at giving effect to those technical changes so that Ireland can be removed from the "follow-up process" at FATF's plenary session in June. This is an important step in protecting Ireland's reputation as a good place to do business and a country which enforces international standards in preventing and tackling money laundering.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> While the current Bill is essentially a technical tidying-up exercise, I would also like to mention the ongoing work at FATF and EU level which will require us to revisit this area in the coming years. In February 2012 FATF revised its standards with the aim of strengthening and protecting the systems in place to deal with money laundering and terrorist financing. The European Commission has recently adopted a proposal for the fourth EU money laundering directive which, in the normal way, will be the subject of discussions with member states with a view to adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. The purpose of this proposal is to replace the third EU money laundering directive, strengthen the EU's defences against money laundering and to give effect to the revised FATF recommendations. The first meeting of the Council Working Group to consider the proposal takes place next week under the Irish Presidency of the European Union. I wish the Department of Finance officials involved every success in their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The Bill under consideration today addresses FATF concerns with the current legislation as evaluated under the old FATF recommendations. While it would be preferable to legislate for the new recommendations now, that cannot be done until the final shape of the fourth EU directive is known, as it is the fourth directive which will give effect in European Union law to the new FATF recommendations, and neither can we afford to postpone making the amendments to the 2010 Act contained in the current Bill. I am advised by the Department of Finance that any prolongation of Ireland's stay in the FATF "follow up process" beyond June of this year could have negative consequences for our international standing. The Bill, therefore, is an interim measure. It provides for some technical adjustments to the 2010 Act to enhance our compliance with current international standards, but we will have to review the systems we have in place once the proposed fourth EU directive is enacted, and I expect, inevitably, revisit the issue in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> I would like, nonetheless, to mention some of the key elements of the revised FATF recommendations and the EU proposals. They include a more focused risk-based approach, which will require countries to understand the money laundering risks they face, and to ensure the right systems are in place to respond to them. It will necessitate the focused use of enhanced customer due diligence, CDD, measures where there is higher risk. I will digress briefly to explain that customer due diligence refers to the types of measure which banks and other designated persons must apply to assure themselves of the identity of a customer and the nature of his or her business. People will be familiar with banks seeking some form of ID, such as a passport, and proof of address, as in a telephone bill, before opening an account. In relation to commercial customers, these measures might include details of the ownership of a company and information on its business model. I apologise for the use of abbreviations and acronyms, but I will save the House considerable time if I refer to CDD from now on instead of customer due diligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Other aspects of the new FATF recommendations and the EU proposals are as follows: more transparency in relation to ownership and control of companies, trusts and other legal persons; clarification of the rules on CDD to ensure a better knowledge of customers and a better understanding of their business; expansion of provisions dealing with politically exposed persons to cover national as well as international organisations; including tax offences as a predicate offence for money laundering; and more effective international co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> I mention the new EU proposals so the House may be aware of them, but also because they touch on what are described as politically exposed persons, or PEPs, if I may be excused from using another acronym. I am conscious that PEPs in this context are different from PIPs in the context of the insolvency legislation. Today, we will have a mixture of both PEPs and PIPs, but that is nothing to do with money laundering. The 2010 Act already provides for PEPs who reside outside of the State. PEPs include senior judges, Ministers, Members of Parliament and senior officials. The three of us present in this House who are elected representatives are regarded as politically exposed persons. In that context it is not the exposure to the electorate that is necessarily envisaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> PEPs and their immediate family members and close associates are subject also to a number of additional CDD measures. These measures include, for example, a requirement to provide a designated person such as a bank with information on the source of wealth and funds underpinning transactions. The Mahon tribunal in its final report recommended an extension of PEPs controls to domestic PEPs. In its response to the tribunal's report, the Government signalled its acceptance in principle of the recommendations in this area. However, as<i>
						</i>the proposed fourth directive contains proposals on the extension of controls to domestic PEPs such as ourselves, any Irish legislation on the issue will have to await the enactment of the directive to ensure that it is properly compliant with the finalised directive at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> I will now outline the provisions of the Bill, which is a short Bill consisting of only ten sections. Section 1<b>
						</b>provides that "Act of 2010" means the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. As I mentioned earlier, the Bill amends existing legislative provisions in that Act. Section 2 provides for amendments to the definition of "occasional transaction" which is contained in section 24 of the 2010 Act. The current definition provides that an occasional transaction, in relation to a customer of a designated person, means a single transaction or series of transactions that are or appear to be linked to each other and the total amount exceeds €15,000. The rationale for this definition is to ensure that obligations in the Act such as CDD, which apply when there is a business relationship, also apply once a transaction or series of transactions reach this threshold. Section 2 provides for the lowering of this threshold in two situations, one relates to private members' gaming clubs where the value concerned in a transaction reaches €2,000. Lowering the threshold aligns the amount more closely with the approach taken in the third money laundering directive in relation to casinos, although I emphasise that these clubs are not casinos and such a change does not affect their status.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> The second situation relates to wire transfer funds and section 2 provides for the application of the definition of "occasional transaction" in such cases when an amount of €1,000 is reached. The provision will also apply to beneficial owners. The current situation is that the threshold for "occasional transactions" at which customer identification, including identification of beneficial owners is required, is €15,000. While Council Regulation 1781/2006 on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds requires money transmitters to obtain information on the sender, that is, name, address, account or other identification number, for any transmission of €1,000 or more, this does not include beneficial owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">This amendment will provide that identification of customers and beneficial owners must be carried out for amounts of €1,000 or more in the case of wire transfer of funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> Section 3<b>
						</b>amends section 33(1)(c) of the Act of 2010. Section 33 forms part of Chapter 3 of Part 4 which deals with customer due diligence, CDD, and sets out the circumstances when CDD measures must be taken, for example, when establishing a business relationship with a customer where existing documentation or information may not be adequate. The purpose of the amendment in the Bill is to align the wording contained in section 33(1)(c) more closely to international standards. It will not result in any substantial changes to obligations in the Act. It provides that CDD applies prior to carrying out any service for the customer if the designated person has reasonable grounds to suspect that the customer is involved in, or the service, transaction or product is for the purpose of, money laundering or terrorist financing.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Sections 4 and 5 amend sections 34 and 36 of the Act of 2010 which relate to the application of simplified CDD. The Act provides that a designated person is not required to apply the CDD measures specified in section 33(2) if the customer or product is a specified customer or specified product, as defined in section 34. Such customers and products are considered to be at low risk for money laundering or terrorist financing; hence the approach that the full range of CDD measures are not required. However, it is important to note that the monitoring obligations still apply in such cases and simplified CDD cannot be applied if there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing or where there are doubts about the veracity or adequacy of information or documentation previously obtained. The purpose of the amendments is to make it explicit in the legislation that a designated person must take the necessary measures to establish that the particular customer or product is one to which such provisions can be applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Section 6<b>
						</b>amends section 37 of the Act of 2010 which deals with politically exposed persons, PEPs. This provision applies to a PEP residing outside of the State who has been entrusted with a prominent public function at any time in the preceding 12 months. A designated person is required to apply enhanced CDD measures to such persons, which includes obtaining approval from senior management before entering into a business relationship and determining the source of wealth and funds. The amendments to section 37 contained in section 6 provide that such measures must also be applied to an existing customer who becomes a PEP. It also explicitly provides that enhanced ongoing monitoring must be applied to all PEP customers. I propose to bring forward some drafting and technical amendments on Committee Stage to clarify this provision further.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> Section 7<b>
						</b>amends section 39 of the Act of 2010 which deals with the application of additional CDD measures, that is, enhanced CDD, to a customer or beneficial owner where there is a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. The current legislative provision provides for the option of applying enhanced CDD by the designated person. The amendment to section 39 provides that enhanced CDD must be applied by the designated person where there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a heightened risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. This approach is also reflected in the amendments to section 54, which relate to policies and procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Section 8 amends section 54 of the Act of 2010 which deals with the internal policies and procedures that a designated person must put in place with a view to preventing and detecting money laundering and terrorist financing. In addition to the general obligations contained in section 54, certain issues are specifically mentioned in order to highlight their importance and to ensure that action is taken on them. Section 8 provides for the inclusion of policies and procedures dealing with the additional measures to be taken in accordance with section 39, that is, enhanced CDD and also dealt with in section 7 of this Bill. It also includes a specific requirement for designated persons to implement policies and procedures on keeping their customers' documentation and information up to date and on potential risks arising from technological developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> Section 9 amends section 71 of the Act of 2010 to extend the type of directions that a State competent authority may issue to a designated person, thereby increasing and improving existing enforcement powers. Section 71 currently provides that a State competent authority may, by notice in writing, direct a designated person for whom it is a competent authority to discontinue or refrain from specified conduct. The new provision will enable a State competent authority to also issue positive directions, that is, to direct a designated person to take specific actions or establish specific processes or procedures that, in the opinion of the State competent authority, are reasonably necessary for the purposes of complying with any specified provision in this Part of the Act. The new provision will also now provide that such directions may be issued to a class of designated persons. This power will enable State competent authorities to recognise and cater for the different compliance issues that might arise as between the different businesses or sectors for which they are responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> I will now outline a number of proposed amendments to Bill to be introduced on Committee and Report Stages. I intend to introduce a number of amendments to deal with the threat to life and property posed by explosive devices which make use of mobile communications technology in their construction or activation. As this issue is not directly related to money laundering, it may necessitate a change in the title of the Bill to something more general, such as the Criminal Justice Bill 2013. The purpose of these amendments will be to allow for a direction to issue to mobile communications service providers to cease service provision in a limited geographical area in order to prevent death or damage to property. The provision will contain safeguards to ensure that any interference with services is limited to the extent necessary to deal with the threat. Deputies might be interested to know that it is my understanding that this type of measure for which we intend to make statutory provision is what occurred in Boston this week, when two atrocities took place and steps were taken to prevent the use of mobile phones over a period of time. As these provisions are outside of the scope of the current title of the Bill, it will be necessary to amend the title of the Bill. In order that the full House will have an opportunity to consider these new elements of the Bill, I am advised that they should be introduced on Report Stage rather than during the Select Committee debate. </p>
          <p eId="para_245"> In addition to those proposed amendments, I hope that it may be possible to bring forward, as Committee Stage amendments, some provisions which were contained in the general scheme, as published last year. Because of the pressure on the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel arising from the increased burden of troika-related legislation, it was not possible to include them in the Bill as originally published. Their inclusion in the list of Committee Stage amendments is still subject to that caveat. These amendments include a provision to transfer the authorisation and monitoring of trust or company service providers, TCSPs, which are subsidiaries of credit or financial institutions to the Central Bank; an amendment to the existing record-keeping provisions so that records may be stored outside the State; an amendment to section 17 of the Act of 2010 dealing with court orders; an amendment to section 35 of the Act of 2010 related to the monitoring of unusual and complex transactions; and amendments to sections 104 and 109 dealing with the registers for TCSPs and private members' gaming clubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> In conclusion, I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies during this debate and I hope that the House will support the passage of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Deputy Niall Collins<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_247">My party will be supporting the speedy passage of this Bill, which is of great importance in the fight against criminality, both domestic and international. The Bill updates legislation passed in 2010 which transposed EU directives and UN conventions into Irish law. The aim of the Bill is to combat the efforts of criminals and their associates to conceal the origin of the proceeds of criminal activity or to channel money into terrorist activity. In light of the ongoing threats from dissident republicans and criminals across the country, the need to tackle money-laundering is of particular importance in this country. Criminal activity, including diesel laundering, racketeering and illegal tobacco sales, undertaken by a rump republican movement continues to present a serious threat to law and order in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">In conjunction with this Bill, gardaí must be better resourced in meeting this threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> The Bill extends and clarifies the criteria laid out in the original Fianna Fáil Bill from 2010. A key element in the legislation is the application of customer due diligence, CDD, or measures on the part of the designated persons covered by the Bill, which include requirements to identify the customer and any beneficial owner and verify that identity. The CDD measures involved include identification and verification of customers and the monitoring of transactions and services. There are also obligations to report suspicions of money laundering to An Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners, and to ensure that there are specific procedures and policies in place to reduce the risks of money laundering. The Bill directly touches upon sums of money being shifted through under-regulated private member gaming clubs and tightens oversight to these potential avenues for laundering. It has been well known for years that gambling and gaming has been an area where money has been laundered, with casinos and on and off-course betting venues being used. We must consider that in a broader context.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> These measures will ensure that Ireland is fully compliant with its EU and UN obligations to tackle the scourge of money laundering and adapt changes based on the experience of operating the system since 2010. The ongoing serious criminal dissident republican activity is being fuelled by illicit funding through a number of revenues, such as the aforementioned illegal tobacco sales and the washing of diesel to be sold at a cost to the State. Unfortunately, the violent death of prison officer David Black and the bloody gangland feud in Dublin are the direct result of this financing, leading to a very detrimental effect on our international reputation, which is important in attracting foreign direct investment and securing much-needed employment. Anything that hampers our competitiveness and the view of the international community must be met head on, with gardaí having the resources to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 transposed the Third Money Laundering Directive 2005/60/EC and its implementing directive, 2006/70/EC, into law. It also gives effect to certain recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, and the international anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing body, which was established by G7 countries. The Act consolidates Ireland's existing anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws, which until then had been contained mainly in the Criminal Justice Act 1994. Significant reform has been required since in order to catch up with modern practices used by international criminal communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> The Act increases the obligation on a wide range of designated persons, including credit and financial institution personnel, lawyers, accountants, estate agents, trust and company service providers, tax advisers and other with regard to money laundering and terrorist financing. That should be welcomed and we have seen over the years the operations of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, with the offices of very professional people raided and documents seized in pursuing the ill-gotten proceeds of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> There is criminality associated with dissident republican activity and it is noteworthy that it has been mentioned by the US State Department, as we have mentioned to the Minister before. Its report on terrorist financing cited the major role of tobacco sales for laundering purposes and specifically mentions the role of the Real IRA. It is indicated that "the production, smuggling and sale of tobacco products, including genuine and counterfeit cigarettes, is a lucrative form of financing for organised crime, as well as terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Kurdistan Workers Party and the Real Irish Republican Army". The CAB, which is the multi-agency body staffed from the taxation areas, Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, as well an Garda Síochána, must play a central role in identifying money laundering activities and assets from groups such as the Real IRA and the newly emerged IRA alliance of dissident groups. These criminals and dissident republicans have been waging a campaign of violence against the people of Ireland that is funded by a series of money laundering processes, turning illicit funds to the purpose of fuelling terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> Unfortunately, we have seen these activities spilling to the streets of our country, particularly in Dublin, which puts our country and capital in a bad light internationally. We must take every measure to fight this, and I am sure when this legislation is enacted it will go some distance to targeting the individuals who are damaging the image of our country by killing, maiming and robbing people and the Exchequer. In that way they are robbing every citizen in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> The Minister mentioned that he intends to introduce some amendments to widen the scope of the Bill, which is to be welcomed. The Minister mentioned the events in Boston, where it was reported that the communications network was shut down to avoid further bombs being detonated by remote telephone technology or mobile telephone. It would be a welcome move to introduce that here. We must consider other aspects as well, including the use of smartphones and other telephone technology by the prison population. Unfortunately, people manage to smuggle telephones into our prisons and recent court reports indicate that drug dealing is being done from prison cells, with people brought before the courts as a result. I was recently made aware of a disturbing case with a person serving a sentence and with a number of serious charges, including murder, before him, had been corresponding with people on Facebook. It is obvious that this individual has a smartphone available to him while he is in prison. We must use the opportunity presented here to consider the issue and put legislation in place allowing telephone companies to block signals in certain parts of prisons. We should avoid, as much as possible, leaving an opportunity for people in prison to operate telephones smuggled into the facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> With regard to the Bill's wider context, the Minister is aware that Retail Ireland has put a value of crime associated with all illegal activities around the country. It is not my figure or that of my party. It takes in digital piracy, illegal tobacco, counterfeit goods such as clothing and medicines, drugs and illegal diesel.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">These cost the Exchequer and society in the order of €850 million per annum. Any crude cost-benefit analysis will show that if we invest more in State agencies such as the Revenue and the Garda Síochána, we will make inroads into that figure of almost €1 billion that is being taken out of the economy each year by criminals. By investing resources in State agencies, the figure will be dented and there will be a positive return for the country and the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> The Minister mentioned the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners. It was disappointing to hear the Minister announce yesterday that he would not now bring a proposal to Cabinet to recommence recruitment and training, as he had indicated at the AGSI conference. We have debated this many times. The force currently stands at 13,300. If the retirements continue at the current rate, we will be in a critical situation. The new roster is structured around a minimum complement in the force of 13,000 at a minimum. If numbers fall below that, we are into the serious situation where the roster is unworkable. The Minister knows the lead-in time for getting new recruits through the application, screening and interview processes and that training takes a long time, up to 18 months. When we factor that into the numbers leaving the force, we are heading for a dangerous situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> This shows the Government did not have a plan B in the event of the Croke Park II agreement not being ratified. For Garda recruitment and training, there must be a plan A and a plan B as soon as possible. Connecting Garda recruitment to the agreement was not satisfactory given gardaí are tasked with the security of the State and if the numbers fall below the critical level, the security of the State is at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> I have raised this with the Minister before. He ran a recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces recently, with 600 new entrants joining. People ask me why there is recruitment into the Defence Forces but not into the Garda Síochána. I urge the Minister not to perform a U-turn on the announcement he made at the conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. It is high time recruitment recommenced, particularly given the importance of the role played by gardaí across the State, the importance of the fight against serious criminality, and the loss to the Exchequer resulting from that criminal activity of almost €1 billion per annum. I urge the Minister and his colleagues to rethink the recruitment campaign into the Garda Síochána outside of the context of the Croke Park Agreement.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_261">Sinn Féin welcomes this Bill and will support its passage through the House. We must all continue to work hard to ensure it is made increasingly tough for those involved in criminality to channel their money in a way that allows them to live a lifestyle repugnant to any sense of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> For too long, many of our communities have faced the scourge of organised criminality and criminal gangs. Over the years we have had instances where governments have been slow to tackle this and unwittingly allowed criminals to operate all too easily. Dublin in the 1980s was in the throes of a massive drug epidemic. Limerick became a city people were afraid even to visit because it was referred to so often as "stab city", a massive disservice to the wonderful and resilient people of the city. The gangland killings on the streets of Dublin continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> Sinn Féin has repeatedly criticised the failure of successive Twenty-six Counties Governments to seriously tackle the causes of organised crime across the State. Substantial cuts to front-line services, both statutory and community, in the most disadvantaged and vulnerable communities across this State can only benefit these criminal gangs. Also, cutting Garda numbers by 10% can only benefit these gangs. The previous Government and the existing Government have operated and are operating, respectively, a policy of removing resources from gardaí to the point that we may fall below the unacceptable threshold of 13,000 in numbers. I noted the Minister's comments that the Croke Park II agreement vote will cause a delay in recruitment, but I appeal to the Minister and the Government to resolve this as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Often much of the criminality narrative and reporting has centred on drugs, but this is not the only type of criminality facing us. We must also tackle diesel laundering and cigarette smuggling head on. Retail Ireland has pointed out that this recession has led to an increase in fuel smuggling and the sale of smuggled cigarettes. The impact of these activities has been very serious for our domestic economy. Last year Retail Ireland reported that 12% of all diesel sold in Ireland was illegal, 19 oil laundries were detected and closed, and 690,000 litres of oil were seized. These are massive figures which are having a huge effect on our economy and also hurting the communities in which they are taking place. Almost 25% of the Irish cigarette market is sourced from the black market and in 2011, 109 million illegal cigarettes, with a value of €45.9 million, were seized.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> The Exchequer is losing €861 million annually because of illegal black market activity and theft. We are already seeing a struggling retail sector as a result of the economic downturn and now we are seeing it suffer again because of the sale of counterfeit and smuggled goods. Retail Ireland has stated that sales have fallen by over 30% since the start of the recession and thousands of jobs have been lost. It is crucial that this sector is not further squeezed by illegal criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> We must take on board some of the recommendations that have been put forward in this area. Retail Ireland, when addressing the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, offered to put money towards the scanners that could be used to detect illegal goods concealed in large containers that are coming into our ports. This is a simple, cost-effective action that can be taken to tackle this type of smuggling head on with fast and effective results. Retail Ireland also raised the open selling of counterfeit cigarettes in markets and the need to deploy Garda resources to police this. Mobile scanners can be used to detect these counterfeit tobacco products. The presentation by Retail Ireland not only outlined the scale of the problem but outlined solutions, and I commend it to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> We must be more serious about white collar crime. The Minister will have been alarmed, as I was, to learn that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, including journalists from institutions as eminent as <i>The Guardian</i>, the BBC and <i>The Washington Post </i>, had uncovered a huge network of offshore accounts and tax avoidance schemes. It is estimated that, globally, €16 trillion to €25 trillion is lost from states as a result of this tax avoidance.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> People in this State were identified as playing a role in that. In this State historically we have seen accountants and solicitors who have colluded in this practice and encouraged clients to participate in this criminality, denying the State badly needed revenue for hospitals, school and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">There was the spectacle of the Ansbacher scandal a number of years ago. How many went to jail over that scandal? Repeatedly, the people are exposed to white-collar crime which has an even more devastating impact than many of the cases that go through the circuit and district courts every week, but yet very few serve real time and pay the price for that. The deterrent needs to be much stronger. There has been plenty of forewarning of offshore accounts and tax avoidance. When will we deal with that? When will we demand full accountability from banks and all the professional classes to ensure that this stops once and for all? It is a global challenge, but Europe could lead the way with further amendments to legislation on these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> As a party, we call not only for international co-operation on matters such as this, but also for a strong all-island policing policy. This is not merely an all-island issue. We need to tackle this internationally, and as strongly as possible. There can be no hiding place for criminals to squirrel away their illegally gained moneys and we must make sure of this, through international co-operation and co-operation on this island between our two policing services. In the recent past I had the privilege of meeting Assistant Garda Commissioner Kieran Kenny who is responsible directly for that relationship and the co-ordination between the PSNI and the Garda, and I was reassured by the messages I received from him and the practical examples of co-operations. I commend both police services for that and I hope to see more stronger co-operation in tackling the scourge of criminality on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> I take this opportunity to re-pledge my party's support for the Criminal Assets Bureau on its significant successes. The CAB is a vital instrument in combatting gangs, going after what these people hold most dearly - their money. According to its latest figures, the CAB has seized more than €133 million of illicit profits from criminal activity since its foundation in 1996. I very much welcome this, but Sinn Féin would like to see some changes to how this money is used.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> My party has made a number of attempts - I, personally, have made one attempt - to bring forward a Private Members' Bill which would ensure that the money seized is ring-fenced for and reinvested in the communities worst affected by this type of activity. It was ruled out of order because of the cost to the Exchequer rule. I disagree with that. Our proposals would not be a cost to the Exchequer and would be cost neutral, but there it is. I would encourage the Minister to look at that. The money seized should be pumped into drugs task forces and community projects supporting communities affected by drugs crime and other crimes. Approximately, €14 million was seized solely under the proceeds of crime legislation between 2006 and 2010, and we have asked the Government to retain this money for community development purposes. This is separate to the money that is seized by CAB for revenue and social welfare fraud. It is the money taken from drug dealers and criminals who are profiting from the communities they are terrorising.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> The Government continues to cut community funding in general and the current legislation allows for all moneys collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau to be returned to the Exchequer in accordance with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 and 2005. The funds are then paid into the Government's Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure. If the Government had the political will to fund these much needed community organisations, it could easily do it by amending the Proceeds of Crime Acts. Sinn Féin calls on the Government to introduce this mechanism to fund local drugs task forces and community groups in the worst affected areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Before I conclude, I would bring the Minister's attention to a couple of issues. Some of the previous money laundering Bills have had knock-on effects for some ordinary citizens inadvertently caught-up in criminal investigations. Can the Minister reassure me that if a person is cleared of any suspicion here, this will be the case internationally? We have seen situations where a person may have had money placed in his or her accounts by accident, arose suspicions, been cleared and then had it held against them while travelling. We need to ensure that the right procedures are taken to ensure data protection and consistency are followed. These laws also place a greater onus on small businesses to pour more resources, often with a financial impact, into identifying customers. We need to ensure that in any legislation such as this that we are passing the House does not contain anything that has the potential to make life difficult for normal citizens and small businesses. Can the Minister assure me that where this Bill means a small-business owner must take steps to further establish a customer's identity and there is a financial burden, the small business will be compensated for this? I suggest that some of the money seized may be used to make provision for businesses affected in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> I reiterate my support and that of my party for this Bill. However, I seek reassurance from the Minister on those issues to which I referred before it reaches the next Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">I welcome this Bill as something which is more than necessary. The calm and measured way in which it is being introduced and welcomed in this House suggests it is almost a rubber-stamping procedure, it would automatically go through and there is not really anything important behind it. That disguises to some extent the alarm bells that had been ringing on money-laundering, not only in the world but, specifically, in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> Most Members of this House will be aware that several of the largest banks in the world, included the blue-blooded Coutts Bank in the United Kingdom and the HSBC overseas, have been involved in fairly massive money-laundering in the past decade much to the surprise of the innocent who feel that big banks somehow do not get involved in this sort of thing and have been outed for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> There is a global body to which the Minister referred call the financial action task force, FATF, which was set up in 1989 to counter this on a global basis. I will not say it has been singularly unsuccessful but it has certainly been unsuccessful because money-laundering to the extent of 2.7% of global GDP has been carried on a fairly regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> This is a chronic problem, by definition not discovered. As new rules are introduced, it is a little like how accountants behave after a budget. In this case, the criminals find new ways of by-passing these new rules. It is a serious global problem and in measured terms, if the 2.7% figure is correct, it is one which needs tackling urgently and has not been resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> Why, in Ireland, are we introducing this Bill? It is because it is a fairly urgent problem here as well but it is something which, when commentators talk about it, tends to turn one off. The Bill is somewhat technical and the Minister's speech is full of acronyms and terms which make it difficult to understand, but the problem is considerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> The Bill comes in the wake, not of calm automatic background measures which are introduced on a regular basis but of a serious warning by the Central Bank last year about Ireland's compliance with money-laundering standards. Ireland's compliance with money-laundering standards have been fairly pitiful. In October last, the Central Bank warned that the country's banks and financial institutions are failing to comply fully with the law on money laundering. The Central Bank supervisory team wrote a letter to the chief executives of all Irish regulated banks and financial institutions in the country in which it warned that the regulator may take enforcement action against institutions that are found to be in breach of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">They had carried out an 18 month inspection that audited those 60 financial institutions across the country and those inspections revealed what it called "a significantly lower level of compliance" with the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 than had been expected. That is Central Bank speak for a pretty slovenly compliance regime in Ireland. It does not like spelling this out because of the ripple effects it might have overseas with consequent reputational damage. It stated that Irish firms should bear in mind "the reputational considerations both for the financial services industry and Ireland as an international financial services centre".</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> As a result of our non-compliance Ireland was put on what is called the follow-up process by FATF, the international body, which means we are on watch for not complying and are in the bad books of the international policemen who inspect how we are behaving. One would not think that from what we heard today - one would think this was some sort of regular automatic routine Bill, but it is not. It is required in order to remedy that we are in a follow-up process meaning we are under the watchful eye of the inspectors or the international regulators because they do not like what they see.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> I welcome that the Bill has been introduced. In his speech the Minister specifically asked us to pass it by June because the Government does not want to have to attend the FATF conference not having complied and not having introduced the necessary legislation to ensure we are ranked higher by the FATF process. It is an admission that for a long period of time the law in this area and practices in this area have been inadequate. For that reason we should welcome the Bill. However, given that we have had such a banking crisis since 2007-08, it is incredible that this particular area has not been properly tackled. Let us hope that this takes us away from the follow-up process, that we enforce the law properly and that it is internationally recognised that we are doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> Underlying this is the importance to Ireland of the IFSC. We have always patted ourselves on the back about the IFSC and since its introduction in 1987 it has been a significant success for Ireland. Let us recognise the role of former taoisigh, Albert Reynolds and Charles Haughey, and others, who, for all the bad things that some of them have done, had some sort of vision for the IFSC. It has been successful because it has brought a huge amount of international interest to the country, global investment and jobs. The jobs and spin-off effects have been fantastic, which must be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> However, there has always been a question mark around the IFSC and how it is being regulated. There has always been some concern that there are too many so-called "brass-plate" bodies in the IFSC - referring to organisations that only exist for money to go through. There has always been some concern over the identity of those sending money through, producing, of course, some limited amounts for the Exchequer, because the profits are made here and therefore they pay tax here. There has always been some concern that there are so many organisations, and always have been, which do not give a great deal of employment, but are registered here and have put up a brass plate. They are not banks, dealers or stockbrokers. They do not do anything particularly constructive in the financial world. There is no market there as such for what they are doing. The Bill, apparently, is to address that particular problem because of the potential reputational damage to which the Central Bank referred last year. It is possible that reputational damage is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> In 2005 <i>The New York Times</i> referred to Ireland as the "Wild West of European finance". That referred directly not just to the antics of Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society and others, but also to the possibilities for disasters and indeed those that had happened in the IFSC at the time. The reputational damage must be repaired or at least the reputation protected and the Bill goes some way towards that. If our reputation is damaged, the competitiveness of the IFSC will immediately deteriorate. We must remember this is not some kind of protected entity. The IFSC is in direct competition with London, Luxembourg and other financial centres throughout the world. If we get the reputation for not complying and being in the rear-guard of those who are complying with anti-money laundering rules that have been set, we will attract the wrong type of money and the wrong type of interest. While we have no figures on this, given that we were behind and it is necessary to do this in a hurry and that we were considered to be not complying properly I hope it does not mean that has already happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> There are real threats to the IFSC from elsewhere. It is a hot debate now and I know I would be in a minority on this side of the House on this as I support the Government very strongly. There is a real danger of the introduction of a financial transactions tax, FTT. If that is introduced there would be a real danger of a movement from here to the UK where it will not be introduced. We must not introduce a FTT which would result in money flowing out of here into Luxembourg and other financial centres. Other financial centres setting up outside Ireland are pointing the finger at us and looking to attract that money. Jobs would be lost. Companies that set up here have no affection for the place. They leave at dawn in slippered feet and that is the end of the story. Let us comply strictly and let us move from the bottom or the middle of the list up to those nations which are complying as fully as is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> Deputy Mac Lochlainn rightly referred to other incidents that have been so damaging to us, including Ansbacher. Wearing my patriotic hat, I am very glad it has not travelled too far from these shores. I do not know if the Ansbacher people broke money-laundering laws, but they certainly moved their money out and broke exchange-control laws. Not only has none of them ever been sent to prison, none has even been charged with anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">There were 120 of them. What message does this send out? It sends out the message that there is something pretty loose about compliance and enforcement in Ireland. People who pushed their money off to the Cayman Islands and elsewhere got away with it, but during a similar period those doing almost exactly the same thing, small operators who put their money in the United States to avoid DIRT at the behest or under pressure from the bank manager, were prosecuted. For years, <i>Stubbs Gazette </i>published all of those who put offshore what were small deposits compared to the Ansbacher people, who had made settlements and who had been prosecuted. They were named and shamed while the Ansbacher people made big payments and it was the end of the story, although they were participating in a massive tax evasion exercise. How did this happen? I do not know. Several weeks ago I asked the Revenue Commissioners about it at the Committee of Public Accounts and they spoke about the passage of time and that it would be difficult to do anything or prove anything, so they just took the money and did not think it was worthwhile prosecuting. Not one of the 120 people fiddling millions was touched. This is extraordinary. It sends out the wrong message. It sends out the message that we are not really a compliant nation and, of course, that if one is rich one gets away with evading tax but if one is poor one does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> What is the story with casinos in this country? I am not anti-casino because I must confess to an extraordinarily wild youth when I spend half my life in casinos in my teens and 20s. Are they legal or illegal? Are they policed or inspected? Are they watched, because casinos are one of the main avenues for money laundering? People can put half their money on red and the other half on black, lose half of it and walk away with a cheque for the other half from the casino and it is properly laundered in this way. Casinos here seem to operate in a twilight zone of semi-legality. If they do operate in such a twilight zone does it mean they are not inspected because they are not legal, or are they rigidly regulated?</p>

          <p eId="para_295">I am pleased to speak on the Bill. The financial action task force recommendations include more transparency on ownership and control of companies, trusts and other legal persons; the clarification of rules on customer due diligence to ensure better knowledge of customers and better understanding of their business; the expansion of provisions dealing with politically exposed persons to cover national and international organisations; including tax offences as a predicate offence to money laundering; and more effective international co-operation. Deputy Ross mentioned flowery and vague language which is difficult to understand. Surely these recommendations are prerequisites and we should already be co-operating.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> This week Ireland will chair a meeting on this issue and I wish the officials well in this regard. We have been exposed around the world as being weak in this area, and our financial crisis has surely laid bare any illusions of Ireland being a compliant country with strong laws. We have two Irelands, one for the rich and big business and another for PAYE workers and small businesses. The latter groups used to be the middle class, but have now been corralled into desperate poverty, penury and destitution while those in the Ireland which wrecked the country, who amount to fewer than 100 and possibly fewer than 50 or 60 people, have not yet been fully arraigned and brought before the courts. We hear talk about charges being brought and I do not know how many thousands of documents have been filed in the Garda investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> We have had no proper investigation of the banking crisis. The Ansbacher accounts were mentioned and the most recent financial crisis probably started much earlier than 2007 or 2008. We have had no meaningful investigation whatsoever because we are protecting senior people of past administrations. It must be the same for the current administration because it promised everything including burning the bondholders-----</p>

          <p eId="para_299">-----but nothing has been done. We have no meaningful accountability from senior politicians, senior officials, regulators, Central Bank governors and bank chairman. What we did was to increase their wages and bend or broke the rules to allow this despite the promises made. Consider how the staff of the former Anglo Irish Bank and the IBRC have been treated. They are badly needed to help the receiver follow the money and the wrongs done, but they are in a bitter dispute because they were promised by the Government that they would be protected and looked after but, for a small amount of money in the overall scheme of things, they are being held up as scapegoats and denied reasonable respect for their valuable work and what they try to do as ordinary workers. They are not the top elite which ruined the country and went mad. Most of the banks must take responsibility also. They all followed the lead set by Anglo Irish Bank, although they stated they had to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> Serious concerns have been raised about the IFSC because we are seen abroad as a bandit country which does not hold accountability in high regard. Former politicians, governors, regulators and senior officials are swanning off, with some promoted to Europe to get them out of the way at all costs in case there would be an inquiry and answers would be needed. What else would we be seen as but a rag bag of a republic or a banana republic? This is why we had such a low turnout in the Meath East by-election and why we will continue to have low turnouts. People are sick and tired of politics and what we have allowed to happen after the men and women of 1916 and 1921 fought so hard for our independence. Their memory has been besmirched by the antics of what has happened here over the past 20 years, particularly over the past ten years. It is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> Retail Ireland has stated rogue activity amounts to almost €1 billion annually. The Croke Park II agreement has been rejected, and rightly so in my opinion, because we were trying to crucify ordinary workers again for €300 million this year and €1 billion over three years, while almost €1 billion, and perhaps much more about which Retail Ireland knows nothing, has been siphoned off in the black economy. We let this go on. I do not know when I last met a customs official on the road. It is a pity the Minister for Justice and Equality is not here. These officials are not on the road any more because their staff numbers have been cut back. They do not have vehicles or resources. A blind eye is being turned to criminality, drug barons and money-laundering. Mention was made of Limerick and Dublin crime gangs. I compliment the Garda and the people of Limerick on how they have fought back and regained the good name of their city, which has been a proud place since Patrick Sarsfield's time. My town of Clonmel, the capital of south Tipperary and second biggest inland town in the country, operates on a shoestring with regard to Garda numbers and resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> I welcome the officials coming to Dublin this weekend and I hope they give a strong message to the Government and official Ireland that all is not well here, that we are not playing ball and that the fight against crime is muffled, with one hand behind our back and one eye covered with a patch. This is what the Minister for Justice and Equality has done. Last night he made a correlation between the rejection of the Croke Park II agreement and recruiting more gardaí, which he promised a month ago and which his colleagues in Tipperary welcomed. The doors of Templemore were going to be opened again and everything was going to be fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">We know how long it takes, however, and the figure is now down to 13,200. We know the basic required level is 13,000. It is wrong to say that it is because of the failure to ratify the Croke Park II agreement. Last week, another Minister threatened a 7% pay cut. It is Government by diktat and bullying. That is all going on while gardaí do not have the resources or numbers. Above all, they do not have the respect, co-operation or support of the Minister for Justice and Equality. Thankfully, someone spoke to the Minister in the last ten days at a senior level in Government and made him change his ways on recruitment and basic civility between An Garda Síochána and himself. Some long-awaited promotions were carried out which were required to fill vacancies created by people who had left. How can we fight crime or support legislation such as the Bill before us when morale is at an all time low in An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces?</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> Army battalions are being disbanded while barracks are being closed. Clonmel had an army presence for 350 years, yet the lovely barrack buildings are now going to rack and ruin, all in the interest of cuts. I do not know what vested interests the Minister seems to have. I have already questioned how he can be Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Defence. Is there a constitutional issue there? I do not have the expertise to decide on that, but a little more respect would go a long way.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> The banks and a handful of big business people ruined this country, yet none of them has been arraigned. I have been a small businessman for 32 years and I have always known that if one falsifies accounts in any way, for example, by moving money, even €500, between accounts to mislead accountants, it is a simple, naked crime. I cannot understand, therefore, how it can take the fraud squad, or whoever else is dealing with it in the Department of Justice and Equality, until now to prosecute people or bring them before the courts for basic fraud and fooling the accountants. The latter sign off on figures that are provided by self-employed people.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> That must be contrasted with ordinary business people, including small farmers and sole traders, around the country who are being persecuted by Revenue and sheriffs. On Monday night, I attended a suicide awareness meeting in a packed hotel in Clonmel. The county coroner spoke and in the past he has referred at inquests to State terrorism. We must tackle that first, alongside tackling the other terrorism, which I totally abhor. We must sympathise with the people of Boston this week. We do not yet know what happened near Waco in Texas, but it is so sad to see anything like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> The State cannot tackle terrorism on the one hand while allowing it on the other hand. How can Revenue be allowed to charge 1.25% interest per month, which is 15% annually, on people whom its decides owe it tax? I am not saying that anybody should get away with a penny of unpaid tax, but Revenue has a merciless approach. I have been speaking to Revenue officials today about a case in County Limerick where sheriffs have visited a family and devastated a business that existed for 35 years. When I attempted to intervene and deal with Revenue officials, they accepted my good offices but said the business had to come up with €15,000 by 5 p.m. tomorrow or else the sheriff would be back. The Revenue Commissioners do not have a clue what is going on in Ireland, especially in the agricultural sector, or any other economic area. The fields are barren and as bare as the Dáil benches. We had a terrible year in 2012, followed by a long winter and a horrible spring. Traders cannot get paid for their work and staff wages cannot be paid either, even though these people are making an effort to deal with Revenue. However, those who give Revenue the two fingers are not arraigned at all, despite threatening and intimidating officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> This Bill also needs to rein in overly ambitious sheriffs using bully-boy tactics under outdated legislation. To be fair to gardaí, they do not understand the situation. They think that when a sheriff comes with a warrant, which was not even signed in the case I am talking about, everything is all right. This situation must be dealt with because we are draining the lifeblood out of our recovering economy. It will kill the entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses, including farmers, sole traders, shopkeepers and self-employed tradesmen.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> We have been talking about the Construction Contracts Bill for three years, thanks to Senator Feargal Quinn, but it is still not in operation. That is because big companies do not want to be wound up. They have the power and are supported by the State, the Construction Industry Federation and all the other big business organisations. As Shakespeare wrote in <i>Hamlet</i>, "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark", but it is rotten in this country too, given that we have allowed these unbelievable tactics by big business and bankers. In addition, organs of the State are persecuting people and every letter they get threatens a jail term, yet the authorities cannot put in jail those who should be imprisoned, or even bring them before the courts. They will not be touched and it stinks to high heaven. Such people were protected by the previous Administration and, consequently, are also being protected by this Administration. It is time we woke up and smelled the coffee because people will not stand for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> I appeal for someone to examine how Revenue can charge 1.25% monthly on outstanding invoices, as well as sending the sheriff with a notice, plus his charges. They can put seized machinery on sale at an auction in Dublin with no VAT advertised on the website. I have asked Revenue to explain how these machines, which are seized on foot of a warrant, can be sold off for half nothing. Huge charges are incurred by Revenue with rogue people employed to collect these machines. They are nothing more than bandits creating misery from people's sweat and blood. They can then advertise the seized assets on websites with no VAT. Anyone in business earning over €14,000 per annum must be registered for VAT, so how can Revenue sell these machines without VAT? Does this have implications for the overall settlement by unfortunate businessmen with Revenue? It must have because there is no VAT.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> We must examine our own house first. It is a pity the Minister for Justice and Equality has left the Chamber. As Deputy Ross said, it is also a pity that this has been put in flowery language to try to cover up our inadequacies. We cannot carry on this cover-up for much longer, however. We have been found out by Europe and elsewhere internationally. The IMF knew we could not pursue the austerity policy and they have told us so now. This has been laid bare. We have a cosy cartel and a cover-up while crucifying and screwing the poor and ordinary people to allow for the downright sins and blackguardism of the 100 people, or fewer, who brought this country to its knees. Meanwhile, they continue unhindered and have not been brought before the courts. I will not say they have been found guilty because that is up to the courts, but we all know it is the biggest cover-up that ever went on in any country. The sooner it is exposed the better.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">The Bill before us seeks to amend the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. This is in light of the deficiency identified since its operation over the past two years, and also to enhance Ireland's compliance with the Financial Action Task Force standards following its evaluation of the 2010 Act. The 2010 Act consolidated the existing legislation in line with international standards. The Act also transposed the third money laundering directive into Irish law. The Financial Action Task Force is an inter-governmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. </p>
          <p eId="para_314"> The overall aim of the Bill is to strengthen and clarify measures to deter, detect and disrupt money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bill seeks to make amendments and, in so doing, make Ireland's anti-money laundering legislation more robust. This is in light of the experience of the 2010 Act's operations over the past two years. The main proposed amendment relates to customers' due diligence measures. This involves taking steps to identify customers and check whether an alleged identity is correct. Other proposed amendments include specific requirements for policies and procedures, and keeping customers' due diligence data and information up to date. The Bill also proposes to strengthen monitoring measures of designated persons. In addition, it includes a requirement for policies and procedures on measures to be taken to prevent the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing which may arise from technological developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> Money laundering is a process whereby the proceeds of crime are disguised in order to conceal their illicit origins. Financing terrorism is the provision of support to those who engage in, encourage or plan terrorism. When criminal activity generates substantial profits, the individual or group involved must find a way to control the funds without attracting attention to the underlying activity or persons involved. Criminals do this by disguising sources, changing forms, or moving funds to a place where they are less likely to attract attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Due to the underground nature of money laundering, it is not possible to give precise figures regarding the extent of the activity. According to a 2011 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in 2009 criminals and drug traffickers in particular may have laundered approximately $1.6 trillion or 2.7% of global GDP. This figure is consistent with the 2% to 5% range previously established by the International Monetary Fund to estimate the scale of money laundering. The process of money laundering involves three stages, the first of which is the initial or placement stage, whereby the illegal proceeds of crime are introduced into the financial system. This may be done by breaking up large amounts of cash into small less conspicuous sums that are then deposited into a bank account or by purchasing a series of monetary instruments such as cheques or money orders that are then collected and deposited into accounts at other locations. The second or layering stage involves a series of conversions or movements of funds to distance them from their original sources. This may be done by the purchase and sales of investment instruments, by wiring the funds through a series of accounts at different banks across the globe or by disguising the transfer as payments for goods or services, which may give them a legitimate appearance. The third or integration stage involves the re-entering the funds into the legitimate economy. This may be done by investment of the fund into, for example, real estate, luxury assets or business ventures. The current definition of "vocational transaction" provides that once the transaction or series of transactions exceed €15,000, obligations such as customer due diligence apply. Section 2 of the Bill amends this and lowers the monetary threshold to €2,000 in the case of a private member gaming club and €1,000 for wire transfers of funds. In all other cases, the definition applies when an amount of €15,000 is reached.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_317">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity of speaking on this new legislation. I welcome this important and urgent debate, as it is highly relevant to the modern world and, in particular, to the major crisis that exists both in Ireland and across the European Union, as well as internationally. In recent days, Members have seen the horrific effects on innocent people in Boston, as well as the slaughter of ten innocent children in Afghanistan two weeks ago. It is important to focus first on the victims of these heinous crimes. Blowing people to bits in Boston, Afghanistan, the West Bank, Omagh, Dublin or Monaghan should never be an option and should never be acceptable in any democratic society, nationally or internationally. The bottom line is it is completely unacceptable and Members should agree with this core principle. This is known all too well in this country and I commend all those who started our own peace process, faced up to the reality and used their skills in conflict resolution. Members should never forget and all should be vigilant to prevent it happening in the future. One should never take the peace process in Ireland for granted and all Members of the Oireachtas should be on their guard in respect of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> As for the legislation before Members, I was absolutely shocked and horrified when I saw some of the figures illustrating the scale of the problem. Due to the underground nature of money laundering, it is not possible to give exact figures in respect of the extent of the activity. However, according to a report produced relatively recently, that is, in 2011, by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in 2009 criminals and drug traffickers in particular may have laundered approximately $1.6 trillion or 2.7% of global GDP. This figure of $1.6 trillion internationally is a lot of money on which many countries could survive, particularly during the current economic crisis. Moreover, the figure is consistent with the 2% to 5% range previously established by the International Monetary Fund to estimate the scale of money laundering. It is important to consider the scale of the crisis internationally. When one then turns to the details of money laundering, it is the process whereby the proceeds of crime are disguised to conceal their illicit origins. The financing of terrorism is the provision of financial support to those who engage in, encourage or plan terrorism, because this all costs money. According to the World Bank, money launderers send illicit funds through legal channels to conceal their criminal origins, while those who finance terrorism transfer funds that may be legal or illicit in origin in such a way as to conceal the source and ultimate use, which is to support terrorism. The Financial Action Task Force, which is an intergovernmental body established in 1989 by the G7 group of countries to combat money-laundering, explains the concept of money-laundering in the following terms. When a criminal activity generates substantial profits, the individual or group involved must find a way to control the funds without attracting attention to the underlying activity or to those involved. Criminals do this by disguising the sources, changing the form and moving the funds from place to place, where they are less likely to attract attention. Again, I will focus on the details in respect of this aspect of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> It is important to get the facts right before having the balance and discussion. When one discusses the issue of money laundering, one must also keep a close eye on its close link, that is, to white-collar crime, because many so-called "respectable" individuals and businesses are directly involved in such activity. This is not acceptable and a justice system is required that ensures those involved in white-collar crime are prosecuted, charged and hounded. In addition, one must also accept the reality that people and states are involved in these issues. I saw an interesting programme this week broadcast by RTE, which dealt with Liberia, an extremely damaged country in Africa and the ongoing scandal there regarding diamonds. It showed how all the diamonds are being shipped out legally, while people are living in muck and dirt without toilets or water. Moreover, massive wealth is being generated there in this regard. Consequently, I believe there also is a political dimension to this debate, which is it is not simply or exclusively about the illegal stuff, as some of the activities that are taking place in states or internationally are unacceptable, full stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> It reminds me of the time in the 1980s when the merits of the Criminal Assets Bureau were being debated and I commend all those who were directly involved in it. I also will use this opportunity to pay tribute to my old colleague and friend, the late Tony Gregory, who was one of those who initially pushed for its establishment during the heroin crisis in the north inner city during the 1980s. He wanted the money confiscated from the drug gangs and drug lords to be pumped back into the disadvantaged communities. Tony was ahead of his time and most people who take an objective view on this issue would commend him and praise him. Consequently, it is fitting that Members honour him today in this debate when discussing these issues. I will go one step further in this regard. At present, a beautiful new bridge is under construction near the centre of the city and I propose it be named the Gregory Bridge, after Tony Gregory and in his honour. Moreover, this is related to the issue under discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> In addition, casinos must also be closely monitored when it comes to money-laundering. Nationally and internationally, there are casinos into which much of this money is dumped. Similarly, there are bookkeepers, bookmakers and others who have similar links and Members must be very careful of such groups. I am familiar with this issue from my experience of dealing with issues in my own constituency, where the drug gangs run parts of the city. Sadly, I refer to the amount of money that is made, the amount of money that is ripped off and the massive intimidation that takes place in communities. Members must stand up for those who are suffering at the hands of such people. Their money must be confiscated and I emphasise this money must be put into the most disadvantaged areas. One cannot have a situation in which drug gangs, drug leaders and people like that are amassing amounts of money, are getting involved in shootings and killings from which people walk scot free, as well as intimidating entire communities. This is the sad reality for many people in the Ireland of 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> A small point, which I regularly raise in this Chamber and for which I am regularly hammered and criticised, concerns the debate on cigarettes. There is a very significant trade in illegal cigarettes. I have met shopkeepers and people with small and medium-sized businesses on the front line who tell me that by not taking action regarding illegal cigarettes, €600 million per year is being lost in tax revenue. I note that this week the figure of €300 million is being discussed in the context of the Croke Park II deal and the amount of revenue that must be found by the end of July.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Revenue has lost through the illegal trade in cigarettes in the region of €600 million. Imagine the massive work and impact that would have if the Revenue Commissioners could bring that money in to provide services for people. This is a criminal activity which is directly involved with money laundering and it finances people with whom most people in this House would have absolutely nothing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> The overall aim of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2013 is to strengthen and clarify the measures to deter, detect and disrupt money laundering and terrorist financing. The important words are "deter, detect and disrupt". That is the core of the legislation. The Bill seeks to make amendments to the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 and so to make Ireland's anti-money laundering legislation more robust. I welcome that. We need to tighten up. We need to up our game and this Government needs to wake up and smell the coffee. The Minister for Justice and Equality needs to deal with the real issues and stop getting into trouble and having rows with judges and other people when he should be focusing on the issues affecting the people in this country. This Bill is introduced in light of the experience of the operation of the Act over the past two years and to enhance Ireland's compliance with the financial action task force, FATF, following the FATF's evaluation of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. I also welcome that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> The FATF is an inter-governmental body established by the G7 countries in 1989 in order to combat money laundering. It is regarded as a leading forum for international efforts to combat money laundering. It has issued a series of recommendations which aim to give guidance on the standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF recommendations have been amended several times, most recently in February 2012. I will address these when dealing with my amendments on Committee Stage. Three anti-money laundering directives have been introduced in order to reflect these recommendations with a fourth directive proposed to implement the new changes. It is important that we focus on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> We have a very strong self-interest in this legislation because of the reputational risks for Ireland as an international financial services centre. This has also been identified as a result of failure to comply with the anti-money laundering, AML, measures. Many of us are proud of our International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, but we must be vigilant lest the wrong elements exploit it and we must have regulation to ensure that straight money, not hot money, goes through the system. That is very important to prevent damage to the integrity of the financial services industry here. Many people who work in the IFSC, have concerns about that. We regularly hear moaning and whinging about the need for tight regulation. We must keep an eye on this and on the dodgy characters, the money launderers and those who are shipping the money in and out of accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> I read a figure over the weekend for offshore bank accounts in the region of €45 million. The Revenue Commissioners took in that sum but I would say there is much more money out there. Meanwhile we have rows here in the Dáil about the mobility allowance and all sorts of allowances that cost €10 million or €8 million or €13 million. Then one reads about the loss of €600 million through the sale of illegal cigarettes. Small businesses have told us about this at committee meetings. We have heard the facts, we have looked at the statistics. I harp on about smoking but when I buy 20 cigarettes I pay a considerable amount of the cost in tax. I have no problem doing that but I do have a problem with those who are involved in cigarette smuggling and illegal sales who are costing this State €600 million in lost revenue. We should wake up and do something about this problem. </p>
          <p eId="para_328"> It is important to consider the main changes in the FATF recommendations, which state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_329">Combatting the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction through the consistent implementation of targeted financial sanctions when these are called for by the UN Security Council. Improved transparency to make it harder for criminals to conceal their identities or hide their assets behind legal persons or arrangements. Stronger requirements when dealing with politically exposed persons, PEPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">A politically exposed person is one who has been entrusted with a prominent political function. I like that angle. There are many politically exposed persons in this Chamber every day but this has a special meaning in this legislation. FATF also proposes "Expanding the scope of money laundering predicate offences by including tax crimes".</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> There is something wrong with our justice system when people who are blatantly breaking the law get away scot free but a small business man who used a scam to import garlic from China is sentenced to six years in prison. Rapists, murderers and child abusers get three or four years but a man who put his hands up and paid back the tax he owed was sentenced to six years. Thankfully on appeal the judgment was reversed and he was released. He should have been given community service. That kind of sentence is off the wall and is not part of a proper justice system because there are other more serious issues to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> The FATF further says we need "More effective international cooperation including exchange of information between relevant authorities, conduct of joint investigations, and tracing, freezing and confiscation of illegal assets". International co-operation is very important. Sometimes this does not happen. Some people are precious about some of those directly involved in crime but we need to be consistent on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> Section 2 of the Bill proposes to amend section 24 of the 2010 Act and the definition of "occasional transaction" under that provision so that wire transfers of funds of up to €1,000 or more are included in the definition of customer due diligence, CDD. These measures will also apply to beneficial owners of such funds. Further, the monetary threshold is reduced from €15,000 to €2,000 for private members' gaming clubs for the application of customer due diligence measures. Section 8 proposes an amendment to section 54 (3) of the 2010 Act in order to insert an explicit reference to the requirements for policies and procedures on keeping the CDD data and information up to date and also on the additional proposed enhanced CDD measures to be taken in accordance with section 39.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> The proposed requirements for policies, procedures and measures to be taken prevent the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing which may arise from technological developments and the way in which services arising from such developments are delivered. This is a new angle. While the people employed by the Garda Síochána are of good quality and those in the Revenue Commissioners are top quality we need to ensure that they have the technological skills necessary to prevent the changes in the criminal world. Criminals use technology to get ahead of the law and order services and we need to be very vigilant about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> As this is a criminal justice Bill no regulatory impact analysis has been carried out. I am concerned about this. It has therefore not been possible to secure specific information for the potential cost to businesses which may arise as a result of the implementation of the proposed measures in the Bill. I have concerns about this aspect of the Bill. While it is a criminal justice Bill we must be vigilant about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> Regarding the implications for businesses of compliance with the 2010 Act, information about credit and financial institutions suggests that failure to comply with the requirements under the Act may result in greater financial implications for firms, compared with the costs of introducing these measures. Indicative of this is the settlement agreement reached by the Central Bank of Ireland, the designated authority to monitor credit and financial institutions under the 2010 Act, in June 2012 with a global banking and life company based in the IFSC. The firm was fined €65,000 for failure to demonstrate that it had instructed any of its staff or directors, with one exception, on the law in regard to money laundering and terrorist financing following the introduction of the 2010 Act. In a further case agreement was reached by the Central Bank in 2010 with the Community Credit Union Limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> In a significant case in the UK, the FSA fined Coutts banking group Stg£8.7 million in March 2012 for failing to take reasonable care to establish and maintain effective anti-money laundering systems and controls relating to high risks including politically exposed persons, PEPs. In a further high profile case, HSBC incurred significant penalties in the US due to its failure to maintain an effective anti-money laundering programme. Under the agreement reached with the US Justice Department, which included a deferred criminal prosecution, something I welcome, the bank must rectify the problems identified, forfeit $1.256 billion and pay $665 million in civil penalties. The bank also faces a fine from the FSA in the UK. Those are significant financial penalties and I raise them because I get sick to the teeth when services for the disabled and for poor, weak, vulnerable and disadvantaged people are cut by €8 million and so on. These penalties will not cause people engaged in the financial services industry a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> The Government is in a hole following the rejection of the Cork Park II agreement and needs to find €300 million. Rather than hammering low paid public sector staff, it should be creative. If the Government parties need a sheriff to come in, sort the issues out and get them out of a hole, why not bring in the former Senator, Joe O'Toole? He would talk to the Government and union representatives and come up with a solution. The Minister of State is aware that he would be well able to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_341"> It is all very well for the Opposition to have a go at the Government parties for the sake of it and I will always have a go at them when I think they are wrong but it is important that we put forward constructive funding proposals, a number of which I have mentioned. Significant sums could be confiscated from illegal money launderers and others involved in criminal activity, including drug trafficking. If that money was invested in community services, it would be important.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> I welcome the legislation and the common sense arguments in the debate because we all have a duty to save lives and prevent money laundering both in Ireland and internationally. When sums such as $1.6 trillion are bandied about, that highlights the potential to generate revenue in our badly affected economy. Sitting on the fence or standing idly by should never be an option.</p>

          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_343">I wish to share time with Deputy Seán Kenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> I welcome this amending legislation. The principal Act took into account many recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and terrorist financing. The primary purpose of the Bill is to take make technical amendments to the Act to align a number of provisions more closely with international standards. I am delighted that we are working on an international basis because money laundering is not confined to individual jurisdictions. The main provisions in the Bill lower the monetary threshold at which a customer is subject to due diligence to €2,000 in private members' gaming clubs and €1,000 for wire transfers. The black economy has developed over the years and there has been a great deal of money laundering. This money is ill gotten and generated through various schemes such as the sale of illegal drugs, illegal gambling and the sale of illegal cigarettes, which is a major issue, as Deputy McGrath pointed out. That is causing significant damage to our economy and to people's health. The cigarettes are being imported from outside the EU and they are probably much worse for people's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> We need to tackle fuel laundering, in particular. The Garda is working with the PSNI and other security forces but the issue has worsened. I live 40 miles from the Border and I have travelled through the country. Many petrol stations, which I thought were bona fide, have been closed. This has put pressure on Exchequer finances and laundered fuel has resulted in a great deal of damage to cars. Insurance companies should be asked to conduct an analysis of the cost to motorists. Six months ago, my car fell victim to laundered fuel and it cost €6,000 to replace the engine. Not alone is the Exchequer losing money through the failure to pay VAT and other taxes, this practice is causing huge problems for insurance companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> Many people with excess money to spend visit bookmakers' sites online and they can gamble on all the horses in one race, for example. They can surely win but that money is going back into the system. This industry needs to be examined in more detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> I attend meetings all over the country and people are furious that those who brought the State to its knees continue to drive around in state-of-the-art cars, take holidays and travel first class and they do not seem to be affected by what happened. Where did the money come from for this? As a former Member said a few years ago, they are living the lives of rock stars. Many people are in difficulty, with most of them in negative equity. They are fuming because they do not know where this money is coming from. It does not set the right example.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> I pay tribute to the Garda and the customs and excise officials. Criminals are using technology and, therefore, the Garda needs to use technology, as Deputy McGrath said. There has been much debate over the years about the closure of small Garda stations. I acknowledge the Garda must adopt a more technological approach but I would prefer to have a team of gardaí work together to combat money laundering and the black economy than to deploy a garda in a local barracks who spends his time stopping people for not having a light on their bicycles.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> We must have a measured and informed debate. Everything is more mobile nowadays. Money can be sent all over the world from a person's iPhone.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">We all want local gardaí and Garda stations but we also need a Garda task force that will work alongside others to target and prevent money laundering. While it is not possible to provide precise figures on the scale of the money laundering problem, it is estimated that it accounts for a staggering 2.7% of global gross domestic product and generates approximately €1.6 trillion per annum. Preventing it presents a major challenge for governments and law enforcement agencies across the world. This legislation brings Ireland into line with international standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> The Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, has done significant work since his appointment three years ago. Members of the public do not fully understand the progress he has made in tackling light touch regulation, which effectively meant no regulation. His appointment was a departure from the practice of seeking an Irish solution to an Irish problem. He came here from abroad and has done an excellent job, although the difficult decisions he has taken have sometimes been hard to accept in such a small country. Mr. Elderfield's legacy is one of imposing proper systematic controls on the banking and financial services sectors. I met him once three years ago and wish him well wherever he goes. It will be difficult to find a replacement for him. I welcome the changes provided for in the legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Kenny<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_352">I am pleased this important legislation is before the House and I am happy to support it. The original Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act was enacted in July 2010. The new Bill transposes the European Union third anti-money laundering directive into Irish law and requires firms and persons subject to its provisions to apply customer due diligence measures. These measures are intended to apply to businesses and banks where large transactions occur. The purpose of lower financial limits for private gambling houses is to prevent such entities from becoming places where money and criminal proceeds are laundered. The inclusion of gambling houses in the legislation is particularly welcome given the discovery during the Mahon tribunal hearings that some of the gentlemen who came before the tribunal had connections to such entities. I recall that one particular gentleman had a connection to a type of casino in O'Connell Street where one arm bandit machines operated. I believe he informed the tribunal he used to visit the premises during his lunch break to see how business was going. I am pleased, therefore, that this type of activity is covered by the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> The Bill also covers the obtaining of information about the business relationship involved in transactions, conducting ongoing monitoring of such business relationships to ensure transactions being conducted are consistent with the knowledge of the customer, the business and risk profile, including, where necessary, the source of funds, and ensuring that documents, data or information held are kept up to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> Different levels of customer due diligence can be applied. A designated person does not have to identify information on the purpose or intended nature of the business relationship of a customer or beneficial owner where the customer is considered to present a low risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. However, the designated person must obtain sufficient information about the customer to satisfy himself that the customer meets the criteria for this simplified customer due diligence to be applied correctly. In circumstances where a high risk of money laundering or terrorist financing is identified, the designated persons are obliged to undertake customer due diligence measures above and beyond normal measures. These are referred to as enhanced customer due diligence procedures. The extent of the additional information sought and any monitoring carried out in respect of any particular customer will depend on the money laundering or terrorist financing risk the customer is assessed to present.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> The EU third anti-money laundering directive prescribes three specific circumstances where enhanced customer due diligence measures must be applied. The first is where the customer has not been physically present for identification purposes, while another is in respect of a correspondent banking relationship. It is noteworthy that the enhanced customer due diligence measures also apply to elected representatives and politically exposed persons in the context of business relationships or occasional transactions. This returns me to the Mahon and Flood tribunals which discovered untoward dealings that would not otherwise have come to light. The promised anti-corruption Bill, which will shortly come before the House, will deal with people who were involved in this type of behaviour. It is preferable, however, to have proper business and banking practices in place to avoid such circumstances arising in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> A third element of the customer enhanced diligence provisions seeks to prevent political support for terrorism in the parliaments of European Union member states. This is a positive development, particularly in the context of terrorism which is sometimes politically motivated. Elected representatives must be open to scrutiny in this regard, as provided for in the new Bill. I welcome the directive and this supporting legislation and commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_357">I welcome this important legislation, which I have called for on many occasions, and compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House. We have learned from the downturn in the economy that there was a lack of adequate regulation, oversight and accountability in certain areas of society. We know where this has brought us.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> The financing of terrorism and criminal activity, two areas that are not entirely unrelated, has been brought to the attention of our European colleagues - hence the need for this legislation. The requirements provided for in the legislation are simple measures and are not rocket science. We have all heard anecdotal evidence about businesses where people are unable to ascertain the basis on which they continue to operate. In the current climate, it is important to establish ground rules and principles that will eliminate this type of activity. The time has come to put a stop to behaviour that has been able to get a foothold in society because it has been possible to circumvent legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> I hope the Bill will be effective and will do what it says on the tin, in other words, deal directly and forcefully with the issues of money laundering and terrorist financing. Money laundering is the means of funding activity of a criminal or terrorism nature and it is a sad reflection on society that it can take place on what appears to be a legitimate basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> There is no need to emphasise the level of criminal activity which obtains at present, the number of shootings which have taken place in very suspicious circumstances, the number of threats issued to juries, judges and others or the number of witnesses who have been intimidated. I accept that many of the issues to which I refer have been the subject of separate legislation. There is no doubt that a huge volume of illegal activity has been financed by means of money laundering. I hope that the provisions contained in the Bill will be adequate to address the means by which money is laundered. Certain people may have become accustomed to living on their ill-gotten gains. If fact, these individuals may be of the view that this has become the norm. That is not the case. We have reached the point where the relevant issues must be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Those involved in criminal activity cannot operate without massive amounts of funding. Such funding continues to be made available. One area to which I wish to refer in this regard is that which relates to the sale of illegal drugs. There is no doubt that extensive borrowing, banking and money laundering facilities are being made available to those involved in this criminal activity. These people do not all operate with cash in their back pockets and neither do they have just one bank account in a particular jurisdiction. Those to whom I refer have multiple banks accounts. The time has come to deal with these people and their rampant criminal activity. I hope the Bill will be part of a suite of legislative instruments which will allow us to deal with the type of activity to which I refer in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> My final point relates to due diligence. When the DIRT inquiry took place, we spent a great deal of time discussing due diligence in the banking, insurance and regulatory systems. We also identified all of the shortcomings which arose on foot of the lack of adequate observance, oversight and due diligence in the context of these systems. Again, this is not rocket science. If simple procedures are introduced and followed, this will ensure that the activities of those in the financial sector will be based on a solid footing. We must ensure that the activities of companies are also above board and I am glad that this matter will be subject of legislation to come before the House next week. We must learn from past experience and put in place the necessary legislative measures to ensure that we do not allow criminal activity to be funded by and from what appear to be legitimate financial outlets and sources. We cannot afford to allow companies to have within their power the facility to allow them to cater for illegal activity on the part of terrorists or criminals. Such activity completely undermines the credibility of our system and the confidence of the public therein. The type of activity to which I refer does massive damage to our image internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on its introduction. I hope it will have the desired effect.</p>

        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Arts,_Heritage_and_the_Gaeltacht" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Dinny McGinley)<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_364">I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate for their support for this Bill, which the Minister hopes will be enacted as soon as possible. The main purpose of the Bill is to make some fairly technical amendments to the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. We want to ensure that certain provisions are more closely matched to international standards. We also want to take the opportunity to make some changes in light of the experience we have gained during the past two years or so in operating the systems which that Act put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> It is clear from the debate that we are all aware of the increasing sophistication of crime, the international nature of it and, consequently, the need to have in place effective structures for preventing and detecting crime. Money laundering, as an offence in itself, does not always come to mind when people think about organised crime. We are more likely to read drug trafficking, robbery or cigarette smuggling. However, it is money laundering which allows criminals to conceal and, ultimately, use the proceeds of their crimes. It is a crime which can be committed on a small or large scale, within and across borders and by seemingly legitimate businesses. The insidious nature of laundering requires robust systems to prevent it and to tackle it when it is discovered. It requires a co-ordinated approach, both domestically and internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> Criminals are always seeking new ways to get away with their crimes and I take this opportunity to commend the financial action task force on its work to strengthen international efforts to tackle laundering. I also welcome the excellent work of the European Commission in bringing forward proposals to improve the legislative response to money laundering. By adapting our systems to reflect the changing nature of crime, we can close off any avenues which might be exploited by criminals. The challenge posed by money laundering also requires a co-ordinated approach on the domestic front. While this involves the imposition of a regulatory burden on the financial services sector, lawyers, accountants and others, that burden is a necessary one. It is required to address the behaviour of those who attempt to use legitimate systems - such as the banking system - to circumvent the law. It is not every day that one hears words of thanks being addressed to bankers, lawyers and accountants but I sincerely thank all those whose everyday efforts support the work of the Garda Síochána and the Revenue in tackling this crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> It is almost a cliche to say that the Garda depends on the support of the community to achieve results. In the area of money laundering, its job would be impossible without the active support of the business community. An individual criminal or a criminal organisation rarely commits a single, simple crime. Quite often they commit complex mosaics of crime, such as manufacturing, importing and selling drugs, for example, and then going on to launder the proceeds. These mosaics must be painstakingly unpicked by gardaí in specialist units - such as the fraud bureau, the drugs unit, the organised crime unit - in local detective units and also by uniformed members. I know the House will join me in extending thanks and genuine admiration to the men and women of all ranks in the Garda Síochána who work so professionally and with such dedication on our behalf to put a stop to these crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> The efforts of the Garda Síochána are reflected in the latest CSO crime statistics. They are generally very positive and it is clear that the Garda, with considerable community support, is making a significant impact on crime. The statistics relating to one crime in particular, burglary, itself a predicate offence to money laundering, show positive signs. The increases in burglary seen early in 2012 are being reversed. This coincides with the introduction of Operation Fiacla nationally. I applaud the contribution of everyone involved in this Garda operation. Under Operation Fiacla, as of 31 March some 4,546 persons had been arrested and 2,512 charged.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Having shared the widespread revulsion at a number of appalling and cowardly attacks on the homes of elderly people, I am encouraged by the clear impact of the robust Garda response to those engaged in burglaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> I appreciate the genuine concerns of communities about the implementation of changes to the way policing is being managed. Fundamentally, the objective of the reforms is to maximise the time that our well trained and highly skilled gardaí spend on operational duties. While concerns about crime are understandable, they should be seen in the context of a decline in most categories of recorded crime, including drugs, public order and assault offences, in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> I will address a number of the points raised by Deputies. Many Members referred to the number of gardaí. The Minister for Justice and Equality has stated several times that he wishes to maintain Garda numbers at 13,000. Yesterday, he stated that there would be a delay in bringing a proposal to the Cabinet on the commencement of a recruitment campaign, as the Government must first reflect on how to effect the savings of €300 million in 2013 that would have resulted had the Labour Relations Commission's pay proposals in respect of an extension to the Croke Park agreement been accepted. The Minister stated that a recruitment campaign could not be commenced without his being in a position to ensure the availability of funding to meet the salaries of additional members recruited to the Garda. He reconfirmed his opinion that it was desirable that Garda numbers be maintained at 13,000 and expressed the hope that he would eventually be in a position to bring an appropriate proposal to the Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> Deputies also referred to the incidence of white collar crime. The programme for Government contains a commitment that rogue bankers and all those who misappropriate or embezzle funds be properly pursued for their crimes and that the full rigours of the law be applied to them. Within eight weeks of taking up office, the Minister moved urgently to introduce additional legislation. The Criminal Justice Act 2011 was enacted on 2 August of that year and provides vital assistance to the Garda in the completion of white collar crime investigations. The Act has facilitated the more effective use of detention periods by making it possible for persons arrested and detained for questioning to be released and their detention suspended so that further inquiries can be conducted during the suspension period. The Garda Commissioner is aware that any further legislative proposal that he might have that would assist in the investigation and detection of white collar crime, or of fraud offences generally, will be considered positively by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> This Bill is mainly technical. It is being introduced to avoid a prolongation of Ireland's stay in the Financial Action Task Force, FATF follow-up process beyond June, which could have negative consequences for our international standing. I thank officials in the offices of the Attorney General and, particularly, the Parliamentary Counsel for their work in drafting this Bill under great pressure and with limited resources. If time and resources allow, some amendments originally envisaged as part of the general scheme of the Bill approved by the Government will be tabled on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> I remind the House of the intention to introduce amendments on Report Stage to address the threat to life and limb posed by explosive devices that make use of mobile communications technology. This may necessitate a change in the Title. The amendments' purpose will be to allow for a direction to telephone companies to cease service in limited areas in order to prevent death or damage to property.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> This is a relatively short Bill and technical in nature. Nonetheless, it is important in ensuring that our anti-money laundering regime is not only in line with international standards, but is also seen to be so. We will need to review this situation again once the proposed fourth money laundering directive is finalised. In any case, it is only right that we keep our laws and systems for tackling money laundering under review. It is an area to which criminals dedicate much effort and creativity in order to hide the proceeds of their crimes. As such, we as legislators should ensure that our laws in this regard are kept up to date and fit for purpose. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">I have become used to feeling a heightened sense of unreality whenever I enter the Chamber to participate in debates on Government legislation, particularly on matters pertaining to the activities of banks, financial institutions and lenders. The sense of unreality, a complete disconnection between the legislative reforms discussed in the Chamber and the actuality of events in the economy for our citizens, is particularly sharp in the context of this Bill and its stated intentions. It is as if the crisis that is under way in terms of the activities of our banks and the dilemma facing approximately 180,000 families in mortgage distress are not happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> According to the Minister, setting up a central credit register under the Bill will assist lenders in making informed lending decisions and protecting higher risk borrowers from excessive debt. One can only laugh when the Government introduces such a Bill while, as we speak, the Minister for Justice and Equality is setting out guidelines that will punish for years to come people who borrowed simply to put roofs over their heads and now find themselves unable to repay through no fault of their own. Some 180,000 families cannot repay their debts. It is not because there was not a central credit register, but because of the reckless greed and profit-driven behaviour of banks and the willingness of politicians and Governments to allow banks to be a law unto themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> There is little in and of itself in the Bill that is particularly objectionable. Let us have a central credit register so that we might know the overall level of borrowing in the country and so that banks cannot lend to people who have no chance to repay their significant debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">That is fair enough. In normal times one might think this is a sort of modest, legislative reform for which one could put a fair argument and that it would cause no harm. However, let us be honest; if the legislation had been in place previously one could ask whether it would have made a blind bit of difference to the behaviour of the banks. Do we think the banks that gave 110% mortgages to people on low incomes or who helped pump up the property market because of their own greed and avarice were particularly worried about the credit history of the people to whom they were lending? They did not give a damn about the credit history. They knew in many cases that they were lending to people with poor credit histories. They did not need a register to tell them. They knew what they were doing was dangerous and they still did it because they were driven by bonuses, market share and the hunger for profit. The fact that at some point the bubble they were creating as a result of the activity would burst did not bother them in the least. It was like the game, Pass the Parcel; they just kept passing the parcel and hoped they would not be the one left holding it when the music stopped. That was the game they were playing. They knew it was madness and reckless and they knew they were lending to people who in many cases could not pay the money back. In many cases they sat down with people and I suspect the people themselves gave them enough information to let the financial institutions know that it was bordering on insanity to lend them money, but they still lent it to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> One could ask what the Bill will do to change that. It will do virtually nothing. The real issue is why in the real world, as we speak, the Government is setting out to punish the innocent victims of the behaviour of banks rather than to punish the banks, bondholders and international financiers that lent them money into this crazy bubble that they were stoking up for their own greed and profit. That is the issue that must be addressed in the context of the utter failure of the Government to do that. In fact, the Government is moving in the opposite direction and everything it does is essentially to punish the victims, in most cases innocent borrowers who wanted to do nothing more than put a roof over their head or were encouraged by banks in some cases to get buy-to-let mortgages because the banks were telling them that was a safe place to put their money for their latter years. They were innocent people, not speculators or big capitalists but just people who had a few extra bob later in life. We have discovered that many mortgage holders are not young people but older people and, therefore, as MABS has said, the proposals the Government is putting forward on split mortgages will not deal with the crisis because for people in their 40s, 50s and 60s the idea that one could park some of the mortgage and then pay it in 20 or 30 years’ time is preposterous.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> One could ask why we are not dealing with that fact. The one reform the Government will not consider is forcing the banks to write down unsustainable mortgage debt. What we will end up with on the credit register is up to 200,000 families with bad credit records who will not be able to borrow money, and who will probably go to illegal moneylenders who will not look at the credit register. Desperate people will be forced into the hands of illegal moneylenders, charging absolutely extortionate interest rates to people. Those issues must be addressed and the people concerned will be in a desperate situation precisely because the Government, the troika and all the rest of them have made a strategic political decision that the victims must pay the price of the crisis caused by the bankers in the first place. Let us begin to address the reality outside this House rather than what is an innocuous but fundamentally fake reform that will not address the urgent crisis being faced by hundreds of thousands of families.</p>

          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_384">I welcome the Bill. It is a vitally important step in creating a more responsible banking system in this country. Any legislation that will addresses the historic bad practices, bad lending and bad banking should be welcomed. I trust that these new measures will go some way towards making the system clearer and more transparent in terms of borrowers. It is clear that reckless lending practices were largely responsible for the banking crisis in this country and under these new rules banks will have to report how much they are lending and to whom.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> During the boom times, people were borrowing more than they could afford and banks were giving out loans too freely. As public representatives we are all aware of people taking out loans from various financial institutions in order to invest in property both in this country and abroad. Unfortunately, some of those people are now in negative equity, in some cases with large mortgage arrears. People find it extremely difficult to pay back their debts and some will face repossession, in particular of investment properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> The Bill creates a central credit register to be maintained and operated by the Central Bank. It will encourage more responsible borrowing and lending. The overall picture in terms of borrowers will be blatantly obvious, which is good. Previously, banks shared information on customers but only those institutions that were members of the Irish Credit Bureau and not all banks were members. Lenders have had to seek permission from borrowers before reporting details of their loans on the system. They will no longer have to do that under the terms of the Bill as the information will be passed on automatically and banks will be required to share details of loans and borrowings. Loans of a value greater than €500 must be reported on the system. Lending institutions will have to ensure that customers are fully informed that the institution is obliged to store their information on the central credit register. In that regard, it is important that clear information about the changes being made are provided on a website or in literature to ensure customers are informed about the change in the law in this area of banking.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> It is vitally important that there is a system in place to monitor how much credit institutions are lending and how much people are borrowing. In recent years people were borrowing far beyond their means to invest in property. Property developers borrowed large amounts of money to build developments all over the country, some of which, sadly, remain unfinished as a result of the property crash.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> There have been reports that Irish Nationwide Building Society did not keep comprehensive records of the details of their loans. The previous chief executive officer, in effect, ran the bank as his own personal bank and he maintained the records himself. The bank had no one to assess the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. No underwriting of the loans took place and no basic banking principles were followed in that institution. The new register will go some way towards addressing the problem, which is good news overall, because we know what happened as a consequence of individuals running banks as their own personal institutions and the State was left to pick up the tab which is both unfair and unreasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> It is obviously important that a record is kept of large borrowers and high-value loans so that such credit histories can be accessed by any credit provider or financial institution. This new system will serve to build a record of overall borrowing in the State. The personal and credit information of individual borrowers and companies is to be held on the new register. At present, there is no statutory obligation on financial institutions to report credit data and no central repository for such data. The current credit rating system is provided by privately-run credit bureaus and only members are obliged to give information.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Section 5 of the Bill provides that the Central Bank will establish and maintain a database of credit and personal information on borrowers, to be known as the central credit register. A number of personal details will be captured on the system, including the name, address, date of birth, PPS number and telephone number of individual borrowers. The information captured for businesses will include the trading name, VAT number and the registration number issued by the Companies Registration Office. The system will also hold information on borrower's credit applications and credit agreements, including the nature and term of the credit, the rate of interest payable and the details of any guarantee or security on the loan. The register will mean that such information will be captured centrally for the very first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Section 9 of the Bill outlines the procedures for borrowers and lenders to apply for amendments to be made to the information held about them on the register if it is incomplete or incorrect. Borrowers will also be entitled to ask the Central Bank for a report on how many times information relating to them has been accessed in the previous five years and by whom. In this way, borrowers are being protected. They are being provided with an opportunity to change the data that is held centrally on them and to be updated on who is requesting that information. It is vital that borrowers are fully informed of their right to identify any incorrect information held on their file, to appeal and to have such information changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> The Bill also includes measures to protect customers against identity fraud. It provides that lenders have a duty to notify borrowers if they suspect that they are being impersonated. Any details held on file about customers will be treated with the utmost confidentiality, with banks being penalised for the disclosure of confidential information, either by way of fines or imprisonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> The fact that there was no central credit register in this country over many years meant that some individuals were able to take out multiple loans with various financial institutions and no-one had an overall picture of the level of their borrowings. The lack of a central register and abuses of the system of credit came back to haunt us, particularly when the credit bubble burst.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> This is a sensible Bill, designed to help us to learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure they are not repeated in the future. The passing of this Bill is a requirement under the terms of our agreement with the EU-IMF programme of financial support. The troika pointed out that the quality and availability of the credit information at the disposal of credit providers in this country needed to be enhanced. The measures contained in this Bill will ensure that the mistakes made in our banking system will not occur again. The Bill will ensure a fairer and more transparent banking system in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_395">Had this Bill been introduced in 2000, no one would have disputed any aspect of it because it would have been introduced in more normal times. In principle, there is no problem with introducing a means of controlling credit. However, the new credit register will become a new worry for many people who are already overburdened with worries. It will place those people who are just about credit-worthy in the position of having to use the most expensive forms of credit, namely credit cards or money lenders. We are creating a statutory database and giving control of it to the very people we had to bail out; the very people who put some borrowers in the awful position they are in by pushing money at them, through 110% mortgages, allowing parents to guarantee mortgages for their children, providing students with completely unsustainable loans and so forth. In that context, the question of how this register is handled is a key issue. There must be safeguards in place for borrowers and a safety net for those who need to borrow money and who cannot do so because of this database. We must ask where people will get money in that situation. In an environment where there is less flexibility for community welfare officers, for example, one would be fearful for people in that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> The credit register is being set up on a statutory basis and will be run by the Central Bank. Such a register would have been a very useful tool to control the level of personal indebtedness during that period when excess credit at low interest rates - which did not suit this country but suited countries such as Germany - was widely available. The high level of personal indebtedness was no secret during the boom years. In fact, it was referred to constantly at the time. It is not the current Government's fault that a mechanism such as this central credit register was not available then but it was a major oversight in terms of good governance and the role of the Central Bank. It is also part of the reason we have been left with this legacy. We must be mindful of the people who are trapped by the worst elements of that legacy and be careful about how they are treated. I am concerned by the lack of a counterbalance for such people.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> The information contained in a credit register would have been invaluable to policy makers in terms of giving them exact information on the levels of personal indebtedness being built up in this country. Having said that, it was widely known that while our national debt was under control, our levels of personal indebtedness, as a result of the cost of housing, were growing exponentially.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> I feel more than a little resentful that the very institutions whose lending behaviour was beyond reckless are now being given this resource and I am fearful about how they will use it. I cannot emphasise that point enough. An individual's credit worthiness is enormously important, particularly when there is little credit available and the lending environment is much more constrained. The register may provide banks with a reason to turn an applicant for credit down, especially if there is someone else in the queue for credit with a better credit rating. In that sense, it will be about the strong surviving and that is why the issue of a counterbalance must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> We cannot pass a Bill such as the one before us without reflecting on issues such as the sub-prime mortgage lending that went on in recent years and the availability of 110% mortgages. We must also consider the position of parents who guaranteed the mortgages of their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The credit rating of both would be affected and perhaps neither will have a roof over their heads. The banks will extract the maximum possible from the arrangement. There is not two ways about it as the economy was handled between 2000 and 2007 to ensure that people felt they had money in their pocket so that the desired result could be delivered for the incumbent Government. The people who will be caught in the credit rating trap will be those who had their votes bought with fairy tales about what could be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> The following issue may not be related to the legislation. The economy of this country and others is overseen by agencies like Moody's, Standard and Poor's and Fitch, which have made disastrous calls in the past. Those agencies gave our banks, including Anglo Irish Bank, AAA ratings but they can walk away after saying they merely made a mistake. The person who is looking at the guidelines produced today and who can see no way out except for the very public process of personal insolvency - a type of penury - cannot act in this way. There is a very real consequence for those people, and it seems that the agencies that are so lauded in the international capitalist community can get away without even being chastised. If we had a system where those agencies called it as it was and there was a restriction on personal indebtedness, we would not be in our current mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> I am concerned about how this process will be used and I will give a separate issue as an example. There has been some mapping of flooding in the country, which is a great idea, as it will ensure we will not make the mistakes seen in the past in building on flood plains, etc. The problem is the mapping is being used by private insurance companies to refuse to insure people's houses where there has been flooding in the past. Something similar could happen when the process outlined in the Bill is in the hands of institutions that have been so hesitant in dealing with matters like mortgage debt or debt forgiveness, even when the Government has given a large amount of money to resolve such issues. They have not done it.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> I know a case where a builder went bust but he is now back in action, with his son as the principal figure in the company. The builder in question is working away and offering to build houses. Credit ratings do not seem to affect such people in companies, which can reinvent themselves, but individuals cannot do this. The Government has a duty of care to see there is a system in place to ensure people are creditworthy, and it must deal with individuals and families trying to find a way out of their credit rating problems.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Dinny McGinley)<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_404">I believe we have had a very constructive debate on the importance of the Credit Reporting Bill, which will create the legislative framework for a central repository of credit information to be known as the central credit register. The register will go some way towards resolving what were identified as weaknesses in the Irish financial services industry by providing a tool which supports responsible borrowing and lending. It will assist the Central Bank in the supervisory role and also augment levels of consumer protection in respect of lending. I thank the Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin parties, which have both provided their support for the Bill. I note that both Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage and we welcome their helpful contributions in the discussion of the Bill. We will be happy to discuss their proposed amendments on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> I will take this opportunity to respond to a number of the issues, proposals and queries raised during the debate before Easter. The question of when the register will come into operation was raised by a number of Deputies. I am unable to guarantee when this will happen as it depends on a number of factors, including when the legislation comes into force and also the length of time it will take for the database to be created. However, I can assure Deputies that we are working hard to have the register up and running without delay. The question of control of the data to be held on the register was also referenced by a number of Deputies. This is expressly why we have provided for strong controls in section 17 of the Bill, which outlines the purposes for which information on the register can be used, which would preclude the use of the information on the register by credit providers for marketing purposes, as was feared by some Deputies. Data protection concerns have been and continue to be of utmost importance during the development of this legislation and the Data Protection Commissioner has contributed to the Bill, ensuring that the rights of consumer are protected at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> In regard to the thresholds set by the Bill in sections 15 and 16, we are considering the contributions made by the Deputies. It is very important that we correctly strike a balance between trying to prevent a lender from avoiding having to check or report to the register and I would not like to make it overly bureaucratic by setting the threshold too low. This issue can be further discussed on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> Deputies McGrath and Doherty suggested that a widespread programme of consumer education could be conducted. This is something which I agree would benefit the consumer, particularly as the Deputies have highlighted the lack of awareness of the availability of consumer credit information. I agree it is very important that citizens are made aware of the register and what implications it will have. It is equally important for consumers to know that they have the ability to access a free copy of their credit report each year. Consumer awareness and education is imperative for the legislation to have the positive effect it is intended to have and this is a suggestion we will be following up on.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> There are others issues which were raised before Easter which I have not responded to today. These issues will be teased out on Committee Stage. I reiterate the point that this Bill represents an opportunity to develop a responsible reporting structure that will benefit both borrower and lender and ensure lenders are in a position to make informed lending decisions. The register will help support our continued policy to combat the over-indebtedness in this country. I thank everybody who made a contribution to the debate and I urge Deputies to support the Credit Reporting Bill 2012. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_411">I thank the Tánaiste for taking time out of his busy schedule to come to the House to address this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_412"> The Tánaiste will be aware from activity in the consular section of his Department and from international media reports that there seems to be an increased level of activity by the immigration authorities, particularly in the Boston area, targeting the undocumented Irish. This appears to be orchestrated, a worrying development. There are a number of cases, including one of a man originally from my constituency who is entirely law abiding, albeit undocumented. This brings its own difficulties in procuring driving licences and other documentation needed to go about daily life. This gentleman was arrested at 6.30 a.m. when he got up to go out to work. He employs 11 people and is married with two children. He is law abiding in every other way. He has made a life for himself and his family in the Boston area.</p>
            <p eId="para_413"> It is disappointing that there has been this renewed level of activity in cities like Boston at a time when considerable progress appears to be emerging on Capitol Hill under proposals put forward by President Obama. The Tánaiste has been to the forefront of the campaign since before he assumed his current ministerial role and I have no doubt he has raised the matter in Washington.</p>
            <p eId="para_414"> Could the Tánaiste make contact with the Office of the President of the United States and others on Capitol Hill to see if something can be done to find a level of amnesty for these people prior to the passage of the legislation so they are not being rounded up in advance of the solution they have been waiting for? This gentleman is now in a federal prison and it is not clear when he will get out. There was a time when undocumented immigrants were put on the first flight home and at least people knew where they stood. In this instance, my contacts tell me this person could be in prison for two months or more. That is huge uncertainty for him, his wife and his family. They are at their wits' end and do not know what to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_415"> We must have a two-pronged approach to this. We must deal with the immediate issue for this individual and then see if we can get some assistance from the federal administration to calm down what seems to be overzealous activity in light of the fact that, at long last, a solution is in sight.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_416">The plight of the undocumented remains a top priority for the Government and in this regard, the publication yesterday of a bipartisan Bill in the US Senate is a very positive development which, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland. The legislation was drafted over several months by a bipartisan group of eight Senators and includes provisions that would help to resolve the plight of thousands of undocumented Irish people living illegally in the United States. It is also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_417"> I am conscious that the overall issues involved are complex and sensitive ones within the US political system and that much further debate is likely to be required before the final shape of any overall legislation becomes clear. The Taoiseach and I have had numerous discussions with proponents of this Bill over many recent months and in particular during the St. Patrick's Day period. I want to acknowledge the supportive role played by Irish organisations in the US in bringing the matter this far. I do not doubt that there is much work and many uncertainties ahead as we strive to bring this work to a conclusion but the determination of this Government to support the inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year, and to address the issues facing the undocumented, should not be in doubt.</p>
            <p eId="para_418"> I am aware that from time to time concerns are expressed concerning the detention of Irish citizens in the United States prior to deportation. While the official figures available to us indicate that the numbers of undocumented Irish being detained and deported have not increased significantly in recent years, and we have not received any recent indications to suggest that detention conditions for Irish people in such situations have been problematic of late, I am aware that the anxiety and stress which detention and deportation cause is very real. This is why it remains the Government position to strongly discourage anyone considering moving to the US without legal status.</p>
            <p eId="para_419"> I am aware of a report in the Irish ethnic media in the US suggesting that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has engaged in a sweep of undocumented Irish in Boston. The ICE, however, has confirmed that it does not engage in indiscriminate raids against potential undocumented communities. Our missions in the United States have not recorded any recent significant increase in numbers. The Deputy has outlined a particular case and if he gives me the details of that case, I will have the Department and relevant consulate investigate further. In March 2013, there were nine Irish people in detention for immigration violations, while in February 2013 there were seven. Our missions in the United States provide consular assistance to Irish nationals who have been detained and are awaiting deportation. We seek to minimise the detention period, and have also assisted in expediting the deportation process where there have been particular medical or other humanitarian issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_420"> I want to underline the Government's commitment to sustaining support for our emigrants overseas and for the many young Irish people who have left in recent years. There is no more tangible expression of this support than the emigrant support programme, which has sustained support for frontline organisations working to address the needs of emigrants, notwithstanding the current budgetary pressures.</p>

            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_421">I thank the Tánaiste for the way he has outlined his position on the progress that has been made and I will provide the Tánaiste with the details of the case I raised. The consular staff in Boston are involved in this case and familiar with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_422">It does not take from the fact that here is a family - I understand there are a number of others - who would have expected to benefit from this legislation and who find themselves in a precarious position. The husband is detained in prison, there is no clear sign of when he will be released, whether he will be returned to Ireland or how quickly that might take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_423"> It will need guidance from those who are supporting and driving this legislation on Capitol Hill that they would start to filter information down to ICE and others that this is on the way. I accept that until such time as the legislation has passed, it will not be possible to find a workaround for it, but I ask if interim arrangements could be considered for those who are under investigation for being undocumented or who find themselves in a state or federal prison. Assistance could be provided to them so that they would be allowed to remain and that they would be released on licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_424"> It is not for me to comment on how other countries seek to deal with immigration. We have our own issues here and have been slow and perhaps tardy as a country in dealing with them, but it is unnecessary to have this individual in jail. His wife and family are in the country, so he is not going anywhere. I would hope that there could be some softening and a recognition that at long last we hope the end is in sight in a way that would see this undocumented issue sorted out once and for all, and in so doing, that the small number who are on the fringes at present do not find themselves outside the loop.</p>

            <p eId="para_425">First, I need to know the details of the particular case and again I invite Deputy Dooley to let me have them. My Department and the consulate concerned will address it and no doubt will provide assistance to the individual concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_426"> This is a problem that has gone on for a very long time. The undocumented Irish in the United States live in a kind of a shadowed existence. As Deputy Dooley stated, they cannot get a driving licence or come back home for a funeral. They are caught in a difficult situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_427"> As the Deputy will be aware, we have been working for some time to try to get that resolved. We now have a big break on that in the form of the legislation that was published yesterday. We have been working with this group of eight Senators, four Democrats and four Republicans - it is most important that this is a bipartisan approach - who have brought forward legislation on immigration. They have included in that legislation measures that will address the problem of the undocumented Irish in the United States but also allow for a flow of legal migration at this level between Ireland and the United States for the first time since the 1960s. This is a significant development. We need to be mindful that the issue of immigration in the Unites States is a controversial one. It has its own political dimension, as immigration has in this country. We must work with the Senators concerned, the House of Representatives and President Obama's Administration to get this legislation through, and we will do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_428"> In the meantime, as regards the situation as it affects individuals, I can identify entirely with a person who, just as the legislation is published, finds himself arrested, detained and in a difficult situation. As I stated, if Deputy Dooley lets us have the details, we will deal with the particular case, but I do not want to get into calls for amnesties, which could be unhelpful in the context of getting the legislation advanced.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_429">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for the opportunity to raise this issue. This is a relatively new scheme that has been running for only two years. It is a welcome development from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and from the Minister, Deputy Coveney. If we are to meet our Harvest 2020 production targets, it is important that all farmers are on the same plain and continue to work with each other and advise each other on best ways of carrying out such work.</p>
            <p eId="para_430"> There is an issue with the scheme at present in that quite a number of farmers, in particular in County Galway, have not received any payment for it. The reason I raise this today is that the issues in a number of these cases seem to be very small. They seem to be issues that should be easy to fix and the punishment for the issues raised seems over the top. For example, one elderly man missed due to health reasons one of the five meetings that he was supposed to attend and his penalty was 100%. It seems excessive that a man who would miss one of these five meetings for health reasons is then thrown out of the scheme or not paid. Certainly, it has been communicated to him that he will not be paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_431"> There are other issues related to the BVD eradication scheme announced by the Department last year. Whereas last year it was not compulsory to take part in it and it was up to the farmer, this year that has changed. The vast majority of farmers did not know that going into the scheme this year. They now have been disqualified from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_432"> There are other issues where a great deal of this information is to be submitted online. If one ticked one box wrongly, there was no second chance. There was no way around it and the penalty was that one would receive no payment for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_433"> This, as we all will be aware, is against the backdrop of agriculture being in terrible crisis due to the bad weather. The issue of the fodder crisis has been raised in the past week already. The Department might consider these figures quite small, but for the individual farmer this is extremely serious. I call on the Minister today to ensure whatever can be done is done in order that these farmers are paid as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_434"> There is another issue with the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, another farm payment. This problem arose last year and the Department does not seem to be able to get on top of it. Farmers have carried out the work they were expected to do. The Department is based in Johnstown Castle in Wexford from where it seems nearly impossible to get information. Over recent months I have become aware of farmers who have still to receive payment for this work and on telephoning the Department, one is told to come back to them in two weeks, three weeks or a month. Today, I telephoned to find out the position in the cases of two farmers and was told there are penalties on their applications. The farmers concerned do not know that.</p>
            <p eId="para_435"> As I stated, all of this is against the backdrop of a fodder crisis in the sector where farmers literally cannot afford to feed their cattle, and that will cause significant issues. The Minister cannot be blamed for the weather but he must understand where we are. I now hear talk of the Government encouraging the banks, the credit unions and co-operatives to be more lenient with farmers, but does it not understand that these are the ones with whom the farmers have the issue? The farmer needs the money to pay back the co-operative and the bank. Why would they be any easier in lending to these farmers in a situation where they are the ones to whom the farmers are supposed to be giving the money?</p>
            <p eId="para_436"> What I want to get across to the Minister is that there are issues with this scheme that are not being resolved. Farmers have still not been paid on their AEOS payments. It is impossible to get information out of Johnstown Castle as to why there is a problem on a farmer's application. If there is an issue, let us fix it. Allow the farmer the chance to fix that problem. These farmers need help and they are not getting it. We need to get it to them as soon as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Dinny McGinley)<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_437">I wish to convey the apologies of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that he could not be in the House to discuss this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_438"> To set the context, in February last year, the Minister announced the launch of a beef technology adoption programme, BTAP, as a key element in driving the ambitious targets for the beef sector in Food Harvest 2020. Based on the discussion group model, the programme is intended to provide participants with the knowledge and the skills necessary to reduce costs and increase profit margins on their beef farms for which there is significant potential. While engaging in the discussion groups, participating farmers develop business plans which will enable them to set targets and track progress over the three years of the programme. Annually, participants also undertake two tasks, from a menu of eight, to assist them in improving performance in a number of areas at farm level.</p>
            <p eId="para_439"> The beef sector is a critically important part of the economy from an employment and export earnings point of view. It is playing an important role in Ireland's economic recovery, as is the food and agrifood sector generally. Mindful of this, the Minister made €5 million per annum available to fund BTAP, which is designed to run for three years, from 2012 to 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> The Minister believes that for the sector to reach its development potential, farmers must take steps to improve profitability. This means focusing on better management at farm level, improving breed quality, reducing the negative impact that poor animal health can have on efficiency, and ensuring they produce the kind of animal that the market requires.</p>
            <p eId="para_441">The Minister is confident that this programme can provide an important stimulus to standardise on Irish farms the kind of focus on profit that is necessary to make a success of any business enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_442"> The beef sector, which had an excellent year in 2011, with a 15% increase bringing the value of exports to €1.8 billion, again grew significantly in 2012 when the value of exports increased to €1.9 billion. However, there continue to be challenges to be faced, particularly given the financial pressure on consumers arising from an extremely difficult global economic environment. It is for this reason that a continued focus on producing high-quality beef while maintaining competitiveness is critical for the sector. It is self-evident that the industry can only grow and develop if that growth is profitable for the primary producer and this programme can play an important role in ensuring that is the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_443"> In the first year of the programme, while a total of 6,563 applicants had initially been accepted into the programme having been confirmed as satisfying the programme eligibility criteria, by the end of 2012, a total of 4,809 farmers involved in 440 discussion groups had successfully completed the first year, with €4.5 million paid to participants. The balance of 1,754 were found not to have to have attended the requisite number of discussion group meetings and-or had not satisfactorily completed the required two tasks. Appeals were subsequently lodged in respect of 600 of those who had not been paid and these are in the process of being examined. Some 101 have been confirmed as being eligible on the basis of the additional data submitted in support of the appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_444"> The Minister remains ambitious for the beef sector and is confident that with a positive and collaborative approach from stakeholders the sector can build on its already excellent reputation. The sector is a key element in the Food Harvest 2020 Strategy and the BTAP is a vital tool in realising its great potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_445">I thank the Minister of State for his response. My issue is not with the scheme, which is doing what it should do. I regret that the Minister cannot be here - I understand he is extremely busy as all Ministers are at the moment. I believe it is important for the Government to appoint a new Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine owing to the workload the Minister is facing and the importance of the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_446"> I cannot complain about much in the Minister of State's reply. I understand the merits of the scheme and that is not the problem. The issue is with the farmers yet to be paid. In order to drive the sector forward, if people sign up to complete a scheme, they should be paid when they expect to be paid. The problem is that the appeals are taking considerably longer than they should take. The issue with AEOS is getting the information from the Department to individual farmers to explain what needs to be done. The Minister of State mentioned that some of them had not attended discussion group meetings. As I said, one farmer did not attend owing to health reasons and did not get his payment. That is completely over the top and that should not be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_447"> I understand the scheme and welcome it. If anything we want to see it extended. However, individual farmers, particularly those in Galway, who have not been paid, need to be paid. The Department needs to work with them through the beef discussion groups or elsewhere as soon as possible. These farmers are on their knees at the moment. They cannot go to the banks or to the co-operatives. Instead of forcing them to these places, they should be given the money they deserve and for which they signed up. It needs to be expedited in any way possible. The resources need to be allocated to help these people out. That help must come over the next two to three weeks. There is no point in it coming in the next couple of months - we need delivery on this now. These farmers are in a very tough situation with massive debts. Let us get them the money they deserve so that they are not forced to go to the banks. They should be given an opportunity to do what they do well. Only then can the sector drive on from there.</p>

            <p eId="para_448">I appreciate the Deputy's concern. Coming from a similar area, I understand the importance of this. I am sure the Deputy would agree it was an imaginative and creative scheme as proven by the number of applicants. Of 6,563 applicants, 4,809 have successfully completed and €4.5 million of the allocated €5 million has already been paid out. Based on what the Deputy has said, some of the payments appear to have been delayed. His concerns, and mine, will be brought to the Minister's attention. Given that the Minister has a great understanding of agriculture, I am sure he will do everything possible to expedite any payment that is due and is not yet processed. Some 600 appeals are in process of which more than 100 have already been assessed successfully. Taking everything into consideration, significant progress is being made on the matter. I know farmers want to get whatever is owing to them as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_449">I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this matter. It is unfortunate that no Minister from the Department of Finance has come to the House to respond. While I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, given that the issue affects virtually everybody in the country, it is a pity that nobody from the Department of Finance was prepared to attend.</p>
            <p eId="para_450"> There is a very real risk that many thousands of homeowners face being considerably overcharged for the new property tax. The local property tax is anti-urban, anti-jobs and above all takes no account of people's ability to pay. Contrary to the promises we were given, it is not a site-valuation tax. For all those reasons it is an unfair tax. However, the administration of the tax makes that unfairness even worse. The Revenue Commissioners used a complex statistical model to arrive at its estimate for each property throughout the State. However, obvious determinants of property price, such as size, number of bedrooms, condition, extension or garden size, were either imputed from area averages or did not form part of the model used.</p>
            <p eId="para_451"> People are generally not aware of this fact. It means that smaller homes can end up in a valuation band that is higher than the true value of that home. By its own admission, the Revenue estimate is up to €50,000 out in a large number of cases and up to €100,000 or more out in approximately 10% of cases. The guidance and background documentation provided makes this clear. The valuation band prediction is accurate in less than 50% of cases by Revenue's own admission, which is unacceptable in terms of providing guidance to the public on the matter. People are not aware that the guidance being presented to them by Revenue is so inaccurate in a majority of cases. Instead Revenue has used the model to provide highly crude valuation guidance based on area averages within each electoral division. However, because it is based on averages, in many cases this guidance is utterly meaningless.</p>
            <p eId="para_452"> I recently crosschecked last year's house sale prices in one electoral division in my constituency with the guidance provided by Revenue. Of the ten properties sold last year, seven did not correspond to the area valuation identified by Revenue. What practical use is this to people in that area? There is a real risk that many people will be overcharged because they are unaware of how unreliable Revenue's approach has been and they do not want to run the risk of second-guessing Revenue. To add insult to injury the reply I received this week to a parliamentary question confirmed that if a person pays more than is due and that becomes obvious later there is no mechanism for that person to get a refund. People are generally not aware of this either. What responsibility is the Minister taking for this? Does he accept that the system operating at the moment is very inaccurate and that steps need to be taken to provide much clearer guidance to the public to avoid people being overcharged?</p>

            <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_453">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Unfortunately the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department are unavailable as they are outside the country. The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 sets out in detail how the tax is to be administered and provides how a residential property is to be valued for local property tax, LPT, purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_454"> LPT is a self-assessed tax and as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has advised the House on many occasions, it is a matter for the property owner in the first instance to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property. For the purposes of LPT, values for properties under €1 million are organised into valuation bands, with an initial band up to €100,000 followed by bands of €50,000 between €100,001 and €1,000,000, so owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property.</p>
            <p eId="para_455"> The Revenue Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, together with the owner's knowledge of a property, will assist him or her in assessing its value. This guidance should be used together with other sources of information including the Property Services Regulatory Authority's property price register, property sections of newspapers, information from local estate agents and property websites. When using Revenue's valuation guidance, property owners should consider the specifics of their property and if they feel that the guidance does not indicate a reasonable valuation, they should make their own assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> In the absence of a national residential property valuation system, the valuation guidance developed by Revenue is designed to help property owners in self-assessing the market value of their property by giving them average indicative values for their area. The guidance is based on sales in the past three years and provides a benchmark to help people consider whether their property is more or less valuable than the average in an area. This guidance will be helpful in the majority of cases, but there are always properties in an area which differ from the average.</p>
            <p eId="para_457"> Surprise has been expressed in some quarters at the fact that the valuation guidance does not accurately reflect the market value of a specific unique property. However, the valuation guidance explicitly states, "This service provides a guide to average market values of properties in a given locality and offers an indicative valuation band for properties depending on type, age and location. It does not provide market values for individual properties".</p>
            <p eId="para_458"> Revenue has made the guidance as simple as possible, and users need only know their property's type, age and location. The Revenue valuation guidance website combines two aspects. These are a simple point and click option to get an average valuation for an electoral district, and an interactive map showing relative valuations across electoral districts.</p>
            <p eId="para_459"> I will take this opportunity to explain briefly how property owners should use the Revenue guidance. The Revenue guidance may show the average valuation band for a semi-detached property in a particular location is between €350,000 and €400,000. If an owner of a two bedroom semi-detached property knows the majority of semi-detached houses in the area have three bedrooms, then the owner can reasonably expect the Revenue guidance to reflect the value of a three-bedroom property. This could offer a basis to adjust the valuation of the property downwards from the guidance average.</p>
            <p eId="para_460"> It is important to re-iterate that the Revenue guidance does not claim to value every house. Using the guidance requires a property owner to make an assessment based on his or her knowledge of the house, the neighbourhood, the house types and any factors he or she feels are relevant, as well as combining the Revenue guidance with the property price register and any other appropriate sources of information available.</p>
            <p eId="para_461"> Revenue's valuation guidance has been peer-reviewed and favourably endorsed by commentators who are very familiar with the property market. Those who are sowing seeds of confusion regarding the valuation process are not being helpful to the generality of taxpayers, who as Revenue point out, are tax compliant. Revenue's view is that its guidance will provide the correct valuation band for nearly half of all properties in an area and will be within one band either way for a further 40% to 45% of properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_462"> It is also clear that a substantial number of people disagree with misinformed claims about the Revenue online guidance, as it is being used extensively by the public. Up to Tuesday this week, in excess of 868,100 hits were recorded on the site and more than 188,400 users either opened the valuation guidance from the Revenue website or saved it to their computer.</p>
            <p eId="para_463"> Revenue has also provided for those who do not use the Internet by preparing paper copies of the indicative valuation band for each property type in every electoral district in the country. These are available from Revenue public offices and the major Citizens' Information Centre offices. Copies were also made available at briefing sessions held by the Revenue Commissioners in Leinster House for Oireachtas Members and their staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_464"> I agree people should not automatically pay the Revenue estimate. The estimate, as Revenue has consistently stated, including in newspaper advertising this week, is only relevant if the property owner does not file and return. Credit should be given to the owner's knowledge of the property market and his or her ability to work out a reasonable valuation for the property, certainly within €50,000 bands. The level of public debate on property valuation suggests that most people are engaging with the local property tax, have a good general sense of the value of their property, and are carrying out research to enable them to do their self-assessed return. I welcome this.</p>
            <p eId="para_465"> Revenue's press release on Tuesday, 16 April, stated 130,802 LPT returns have already been filed by property owners who, in the majority of cases, have made their own assessment of the valuation band for their property. This clearly shows people are following the self-assessment principles and making their best assessment of the value of their property.</p>
            <p eId="para_466"> Revenue's website cites additional sources to help in the valuation process, such as other property websites and information from local estate agents and newspapers. While the latter sources quote asking prices which tend to be higher than final prices, these should nonetheless help the property owner get a general idea of property values in their locality which can be used in conjunction with the other sources of information available.</p>
            <p eId="para_467"> In the context of a self-assessed tax, I am completely satisfied that Revenue's online valuation guidance is fit for purpose, that Revenue has been very clear about its scope and purpose, and that it performs at least equally well, if not better, than other sources of valuation guidance available. I am confident the valuation guidance will be useful for the majority of property owners in assisting them to value their homes, and that using this source and the other sources to which Revenue points, as well as the property owner's knowledge of his or her property, provides the basis for this self-assessment to be honest and reasonable.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> I have no difficulty with opposition to this tax, or indeed to any other tax, but I am concerned some media commentators, some professionals in property-related businesses and, unfortunately, some politicians are creating confusion by making claims that are simply not true. I remind the House the local property tax is provided for in legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and I encourage Members to assist constituents in meeting their legal obligations.</p>

            <p eId="para_469">At the beginning of his contribution the Minister of State said the average price in an electoral division is accurate in most cases. This is not actually true. I have already given an example where seven out of ten cases were inaccurate in one electoral division, and I can provide the information to support this. I call on the Minister of State to provide clearer guidance to people on how they can go about self-assessment in an honest way. Will the Minister of State consider making it clear to people that the correspondence they receive from Revenue is not a bill but merely an estimate, which is likely to be inaccurate in the majority of cases?</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> I also call on the Minister of State to be more forthcoming about the inaccuracies in the approach of the Revenue Commissioners. Will he consider updating the property price register to provide more detail on house size and bedrooms? Will he give guidance on the percentage reductions which should be applied on house prices achieved in 2011 and 2012 given the changes in the market since then? In many cases sale prices are only available for previous years. Will he remove Revenue's recommendation to base house valuation on local asking prices? We know that very often they are way off the mark. I call on the Minister of State to request the Minister for Finance to allow for a refund where a property is mistakenly overvalued and where it subsequently emerges a person has paid too much.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">They should be entitled to a refund in those circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_472">The points raised by the Deputy will be brought to the attention of the relevant Minister and Department. I welcome the fact that the Deputy has had an opportunity to raise those matters here. I have repeatedly said that it is almost impossible to be accurate concerning house prices. Many efforts have been made and many sources have been employed to obtain guidance that is as accurate as possible, but at the end of the day it is up to people themselves to ascertain what the property is worth. We have used newspaper advertisements and many other sources to indicate that as accurately as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_473"> In the area I come from in west Donegal, the indicative value of every house is in the second band of €100,000 to €150,000. Perhaps there are some houses there that are worth more than that, while some may be worth less, but it is just a guide.</p>

            <p eId="para_478">I have submitted this Topical Issue seven or eight times before now, so I am pleased that it was selected for today's debate. Like Deputy Shortall, I had hoped that the relevant Minister would have been here. Nonetheless, I hope that the points I wish to make will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Health.</p>
            <p eId="para_479"> I will cite the example of one child because there is a disproportionately young population in my constituency, as the Acting Chairman, Deputy Wall, will know. It may not be that the same situation pertains throughout the country. It may well be different elsewhere, but my experience is that parents seeking an ear, nose and throat specialist for their children are experiencing considerable delays. </p>
            <p eId="para_480"> The example concerns a child who is about to enter secondary school in September this year. She is routinely on antibiotics and painkillers because of a chronic problem with tonsils and her sleep has been badly affected. Given that her tonsils are enlarged there is a major restriction in her airways which is contributing to sleeplessness. She has lost weight and is very pale. I have met the youngster and it is appalling to talk to a 12 year old about such health problems. It is pretty grim to reach that stage. </p>
            <p eId="para_481"> In September 2012, this child was referred by the family's GP to an ear, nose and throat consultant in Tallaght hospital, but was told that it would be 18 months before she would get an appointment. Her GP was then asked to refer her to another hospital and, in January 2013, she was referred to Crumlin hospital. The latter hospital replied stating:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_482"> Thank you for your referral to the ENT department. Currently, the outpatients' waiting time is over two years for routine ENT appointments. [That is not for the operation but for a routine appointment]. Accordingly, we are not in a position to accept your referral at this time. We suggest that you consider referring the patient to an alternative service.</p>
            <p eId="para_483">The doctor had obviously been ringing around to see if any service could provide that child with a speedier response. We have had much discussion about building a new national children's hospital, but what seems to have gone under the radar is the fact that children requiring fairly minor medical procedures, which impact badly on their health, are not even being seen at the moment. </p>
            <p eId="para_484"> Other parents have spoken to me about raising loans and trying to get treatment done privately because they find the delay unacceptable. Someone else told me that the size of the tonsils was impacting on a child's ability to form words and is, consequently, in a queue for speech therapy that they may not need.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> I raised this matter in March by way of a parliamentary question. I have highlighted the case of one child but a lot more children are affected. I also raised the overuse of antibiotics. If tonsillitis is left untreated it can lead to serious complications, including heart problems in the most extreme circumstances. I am hoping to hear not only that there will be a move to reduce the delays for routine appointments, but also for the procedures to be carried out. It is unacceptable to see children awaiting fairly minor procedures to give them a better quality of life. I have experienced this problem in a number of hospitals, including Crumlin and Tallaght, which suggests that there is a serious difficulty with waiting lists for this particular discipline. I hope the Minister of State will provide me with some comfort in his response.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_486">I am answering this matter on behalf of the Minister who is unavoidably absent. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of waiting lists for ear, nose and throat specialist consultations.</p>
            <p eId="para_487"> As the Deputy is aware, improving access to outpatient services is a key priority for the Government. Tackling outpatient waiting lists is the next priority for the special delivery unit established by the Minister for Health in 2011 to unblock access to our acute hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_488"> In 2012, building on work already undertaken by the Health Service Executive and the National Treatment Purchase Fund a national project was initiated to compile, for the first time, an outpatient waiting list database based on patient-level information from individual hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_489"> For the first time, clear data on the OPD waiting list is now being reported. The waiting list for outpatients is updated monthly and is available on <i>www.ntpt.ie</i>. The data show numbers waiting over the various time bands for a first appointment at a consultant-led clinic. In a further enhancement of the reporting, future updates will, for the first time, include numbers reported by specialty, including ENT, in addition to the breakdown by hospital. However, that data is not yet available.</p>
            <p eId="para_490"> The outpatient waiting list number currently reported, as of 28 March 2013, is 384,632 - slightly lower than the January figure. The data also show that more than half of people on the list are waiting less than six months and almost 75% are waiting less than 12 months. </p>
            <p eId="para_491"> For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first-time outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan. This will apply to all patients, including those waiting for ear, nose and throat consultations.</p>
            <p eId="para_492"> The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format, allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed. Currently, the focus is on hospitals continuing the validation of waiting lists. All hospitals have been engaged in this process which is anticipated to be complete by mid-May 2013. At that point, the SDU will have a better view of the profile of long waiters in terms of their numbers, geographical and specialty distribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_493">In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, an outpatient reform programme is under way with the special delivery unit, the HSE outpatient reform team and the HSE clinical programmes. This overarching programme is examining the structure and operation of outpatient clinics to ensure the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. Implementation of this programme will ensure a sustainable low-wait environment for outpatient services and prevent the build-up of long waiters. As stated in the strategic framework document, Future Health, one of the key goals of hospital reform is to deliver more responsive and equitable access to vital services for all patients and a key action is the reduction of waiting times. The Government is determined to deliver on this goal.</p>

            <p eId="para_494">I would like to meet the person who replied in that way. I will not give that reply to the parents of that 12-year-old child or a few others who have approached me about their children because, to be perfectly honest, this is an academic response. I seek a strategic response and do not simply wish to raise the issue of a single child.</p>
            <p eId="para_495"> I have been approached by several parents whose children are seeking ear, nose and throat, ENT, appointments and I used one child to portray the predominant picture. The Minister of State informed me that a certain number are waiting less than six months and 75% are waiting less than 12 months. However, I read out a letter to him and informed him this child has been told by Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, to go somewhere else because it has a two-year waiting list for an ENT appointment. There is no point in telling me about the special delivery unit or the National Treatment Purchase Fund because, essentially, this child cannot even be seen in order to get onto a list. Can the Minister of State express my dissatisfaction to the Minister with regard to this response, which really does not address the issue at all with regard to ENT?</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> There is a crisis here for youngsters who cannot get even an appointment and cannot get a fairly minor procedure that would give them a better quality of life, such as having their tonsils removed. I have to hand a letter from Crumlin hospital stating the child cannot get even an appointment because there is a two-year waiting list and telling the general practitioner to find another hospital that might put the child on its list. This simply is not acceptable and that response is just Civil Service-speak, because it does not match the reality of the topic on which I have asked this question. I am deeply unhappy with the response. I will forward to the Minister for Health the letter that was sent to the parent because it outlines very well the deficiency.</p>

            <p eId="para_497">I appreciate the Deputy's concern for her constituent and any Member would be concerned for such a case. In this case, I ask the Deputy to furnish the details of the case to the Minister in order that it can be investigated. However, I can only go on the information that has been collected and presented to me, which indicates that more than half the people now are on waiting lists for less than six months and that almost 75% are waiting for less than 12 months. I do not suggest there is not an exception to the case and if what the Deputy has outlined is accurate, there may be an exception to the case. Were she to furnish the details, I certainly would have the matter investigated, no problem.</p>

            <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_502">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_503"> At its meeting yesterday, as expected the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions did not accept the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, proposals for a new public service pay and industrial relations agreement. Clearly the Government is disappointed at that outcome. It is disappointed because it believes the LRC proposals represented a fair, balanced and negotiated resolution to the stark problem that faces the country, namely, that the Government cannot afford to pay its employees as much as it now does.</p>
            <p eId="para_504"> The proposals would have ensured that direct pay reductions were reduced, in so far as possible, through public service-delivered productivity. By increasing productivity, it would have allowed the Government to deliver the same level of services with a smaller number of staff and fewer agency workers supplied from the private sector. Consequently, the Government could have reduced the cost of the pay bill by reducing numbers of employees in a voluntary way, while avoiding substantial reductions in the services delivered to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_505"> The proposals would have contained the really big drivers of the cost of delivering modern public services, especially those which must run on an all-day and through-the-weekend basis. At the same time, they respected the important principle that those public workers who must work at unsocial or inconvenient times at nights or at weekends should receive more pay for that work. Finally, where direct pay cuts had to be applied, they would have applied only at the upper levels of pay and they were the people who have been asked to take that reduction. The core salaries of the 87% of public workers who earn less than €65,000 were to be protected. The majority of those who earned above that amount but less than €100,000 received an assurance that their pay rates would be restored after 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> The LRC proposals therefore went a long way towards avoiding the highly unpalatable outcomes for public servants and giving them security about their terms of employment up to 2016. However, I recognise it is unprecedented to ask public servants to sign up to an agreement that has a negative impact on their pay and conditions and it is now clear that a majority were not willing to so do. It is a matter of regret that, as has been made clear on many occasions by the Government in recent weeks, a rejection of these proposals does not change the inexorable budgetary arithmetic. To conform to its budgetary targets and to continue on its path to economic recovery, the Government must make payroll savings of €300 million this year and €1 billion by 2015. The Government will now reflect on the outcomes of the ballot and the manner in which the required savings can be achieved this year and onwards. It must consider how to do so, while ensuring the ongoing delivery of public services to the people of Ireland, who depend upon them.</p>

            <p eId="para_507">I thank the Minister for his reply. What surprises me with regard to the Minister's handling of this issue is that if he thought it was such a good deal, why did he contribute so much, more than anyone else, to its rejection? In the week before the deal was agreed, the Minister started by putting out black propaganda against health workers and how much they were paid on Sundays. Thereafter, at a critical time in the talks he himself forced a large proportion of public sector workers to withdraw from the talks. He set about a policy of divide and conquer. In an interview with the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 17 March to give himself good publicity during the St. Patrick's weekend, he referred to an across-the-board pay cut and stated, "It is inefficient, in my view, and does not contribute to the process of long-term reform contained in [the] ... agreement".</p>

            <p eId="para_509">Subsequently, the Minister went on to threaten an across-the-board pay cut of 7%, which is the precise opposite of what he had indicated in the aforementioned interview. Thereafter his colleague, another Labour Party Minister, appeared on television during the final hours of the voting period to state that such an across-the-board pay cut would not apply to low-paid workers, which is something the Minister himself never said. The aforementioned colleague then stated that even were the deal to be rejected, there would be plenty of wriggle room. Is it any wonder the deal was voted down? To revert to my question, what actions will the Minister take? While he has told Members the current position, my question looks forward to where we will go next.</p>
            <p eId="para_510">Where is the Minister going next with the proposal that he, with help from other Labour Ministers, ensured was rejected by public sector workers?</p>

            <p eId="para_511">I am not going to engage in fisticuffs on these really important issues with the Deputy opposite. In respect of the notion that there was any black propaganda, if I said anything at any stage that was untrue the Deputy should put it on the record now.</p>
            <p eId="para_512"> I noticed that the Deputy himself set out the Fianna Fáil position last Sunday on national television. He said that we should not be looking for €300 million in savings this year but for €350 million. He contested 6% of the €1 billion set out in the LRC recommendations that I supported, €60 million for front-line services. In other words, he accepted 94% of the proposals. We have an issue to address, a shortfall of €300 million in the allocated, voted monies on the pay side of our budget for this year. We have to address this because neither I nor the Government intend that the matter should continue to a crisis point. We are calmly reflecting upon the decision of workers and it is quite clear that different workers voted for different reasons. The very highest paid, including the IMO, senior civil servants, rejected it. They were hardly doing so because it failed to impact on high pay. Others who were very minimally affected voted against it for other reasons. We have to reflect on that but the inescapable issue Government has to address is that we need to find the money.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_249">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_513">It does not really matter at this juncture that the Minister's view remains that the Croke Park deal was fair, equitable, balanced and all of the vocabulary he has used. The workers did not act impulsively or rashly, they thought about this carefully and had done the maths. Whereas the Minister has said the core pay of 87% of workers was unaffected, the difficulty was that in respect of premium payments and allowances and so on people were being hit very hard, particularly at the front line. That is now water under the bridge.</p>
            <p eId="para_514"> The Minister entered into a process in which the unions were summoned, a deal was struck and it was agreed that the deal would then be put to ballot. The Minister's predecessors in Fianna Fáil never went through that routine: they simply legislated unilaterally. The Minister voluntarily sought to engage the unions and the workers in this process. Now the unions have come back and said "No thanks, we are not signing up to that". It is therefore absolutely critical that the Minister make clear today to the unions but more importantly to the workers that he accepts their verdict in respect of that deal. It is also important that he clarifies today that he will not in fact legislate for a 7% cut across the board. I would like him to do that. He is hiding behind reflection and consideration. By all means let him reflect and consider but he should make it clear to workers, particularly low-paid civil and public servants that he, a Labour Minister, will not legislate for a 7% cut across the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_515"> Can he tell us also how he got on with the troika? I understand he took a call from them. What did they say to him? What did he say to them? What now is the process? While the Minister reflects it is entirely reasonable that we ask him what is plan B. I would like to hear from him today that plan B does not entail legislating for a 7% cut across the board because that was the threat, or the promise that he made to workers in the course of this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_516">The Deputy is right. It remains the view of Government that a negotiated agreed settlement would be the preferable way to advance these issues. That is why we did not take unilateral action as our predecessors in government did. In a very measured way we opened the books of the State to the trade unions to let them understand that we had a hole in the arithmetic, thanks to the previous Administration which had unallocated savings for this year and especially for next year, that I believed could not be met by continuing reductions across the board in respect of front-line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_517"> On that basis we sought a proportionate contribution from the pay bill, that is, since the balance of adjustments to be made on the expenditure side was €3 billion and since the pay bill is of the order of 35% of current expenditure, €1 billion of the €3 billion should come from that. We sought to do that in a proportionate and fair way with the burden falling on those best able to meet it and for the people who understood, the trade union movement and the workers' representatives to negotiate that. The negotiated settlement brokered by the Labour Relations Commission was demonstrably a fair proposal. I agree entirely that to ask any set of workers to vote for a worsening of their conditions in any way, whether it is an extra hour's work for no pay or any reduction at all, is difficult. All the adjustments we have made over the past few years have been difficult for people dependent on social welfare, health and education services. All expenditure reductions are difficult.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> The trade union movement will want to reflect on its position. The Government must and is reflecting on its position but the inescapable issue that we must address is that we need to find €300 million this year from additional payroll savings.</p>

            <p eId="para_520">The Minister has spoken twice but has not told us what he is going to do although he has decided what he is going to do. Yesterday, here in the Dáil, we voted to allow the Revised Estimates for 2013 go to the committees next week. The Minister was in the House on Tuesday and the briefing note on the Estimates from the Government to the Opposition parties stated that they largely follow the budget day allocations with the pay deal recommendations by the Labour Relations Commission having been programmed into departmental Estimates. The Minister produced Estimates, and published them yesterday, that factored in the pay deal cuts in the agreement and he will want the committees to approve them next Tuesday. The Minister has decided what he is doing next. He is working unilaterally and he intends voting the measures through the Estimates line by line, Department by Department, next week. He should have told us he was doing that when we asked him what he was doing.</p>

            <p eId="para_522">The Minister is sending out mixed messages because on the one hand he says he favours a negotiated settlement and that he will not act unilaterally. If that is the case he is not legislating unilaterally, never mind for a 7% cut. That suggests that he is going to go back and re-engage with the unions and the workers. The point is well made in respect of the Estimates and the factoring in of the deal. He was taking that almost as a <i>fait accompli</i>. He may be reflecting but he is causing confusion. If it is the case that he intends to act unilaterally and to force legislation through, despite the vote of workers and their unions, he should just say so. There is no need for a protracted reflection period. If he were to do that it would represent the heaviest hand of this Government to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> It does not really matter that he still thinks the LRC proposals and Croke Park II were fair and the best deal, as they have been rejected. It is gone.</p>
            <p eId="para_524">The Minister needs to find €300 million this year, accumulating to €1 billion by 2015, and he is hell bent that this must come from the public service payroll. He knows well, because I have argued long and hard about this, that he can go ahead and target overpaid and over pensioned people in the system but he cannot credibly levy further hardship on low and middle income earners if he is serious about maintaining decent public services and rebuilding the domestic economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_529">We have had two speeches from the Deputies rather than questions. I made a decision to publish the Estimates, which are based on the implementation of the LRC recommendations, because that is what we hoped to do. We had to have some basis for apportioning the €300 million and I wanted the Estimates out because they had been delayed. There are agencies that need funding and, therefore, we need to pass the formal Votes. Obviously, if there is a different formula for the €300 million, we will come back to the committees to have those adjustments made, as is normal, in the course of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> Deputy McDonald has the same mantra always. A total of 87% of public sector workers do not earn more than €65,000 and regard that income as a lot of money. To ask for a proportionate contribution of between 5% and 9% from those earning in excess of €65,000 is reasonable. The Deputy referred to high rollers. It is a lovely jibe to make and she will probably get her headline tomorrow again. If the proposals had been implemented, a Minister would have earned €100,000 less than at the height of the boom. That indicates how much we have attempted to reduce pay over time because we are determined that there will be a proportionate response to these difficult challenges. This morning, the Tánaiste challenged the Deputy's party to introduce legislation to cap all public sector pay at €100,000 per annum if that is what they believe is necessary. We will see how many consultant doctors, judges and so on remain in the system once that is done.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_550">I reiterate my disappointment at the decision of the executive committee of the ICTU not to accept the LRC proposals. However, it is still worth addressing some of the misconceptions that arose in respect of the proposals on work-life balance arrangements in the public service and I thank the Deputy for tabling this question. </p>
            <p eId="para_551"> Work-life balance arrangements in the public service are among the best available options provided by Irish employers, particularly when considered in tandem with annual leave and other provisions. Flexible working arrangements, including flexible starting and finishing times, generous leave entitlements, the capacity to take career breaks and so on, are available across the public service and we are proud of that. Had the LRC's proposals been accepted and implemented, this would have continued to be the case. </p>
            <p eId="para_552"> The most popular and widely availed of work sharing arrangements would not have been affected by the proposals. Flexi-time would still have been available with most employees able to use additional hours worked in one period to facilitate leave in the next. The proposals would have reduced flexi-leave from a potential 19.5 days flexi-leave a year to 13. This would still have been a generous provision by any comparison.</p>
            <p eId="para_553"> In recognition of the valuable contribution made by those with caring responsibilities to our society, those in receipt of carer’s allowance were not being asked to increase their hours above the 15 hour a week limit for payment of their allowance. Furthermore, in support of our commitment to achieving the public service target of a 3% employment rate for those with disabilities, such employees who had reached a reasonable accommodation with their employer to work less than 50% of full-time hours would have been able to continue to avail of these arrangements for as long as they were required. </p>
            <p eId="para_554"> Some of the LRC proposals in respect of flexi-time and work sharing simply reiterated management prerogatives that are currently in place in line with previously agreed arrangements. The LRC proposals to revise flexi-time and work sharing were timely in the context of falling numbers and changing demands for public services. The flexibility facilitated by these arrangements is valuable to both staff and management but they must support the business of the organisation and the provision of services to the public, which is the core objective. The proposals sought to streamline existing arrangements in order that a satisfactory balance could be struck between the delivery of the business needs of the employer – in this case the consistent delivery of high level public services to the people of Ireland – and the need for working parents and carers to have flexibility to meet their personal commitments. </p>
            <p eId="para_555"> In light of this, I do not believe that the proposals would have acted as a push factor for those with caring responsibilities to leave the public sector.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_556">Life-work balance was good in the public service but the arrangements proposed under the Croke Park II agreement would have undermined it in a big way. The Minister is probably familiar with the equity audit carried out by equality expert, Niall Crowley, who is the former head of the Equality Authority. The audit focused on the changes to working conditions proposed, something which has not received as much media attention as the pay elements. The proposals included pay cuts, increment freezes and changes to working conditions such as longer working weeks with no additional pay. The equality audit focused on the impact of the proposed changes on women and men with caring responsibilities. The key results showed that the provision for additional working hours would have a higher impact on them. That could force women and carers out of the workforce. Second, the provision regarding work sharing, which was to be reduced under the agreement, would have a similar impact. Women and carers would be disproportionately hit. Third, the proposed reduction in flextime arrangements would impact more negatively on women and carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_557"> One of the principal guiding lights of the agreement was supposed to be an increase in productivity but the proposed cuts could lead to a loss of productivity. Does the Minister not think, given everything that has happened following the implementation of austerity measures, which has undermined the social contract that has been built up since the Second World War, that these proposals will further erode the conditions of those who have suffered most through the austerity campaign, particularly women and children?</p>

            <p eId="para_558">The Deputy has raised two distinct and separate issues. I strongly agree regarding the social contract for the past 30 years, which my party has consistently focused on to develop. The input of people from Brendan Corish to Frank Cluskey to Michael O'Leary and others in the employment area is testament to the contribution my party has made to advancing the terms and conditions of workers, particularly women, in this society.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">It is an inescapable fact that we are in unprecedented times and need to save money. This can be done in a variety of ways. The Deputies opposite oppose virtually everything we suggest, as is their prerogative.</p>

            <p eId="para_561">I propose to address the specifics of this issue because it is important. I have noted and read the equality audit report commissioned by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which was launched in the middle of the ballot. The work-life balance arrangements in the public sector would have remained among the best available to any worker in the State if the Labour Relations Commission proposals had been implemented. That should be acknowledged.</p>
            <p eId="para_562"> Deputy Mick Wallace referred to work-sharing and asked how many work sharers would have been affected if the proposals had been implemented. Does he have any idea of the figure involved? In the region of 2% of those currently work-sharing in the Civil Service have a work-share pattern of less than 50% and almost 90% of work-sharers avail of the most popular and widely available patterns. Therefore, the vast majority of those engaged in work-sharing would not have been affected by the proposals.</p>

            <p eId="para_563">The Minister is well aware that the conditions of women and carers have been seriously undermined, not only this year and last year but also during the previous three years. The Croke Park II agreement was the straw that broke the camel's back and it is fitting that it was rejected in the same week that Mrs. Thatcher was buried, given that the former British Prime Minister broadly shared the Government's philosophy. Mrs. Thatcher wanted to cut the public sector and privatise state assets and it is frightening that the Labour Party is taking part in a similar process. There is a strong correlation between what is being done now and what Maggie Thatcher was up to in her time in power.</p>

            <p eId="para_566">Generalisations such as the statement the proposals would have completely upset the work-life balance are great. The Deputy referred to work-sharing and I responded. He should give me an example of all the other issues he raises and I will give him a detailed response to show his statements are not correct. As for his claims that the Government or my party is somehow Thatcherite, we are doing what we need to do to recover the economy. We could pretend, as some of those opposite do, that we can continue to borrow more than €1 billion per annum to provide for the current level of expenditure on public services. There are two simple inescapable facts. First, nobody will continue to give us €1 billion if we do not balance our books and, second, we cannot continue to pile debt on the shoulders of the next generation. The national debt will peak this year at a figure in excess of 120% of GDP, which is dangerously high. We are determined that when this occurs, it will mark the start of the reduction of the national debt to give a chance to the next generation to live, work and thrive in this country.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_286" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_568">In October 2012 the Government decided to accelerate the rate of headcount reduction in the public service, agreeing an end-2014 target of 282,500. Reaching this target will require a reduction of some 8,000, or just under 3%, from the serving numbers recorded at the end of 2012. At this point, the public service will be broadly the same size as it was in 2003-04. This planned level of public service numbers reduction should be understood in the context of the Government’s public service reform agenda. Of course, the need to reduce our unsustainable budget deficit is a factor in this and the headcount reduction will make an important contribution to reducing the cost of public services, but perhaps, more importantly, it is also about laying the foundations of a leaner, more efficient and integrated public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_569"> The size of the public service has reduced by about 10% since the peak of 2008. While this level of reduction has posed challenges across many areas, front-line services have been largely protected and, in parallel, there has been real and permanent reform of service delivery models to the benefit of citizens and businesses. The better use of new technologies, for example, has enabled enhanced access for the public to many services: over 400 public services are accessible via the Government’s central portal – <i>www.gov.ie</i> – with more to be added over time in line with the e-government strategy; the Department of Social Protection is enhancing its client operations with the introduction of a one-stop-shop, which will bring under one roof all of the services available to and in support of the unemployed; and the new public services card will facilitate easier access to Government services, with more than 150,000 cards now issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> The Deputy asks about a cost benefit analysis. As he is aware, CBA is a specific technical evaluation tool for appraising the merits of individual expenditure programmes or capital projects. It weighs the cost of a proposal against the gains or benefits to the economy and-or society as a whole. CBA is designed as a tool to help inform decisions on whether to undertake a particular expenditure such as building a new road or introducing an employment subsidy scheme - it would not be an appropriate tool for looking at headcount reduction in the public service and would not usefully inform decisions in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_571"> As I have said, the reduction of numbers in the public service needs to be understood both in the context of the fiscal constraints and the programme of ongoing reform. The Government believes the public service has to be more efficient and deliver better services at a lower cost. This is what the economy as a whole needs to do: be more productive and, therefore, more competitive internationally. That is the only way to secure long-term economic growth, recover lost ground and improve the lives of the people.</p>

            <p eId="para_572">It is good that the Minister has said he wishes, as a member of the Labour Party, to reduce public service numbers by a further 8,000 before the end of next year. That is a net reduction and it should be noted that teachers and many others who leave the public service will have to be replaced. The target of further reducing the number of jobs in the public service by 8,000 was originally set for 2015. I am surprised by the Minister's statement that he announced last October his intention to bring forward the target by 12 months. I do not recall that announcement, which he has just confirmed, being made.</p>
            <p eId="para_573"> The Minister referred to a targeted redundancy programme introduced some months ago to reduce public sector headcount by 5,000. The Labour Relations Commission's document about which we have spoken refers to a further headcount reduction of between 2,000 and 2,500, bringing the total to 8,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_575">I ask the Minister to reconsider his position on carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. I have never heard of another case of a company or body that was about to incur costs arising from a major redundancy programme refusing to consider carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Every company and organisation that lays off staff estimates what will be the cost of the redundancy programme versus the projected savings. The Minister has stated one can only carry out such cost-benefit analyses for road building and other capital projects. I have never heard anyone else make a similar statement. I ask him to do the public service a favour by asking the person who wrote his reply to learn something about economics.</p>

            <p eId="para_576">On occasion I have heard the Deputy and members of his party state there are too many administrators in the Health Service Executive. This arose because a superstructure was placed on top of the old health board system when the HSE was established. Most believe there is scope for de-manning in the HSE, which has identified 1,500 positions that could be eliminated. Over-manning has also been identified in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which has identified 300 positions, and a number of other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_577"> The notion that it is good to keep people artificially employed runs counter to the need to have efficient public services. People want to ensure they get value for money. The Government has determined that there will not be compulsory redundancies and I hope we will yet have an agreement that will protect this determination. However, this may not be possible. We need to reach the target numbers by being more efficient. We have achieved a great deal in recent years, including a large number of efficiencies, as is manifest in our ability to protect front-line services with fewer people doing different things. Every company in the country is doing this, as it seeks to become more efficient. We are using new technologies to deliver public services. There appears to be a notion that the public service should be moribund, get caught in a warp or refuse to use new technologies, shared services or have online access to services.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">For example, anyone who wishes to tax his or her car does so online rather than by filling out a form and making a payment at his or her local authority office. Some 400 services are available online now and even more are going to come on stream. This is the way forward.</p>

Will he identify one single action he has taken in this area since he became Minister? Last year he referred to cutting allowances, but the move in that regard was an utter failure. This year he has come forward with the proposal to which my question relates, but that has now gone up in smoke. Nothing he has announced has ever come to pass. In fact, the reductions to which he refers came about as a result of tough decisions taken by Fianna Fáil when it was in government. The current Administration has not introduced a targeted redundancy programme since it came to office. It has not introduced any reforms but has instead issued press releases.</p>

The Deputy should visit my Department's website, where he can read about all the proposals - with timelines - we are rolling out in order to fundamentally alter the public service.

I am sure he will concede that Bord Gáis is a very successful company. It is self-financing and - in common with the ESB - it has consistently returned a dividend to the State. By any standard, the energy sector is both sensitive and strategic in nature. I imagine the Minister and I can agree on that fact. I am of the view that the Government is making a very big mistake in selling off Bord Gáis Energy. This is a decision it will live to regret. The great value of energy utilities is the fact that they are integrated entities.</p>

            <p eId="para_593">-----in respect of my protecting the highest paid. The Deputy knows these things and she plays her particular game. I will deal with the specifics of this matter. If one considers the position objectively, one will realise that the notion that selling the energy division of Bord Gáis is butchering the assets of the State is fanciful. There are two large energy companies in State ownership in this country and these compete with each other on a notional basis. The larger of the two, ESB, was not permitted to benefit from an energy cost reduction and the purpose of this was to create an artificial market with another State company. That was what passed for competition in the past. It is my opinion that the consumers and workers of Ireland who depend on and want affordable energy would be happier if there was real competition between an external player and a robust, lean ESB, while Bord Gáis concentrated on its gas pipelines, which is what it was established to do in the first instance. Bord Gáis is a very successful company. Its expansion into certain areas - running wind farms, etc. - was never envisaged when it was established.</p>
            <p eId="para_594"> Does the Deputy believe that a power station in Spain is an essential part of the assets of a company such as ESB, particularly at a time when the State needs financial resources in order to invest in job creation? She will be aware that I have renegotiated the troika agreement to ensure that the financial resources that will be leveraged from the sale of these assets will be invested in job creation. If I do not have time now, I will refer to the position with regard to Coillte when replying to the Deputy's next supplementary.</p>

            <p eId="para_595">The Minister is engaging in a degree of historical revisionism in the context of energy prices within the State. Those prices shot up as a result of the adoption of a European Union directive that insisted upon deregulation of the market. The Minister is correct: those prices were increased to artificially high levels and then maintained in order to make what is a very small market alluring to major players. This is because we do not have the same economies of scale that obtain in larger continental countries. That is done, however, and the issue that now arises is whether the Government, on behalf of the people, is going to maintain in State ownership assets in strategically important areas. The energy sector is one of the latter. Before he listed what he intended to flog off, the Minister used to say that only so-called non-strategic assets would be sold. He really laboured that phrase. I am really struggling to understand - despite the standards they have kept while in government - how any Labour Party representative in his or her right mind could describe the area of energy as anything other than utterly strategic. The Minister is, however, clearly not open to my view in this regard. How much does he expect to realise from the sale of Bord Gáis Energy and the two ESB power plants in Spain and England?</p>

            <p eId="para_603">The Senior Public Service, SPS, was established with the aim of strengthening senior management and leadership, initially across the Civil Service. Membership of the SPS comprises all Secretaries General, deputy secretaries, assistant secretaries, directors and related grades in the Civil Service. Over time, the SPS will be extended to senior levels of the wider public service. The SPS is overseen by the SPS management committee, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. A secretariat was established within the Department to provide support to the committee and to support the drawing up and implementation of SPS initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> A leadership development strategy for the SPS will be published shortly. It sets out a number of programmes for supporting leadership development. In this context, executive coaching has been identified as a means of improving leadership capacity and individual performance at senior management level. It is widely used in the private sector as an effective leadership development tool. A successful pilot coaching programme, which had a beneficial impact on participants, was run last year at assistant secretary level. Following the programme's evaluation, the management committee decided that the proposal to extend a further coaching programme to all SPS grades had merit.</p>
            <p eId="para_605"> A tender process to enlist a panel of experienced coaches to service the programme is under way. The intention is that the coaching panel will remain in place until the end of 2015. An invitation to members of the SPS to apply to participate in the programme will issue in the coming days. It is envisaged that contracts will be awarded in May and that the programme will commence shortly thereafter.</p>

            <p eId="para_608">I thank the Deputy for welcoming this initiative. One of my first acts was to establish the SPS. We took this opportunity shortly after the Government was formed. At that point, we had summoned all of our ambassadors back to Ireland so that we could give them a briefing on the programme for Government and our economic strategy, allowing for a joined-up international presentation. All assistant secretaries and above were together and I used that forum to discuss the SPS and to build an integrated unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_609"> My two main concerns about the areas of the public service that I have examined relate to quality of management and proper evaluations of performance. We must improve these elements, albeit not necessarily in a critical way, that is, by pointing the finger at those who are not up to scratch. We should give them the capacity to be up to scratch. There will be coaching and evaluation systems and I will shortly produce a comprehensive paper on restructuring and instituting proper evaluations in the Civil Service. When my Department finishes its work in this regard, we can discuss the matter, perhaps in committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_618">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 39 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_619"> The Government continues to make good progress in achieving all of our deficit targets and priorities, as articulated in the Government programme. We are bringing public expenditure back onto a sustainable path and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort, which is essential to achieving our annual deficit targets. To date, all quantitative fiscal targets set as part of the EU-IMF programme of financial support have been met in full.</p>
            <p eId="para_620"> The expenditure report 2013, published on 5 December 2012, includes further well-specified expenditure savings measures across every area of government spending. While the Government's structural economic and budgetary reforms will bring a return to prosperity and growth in the medium term - indeed, the economy grew in real terms in 2011 for the first time since 2007 - the current international economic position, combined with a high level of uncertainty across the world's financial markets, will require Ireland to maintain fiscal discipline into 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_621"> Regarding the monitoring of the performance of various Departments, it remains a matter for each Minister and his or her Department to ensure that the Vote-level allocations are adhered to while ensuring that it continues to provide essential front-line services and manages increasing demands. With this in mind, the new medium-term expenditure framework aims to incentivise Departments through the implementation of a new carryover facility for those that exceed targets and successfully manage their allocations within budget in any year so that they can use those savings in the following year. There will be no pressure on them to spend. The Departments that are proactive in driving reform, innovation and structural planning will be best-placed to avail of this facility. Departments that exceed their current expenditure ceilings in any given year will consequently bear an offsetting adjustment in their envelopes for the following year. They will be required to devise appropriate policy measures to live within their reduced allocations. It will be a matter for Ministers and heads of Departments and offices to devise forward-looking plans and policies and to ensure that the ministerial expenditure ceilings are adhered to.</p>

            <p eId="para_622">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. I acknowledge his herculean efforts and those of his Department, the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and the trade union movement in the long and detailed negotiations. In the end, the proposals did not receive support in the recent vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_623"> Without disadvantaging those who engaged in the discussions and being mindful of the need to include those who raised particular issues, will it be possible to engage in a meaningful and useful way with a view to achieving the preferred result, recognising the important achievements to date and the need to comply with the troika arrangement entered into by the Minister's predecessors?</p>

            <p eId="para_624">I might have the opportunity to respond to Deputy McDonald's question if I piggyback it onto these questions, as I did not mention the troika when she raised that matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_625"> We need to find €300 million in payroll savings in this year's budgetary arithmetic. We must embed them in a way that achieves savings of €1 billion by 2015. When we embarked upon this process, I had no illusions about how difficult it would be. I commended the public sector unions on engaging in the process. It would have been easier for them not to involve themselves and to tell us to impose what measures we wanted so that their fingerprints would not be on them.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">Nevertheless, they did engage and they put forward solutions. Some engaged tentatively. Some attended but did not engage at all. That was their own decision, but those who did engage contributed to what was demonstrably a reasonable package. One could ask what is fair. Is it fair to take a cent off anyone? In truth, all the reductions in expenditure impact on people and we would rather not do it. Any of the reductions could be described as unfair. I refer to the reductions in the social welfare budget in recent years. A previous Government decided to unilaterally cut all pensions and social welfare benefits. All of those things are very difficult. I commend those who were involved. We must now reflect on how we can go forward but the inescapable truth is that we need to get the money.</p>
            <p eId="para_627"> I had more than one discussion with the head of the troika since the vote. He understands the result and what it means. No doubt my officials and the officials from the troika will engage in discussions over time, but they like us understand that this is an issue that must be addressed. We must find a solution that finds the money in the payroll and pensions Bill.</p>

The Minister is fixated on the need to find €300 million within the public sector payroll. Has the troika instructed him that it must be found there, or is it the case with many policy areas, including the sale of State assets which we just discussed, that the targets are set and the troika is hands-off in terms of where the Government finds the money or makes the adjustments? Has the troika instructed the Minister to find the money in the public sector pay envelope?</p>

In addition, we have had a series of financial reports such as the one from the advisory council over the two weeks the Dáil was not sitting which indicated that will have a primary balance in 2015 and that because of the horrific sacrifices ordinary people have made since the disastrous Fianna Fáil blanket bank guarantee – supported by Fine Gael to the hilt-----</p>

Given those circumstances and given the fact that we have an earlier budget this year because of the two pack, is there not a case for giving public servants and the rest of the population a bit of a break, and to give them some kind of encouragement and reward rather than chastising them again? I say that given the kind of pressures people have and the feeling that they are on the edge of a precipice. Could the Minister explain the focus on the €300 million?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_639">I entirely understand the sentiment expressed by Deputy Broughan and I agree with much of it. I do not wish to be in the current position. I do not wish to reduce expenditure in any area of the public service. I do not want to ask public servants to make a contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_640"> I say that because people call for an end to austerity. I would love to end austerity today. The problem is that we are borrowing €1 billion a month for public services. In truth, that is not sustainable in the future. A target has been agreed to get our deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015. In order to do that there is approximately €5 billion in further adjustments remaining. We will divide that between taxation and expenditure reductions. There is €3 billion in the expenditure reduction side. That is in the budgetary arithmetic, in the medium-term fiscal plan and in the agreement with the troika. If we have to save €3 billion, approximately one third – 35% - of expenditure relates to pay. We must focus on that or else pile on the cuts in other areas. That was the choice we made last year. One must decide whether one piles on more on health, education and social welfare. Instead of that we gave those areas relief. The Government added back €150 million last year to health and social welfare in particular to lessen the awful decisions that had to be made in those areas. It is reasonable in a balanced way, if one is going to ask social welfare recipients, those dependent on the health service or who want an education to carry some of the burden, that public servants who earn above €65,000 would make a contribution, in the same way as Members of this House, myself and others, as well as people who are consultants, doctors, judges or senior gardaí – those who are significantly well paid. That is reasonable. That is the strategy.</p>

I accept this is based on hypothesis to a certain extent. Was it possible to illustrate for the troika the Government’s ability to meet its requirements by the end of the year?</p>

            <p eId="para_642">We have a track record with the troika of delivering on every promise the Government made to the troika. Our reputation was rubbish as a nation internationally when we came into office. Among the many big jobs we had was to build our reputation so that people could trust us. The two things we said is that we would not over-promise and we would not under-deliver in what we undertook to do. We have reached all our targets. We have delivered upon 190 individual commitments in the troika programme, many of them involving substantial bodies of legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> I am mindful of what Deputy Broughan said, that people need a break. We must have a horizon that gets us out of this crisis. People want to know that there is hope. That is what we are about now. The bulk of the adjustments have been made - painful, difficult and awful for many people that it was. Let us look forward now to growth, job creation and jobs investment. Let us unite with those who had a strategy of denial on the means to that end on the next phase. Although there is some way to go yet, and there is pain involved – often the last 20% of any journey is the most difficult - when we get beyond the rebalancing we have within sight the prospect of exiting the troika deal, of growth and job creation in our economy. Let us work in tandem to achieve that.</p>

            <p eId="para_647">I tabled the question last week before the Revised Estimates were published. It appeared then that the Estimates would not be published before 1 May which is why I inquired whether they would appear before the summer. The Minister has now published the Estimates. The question relates to more than whether it is just a case of this week or next week. What is the Minister’s timetable for the Revised Estimates to be passed by the Oireachtas now that they are published? I hope that will be done during May. Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister held off on publication of the Revised Estimates while discussions were ongoing does he agree that it is not right that we should discuss the Estimates for 2013 in April and May when 40% of the money for the year in which approval is being sought in the Estimate has already been spent and the overwhelming majority of the balance is already pre-committed?</p>
            <p eId="para_648">We are really just looking at the money and waving at it after the horse has bolted. Europe, thank God, is forcing a situation upon us whereby we will have the Estimates for 2014 published by October. Sometimes good developments come from Europe which we do not seem to be capable of introducing ourselves, for some reason. I ask the Minister to give a commitment to the House that we will have the Estimates for next year in October 2013. Will the Minister give a commitment that the full, revised Estimates for 2014 will be passed before 1 January 2014?</p>

            <p eId="para_651">While the Deputy is going back to the previous question, I am happy to answer that. The arithmetic agreed with the troika was the budget line, which contained an additional saving of €300 million in payroll this year. That was understood when we negotiated the service outline for this year because we wanted to add back money to the Departments of Health and Social Protection. It was understood from the beginning of the year that those additional savings of €300 million, on top of the savings we have already targeted in the pay area, would come from pay. That is the understanding we have with the troika.</p>

            <p eId="para_654">I strongly agree with Deputy Fleming about the nonsense that is discussing last year's Estimates this year. Deputy Howlin is the Minister with responsibility for reform and one of the issues that was often discussed at meetings of the finance committee and the Committee of Public Accounts was the need for the Oireachtas to have a meaningful input into the development of the budget in any given year. The Minister made reference to the first week in October for the publication of the Estimates. Last year, many Deputies tried to present alternative budget proposals, including Deputies from the Labour Party, as well as at least one MEP. Will space be provided for the Oireachtas to have a meaningful involvement, given that the Minister has said that the essential decisions will be made by early October, with the budget being passed before the end of the year? Can we adopt a more European style of drawing up the Estimates and framing budgets?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2013-04-18T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_655">I entirely agree with Deputy Broughan. Parliament has never really been used in a way that meaningfully involves it in the drawing up of the Estimates. It was for that reason that the Government fundamentally changed things. However, it is not just a question of facilitating such involvement - the facilitation must be seized upon by Members of the House. We have published the comprehensive review of expenditure, devised by the Departments, which deals with all of the expenditure issues and options, although those options are not exhaustive and Deputies may think of others. We have also published the three-year envelope of expenditure, so Deputies will know what the envelope of expenditure in the Departments of Health, Education and Skills or Social Protection, for example, is for each of the next three years. Given that Deputies now know all of the issues involved and the envelope, I had hoped that each line committee would meet the Secretary General or Minister in each Department and go through the options. It should also be possible to involve members of the public and groups that have views on such options. The committees could test the options and make recommendations to Government. However, that process probably will not really take off until we are in an expansionary phase again and talking about additional expenditure. Just as it is difficult for the trade union movement to vote for a worsening of terms and conditions, it is difficult for Deputies in opposition, in particular, to come up with proposals to make reductions in public expenditure. It is difficult for them to say that one option is better than another, and so forth, and I understand that. It is, I suppose, base politics. However, if Deputies want to argue for the empowering of Parliament, they must take that on and not simply say, "none of the above", reject the basic premise of the budget line and refuse to engage. Maybe when we move into an expansion phase again, we will have a much more robust pre-debate of the Estimates, involving Parliament as the instrument of the people in the way that it should be.</p>
