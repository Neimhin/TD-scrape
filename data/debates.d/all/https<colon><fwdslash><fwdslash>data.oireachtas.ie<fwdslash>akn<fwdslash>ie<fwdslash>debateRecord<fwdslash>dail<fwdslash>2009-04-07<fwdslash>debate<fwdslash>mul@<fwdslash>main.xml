          <p eId="para_1">In May 2007, the numbers on the live register were 104,000.  In April of this year there are 373,000 plus on the live register, an increase of 219,000 which is more than double the population of the Taoiseach's Laois-Offaly constituency, at 103,673.  It is obvious the country is not working under this Fianna Fáil Administration.  There is no plan for the future of the country, no plan for jobs and no plan for the economic development of Ireland.  The Taoiseach tells us we will have 400,000, and possibly more, out of work by the end of the year and there is a drop in living standards of 10% or 12%, yet we are to have a budget in a little over one hour's time in which the people will be penalised for the mistakes of the party in office.  In the context of this afternoon's budget, I challenge the Taoiseach to say whether he is prepared to put that budget to the people and let them decide in a general election who they want to lead the country out of the economic morass and mess caused in the main by his party in government.</p>

          <p eId="para_6">The Irish people are aware of the serious challenges faced by our country and of what is happening right across the world.  This is probably the biggest recession in 80 years.  This country has not been immune and in fact it has suffered more than most.  Today's budget is another step by this Government — and I hope with sufficient support from the House — to enable us to get on with the business which the people expect us to do, to make the necessary adjustments.  I believe the people are ready to take whatever sacrifices are necessary in the interests of the next generation and in the interests of getting this right over the period ahead.  They know there is no silver bullet, no immediate answer to some of these questions but we will certainly put forward a strategy in the coming years that will outline how we can bring back order to our public finances as this is fundamental as a pathway to economic recovery.  We will also indicate our intended strategy to ensure that the banking system provides us with the necessary financial stability to enable Irish business to get on with protecting as many jobs as it can in the most difficult operating climate for many years.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">As usual the Taoiseach will not answer the questions in here.  I agree the Irish people are well aware of just how serious is this problem.  I agree that the Irish people know well who caused this problem.  I agree that the Irish people have convicted Fianna Fáil and they are waiting for them but Fianna Fáil does not have the courage to rise to that challenge politically.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">At 11% and rising, Ireland's unemployment rate is now higher than Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands.  A total equal to more than twice the adult population of the Taoiseach's constituency of Laois-Offaly has become unemployed in 18 months. The EU estimates that Ireland will have a deficit of 11% of GDP this year.  France is expected to have a deficit of 5.4%, Spain a deficit of 6.2% and Greece a deficit of 3.7%.  Greece has been given four years to sort out its problems and the Taoiseach's Government has been given five.  The global competitiveness report which is compiled every year reported that the quality of Ireland's infrastructure dropped nine places between 2008 and 2009 to become 64th in the world.  We were the fifth most competitive country in 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I listened to the Taoiseach's comments at the weekend about codding the people.  I put it to him that in May 2007 the greatest con job of all was pulled by him as Minister for Finance and his predecessor as Taoiseach when they put out advertisements in the national newspapers to the effect that 97% of the taxpayers of Ireland would be better off under Fianna Fáil.  I note from the communications unit the interview given today by the Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, in which he said that in respect of the last budget the two Brians made a bags of it and that it was unfair.  I am not a supporter of Deputy McGuinness and I do not know if the Taoiseach heard the interview but that is what he said today.  He said the two Brians made a bags of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">We are aware that the country is not working under Fianna Fáil.  Retail shops are closing down, small businesses cannot get credit and 1,000 jobs a day are being lost.  Young people are forced to find a place in the world where they might find some work because of the despair and hopelessness they are experiencing here.  I challenge the Taoiseach again; will he put this budget to the Irish people in a general election and give somebody a mandate to lead this country out of the mess that he and his people over there have created?  Is he prepared to do that or is he not?</p>

Unlike Deputy Kenny, I say to the people openly and honestly that there will be a greater imposition of tax and a greater degree of sacrifice required of all of us.  At the same time, it is far better to be straight and honest about that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_36">It is fair to say that this afternoon the mind of the country is on the announcement from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, of the second budget for 2009.  This will be announced in an hour's time and no doubt it will have implications for the pay packets of people all over the country with regard to taxes and levies, and so on.  That is probably what most people will be discussing over their dinner this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">However, as the Taoiseach stated, that is only one aspect of the issues being considered by the Government at present.  The other has to do with the future of the banking system.  As we know, the Government has made a couple of attempts to deal with the banks, including the guarantee last September, the announced recapitalisation in December which was not proceeded with, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank in January, followed by the recapitalisation of the two larger banks at a cost of €7 billion to the taxpayers.  Over recent weeks and particularly over the past few days, there has been increasing speculation that the Government will make a further announcement of some decisions in respect of banking.   There has been speculation about the possibility of the establishment or creation of a "bad bank" to corral the bad debts.  There have been some suggestions about the establishment of an asset management company under the National Treasury Management Agency and there have been suggestions that the Government may be considering some kind of arrangement or mechanism whereby taxpayers' money will be used to buy up the bad loans of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">What decisions have been made by the Government in respect of the banks?  Will the Government publish the report of Dr. Peter Bacon on which I understand such decisions to have been made?  Would the Taoiseach agree to the suggestion made yesterday by my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, that Dr. Bacon's report might be published as a Green Paper on banking?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_34">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_39">Deputy Gilmore will be aware that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, has indicated that in part of his Supplementary Budget Statement he will make some comments with regard to these matters that are important for the future of our economy.  The motivation of the Government is to ensure we get the Irish banking system to serve the people within its core franchise of providing lending capacity to families, personal borrowers and to Irish businesses.  This will enable it to protect as many jobs as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">As the Deputy is aware, there is an EU set of guidelines on dealing with what are called "impaired assets" and we will be working within that framework.  Other countries have indicated already what they intend to do in this regard.  The decisions we have taken thus far in respect of Irish banking and the State guarantee were absolutely necessary at the time in order to avoid any systemic failure of the Irish banking system and all the chaotic consequences that would have arisen from that.  The recapitalisation policy was a prudent one on behalf of taxpayers and was taken after due diligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">The question of how we manage risk in the future in respect of impaired assets and banks is an important issue for the people.  Our motivation in this regard is to ensure that the problems which are causing the reduction of credit into the real economy, with all the accompanying effects, must be addressed in a very determined, sustained and strategic way.  It is on that basis that the Minister will make some comments on this matter during the course of his Supplementary Budget Statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">The Government has made its decision not simply on the basis of any individual report but based on the advice of the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency.  The latter has done a great deal of work in this area and has built up a very fine reputation over many years with regard to treasury management issues in this country, the management and reduction of our debt and in dealing with our public finances in that respect.  These were the advisors, along with the Department of Finance.  The official advice we received is built around the consensus of opinion that has developed with regard to deciding which is the best way forward.  It is on that basis that the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, will make some comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">As the Deputy is aware, these matters concern some very commercially sensitive, market-sensitive issues and therefore I do not believe at this remove that it is possible to publish such reports.  However, the decisions that will be taken by Government can be explained and brought to the House and any legislative changes that will be necessary on foot of those decisions will provide an opportunity for further debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_35">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_44">I am curious about the way in which the Government is planning to do this.  I understand from what the Taoiseach said that the issue of the banks is to be dealt with in the Budget Statement by the Minister, Deputy Lenihan.  The significance and scale of what is being done, or intended to be done, is very large.  What has been done already is very large.  The guarantee exposes the Irish taxpayer in a considerable way.  The cost of the recapitalisation, namely, taxpayers' money already provided to the banks, is apparently about double what the Government proposes in the budget, in terms of the total impact of the budget's €7 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">There has been speculation over the course of recent days that proposals are being considered by Government which effectively will use taxpayers' money to buy up the bad loans.  This means buying up the half-finished housing estates, the land bought at enormously inflated prices, the property that was the cause of speculation.  Is it the case that in addition to the bail-out of the banks already undertaken by Government there will now be a bail-out of the property speculators who ruined the country?  Is it the case that the announcement of that bail-out will be buried in the Supplementary Budget Statement to  be made later today?  At that time everybody's eye will be on what their tax liability is to be and where they will stand in terms of levies, and so on.  Is it the case that there will be a significant announcement concerning banks buried in the Supplementary Budget Statement?  I would have thought that the scale of what must be done in respect of the banks required a separate announcement by the Government, one that might be examined and debated on its own merits rather than being part of the bigger Supplementary Budget Statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">I do not accept what the Taoiseach said about market sensitivity.  The markets have been sensitive to the banks for a very long time and we see the consequences.  I accept what the Taoiseach said about market sensitivity.  The markets have been sensitive to the banks for a very long time and we see the consequences in the share price.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">The Bacon report is of major significance to the public.  This is our money.  One of the banks has been nationalised and €7 billion of public money has already been put into the banks.  This is not private business any longer; this is public business.  If one compares it to what happened in Sweden in the early 1990s, all of this type of information was put into the public domain and it was this fact that helped to restore confidence.  If the information and the reports on which the Government is making decisions on these matters is not shared with the Opposition parties and made available to the public, it is very difficult for the public to regain the kind of confidence we all accept is required in the banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">Again, I ask the Taoiseach to tell us straight out what the Government intends to do with the banks.  Will it buy up the bad loans?  How much taxpayers' money will be used in this regard?  Can we have sight of the Bacon report, which the Taoiseach now says is just one report?  What other reports is the Government considering in regard to the banking system?</p>

          <p eId="para_49">I want to make it clear to Deputy Gilmore once again that this is not a question of doing anything other than trying to secure the future of the economy.  The whole purpose and motivation of Government involvement and Government policy in this matter is to try to ensure that we maintain financial stability in this country, which is absolutely essential for the purposes of dealing with the issues that are often discussed in this House, namely, the need to create jobs, maintain investment and ensure businesses have access to credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">The continuing effort to try to portray this in the pejorative way in which it has been outlined by Deputy Gilmore does a grave injustice both to the gravity of the situation we need to deal with and the motivation of everyone in this House.  Whatever our differences, we must do whatever we can to try to ensure that the Irish economy has a solid future going forward.  The difficulties of our financial system and banking system have been no different from the difficulties that have arisen in respect of other financial systems and financial institutions in other countries, where governments have had to intervene, as this Government has had to intervene for the purposes of trying to bring forward an economic programme and economic policy that will ensure a future for this country.  That is the truth of it.  Any suggestions to the contrary by anyone in this House does an injustice to that situation.  I am simply saying——</p>

          <p eId="para_61">Second, in regard to the matter that has been raised, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will outline the policy position and strategic approach the Government believes needs to be taken now in the interests of the economy and for no other reason.  The third point I wish to make to Deputy Gilmore is that, from our point of view, everything we seek to do here is to protect the taxpayers' interest at all points.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">With regard to the capitalisation programme which Deputy Gilmore regarded as a bailout, this is about ensuring that we get a return on that money and that the Irish taxpayer is protected in respect of those public funds that have been made available to ensure there is sufficient capital in our banks to enable them to operate.  We also need to see the banks functioning to a far more dynamic extent for the benefit of the economy and business, and the protection of jobs, about which many people talk in this House.  There are major decisions to be taken to ensure that this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Part of this is to ensure that we have a banking system which serves its core franchise of looking after businesses and jobs, personal borrowers and those who have mortgages.  These are the people who are at the centre of our concern, not this continuous pejorative attempt to suggest there is any other motivation in regard to discussions we are having on these important matters.</p>

I know we will have opportunities to vote on particular issues that may arise in the budget during some of the financial motions later today but when will we have the opportunity to vote on the budget in its totality?  As I understand the order that has just been passed, the motion for the General Financial Resolution will be moved at some stage before midnight and a debate on it will start tomorrow which will continue for some time.  The motion for the general financial resolution will be moved at some stage before midnight and a debate on it will start tomorrow, which will continue for some time.  I presume the financial resolutions the Taoiseach is talking about are covered by No. 12 on the Order Paper.  I also noticed No. 22 concerns a resumed debate on the financial resolutions for the 2008 budget on which the House has never voted.  No. 25 regards the financial resolutions from the 2007 budget, on which, again, the House never voted.</p>

I assure the people that we have the capacity and the Government has the will to bring us out of this period of severe economic distress.  We can work our way through our problems.  We have faced adversity in the past and we have prevailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Many of the factors that made us an economic success story in recent years are still with us: social cohesion; political stability; a young, well educated, flexible workforce; and a pro-enterprise, export-oriented economy.  All of this remains intact.  What is wrong in our economy we can fix if we take the right course of action now and if each one of us signs up for that course of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The economic boom this country enjoyed in recent decades brought a remarkable rise in our living standards.  Rapid growth in the early years was driven by exports.  As in many other countries, the later stages were accompanied by a property bubble, fuelled in part by very low interest rates and the ready availability of credit.  Some warned that the housing market was unsustainable.  Plenty did not.  The consensus view suggested a soft landing.  That prediction proved wrong.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that more should have been done to contain the housing market.  We became too reliant on the construction sector for growth and tax receipts.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_192">If all our difficulties related to the recent construction boom in Ireland, I would not be before the House this afternoon.  We are the living witnesses to the most dramatic collapse in the world financial system since 1929.  We are a small open economy with a huge exposure to international economic trends.  Our confidence, our finances, our exports and our banks have been dented.  The depreciation in the value of the currency of our nearest neighbour has compounded this adverse international picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Recent data show that the gross national product declined by 3% last year.  A more substantial contraction of the order of 8% is in prospect this year.  This is a serious decline in national living standards — the sharpest fall on record.  Forecasts for 2010 are not as severe.  However, we must place our performance in context.  Economic activity is shrinking in almost all of our main trading partners.  In the OECD area which covers most high-income countries, incomes will decline by 4.25% this year.  The slowdown has been sharper in Ireland, reflecting the contraction of the property sector, and the openness of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Last October, forecast inflation for this year was 2.5%.  Like many forecasts this prediction has seen radical revision.  It is expected that consumer prices will fall by close to 4% this year.  As consumers, we are accustomed to rising prices.  However, prices of goods and services are now falling, moving back toward levels pertaining in other euro zone countries.  This decline in prices mitigates the effects on real household incomes of falling nominal wages and higher taxes on incomes.  With falling costs our economy is displaying remarkable agility.  This will strengthen us in the euro zone.  I am confident that sooner than many observers expect, we will position ourselves to take full advantage of a global upturn.  This adjustment in our cost structure sows the seed for export-led economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">There are six steps we must take to restore and renew this economy.  First, and most urgent, we must stabilise our public finances.  Until we show that we can put our own house in order, we cannot expect those who have invested here and who might invest here in the future to have confidence in us.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Second, we must restore our damaged banking system to ensure credit flows to businesses and consumers.  Credit is the life blood of the economy.  Unless we take radical and bold action to resolve the crisis that has staunched the flow of credit, this economy will not recover.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Third, we must regain the competitiveness we have lost through over-reliance on domestic spending during the boom years.  The future of our economy lies in exports.  We must work harder to gain market share.  We must drive down our costs and improve the quality of our products so that we are well placed to gain when the tide changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Fourth, we must protect the jobs we have and invest in retraining those who have lost jobs.  Already this year, 80,000 additional people have gone on the live register.  At the end of the last year, there were 2 million people employed in this economy but this is falling and we must take all possible and sensible measures to protect and support existing jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Fifth, we must support and stimulate economic confidence as much as we can within the resources available.  However, as I said earlier, stabilising our public finances is crucial to the recovery of confidence among investors, consumers and businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Sixth, we must restore our reputation abroad.  We have been badly damaged by the actions of some in our financial sector.  We have been damaged by our rejection of the Lisbon treaty.  We must show our EU partners that we, who have gained so much from the European Union, want to remain at its centre.  We must show the world that our financial system is soundly based and governed by the highest standards of regulation.  If we follow the six steps I have outlined we will be well on the road to economic renewal.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Fairness must be the cornerstone of all our efforts to achieve economic renewal.  Everyone wants fairness but there is less agreement about what it means.  For many, it means the next person should pay, but the reality is everyone must give according to their means.  Those who have most must give most.  However, before we ask anyone else to give, we in this House and in the Government must examine our own costs.  Those of us in politics have been entrusted with a great privilege by the people.  We must lead by example.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The Government has decided to introduce a number of additional changes to the remuneration of Deputies and Senators.  There will be a 10% reduction in all expenses other than mileage rates where a 25% reduction has already taken place.  Deputies will no longer receive long-service payments or increments.  I know that Deputies do not enter this House as a career.  It is an honour and vocation to be elected by the people, and all Deputies are equal.  The arrangement whereby former Ministers are paid ministerial pensions while they are still Members of the Oireachtas will be discontinued.  Oireachtas Members who are on paid leave of absence as teachers may no longer avail of the arrangement whereby they can keep the difference between their teachers' salary and the cost of employing a replacement.  The allowances paid to Oireachtas committee chairs will be halved and the payments to whips and vice-chairs are to be abolished.  The Oireachtas Commission has put forward its own proposals for a reduction in the number of committees and I am happy to leave that matter to the Houses.  Some of these changes will require legislation which will be introduced shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">The Members of this Government reduced their salaries by 10% last October.  Ministers of State made a similar reduction.  The public service pension levy was applied to members of the Government and Ministers of State.  As a result, Ministers have seen a reduction of one fifth in their incomes.  I have asked the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector to undertake a fresh review of top level pay rates to take account of the changed budgetary and economic circumstances and the changed private sector pay environment and to benchmark rates against those of other EU countries of comparable scale.  This review will be completed by July.  I believe pay at leadership levels in the public sector should be more in line with pay in other countries rather than with top level private sector pay in this country which had become over-inflated in recent years and is now falling in any event.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach announced that the number of Ministers of State will be reduced from 20 to 15.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">In framing this budget, the Government has been guided by the principle that everyone should contribute according to their means.  Tax increases are required and they will not be easy to accept but the measures I am announcing today are progressive.  Those who can best afford it will pay most.  For example, as a result of the changes proposed today, a person earning the minimum wage, which is approximately €17,500 per year, will be asked to pay €350 per annum or €7 per week, representing 2% of their wages.  A person earning €50,000 per year will pay €1,500 or €29 per week, which is 4% of their income.  A person earning €300,000 per year will pay €15,655 or €300 per week, or 9% of their income.  Fairness requires that the real value of social welfare benefits should be protected as far as possible at this stage of the economic crisis.  It is for the Government and this House to adjudicate on fairness, but we all have a responsibility to accept a proportionate share of the burden of adjustment needed in this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">STABILISING OUR PUBLIC FINANCES</p>
          <p eId="para_206">The Financial Context</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The pre-budget data published last week show a €5 billion widening from the budget deficit projected this January.  A correction of this amount in a full year approximates to a €3.25 billion adjustment in the part of this year which remains.  The Government recognises that part of this shortfall relates to the global economic cycle.  It is reasonable to expect part of the shortfall to disappear as economic activity recovers here and abroad.  However, part of the gap between spending and revenues derives from structural problems in the public finances.  We must take firm actions to eliminate these problems within a reasonable period of time.  Our approach is rooted in a determination to control our own destiny.  We cannot control developments abroad, and we cannot control what others think of us, but we can take decisive actions to put this economy on the road to renewal and demonstrate that we have the ability to make the right choices for everyone in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The problem is our expenditure base is too high and our revenue base is too low.  If we fail, refuse or neglect to address this structural problem we will condemn this and future generations to the folly of excessive borrowing.  Already, the share of tax revenues that goes to service the national debt has risen from 5% in 2007 to more than 11% this year.  As we accumulate more and more public debt, this figure increases.  This is dead money that should be used to improve vital public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Without this supplementary budget the general government deficit would have been 12¾% of GDP, reflecting the large gap needed to fund the difference between spending and revenue.  In the prevailing economic circumstances, the natural preference would be to leave expenditure and taxation as they stand.  This is not an option for the Government or this House because of the scale of the deterioration of the public finances.  A difficult balance must be struck between the need to show a credible way forward on our structural problems and the need to protect our economy as far as we can this year.  It is the considered view of the Government that a borrowing target of 10¾% strikes the correct balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">To date this year, the Government has reduced public expenditure by €1.8 billion primarily through a reduction in the public service pay bill.  Measures announced today will result in a further reduction of nearly €1.5 billion in gross public expenditure and additional revenue of €1.8 billion.  The scope for additional expenditure reductions at this stage of the year is limited.  Further immediate reductions in expenditure today would have necessitated additional pay cuts for public servants, reductions in the rates of payments for welfare recipients and the cancellation of all contractually uncommitted investment projects.  It is important that Members of this House understand that in commenting on this budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The deterioration in tax revenues from €47.25 billion in 2007 to almost €41 billion in 2008 to an envisaged €34.50 billion this year is a far greater decline than the decline in the economy.  This illustrates that in recent years our tax system became over reliant on fast growing, construction heavy economic activity.  As we move to the next stage of our economic development, we must restructure our tax system to suit an export-led economy growing at a more sustainable pace.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Multi-Annual Plan</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Last January, the Government proposed to the European Commission that we could fulfil our obligations to secure stability and growth over a five year period.  I am glad to report to this House that following intensive discussions with the European Commission, agreement has been reached with the Commission that five years is the appropriate timeframe for addressing our structural problems.  I want to express my gratitude to Commissioner Almunia and my colleagues among the eurozone member states who have been supportive of our efforts to stabilise the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">To bring sustainability to the public finances, the Government is today announcing the necessary multi-annual consolidation plan.  In 2010 and 2011, the plan envisages greater reductions in expenditure than increases in revenue.  I want to stress that the expenditure figures are the minimum that must be achieved and the figures mentioned for tax are the very maximum that can be imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Spending reductions that the Government has decided on for 2009 to 2011 will have a cumulative full year effect on current spending of €2.7 billion in 2010 and €4.2 billion in 2011.  Reductions in capital spending will accumulate to €1.3 billion in 2010 and €2.4 billion by 2012.  The policy decisions underlying these reductions are already in train.  They entail further reductions in pay costs, programmes and numbers.  There is no provision for extra social spending, other than that dictated by demography and unemployment.  There will be a cap on capital spending and efficiencies will be found throughout the public sector.  Savings on day-to-day spending will be made through more targeted welfare provision and further reductions in public service costs and numbers and the wider application of charges.  Sharper targeting of programme spending and more efficient use of resources across the board will be required.  Difficult decisions in all areas of policy are in prospect.  In 2010, we will seek up to an additional €1.75 billion from taxation.  In 2011, the target will be to raise up to an additional €1.5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Options to raise this may include the taxation of child benefit, the introduction of a carbon tax, a form of property tax and significant further base broadening through the elimination of unnecessary reliefs and a review of all areas of tax exempt incomes.  Over the later years of the five year plan, further adjustments will be required.  The scale and nature of these measures will depend to a great extent on the strength of the economic cycle.  If growth is better than forecast, less will need to be done at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Public Spending</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Public expenditure can be divided into four parts.  The public sector payroll at €20 billion and welfare spending at €21 billion account for two thirds of all expenditure in the State.  Non-pay programmes cost €15 billion and public investment will amount to €7.3 billion this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Public Sector Payroll</p>
          <p eId="para_220">The Government has decided that a permanent reduction in the cost of the public payroll is an essential element of this plan.  In February 2009, we introduced the public sector pension levy which resulted in an average deduction of 7.5% from the salaries of public servants delivering savings of €1.4 billion this year.  This is a considerable contribution by public servants to the unavoidable economic adjustment.  It is also necessary to control public sector numbers which have grown by 11% in the past five years alone.  A key part of such a policy is the ban on recruitment and promotion, with certain exceptions, announced by me on 27 March last.  Today, I am announcing a scheme whereby, in those areas of the public service where permanent reductions need to be brought about, staff aged 50 or over may retire from the public service without actuarial reduction of pension entitlements they have accrued to date.  Ten per cent of the relevant lump sum will be payable immediately with the balance paid later at the normal retirement age of 60 or 65 without actuarial reduction and subject to current tax law provisions.  This scheme will be open to applications from 1 May and will be subject to local management arrangements to ensure the scheme operates in an orderly manner.  Those leaving under the scheme will not be replaced except in specific cases or circumstances sanctioned by my Department.  The continued availability of the scheme will be reviewed in the budget for next year.  The Government sees no scope for introducing other, more generous early retirement schemes in the present budgetary circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The Commission on Taxation is examining various aspects of pension tax treatment,  including the treatment of lump sums and I expect to be dealing with its recommendations in the 2010 budget next December.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Social Welfare Spending</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Over the past decade, we have been able to provide very significant increases in welfare payments.  For example, the payment of child benefit has increased from less than €44 to €166 per month.  The State contributory pension has gone from €113 to more than €230 per week.  The weekly rate of long-term job seeker's allowance was raised from €93 to €204.  These payments compare very well internationally, particularly with payments in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">It was right that when times were good, we increased payments to those who are vulnerable.  Now that we are in recession, we must look at how we can use the €21 billion welfare budget to afford maximum protection to those in need.  The Government has examined very carefully how we might make savings in welfare.  In the budget last October, we increased payments by around 3%.  Notwithstanding the fall in consumer prices, which we expect to be close to 4% this year, we have decided not to reduce welfare rates in this supplementary budget.  However, it may be necessary to review rates of payments in future years if reductions in the cost of living materialise.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">However, we do need to make some savings in order to absorb the additional expenditure of over €2.8 billion due to the sharp rise in unemployment since December.  For this reason the Government is not in a position to pay the December bonus which it has been able to deliver in previous years.  We are also making limited changes in eligibility to certain benefits.  Specifically, the job seeker's allowance for the under 20s will be halved to €100 a week so as to incentivise the young unemployed to participate in training programmes.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">Payments under the rent supplement scheme will be reduced to reflect the fall in prices in the rental market.  We will also intensify the campaign against welfare fraud by allocating additional staff to the Department and by targeting, in particular, the fraudulent claiming of child benefit and other payments by those who are no longer resident in this country.  We will continue to target the available resources on those most in need.  The Government does not think that it is fair to pay the same level of benefit irrespective of the level of income of the recipient.  For that reason, the Government has decided that child benefit will be means tested or taxed in the budget for next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">The scope for changes in expenditure programmes in mid-year is limited.  Changes over the next three years will be informed by the report of the special group on expenditure and numbers, which is evaluating all programmes.  We need to achieve better results with fewer resources.  One example of how this has been done in this budget is the changes we have introduced to the early child care supplement.  This scheme was introduced to help people with the cost of child care at the height of the boom.  While appropriate to the time, it cost the State €480 million last year.  The programme is now being replaced by a free early child care and education year for pre-school children at an estimated cost of €170 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">Pre-primary education significantly enhances the subsequent educational achievement of students and in turn increases the return for State investment in education.  The free pre-school year will start next January.  The existing rate of early child care supplement will be halved with effect from 1 May and abolished at the end of 2009.  More details are set out in the summary of budget measures.  This is an example of how a programme can be reshaped and made more effective at a lower cost to the taxpayer.  We need to see more such initiatives in the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The other elements of spending reductions are set out in the summary of budget measures.  These reductions affect a broad range of Vote headings in order to spread the burden of adjustment as fairly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Capital Spending</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The Government is determined to maintain high levels of public investment.  However, spending cannot be maintained at the levels envisaged when the economy was in rapid expansion.  We must progress projects that maximise economic and social returns.  The Government has decided to set a total capital allocation at €7.3 billion<b> </b>for 2009, which is greater than 5% of projected GNP.  The Government has also fixed the overall Exchequer capital allocation for public investment for the next four years at €6.6 billion in 2010, €5.5 billion in 2011 and €6 billion in 2012 and 2013.  This represents an average of 4% of projected GNP over the period out to 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Significant reductions in tender prices mean that we will be able to deliver a very large part of the national development plan programme within the envisaged timescale.  The Government has already re-allocated money to more labour-intensive areas and will be putting in place further measures to prioritise the more productive and more labour-intensive elements of capital investment.  Details of the revised capital envelope are set out in the summary of budget measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">There is scope to access significant private funds for infrastructure projects in order to sustain as many construction jobs and as much activity as possible.  Discussions are in train with the pension industry about an initiative that seeks, on a value for money basis, to unlock additional private capital to complement debt financing provided by banks and the capital markets.  This would support existing PPP projects and other projects previously funded by the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">We need to explore all options to fund our infrastructure needs, including the disposal of assets, sale and lease back arrangements, franchising arrangements and the proposal from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, for a national recovery bond.  My officials have been asked to examine these options with the relevant Departments and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The total reduction in gross spending for 2009 comes to €886 million in current spending and €576 million on the capital side.  This is equal to €1.8 billion in a full year.  Further savings of €4.8 billion will be required over the period from 2010 to 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">TAXATION</p>
          <p eId="para_241">We need to broaden our tax base so that everyone makes a contribution.  We will remove unjustified reliefs and we will ensure that capital is taxed in a fair manner.  We will retain our 12.5% corporation tax rate as a key aspect of our inward investment strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">A key structural weakness of the Irish taxation system is the narrow base.  Too many people do not pay tax at all and there are too many ways in which those who have wealth could shelter their income.  Many of these reliefs were abolished in 2006 by my predecessor, the Taoiseach.  Today I will continue this process by reducing those tax expenditures that can have an impact this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I propose to reduce the level of tax relief investors can claim on the interest for mortgages and loans on residential rental properties to 75% of the interest with immediate effect.  I propose to abolish the current 20% rate applied to the trading profits from residential development land and restrict the treatment of trading losses.  The profits will be charged at the relevant marginal rates of income tax or at the 25% rate of corporation tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I will terminate the property-related accelerated capital allowance schemes in the health sector.  This scheme covers private hospitals, registered nursing homes, convalescent homes and associated residential units as well as mental health centres.  Schemes for palliative care units and child care facilities will remain in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The Government has decided that from 1 May, mortgage interest relief for principal private residences should only be available for the first seven tax years of the mortgage.  I believe this move is justified given the significant recent reduction in interest rates and in house prices.  The relief will now be targeted at those who bought their homes when prices were at their peak.  It will also support those who now wish to move, improve or buy for the first time.  As house prices fall, the provision of mortgage interest relief will be kept under review with a view to eventual abolition.  In this regard, I look forward to the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation, which I will receive later this year.  I would like to thank the commission for its work to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">At this stage of the annual tax year it is not possible, for technical reasons, to restrict or abolish further reliefs.  It is the intention of the Government to continue to remove reliefs and shelters from the tax system in successive budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Capital Taxes and Savings</p>
          <p eId="para_248">It is important that we treat all sources of income in a similar manner.  I am increasing the rates of capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, CAT, to 25% with immediate effect.  In light of declining asset values, I am reducing the CAT thresholds by 20%.  The details are contained in the summary of budget measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I am increasing the deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, rate on ordinary deposit accounts to 25% and to 28% on certain other savings products.  The existing 2% levy on non-life insurance premiums will increase to 3% and I am also introducing a new levy of 1% on life assurance policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Income Tax</p>
          <p eId="para_251">In good times, it was possible for us to keep minimum wage earners outside the tax system.  This is no longer sustainable.  With up to 40% of income earners paying no income tax at all, we can no longer meet our fiscal needs.  The challenge is to spread the burden in a fair manner to a wider range of income earners while avoiding economic disincentives.  The scope for income tax changes half way through the income tax year is limited.  To raise the necessary revenues, the Government must use the various levies and charges already established in the tax code.  Accordingly, the Government has decided to double the rates of the income levy and to reduce the entry points for each rate.  The new rates will be 2%, 4% and 6%.  The new entry points will be €15,028, €75,036 and €174,980 per annum, with the weekly equivalents being €289, €1,443 and €3,365 respectively.  Health rates will also double to 4% and 5% and the entry point for the higher rate will be reduced to €1,443 per week which is €75,036 per annum.  Finally, the PRSI ceiling will be raised to €1,443 per week or €75,036 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">These measures will reduce all our living standards.  I am acutely aware of that.  The Government has taken care to ensure they are fair, equitable and highly progressive.  I would point out that, notwithstanding all the increases made today, Ireland will continue to have one of the lowest tax wedges within the OECD.</p>

I indicated previously that I was prepared to review the operation of the public service pension levy to address any issues of fairness.  Taking account of the impact of the tax measures which I have announced, I am proposing a slight recasting of the structure of the levy to reduce somewhat the impact on the lowest paid public servants with a small increase at the higher levels.  The net cost of this is €100 million in 2009.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">Restoring the Credit System</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The global financial crisis has caused extensive and rapid government interventions across the developed world.  Governments have intervened time and again to preserve financial stability and maintain their banking systems.  Here in Ireland, through the bank guarantee, bank recapitalisation and the protection of public ownership, we have provided very substantial support to the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Our sole objective is to ensure that householders can access credit for home loans and consumer credit, that small and medium-sized businesses can fund their enterprises, that deposit holders have confidence their money is secure and protected and that international investors are satisfied about the stability of our banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">A key pillar in our economic renewal is a well regulated financial system.  This is essential for domestic and international confidence and credibility.

          <p eId="para_268">The Government also believes that further radical action is necessary to stabilise the banking system and ensure the supply of credit to the real economy.  Cleansing and repairing the banks' balance sheets is fundamental to achieving a sustained recovery of the banking system and the sustained provision of credit for this economy.  The Government has decided to bring forward measures to address the issue of asset quality in the banking system.  A national asset management agency will be established on a statutory basis, under the aegis of the National Treasury Management Agency.  Assets will be transferred from the banks to the new agency with the purpose of ensuring that banks have a clean bill of health, their balance sheets are strengthened and uncertainty over bad debts is reduced.  This will ensure a sustained flow of credit on a commercial basis to individuals, households and businesses in the economy.  The agency will have a commercial mandate and will have the central objective of maximising over time the income and capital value of the assets entrusted to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">As it is clear that the principal uncertainties about asset quality in the Irish banking system lie in the banks' land and development loans and in the large aggregate associated exposures, these will be transferred to the agency.  These assets pose the main systemic risk to the banking sector in Ireland and the most significant obstacle to the recovery and restoration of lending by credit institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The agency will purchase the assets through the issue to the banks of Government bonds.  This will result in a very significant increase in gross national debt, to be offset of course by the assets taken in.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">No.  The amount paid by the agency will be significantly less than this to reflect the loss in value of the properties.  In the longer term, if the agency were to fall short of recouping all of the costs, the Government intends that a levy should be applied to recoup any shortfall.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">All borrowers will be required to meet their full legal obligations for repayment.  There will be a hardening of the approach to these borrowers.  Taxpayers' money is at stake — not the private interests of banks — and the agency will be expected to protect it in a commercial way and with an independent remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">It is important to note that the State will not assume all of the risk in the acquisition of these assets.  The assets will be valued on a basis which is sustainable for the taxpayer.  This will entail an assumption of losses by the financial institution whose assets are removed.  The State has already capitalised the Bank of Ireland for a 25% stake and is completing due diligence at Allied Irish Banks prior to capitalisation for a similar stake.  If the crystallisation of losses at any bank requires additional capital the State will insist on participation by way of ordinary shares in the relevant institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">This initiative will be developed and implemented within a common EU framework detailed in the European Commission guidance on the treatment of impaired assets, working closely with the European Commission to obtain prior State aid approval.  By drawing on the best advice and experience available internationally, and on the proven expertise and ability of the National Treasury Management Agency, we are committed to ensuring that this very significant measure will be an example of best practice and will meet all of the objectives that the Government has set for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Leaders throughout the world speak of the need to clean out the banking system of exposures and we, on our own initiative, are participating in the international trend, leading it with a distinctive solution which is tailored to our needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">The Government also intends, in line with its previous indication, to put a State guarantee in place for the future issuance of debt securities with a maturity of up to five years.  This access to longer-term funding is in line with the mainstream approach in the EU; is consistent with State aid rules; and will assist the funding needs of the banks and secure their continued stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The Government is determined through these reforms to restore our banking system and the reputation of our regulatory and supervisory structures.  We want to send a strong signal that the types of practices followed in some of our institutions are unacceptable, that the regulatory structures will be strengthened, that decisive action is being taken to repair banks' balance sheets and that Ireland remains committed to the continued development of a soundly based, well-regulated and competently supervised financial services sector.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_285">Our economy must return to being driven by sustainable export-led growth, rather than by domestic demand.  To do so our price and cost structure must fall relative to our trading partners.  Private sector wages need to adjust and are adjusting.  I hear examples every day of companies and employees reducing costs and changing work practices in order to safeguard employment.  It is this flexibility that will restore our competitiveness and provide the basis for future prosperity.  With the introduction of the pension levy, the public sector has also lowered its costs but much more is required in terms of changing work practices and driving efficiencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">One of the main drivers of growth in output and employment in Ireland from the middle of the 1990s was flexibility and adaptability in the labour market.  The willingness of employees to embrace change allowed a rapid re-allocation of skills, expertise and knowledge to expanding economic sectors.  Looking to the future, we must recreate the same commitment to embrace change in the public service no less than in private enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">As Minister for Finance, I must allocate and redeploy staff in the Civil Service to areas of highest priority.  I have already made additional staff available to the Department of Social and Family Affairs to meet the needs of the growing numbers on the live register.  I will use the same powers to redeploy staff to other priority areas in the future.  We must ensure that the redeployment of staff will be done with due consideration to geographical constraints and is consistent and fair in its implementation.  I know that all those employed in the public service share the common goal of delivering excellent services.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">We must also reduce costs in regulated sectors where we can.  The Government expects to see reductions of about 10% in energy costs for electricity and gas consumers by September.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will be seeking ways to lower costs further on an ongoing basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">The Government can help with the process of supporting employment by a redirecting of the NDP to support employment and enterprise.  The broad cost of each thousand people who lose their jobs is now estimated at about €21 million.  In order to support employment, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will set up an enterprise stabilisation fund worth €100 million over two years.  In conjunction with the banking sector this fund will provide direct financial support to eligible, internationally-trading enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Smart Economy</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The Government will also implement measures to support the smart economy through investment and incentives to reach a research and development target of 2.5% of GNP by 2013.  We have already trebled our economy-wide R&amp;D spend in the last decade.   It is now about €2.5 billion of which some two thirds comes from the enterprise sector.   It is not just a matter of saving jobs where we can but of re-orienting the economy to produce the export-led growth we must achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Activation through Training, Education and Work/Employment Experience</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Increased unemployment carries a heavy human cost for individuals and families and threatens the aspirations of all our citizens.  We must support those who have lost their jobs through re-training and further education.  As an initial response, the Government has already introduced a number of measures in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Notwithstanding the pressures on the public finances, I am now announcing a further range of activation measures which will achieve the following: support individual enterprise through enhanced access to the back to work enterprise allowance scheme, which will facilitate some 1,400 additional claims; encourage further education through earlier eligibility for the back to education allowance; facilitate work experience through a new scheme, to include placement of graduates, which will cater for 2,000 people; expand activation opportunities for over 14,000 people; support redundant apprentices to receive additional training in the education sector — for up to 700 people; enable participation in further and higher education for over 6,000 people; and initiate pilot training schemes for workers on a three-day week.  The Tánaiste, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, and the Minister for Education and Science will provide details on the initiatives in their respective areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The overall cost of this wide range of measures will be met through the re-allocation of current resources towards supporting unemployed people.  The full year cost of providing close to 25,000 additional places will be in the order of €128 million.  Within available resources, the Government will continue to pursue the introduction of further training and education services.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">CONFIDENCE AND STIMULUS</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The most effective way to build confidence in this economy is to show that we can restore order to our public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Measures to help Stimulate the Economy</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Notwithstanding the increases today, our tax system remains competitive and pro-enterprise in character.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Last October, I introduced a considerable enhancement to our R&amp;D tax credit regime.  I also mentioned the increased importance globally of intellectual property.  Accordingly, I propose to introduce a scheme of tax relief for the acquisition of intangible assets, including intellectual property as a means of supporting the smart economy.  The details of the scheme will be worked on by my Department, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, and will be published in the legislation giving effect to the budget provisions.  This measure will help to attract high-quality employment to this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">To address the overhang of unsold properties, I am proposing to establish a stamp duty trade-in scheme.  This will enable persons purchasing a new house or apartment to trade in their previous property with the seller who will not be liable to stamp duty until they subsequently sell the traded-in property on at a later stage.  Full details of this initiative will be contained in the forthcoming Finance Bill and the scheme will apply from the date of publication of the Finance Bill to 31 December 2010.  I am also changing the way in which car dealers can account for VAT on second hand cars from July next.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">RESTORING OUR REPUTATION</p>
          <p eId="para_308">As a small open economy, our reputation abroad matters in terms of our ability to attract foreign investment.  Recent banking scandals have sullied our good name and may have prompted some investors to think twice about investing here.  Measures presented in this budget send a strong message around the world that we are determined to restore our reputation.  The actions I outlined earlier to repair banks' balance sheets and the proposed reforms of our regulatory and supervisory regime are aimed at rebuilding confidence in our financial system.  The resolute actions we are taking to reduce the budget deficit and to boost competitiveness by driving down costs, prices and wages are needed to restore the confidence of prospective investors, bankers and lenders.  To reinforce these messages, I plan to visit financial capitals around Europe over the coming weeks along with representatives from the National Treasury Management Agency.  These visits will give me the opportunity to communicate more effectively with foreign investors about our plan for renewal.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">It was only last June when we surprised our EU partners by rejecting the Lisbon treaty.  Looking back, it would appear that economic success had fostered a sense of invincibility.  A lot has changed since then.  Events over the past year have underscored how interdependent the world is and have reminded us that our fortunes are deeply intertwined with those of our European partners.  We are a small trading nation on the edge of Europe, but our best interest is served by remaining at the heart of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">CONCLUSION</p>
          <p eId="para_311">A Cheann Comhairle, I want to acknowledge the serious and constructive documents put forward by the two main Opposition parties in advance of the budget.  Both documents contained some good ideas, some of which we have adopted.  While there are many differences between us, there is also some important common ground.  That in itself sends out a powerful signal to the rest of the world that we can overcome our difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">As the many interest groups prepare, as is their right and duty, to defend their sectional interests in this budget, I ask them to pause for thought.  We are now facing the challenge of this nation's life.  This is a time to set aside those narrow, sectional interests. Yes, we must be fair and I believe we have been fair.  But now is the time for the common good to prevail.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_321">The budget I put before you today is our plan of action for economic renewal.  It will bring order and stability to our public finances.  It will enhance our productive base.  It will protect and support those most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">As if.  The reality in the months since that statement was made is entirely different.  The projected borrowing rate has doubled, 130,000 more people have joined the unemployment list, the unemployment rate will have doubled within 12 months of that statement and the economy is on a perilous edge, with the most vulnerable people at greatest risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">This is a budget in which the people are once again being asked to rescue a failing Government.

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_329">People see in this budget and the history of the past several months that the banks bailed out developers before being themselves bailed out by the Government.  Today, the taxpayer is being asked to bail out the Government once again.  Who is going to bail out the taxpayer given that today's budget will add almost €2 billion to the tax bill that has to be paid by every family, on top of the €2 billion and the huge increases in charges introduced last October?  The net effect for many families is an additional burden of €2,500 as a result of this budget and its immediate predecessor.  Even those on very modest incomes will face huge increases in their tax bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The Minister repeated the claim that we have been hit by a tsunami of pressure from overseas.  I do not think even a handful of Fianna Fáil Members believe this Government pursued sound and sustainable strategies which were swept aside by some unfortunate event that transpired overseas.  Even the Government admits that the bulk of the black hole in our public finances is due to mismanagement by Ministers.  The structural deficit about which it speaks was created over the past seven years by the previous Ministers for Finance who occupied the seat opposite.  We are now paying for that tragedy.  A huge structural deficit of €13.8 billion has been totted up through mismanagement by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance.  That is the problem which we face today.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">This is not merely the result of difficulties overseas.  I recognise that we have been buffeted by unprecedented challenges but those in Government who disregarded their responsibilities and who spent like there was no tomorrow left ordinary people exposed to the risks of a downturn.  They lived on easy street, with money for everything.  The cosy consensus surrounding them allowed no questioning of value for money or what we could afford and no questions were raised about the quangos piled one on top of the other with little accountability.  The largesse of Government was widely distributed but now we see that it will be paid for by ordinary families, by pensioners who were expecting the Christmas bonus and by young unemployed people who will be told they can only get €100 per week.  Those people will carry the brunt of the Government's mistakes.  During those good times, problems were bought off rather than confronted.  There was no willingness to introduce reform but the money merely papered over the cracks.  Our Ministers became the highest paid in the world, as if they were managing a successful economy.  The reality that we now face is very different.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I ask Members to observe how other countries are coping with these difficulties.  No other country in the world is responding to this international crisis by seeking €4 billion in additional taxes in the space of six months or refusing to offer genuine stimulus and support for their small businesses.  We stand alone in thinking that cutting spending and raising taxes are the solution to the problems we face.  It is only the solution because the Government has eroded all the options available to other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">It is deeply depressing that, even at a time of huge crisis, the one issue pushed aside is any effort to introduce reform.  Report after report is published by group after group.  A group is studying taxation but its influence has not been reflected in this budget.  Similarly, the group investigating public spending has had no influence on public service reform in this budget.  If in a crisis a Minister fails to focus on the need for genuine reform, we are lost.  That is the trouble with the way in which this budget was put together.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I am most worried about something that has been slipped in without much debate, namely, the Government's decision on banking.  This is a massive gamble.  We are told the Government will ask the taxpayer to shoulder €90 billion in toxic loans.  Conservatively, that represents an additional 50% on a debt burden which the Minister has admitted is heading towards 70%.  We will be back to the old days of a public debt of 120% if that materialises.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">What has been set out in the document before us in regard to protecting the taxpayer who will have to shoulder these toxic loans?  We have no information on the price which will have to be paid.  These are assets which the market refuses to touch yet we are expecting the taxpayer to purchase them.  No indication is given on whether taxpayers will recover their money if this plan becomes a disastrous mess.  We are vaguely told that the Minister might consider introducing a bank levy.  Where is the contractual agreement that banks shall make up any losses that accrue on these portfolios?  We need to be given firm commitments rather than vague talk that the money will be recovered over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Why are bondholders, who walked into the risks with their eyes open and whose assets are valued in the markets at one tenth of their face value, not making a contribution to addressing the banking problems?  These risk takers helped to pump up the property bubble with which we are now trying to cope.  According to the Minister's proposals, however, they will walk away without compromising their position.  I cannot understand that.  It is not the right way to proceed.  We are mistaken to follow this strategy because if it goes wrong, it could dwarf everything else that has hit us in recent times.  Did the Government put forward a convincing case for what it is doing?  Can we have faith in the oversight that it says will protect the taxpayer, knowing our experience over the past several years of oversight by regulators and the Central Bank?  Have we any basis for an act of faith when many of the people now managing the banks brought us to this deep crisis?  Serious concerns arise about the undertakings the Minister has made in an aside to the budget.  These are more than an aside, however, because they are of massive proportion.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Today's budget admits that 250,000 jobs will be lost by the end of 2010.  Fine Gael believed this budget would be all about employment.  We accept that we have to correct our public finances during a time of crisis but the balance of the measures we would have adopted would be designed to protect employment at every opportunity.  Where, however, do we see such an aim in this budget?</p>
          <p eId="para_338">In the measures proposed over the five years of the Government's plan, 68% of the adjustment will come from higher taxation.  That means higher taxes for businesses and people at work.  The Government took the soft option because it is not willing to address the spending it pumped up over several years.  Since 2005, it increased spending by 35% excluding social welfare.  Where is the commitment to reducing the cost of running the Government?  If we do not reduce the cost, we will have the tragedy of people paying with their jobs.  We have choices.  We are facing a 20% cut in our national income.  People who are secure and protected in their positions can put up the barriers and refuse to make changes.  Who will pay then?  It will be the unemployed.  What we needed to see in this budget was the Government taking a definite course, cutting the cost of running Government, and living within what can be afforded by competitive businesses and people striving to hold their jobs.  That balance has not been struck, however.  The Minister is insisting on correcting this predominantly by tax increases, which is not the remedy.  It is not the route that will protect our job bases.  We need a budget that is designed to protect our employment to the maximum possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Of the taxes that are to be collected in this year's budget 74% will be taxes on work, which will directly hit people who are working.  If one wanted to design a budget to protect people at work, one would shift the balance the other way — a predominance of tax would come from areas that did not penalise those at work.  The Minister has struck the wrong balance, however, even within his tax package, and he has relied on taxes instead of spending.  It is not the correct approach.  We need a Government that is willing to get out from its sheltered environment and join the battle for survival among our companies.  There is a battle for survival to keep viable companies ticking over and get them through this period, but they are not able to get credit and cannot cope.  A measly €50 million is in a so-called enterprise fund, as if that sum could resolve these things.  Other countries are being genuinely imaginative about what needs to be done.  They are bringing in well tailored packages to bring credit to viable businesses that are struggling, they are showing flexibility in the welfare system as employers struggle to cope with pressure on their workforces and they are reducing the burden of taxation by pushing out payment dates.  Our Government, however, thinks it is better that struggling businesses should pay their taxes earlier than they used to.  The whole emphasis in this budget has not been about protecting employment, which is the mindset that should have informed it if it was to be appropriate to the needs involved.  This is too much of a bookkeeper's budget.  The Minister is hauling in tax because it is easy to get, but he is not addressing underlying reforms to alleviate the struggle encountered by people in ordinary businesses who are trying to hang on to their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">It is disappointing that this year we will see €600 million taken off the capital investment programme and double that next year to €1.3 billion.  The following year, nearly double again, €2.4 billion, will be taken out of the investment programme.  That is not laying down the foundation for employment.  I would not have minded if the Government had adopted what we had recommended — a way of getting equity and borrowing into investment in public infrastructure, such as our water services, electricity grid and telecommunications network.  We showed how that could be done in the coming years without costing the Exchequer one red cent, but that proposal was not adopted.  I appeal to the Minister to look afresh at that solid proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I welcome the fact that the Minister is willing to raise money from pension funds for PPPs.  To be brutally honest, however, I thought the Minister would have a lot more work done on that proposal than he has.  It merited just a throwaway sentence, saying that he is examining it and hopes something will come of it.  If he has not been striving on this matter in recent weeks, what has he been doing to create incentives for investment in this country?  It is the core to a strategy that will get us out of this hole, yet it is still very underdeveloped.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I worry about the share out of the burden.  We believed that this budget would be about a fair share out of the burden, yet there is no capping on the huge amounts that well off people can put into their pensions.  A sum of €150,000 with a huge taxpayers' subsidy of nearly 50% can be put by very wealthy people into their pension funds year after year.  What is the justification for that continuing at a time when we are seeking €2,500 in extra taxes from ordinary people?</p>

          <p eId="para_347">There is a lack of focus, too.  I can understand why the Minister is examining child care and mortgages but, as he works on the budget for next year, let us not forget those who are really taking the strain.  The people who are really taking the strain in this society at the moment are those who were lured into paying huge mortgages.  They are now in huge negative equity, have young families and are worried about their jobs.  We cannot pile mortgage relief cuts and child support cuts on the generation who are taking the strain for the mistakes that were made in Government.  We have to be sensitive to the needs of those people as the Minister starts to reform these areas.</p>

The Minister himself said that it was a mistake to raise VAT, yet when it comes to dealing with some of these things there is a deafening silence.  Surely there was an opportunity to look at some areas where taxes could be reduced, as well as areas where they could be increased.  The airport tax is telling visitors that we do not want them to come here, although the tourism industry is on its knees.  The low VAT rate is focused on home holidays and home improvements.  Surely there was an opportunity to give a boost to tourism and other such labour intensive activities.  Surely the Border countries, which are under pressure from the VAT increase, deserved some consideration in this budget at a time when the Government is trying to protect employment.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">I also worry about the Minister's approach to those who have lost their jobs.  We need to think much more outside the box about protecting the unemployed and finding opportunities for them.  I welcome the Minister's back to education scheme, which will be available to people three months earlier than was previously the case, but people will still have to be unemployed for nine months before they can take up a third level course.  That is not appropriate at a time like this.  We need to get people to move quickly and not have a long period of idleness.  Cutting the enterprise support scheme from four years to two does not seem a sensible suggestion at a time when start-up businesses will be working in a very difficult environment.  It seems a short-sighted saving that is not motivated to getting small enterprises going by those who have lost their jobs.  It seems unfair and niggardly in its approach.  It is a slide-rule approach to making savings, instead of a helpful one.  Meanwhile, the ordinary back-to-work scheme has been axed altogether, which is a strange decision at a time when we ought to reach out to those who have lost their jobs in order to offer them opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The underlying problem, which we have always refused to face up to, is the dysfunctional nature of this budget.  The budget's composition is always the same.  There was no advance scrutiny of the options and no efficiency targets or targets of any sort.  It is based entirely on last year's money and whether we will reduce it by 1% or 2%.  There is no root and branch examination of what is being done.  We, in Fine Gael, advocated turning that system on its head.  We argued that budgets in future should not be about the demands of agencies but about the needs of clients and ordinary people, that agencies should be forced to bid for their money and that if they are not performing, managers should be expected to shape up or ship out.  We need that sort of transformation in the way we think of our public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Delivering a public service is a great honour but we have trapped people in the public service in a system that is failing them.  The budgetary system and a soft option approach to politics, one which we saw in decentralisation, are failing them.  We need to release the talent in our public service and reward those people of ambition who want to make change and drive standards.  Our system does not do this.  It tells people that when money is short, one closes hospital beds and wards and turns away patients.  What enterprising and ambitious public servant wants to respond that way?  People who want successful organisations want the opportunity to run more patients through their system, be more efficient and be rewarded for the extra patients they treat.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">We are stuck in the old budgeting system that has trapped talented public servants, whose talent we now need more than ever, in a straitjacket that is not rewarding or encouraging their talent.  That has to change but, again, there is no sign of change in this budget.  There is no talk of a new deal for moving staff to areas of need or of rationalising quangos which remain as numerous as ever.  Work on the programme the Minister offered last year remains as slow as a snail.  We are not seeing a Government that is willing to shape up to the huge need to reduce the cost of running government, run government more efficiently and squeeze out and encourage performance.  That should have been the clarion call underpinning the budget today.  At a time of crisis, this nettle should have been seized.  People will suffer because it was not seized, because it means that as budgets go scarce, we will see the old approach again.  Schemes such as the home help service and nursing home support will be squeezed for want of money as the year ticks on because the reform agenda has not been boldly seized.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The problem we have in this country is that we have a Government which simply would not heed the warning signs.  Time after time, it was told of the dangers that were occurring.  Our competitiveness entered the red zone in 2002 when it started to deteriorate.  The housing market entered the red zone in 2005 when the IMF issued warnings.  The reliance of banks on short-term money entered the red zone in 2005 when we could see them sucking in huge amounts of short-term money not supported by the deposit base.  The public finances started to go into the red zone when Ministers pumped spending before elections and benchmarking was paid without looking for anything in return.  All of those who issued warnings to the Government that the position was not sustainable were cast aside and contemptuously dismissed.  We were told time after time that the property bubble was built on sound economic fundamentals, competitiveness was fine and we did not have to worry about our banks.  How wrong that was and how much Irish people have paid for the refusal of Ministers to heed the warnings that were given.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I saw a film recently with Anthony Hopkins called "The Edge" about a man in the wilderness struggling to survive.  Hopkins's character made the comment that most people who die in the wilderness die of shame.  We have been led into the wilderness by this Government.  There is a creeping sense that it does not know how to fix what it has broken and the risk is that we are seeing a Government that is dying of shame as it tries to face problems and that is not carving out the solutions which will resolve these problems and help the country regain its independence.  Will the Government die of shame and take our economic independence with it?  That is the worry that is on people's minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">It seems this Government believes it will be the first administration in the history of the world to work its way out of a depression and recession by taxing and more taxing.  We stated clearly that the response in this budget had to be built on jobs, jobs and more jobs.  It had to be about how we could protect, create opportunities and make sure the tax changes we made were sympathetic to employment as well as how we could make sure the burden between cutting spending and increasing taxes was on the side of more cuts in spending rather than more tax increases.  Those were the challenges we faced and that was the framework which should have informed the budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_373">This is the budget from hell, particularly for families in the middle income bracket who have two or three children.  I want to summarise, particularly for families who may be listening in, what the Minister is expecting them to pay for the banks and all the other mistakes of 12 years of Fianna Fáil misrule.  The tables at the back of the Budget Statement include one relating to a couple called Lorraine and Colm.  Colm earns €60,000 a year, Lorraine works in the home and the couple has two small children.  Colm and Lorraine are not the bankers who turned up their noses at a cap of €600,000 but a couple earning one tenth of that sum.  The health levy they and their children pay will rise from €1,200 to €2,400, an increase of €1,200 per annum, while their income levy will increase from €600 to €1,200 per annum, an increase of €600.  They will pay an extra €1,800 each year in income and health levies.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">That is not the end of it, however, because this couple is special.  As Colm's and Lorraine's two children are small, they will lose approximately €1,000 each year through the measures announced on the early child care supplement.  Let us suppose they have been married and living together for ten or 15 years.  Having bought an apartment when they first got together, they decided when they got married to trade up to a nicer house with bedrooms for the children, as they were told to do by former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy.  Guess what?  Their mortgage interest relief is gone as well, even if they traded up in the past seven years when the market was going up and up and up, spurred on by Fianna Fáil's reckless stoking of the property market.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">This budget is really the payback budget because Colm and Lorraine and their cousins, sisters and brothers will have to pay back for what Fianna Fáil has done to this economy over 12 years.  They will have to pay back their early childhood supplement.  I remember the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, at the time of the last general election and his supporters in Fianna Fáil who, when former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, announced the early childhood supplement, which was a clear bribe to people to vote for Fianna Fáil, went to the post office in Blanchardstown and stood canvassing the queue.  I do not know if he remembers it.  I remember it because I arrived, saw the Minister and left.  He arrived on the day that there was a queue outside the post office where people were waiting to collect child benefit.  His people worked all the post office queues to make sure that people knew about this supplement.  Will he have a little leaflet for the queues next month to tell them he is taking it away?</p>

          <p eId="para_377">They can tell the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, it was one of the worst designed bribes ever given to young families.  It did absolutely nothing except drive up crèche fees.  He is now adopting a Labour Party proposal, which is that we should have an early child care system.  Fianna Fáil had 12 good years when it threw it all away and spent it on electoral bribes such as those we saw when the Fianna Fáilers were working the queue.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">We are paying again for the banks.  This Government started life this time last year with a fair wind.  The Taoiseach enjoyed his own county's adoration, amazing media support and tremendous goodwill from the whole country.  He had political capital in abundance and threw it all away.  Today the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or Fianna Fáil do not have much capital left to ask the Irish people to endure sacrifice and be as resilient as they always have been in the face of danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Not so long ago there was a shocking foot and mouth scare in Ireland but everybody responded to it.  The whole country united in the common name of Irish men and women to see off a danger that threatened our country's prosperity.  There was no quibble about cost or inconvenience; the job had to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">However, the Government does not have the vital political capital to call the country to unity today and that is why there will be little or no public consent to today's measures.  Of the €3.2 billion this supplementary budget will take out of the economy, some €1 billion will be in tax, of which €754 million is in income tax, mainly from the PAYE sector.  Another €799 million is in levies, PRSI and the health levy, again, mainly from the PAYE sector.  Of that €3.2 billion package, €1.5 billion, or approximately half of it, will be paid in taxes directly from the PAYE sector.  As the Taoiseach well knows, the PAYE sector did not cause the bank crisis or greed that this budget is paying for.  They did not cause it but he is making sure they will pay for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">It reminds me of the First World War generals who called for wave after wave of sacrifice from ordinary families and soldiers, which gave rise to a very famous phrase, "Lions led by donkeys".  This is the perfect description of the plight of the people today.  The hopes of one more generation of young Irish people were dashed today in order to pay for the dismal failures of Government policy for over a decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">For a time the Government could blame the international background.  Now that excuse looks even more threadbare.  Even the Central Bank recognises the roots of our current crisis lie overwhelmingly in domestic policy.  Every aspect of policy was geared towards promoting the property bubble.  It is stated in the budget that 12.5% would have been the deficit.  The Central Bank report last week stated 10% of the deficit was structural and is, therefore, attributable to Fianna Fáil and the property market which collapsed.  The other side of the House fanned the flames of a reckless lending spree for 12 years and now it has the nerve to offer its services as firefighters to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">In terms of the headline figures on GDP, if the economy continues to contract from today's decisions, it will be very difficult to get the percentage deficit right.  The real effect of today's budget, tragically, could be to drive the economy deeper into recession.  It could erode confidence more and could undermine the efforts of business to put some life into the economy.  Every action of the Government has made a bad situation worse.  The increase in VAT last October was folly in the extreme, an act of wild madness and the wrong decision at the wrong time, and I notice the Government has no strategy to reverse it.  Many of today's decisions come from the same stable and are just as suspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Last week, I heard groups of Dublin stockbrokers had come together to give their tuppence worth of advice to the Minister.  Their principal recommendation was to reduce social welfare.  These are people who are always first in the queue to get public contracts and consultancies.  Most of their consultancies cost €1,000 to €2,500 per day.  Did they get their way?  The Minister took away the Christmas bonus, which costs €156 million, from people on social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">I am sure the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, remembers an important lesson from his old school, which is to beware of Greeks bearing gifts.  He should have been wary of stockbrokers bearing recommendations that would reduce income for people who are quite poor and increase poverty in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_387">One lesson which should be learned is that there is a misguided obsession with the budget deficit that can compound the very disease it wishes to control.  Deficits can melt away like the snow when the economic spring comes and this can happen remarkably fast.  The core issue is to combine prudent budgeting with economic stimulus so the actions we take to get the books to balance do not worsen the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Much of what the Labour Party has emphasised in recent weeks refers to job training and job retention.  We endorse the idea of a national bond, as first suggested by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and later by the construction industry.  I was disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, made no more than a passing reference to it because there is an appetite among savers for secure, State-backed investments.  Even yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> mentioned the fact that the German Government is hatching a similar plan to tap into people’s savings and into the capital of pension funds to finance important projects that can sustain jobs and prepare the country for long-term recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">There is also scope, surely, to seek support for such a bond among Irish people in the US and elsewhere, who are our own diaspora.  We have a gap in our funding capacity to build schools and hospitals and this could go some way towards meeting this need.  There must be a stimulus element in today's budget.  It cannot be all cuts and tax increases because that will mean only more job losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The Americans have a phrase, "shovel-ready projects", which they use to describe construction projects that are labour-intensive, such as public transport projects, and that are already well advanced in terms of planning but cannot be funded in the normal way due to the public financial crisis.  The Minister does have access to another possible source of funds for these projects, but he is staying strangely silent about it.  I refer to the €1 billion that is to be paid in fees this year and next year by the six financial institutions that were guaranteed by the State last 29 September.  This is kept in reserve in a special account in the Central Bank.  It is sitting there, and I hope it is not being kept for the next general election campaign.  Why is this money not being made available now for job training initiatives——</p>

          <p eId="para_392">——or school building projects?  I am not a fan of public private partnerships but I recognise that they offer some advantages in securing finance for the capital budget.  Why is the use of this mechanism limited this year to four schools in the Taoiseach's constituency?  We need more outside-the-box ideas to keep the capital programme ticking over.  By this I mean projects that are fully assessed by robust cost-benefit analysis and perhaps sanctioned by the EU for funding outside the headline public deficit constraints.  In other words, they would be off balance sheet for EU purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The Labour Party has suggested the establishment of a national development bank that can focus on the many sensible proposals for the smart economy that allegedly form part of the Government's strategy.  I am afraid I saw little commitment in today's announcements to making progress on that agenda.  Access to broadband and investment in public transport, water supply and low-carbon energy all form part of the agenda, but for these we will need access to capital, which must be sourced in new and imaginative ways.  The Labour Party's proposed development bank could be used for this purpose.  It would be set up on a commercial semi-state basis.  Capital projects it supports would be considered by Brussels to be off balance sheet and thus would not affect the general Government balance, except where the Exchequer transfers funds directly to the bank.  The national development bank could support some €3 billion of capital spending over the 2009 to 2011 period.  The bank could be capitalised in several tranches over a number of years through the National Pensions Reserve Fund on a once-off basis, through private investment in a recovery bond, through providing the credit union sector with a stable investment vehicle, which it is currently looking for, and through borrowing under Government guidance.  I am disappointed that the Minister has shown so little imagination in his statements today.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I said already that the PAYE sector, which is paying more than €1.5 billion in extra income tax and health and PRSI levies, is the main target of this budget.  I have talked about tax justice until I was blue in the face.  A recent case highlighted how easy it is to set up a perfectly legal tax scheme whereby one can avoid a modest 20% tax on a €25 million profit by simply sending one's spouse to Italy for 183 days.  A whole industry has developed among tax accountants and lawyers to facilitate this.  In today's statement there was precious little to show any serious intent to end this outrage.  All the tax exile rules, all the tax shelter schemes, and all the cosy arrangements to allow tax losses to be brought forward indefinitely and even back for a year should end now.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I do not think the word "pension" even crossed the Minister's lips.  We are talking, for example, about the pension pots of €5 million to €20 million accumulated personally by a number of our large bankers and other captains of industry.  When they retire they get a quarter of their funds tax-free.  That equates to a tax saving of €1 million when they exit the funds.  I thought the Minister would seek to cap that.  There will be no consent from taxpayers to the €1.5 billion hit to the PAYE sector when they see that the culture of tax avoidance and evasion continues to flourish.  Tax justice must be done and must be seen to be done.  I told the Minister to write down the words "Tax justice" and put them on his desk, as the former American President Harry Truman did with the words "The buck stops here."  There is a fallacy about that the Revenue Commissioners have changed the culture of tax evasion.  The former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Daly, and the current chairman have done sterling work, but there is more to be done.  The new campaign on offshore trusts shows that there are still mechanisms in place to dodge and weave around the rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The Taoiseach will remember Lord Justice Denning's notorious "appalling vista" remark with reference to the Birmingham Six.  I will give him an appalling vista with regard to the tax-back schemes that will be implemented shortly.  A property company, Company A, has stock consisting of development land and buildings.  In view of the crash, it will have major write-downs in the value of this stock.  The result will be massive losses for tax purposes.  These losses may be carried forward, but they can also be written off against tax already paid currently — that is, in 2007 — which will allow it to claim a refund from the Revenue Commissioners of tax paid recently.  There is more.  The bank that lent the money to Company A to fund the purchase of land will also write down the value of the loans, and this too will give rise to a claim for tax refunds by the bank.  This is a double whammy for the Revenue Commissioners.  It will have tax refund claims from both the company and the bank.  The losses on these refund claims are likely to be quite astronomical.  I have heard suggestions that they could be as much as €1 billion between this year and next year.  This is not fancy speculation.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is bracing itself for major refunds to developers and banks, including the very institutions that have been bailed out by the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">If the Taoiseach engaged an accountancy consultant to examine this he would be charged a handsome fee.  I am giving him this advice free.  I do not think the Government can stand idly by and tolerate this.  It would mean a double whammy for the taxpayer.  The very banks we are helping are fleecing us with bail-out demands and they will shortly be fleecing us on the double with tax refund demands based on write-downs of their dodgy loans.  There will be a sos later.  It is open to the Taoiseach and his colleague the Minister for Finance to write further emergency legislation to close this loophole tonight.  We will vote for it.  This is an offer to the Taoiseach that makes a lot of sense.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">He can close this loophole tonight if he so wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The overhang of the banking crisis affects our nation's international creditworthiness as much as the budget deficit.  Of the adjustment of €3.2 billion announced today by the Minister, I reckon at least €500 million — but possibly up to €1 billion — will be used to meet the higher interest charges that must be paid by Ireland on the money it borrows internationally because of mismanagement by this Government.  PAYE workers are paying €1.5 billion in extra taxes, much of which will go towards the extra interest costs racked up by the Government by its damage done to our reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I read with some astonishment a report by Stephen Collins and two colleagues in last Saturday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> regarding the events of 29 September 2008.  According to this report, the State’s two largest banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, left the overnight negotiations on the guarantee scheme on 30 September believing the Government would nationalise Anglo Irish Bank the following weekend, after the introduction of the scheme.  The Minister has been strangely silent on this report in contrast to the fuse he blew over Professor Morgan Kelly’s very similar proposal some months ago in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Had Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society been nationalised immediately, and Mr. FitzPatrick and Mr. Fingleton shown the door, we would not have endured quite the fallout we are now suffering.  What was it about this pair — Mr. FitzPatrick and Mr. Fingleton, our home-grown Bernie Madoffs — that they were able to persuade a gullible Fianna Fáil, a gullible Central Bank and a gullible regulator that they could resolve the difficulties at their respective institutions?  There has been no explanation or apology in this regard.  We were already in serous trouble because of the situation with our banks, but the introduction of the guarantee scheme was a disaster for the country and for our reputation.  The decisions made on 29 September were flawed and left the country open to a very hostile international reaction.  The Taoiseach told the Irish Management Institute in recent days that the risk exposure from the guarantee was "just" 230% of GDP.  Of all the understatements I have ever heard, this beats Banagher.  We have a situation where "just" 230% of the nation's entire wealth is hanging on the bank guarantee.  The man who made this statement is charged with leading the country at this moment of crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The financial institutions guarantee scheme was followed by the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the allocation of €7 billion for recapitalisation.  Now we have come to the grandest act of all in the saga of banking policy with the introduction of a national asset management agency.  The Minister is drinking in the famous last chance saloon.  He has been very sketchy on the details of how control of debts and toxic assets will be taken from the balance sheets of the banks.  One policy issue is central to this scheme, namely, the question of how to handle the valuation of these debts.  As long as these toxic debts remain on the balance sheets, our economy will be hobbled by these dead banks walking or zombie banks.  These problematic loans must be dealt with in order that ordinary banking and credit flow will resume, thus allowing small, medium and large enterprises, commercial operations and sole traders throughout the State to retain people in employment.  As I said, today's budget will see our citizens taking a severe hit in living standards for years to come, with additional taxes of all types, reductions in public services, decreases in social welfare payments and limitations on entitlements, all for no other purpose than to save these financial institutions from the consequences of their own folly and greed.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The Minister mentioned a figure of €80 billion to €90 billion as the likely level of problematic loans.  However, he does not indicate what will be the write-down of that figure.  Many of these loans are in respect of development lands — the fields outside Dublin city and outside towns throughout the State.  These were fields of gold for which the owners may have paid €20 million, €100 million or €200 million.  However, they are no longer fields of gold but simply fields.  One would be lucky to get a farmer to pay for grazing on some of them, so low will be the demand for construction on them.  What value will be put on these former fields of gold?  If €80 billion to €90 billion of assets are at issue, a 50% write-down would leave taxpayers with a burden of €40 billion to €45 billion to take onto their backs and those of their children and grandchildren.  Why should we pay anything in respect of these loans?  What is wrong with either taking a majority stake or nationalising the institutions in question?</p>
          <p eId="para_405">In annex 1, which provides questions and answers relating to the national asset management agency, NAMA, one of the questions asks whether land and development loans outside of Ireland will be transferred to the NAMA.  The answer suggests that toxic debts held by our banks outside this State will be eligible for transfer to the NAMA.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_409">Yes, land and development loans outside of Ireland will be eligible for transfer to NAMA, subject to consideration of the legal issues involved.  This is essential to ensure that the banks are completely cleansed of their exposure to their identified riskiest loan category.  UK exposure is a significant part of the bank's total land and development portfolios and therefore needs to be included in the transfer of NAMA as part of the overall solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">It is scandalous and outrageous that taxpayers — hard-working PAYE earners — will be burdened with the cost of property speculation in the United Kingdom.  How can the Government stand over this?  Who will be responsible for the valuation of these United Kingdom assets?  In addition, I am aware of the existence of smaller portfolios in the United States, Spain, Dubai and elsewhere.  Is the taxpayer to pick up the tab for property portfolios throughout the world?  From 1 May, Lorraine and Colm, the fictional couple used by the Department for illustrative purposes, will be liable for an additional €100 per month in health levies and an additional €50 per month in other levies in order to pay for the global speculation of some of the greediest people on the planet, those who have also shown themselves to be some of the most stupid people on the planet.  Why should we pay for their greed and stupidity?</p>

We are not just paying for speculation in places such as the fringe around the M50.  We are not just paying for unsold apartment blocks on the banks of the Shannon or in Cork and Kerry.  Rather, we are paying for speculation in London, Dubai, Chicago and New York.  The website of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, details his travels to various locations around the world  to deliver lectures, for a fee, on how he built the Celtic tiger.  Perhaps he is dropping in to these construction developments in foreign lands, the cost of which has been loaded on the backs of another generation of young people, their children and grandchildren.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">Both Deputy Gilmore and I have asked whether the Bacon report will be published in full.  A short report has been published by the European Commission outlining the reasons for the success of the Swedish banking bail-out.  There are six or seven critical reasons the Swedish scheme worked, the first of which is transparency in terms of the amounts involved.  The Minister used the word "tough" in regard to some of these loans.  I imagine some of these tough developers will not know whether to laugh or cry when they read tonight about this arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The Labour Party welcomes, in so far as they go, the proposals to curtail Deputies' and Senators' expenses and, in particular, the suggestion that Deputies who have been Ministers will no longer receive pensions.  The Taoiseach will be aware that Deputy Gilmore and I surrendered our pensions to the Minister for Finance some time ago.  We also proposed that top salaries in Government, Government agencies and Departments be capped at €200,000 for the duration of this financial emergency.  This should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The Taoiseach will have seen the international articles and reports in regard to his salary.  We are a country of under five million people.  I accept the Taoiseach inherited the current situation in terms of remuneration from his predecessor.  However, he is up there with Obama, a leader of a major country, Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy.  If we want the international bond markets to take us seriously we cannot continue to pay people these extraordinary amounts of money.  The L'Oreal advertisement "Because I'm worth it" comes to mind.  We can no longer afford to pay people these extraordinary amounts of money.  The move to address this situation is tepid and disappointing.  The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance could have shown leadership today and provided that, for the duration of this emergency, all top salaries would be capped at approximately €200,000.  I believe most people in receipt of those salaries would be happy to make that sacrifice, which would not leave them on the breadline as will be the young person under 20 years of age whose social welfare allowance has been reduced from €200 to €100.</p>

It was a sweetener introduced by that master politician, former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to ensure that a wide coalition of Independents continued to support him and it worked.

We must establish our credit worthiness as a country.  The Government should not underestimate the Labour Party's commitment and willingness to implement sound public finances and to meet agreed targets on time.  However, this must be done in a planned way that avoids panic measures, thus worsening the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Today's package involves €3.5 billion to €4 billion.  The suggestion is that it involves €3.2 billion before the bank guarantee, which has not been costed, is taken into account.  Last week, the Bank of Ireland received a cheque for €3.5 billion from the Irish State.  It is amazing that the Minister for Finance gave €3.5 billion to the Bank of Ireland, the biggest cheque in the history of the Irish State, and that there exists no photograph of the Minister handing over that cheque.  No photograph of the Minister holding up the cheque was provided for publication by all the newspapers and carried on the RTE news.  We all know there are some Ministers who, it appears, have chequebooks in the back of their cars and who, when they turn up at community events, write cheques for up to €50,000 which are subsequently held up and photographed.  There is no recorded photograph for posterity of that €3.5 billion cheque.</p>

          <p eId="para_429">In a few weeks, Allied Irish Banks will also receive a cheque for €3.5 billion.  Will that cheque be photographed?  I suggest we obtain a photograph of it for posterity.  It is quite possible other financial institutions will want the same sum and that they may get it because they are guaranteed, which is one of the worst measures ever introduced by Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The Bank of Ireland has received €3.5 billion and Allied Irish Banks will shortly receive €3.5 billion.  The taxpayer did not today get €3.5 billion, it gave €3.2 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">This is the crazy economics of Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I want to return to the comparison I set out at the beginning of my contribution in regard to the First World War.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the Siegfried Sassoon poem of a cheery general meeting two soldiers on their way to battle who states: "But he did for them both by his plan of attack."  General Lenihan has well and truly done for us all by his plan of attack today.  Anyone can slash and burn.  One does not need courage or wisdom to do so.  One can of course save money by making men and women redundant.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I was desperately disappointed that SR Technics, in terms of a plan to save high level jobs at that plant, did not merit mention by the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_436">We are saving landbanks in Dubai and London but are not able to save the cream of technological skill at Dublin Airport.  Half of the 1,100 to 1,200 men employed at SR Technics received their notice last Friday.  Members may have heard read out on the "Today with Pat Kenny" programme a sad letter from the wife of one of those workers.  She spoke of her husband retching over his breakfast as he faced his last day at work after 30 years service.  I am disappointed this issue did not merit mention by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">A true leader is one who pauses to say capital invested in job training and earn and learn schemes can pay dividends quickly and use welfare money more efficiently.  I do not mind so much the proposed reduction from €200 to €100 in social welfare payment for young people because I do not believe a person under 20 years of age should be on the dole.  I do not believe that is the place for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">They are not many places they can go.  Jonathan Swift in <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i> said a long time ago to people with the slash and burn mindset: “... whoever could make ... or two blades of grass, to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind ... than the whole race of politicians put together.”  This is where this budget has failed.  There are no two blades of grass.  There is no growth in SR Technics.  I do not see anything much for Limerick or for Waterford Crystal.  When the Government was on its high horse — when its hubris and its arrogance were evident — it could not bring itself to make a basic credit guarantee arrangement for Waterford Crystal.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">It wanted to hang tough.  The Government did not do anything at the time, which was before the bank crisis.  The amount that would have been involved in the Waterford Crystal guarantee was approximately €40 million.  An iconic Irish industry has pretty much gone down the tubes.  The people of Waterford are happy that it will be restarted in a small way with a tourism facility.  They understand that something is better than nothing.  The banks that are being looked after today will get between €80 billion and €90 billion.  There is a poverty of ideas about how to maintain the real jobs, in companies like SR Technics, Dell and Waterford Crystal, which keep families at work.  People will be hurting tomorrow as a result of today's budget, which was supposed to turn this economy around, reform the system and bring fairness to it.  Tax exiles and those with pension pots worth €20 million will sleep easy tonight because they will not be affected by this budget.  At the same time, many ordinary families will be counting the large cost of this budget to them.  The pain caused by this budget, which the Government has deemed necessary to bail out the banks, will last for a long time.  Shame on the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">There is no justice in the budget.  Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have cynically targeted workers who survive on a little over €41 a day.  They have targeted young families who are struggling to meet their child care costs and pay their mortgages.  They have targeted teenagers who receive jobseeker's allowance.  The removal of the December bonus that is given to those in long-term receipt of social welfare will force vulnerable families into the hands of moneylenders.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">The Government should have removed the PRSI ceiling, thereby eliminating the need to bring those on the minimum wage into the tax net.  It should have introduced a 48% tax rate for those earning more than €100,000 a year, ensured that all discretionary tax reliefs are claimed at the standard rate, done more with regard to capital gains tax and capped pension fund contributions.  Such measures would have ensured fairness and helped the public finances.  Some 372,800 people in this State are unemployed.  The retraining measures that have been announced today would not help all of those who lost their jobs in January and February, never mind the hundreds of thousands of other people who are unemployed at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The Government is taking €200 million from the environment budget, principally in respect of social housing and water infrastructure.  It is cutting €54 million from the school building programme at a time when it should be doing the opposite.  It should frontload such projects.  Educational centres need to be built if we are to have the workforce that will be needed in the knowledge economy of the future.  Some €13 million is being taken from sustainable energy and energy research programmes.  A further €300 million is being cut from the public transport fund.  This has been a slash and burn budget, by any measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">If the Government is serious about addressing the unemployment crisis and improving competitiveness, it should do the opposite of what it has announced today.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to the smart economy and the need for competitiveness, but this budget will make it harder for businesses to engage in research and development and innovation, which are supposed to be key elements of the Government's strategy.  The Government has walked away from enterprise.  It has given the banks a "get out of jail" clause, after years of reckless property lending, and saddled the taxpayer with a €90 billion debt.  It has again nationalised debt but privatised profit.  Those watching and listening to this debate are desperate for real political leadership and a positive change in direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Sinn Féin has set out proposals aimed at saving and creating jobs and progressive tax and spending measures.  There is a fairer and better way, but the Government has decided not to take it.  Instead, it is pursuing a policy of regressive taxation, unfair spending cuts and countless job losses.  The Minister's attempt to cite the rejection of the Lisbon treaty as one of the causes of our economic difficulties was deceitful.  The seeds of economic decline were sown by the Minister's colleagues long before the electorate rightly rejected what was a bad deal for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">People have waited in fear and hope of what this day might mean for them.  Workers in companies like Waterford Crystal, Dell and SR Technics have lost their jobs.  Small businesses across the land have been forced to let thousands of workers go.  Such people have waited to see whether this budget would do anything for them.  They hoped it would contain a stimulus package for the economy, involving the creation of new jobs that would allow them to apply their many skills.  They will be disappointed with this budget, particularly its lack of support for job protection and creation measures.  Those working in companies that are in receivership and industries that are under threat have waited to see whether measures would be introduced to save their jobs, keep them in employment and protect them from the lengthening dole queues.  They will be disappointed when they learn that regressive flat taxes, such as the income levy, have been increased.  Families have been struggling to cope since the last emergency budget, which involved the introduction of levies on wages.  In that budget, children were targeted through education cuts and elderly people were targeted through medical card withdrawals.  As families have waited, they have worried about what the Government will hit them with next.  They have wondered how much more they will be expected to sacrifice to clean up a mess that was not of their making.  They will be disappointed when they learn about spending cuts and flat tax increases.  All of these groups, and many more, have waited impatiently.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">At the start of last year, it was apparent to everyone that the economy was facing serious contraction.  While the Government was late in coming to the table, it saw fit to implement some budgetary measures in the form of savings last May.  By the time of the Budget Statement in early October 2008, the Government had walked us into a recession.  I accept that there were significant international events in the global economy, including the fall of iconic institutions like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.  It was revealed that certain people at the head of Ireland's financial institutions, including the Brothers Grimm, Mr. Fingleton and Mr. Fitzpatrick, had behaved in a scandalous manner that, some would argue, put this country's economic survival at risk.  The criminal behaviour of those charged with managing our financial institutions, which almost brought the country to its knees, required the taxpayer to provide an underwriting of €440 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The terms and conditions put in place by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party when they gave the bank guarantee were so weak that they allowed Irish Nationwide to offer Mr. Fingleton a €1 million bonus.  The terms and conditions were so short-sighted that the State had to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank, which was the right idea but in the wrong bank.  They were so ineffective that the State is now recapitalising the banks to the tune of €7 billion, which is the right idea but in the wrong banks.  We should keep that €7 billion figure in our heads when we talk about this budget.  Would we have needed income levies, excise increases and cuts in various sectors, particularly education, if that €7 billion was still on the State's balance sheet?  The Minister spoke today about allocating additional funds to monitor social welfare fraud, but what about dealing with bank fraud?  The "get out of jail" clause that has been given to the banks after years of reckless lending will saddle the taxpayer with a toxic debt of €90 billion.  More public money will be spent on toxic debts as long as the likes of Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Fingleton get off scot free.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Sinn Féin has consistently called for measures that benefit the public rather than the bankers.  We need to nationalise the good parts of the banks, ensure that credit is made available to our small and medium-sized enterprises and reduce mortgage repayments for struggling families.  The Government cannot maintain its policy of protecting bond holders.  It cannot continue to nationalise debt while privatising profit.  Its short-sighted policy was evident when, after bringing last autumn's budget forward by six weeks, the Government did not see fit to implement the sweeping measures that were needed to help the economy to enter into 2009 in a fit state.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The Government can make all the claims it wants about the global downturn having its effect on the Irish economy, but the global downturn is not responsible for the Government's failure to do enough in October, which led to savage emergency measures being taken in January to save €2 billion on the year's budget and now this emergency budget — another exercise in short-sighted accountancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">People cannot suffer much more under this Government.  We desperately need leadership and a positive change of direction.  By leadership, I mean taking responsible measures that are motivated by a social conscience, that are fair and just as well as effective, and that are taken in the national interest.  We need a very different approach.  We need something other than Ministers preaching to us that we all caused this mess and we all must fix it, and something other than the plethora of economists who called it wrong every step of the way and are now back on the airwaves revising their forecasts from last year and telling us, cold-heartedly, the savage steps they believe the Government must take to bridge the deficit.  The Government is, of course, foolishly listening to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">We also need something very different from that offered by Fine Gael, the party that last week managed to blow economic orthodoxy out the window by launching a jobs creation paper that called for 15,000 redundancies.  We accept that the public service requires a root and branch audit to identify any inefficiencies but public servants took more than their fair share of the pain with January's pensions levy — a pay cut by any other name.  The public service has become the whipping boy of right-wing economists for several years.  To take an axe to 15,000 public service jobs is not the way to deal with this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">We have enough people losing their jobs in this country.  To give people hope, we must show them we have the answers.  As unemployment figures have soared — simultaneously destabilising tax receipts and increasing the social welfare budget — the human toll of the job losses has been horrific.  In all of the speeches here we have been addressing statistics but these are real people.  They are our neighbours, these are families in their own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">While this country grapples with the apparent truth that this Government's jobs strategy is emigration, individual workers in factories, shops, building sites, and offices across the State are being brought in by management to be told their jobs are gone.  Some are being dealt a double whammy.  They are being informed that their pension funds, many of which would have been contributed to for 40 years, are also gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">That this has been allowed to happen systematically for almost two years is shameful.  It is shameful that the Government did not see the need to put job retention measures in place.  It is shameful that it did not think to bring about a jobs creation strategy sooner.  It is shameful that these people have been forced to watch as this Government spends billions saving the banks, but will not lift a finger to save their jobs.  It is a disgrace that the people who lost their jobs over the past couple of years bore witness to the news that the head of the State jobs agency, tasked with training them to start their new lives, was allowed resign amid a myriad of financial corruption allegations.  He should have been sacked.  I cannot remember the last time anyone was sacked by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The cronyism and corruption that pervades this State's political elite has never been more despised or unforgivable than it is now.  There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> about Fianna Fáil telling us to tighten our belts — we all remember former Taoiseach Charles Haughey telling us to tighten our belts while he was swilling champagne on a luxury yacht and ordering from France yet more Charvet shirts each of which cost the average industrial wage at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">All is not lost, however.  Despite this Government's best efforts, we still have an opportunity to save people's jobs now, and to create more to replace those that are being lost.  As dejected and distressed as people in this State are, they have not lost their fight.  We are the same people who have battled through countless centuries of oppression and poverty.  We are the same people who were able to go out into the world, help build it and send home every spare penny to help family and country.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">In March of this year, Sinn Féin launched its job retention and creation strategy paper, which contained almost 80 proposals to save existing jobs and develop new ones.  It is unfortunate that the Government did not at least read the document and take some of those proposals on board.  Putting Irish people back to work is the essential first step to resolving this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Within our document on jobs, my party has set out a range of measures to keep people in employment.  These include establishing a €300 million jobs retention fund to subsidise workers in viable SMEs which are struggling in the current crisis, the setting up of a task force to actively pre-empt job losses by going into companies where jobs are in jeopardy to troubleshoot and offer advice, ensuring small businesses can access credit by establishing a proper State bank that would have this as one of its main aims, reduce the costs of doing business by examining stealth taxes and further reducing utility bills, guaranteeing access to high-speed low-cost broadband and boosting the agri-food sector by introducing an improved country-of-origin labelling system and helping producers reach economies of scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Our logic in putting forward these proposals is that it is far less costly to keep people in work than it is to allow them to languish on the dole — both financially and socially.  Nobody disagrees with us on this — so why are these measures not being taken?  It also makes sense from an emergency public finance position.  So far, the tax receipt losses have been most noticeable in the property taxes and VAT, due to the State's unbalanced reliance on these indirect taxes.  As job losses have increased, we have seen income tax start to take a hit.  That will only increase if something is not done now to stabilise jobs numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Recognising that not every job can be saved, Sinn Féin has also produced a range of proposals to create new jobs.  These include frontloading labour-intensive national development plan projects and increasing the number of school-building projects to provide both jobs and centres of learning for our much needed educated workforce of the future.  The Government has done the opposite.  The decision to cut capital allowance this year to save money will only damage further the potential for both employment in this State and the State's ability to turn itself around.  We need more investment in infrastructure, not less.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">We have also called for the creation of one-stop-shop enterprise points to be set up, for the establishment of Eolas Glas Éireann, a new green technology body, and for the creation of a sales Ireland strategy to help Irish firms access export markets outside the United States and Britain and to help Irish firms looking to set up manufacturing businesses with the potential to compete with our largest imports, including research and development funding.  It is not lost on our exporters — it appears to be lost on the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, who launched the export report, Catching the Wave, last year — that currently, almost 90% of exports from this State come from foreign-owned multinationals.  In addition to that startling figure, foreign-owned firms import over 86% of the materials they use, bypassing Irish firms.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">These are just a couple of our 80 proposals aimed at stimulating employment.  Alongside these innovative ideas, we spelt out the need to stimulate consumer spending.  I spoke against the 0.5% increase in VAT in the October budget and I and all of my colleagues voted against it.  I met with groups such as ISME and various chambers of commerce over the preceding months and I could see from quarterly figures that VAT returns were falling.  I also met with many traders from both sides of the Border.  It seemed entirely counterproductive to me, at a time when consumer spending was crying out for stimulation, that the Government would make it more expensive to shop.  The Government's VAT strategy is a complete failure and one that was avoidable.  We need to harmonise VAT across the whole island, not to mention work for an all-island currency.  Work on this needs to begin immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The total cost to implement our jobs package over a full year comes to just over €2 billion.  Most of the measures are cost neutral, they just require a change in direction of Government policy.  They need the Government to accept that we are not a strong performing export market, that we have a trade deficit that is strangling us, and that we are far too dependent on the multinational manufacturing sector.  If we are going to attract FDI to this State, we should be targeting their headquarters, and offering their research and development sections partnerships with Irish universities.  We must be more than mere outposts from which they can pull out at will and send those jobs to cut-cost economies.  Some €2 billion is not much to pay if it means saving and creating jobs, and ultimately, stabilising the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">That brings me to the issue of tax and expenditure.  In the run up to this emergency budget, we stated the only way to secure the economic future of the State was to retain existing jobs and to create new ones, reduce the trade deficit and stabilise and better regulate the financial sector.  We also said the public finances had to be stabilised so as not to further harm our borrowing capacity.  We stated this could, and should, be done through fair, progressive measures that would not, as has been the traditional method of this and Fine Gael-led Governments, target those who could least afford it.  We called for a line to be drawn between increasing revenue intake and not taking so much out of the economy to contract it into a depression.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">In the financial aspect of our pre-budget submission last week, we set out measures that would have raised and saved €3 billion in the current year and €5 billion in a full year.  These included fair measures such as standardising all discretionary tax reliefs, which would save the State approximately €1 billion a year; levying the existing and remaining property tax reliefs, which would return between €200 million and €300 million on average a year; introducing a new third rate of tax for high earners; and increasing the health levy on high earners and PRSI by 1% while abolishing the ceiling to ensure the social insurance fund can continue to meet its obligations for unemployment, maternity and pension payments.  We laid out savings in the public sector, but none that would affect front line services.  Our savings targeted areas such as the private health care sector, which has been financing itself on the back of the public health care budget and people's fear because public services are run so badly by this Government and the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">In bringing forward proposals to bridge the gap in the current budget deficit, Sinn Féin sought to protect those on low to middle incomes and those in receipt of social welfare.  We could go over old ground all night about how the Government did nothing over the past ten years to broaden the tax base or to make it more fair and progressive and how the Government oversaw the shift from an export-led economy to a bubble economy dependent on property and consumption taxes.  In its simplest terms, the Government believed four walls and a roof, and the furniture bought for that house, constituted the solid foundations for an economy, which is ludicrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">However, the fact is that we need to deal with where the country is right now.  The dramatic contraction in the economy is nothing less than a national emergency.  There is much we can do in the long term to fix the public finances and my party has advocated a complete overhaul of the taxation system to include a sophisticated system of multiple bands and rates for both income and business tax, an end to tax reliefs except when they are for society's benefit, an end to tax shelters and loopholes and putting a stop to wastage and duplication in public expenditure.  In the immediate term, measures can be taken, and I listed some earlier.  My party believes our approaches are sensible.  We are not using the recession to push an agenda that will ultimately serve only the few.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">For example, we are completely against selling off, for short-term gain, profitable State companies or companies that could be made to turn a profit again.  This policy, articulated by some in the House, is ideologically partisan, economically naïve and, ultimately, counterproductive for the future of the State and its economy.  I refer to the case of SR Technics, formerly FLS Aerospace and Team Aer Lingus, which emerged from the mechanical and engineering section of a public sector company, Aer Lingus.  This is a classic example of where the privatisation agenda takes us and how it leaves workers on the dole.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">We have also been adamant that those earning the minimum wage must be kept out of the tax net and that those on social welfare cannot be targeted.  With the abolition of the Christmas bonus for those subsisting on social welfare, it appears that Fianna Fáil and the Green Party disagree that nobody earning €204 a week should be asked to carry the can for the mess that the Government, bankers, developers and the business elite have conspired to create.  Unfortunately, the Government has chosen, once again, to take a series of measures that are neither fair nor just and that will not be effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The income levy is not progressive.  A levy of 2% on somebody earning €15,000 a year is more disproportionate than levying 2% on someone earning €70,000 a year.  The Government's line about not being able to change tax rates and bands in the middle of a tax year is dubious and does not explain why the tax system was not changed last October when the levy was introduced.  It is also very convenient that the Government claims it cannot tackle the multi-billion euro tax relief scheme in the middle of the tax year.  There was nothing to stop it ending these unfair reliefs last October.  Bringing people into the tax net is outrageous.  Nobody earning €350 a week can carry the can in this budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The cuts to social welfare are vicious.  The early child care supplement is paid in recognition of the fact that the State does not provide universal early child care, as is provided in most other progressive European states.  Even if the proposed child care scheme comes on stream in January next year, how are parents supposed to pay for child care this year following this payment cut?  Perhaps the Government's unemployment strategy ties in well with the slashing and eventual abolition of this payment.  Means testing or taxing child benefit next year is also punitive.  The Minister should target the tax rates of parents, not their children.  The reduction in rent allowance is a disgrace.  The housing market has changed but not to the extent that rents have collapsed.  The measure to reduce jobseeker's allowance for the under 20s is an attack on young people, who are the most vulnerable in seeking a job in this economy now.  It is an emigration tax, as it will force them to leave the country and travel elsewhere where the economic crisis will probably be as bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Those on the right argue that, in a public finance crisis, the last place a government should look to raise money is the tax system.  They argue cuts are the only way to solve an economic crisis.  It is easy for these Washington School students to advocate spending cuts, which invariably comprise cuts to services on which the better off never have to rely.  If one is rich enough, one does not need a public health service or education system nor does one need social welfare payments.  What differentiates Sinn Féin from those on the right is that we believe all these important services such as health, education and social welfare are rights.  That is what one pays one's taxes for.  One does not pay them so the top rank of civil servants can earn upwards of €150,000 per year.  One does not pay them so the heads of State bodies can take first class trips to Florida and stay in five star hotels.  One pays them for the Government to give them back to their developer friends through billions of euro in tax reliefs.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Sinn Féin's priority at this time is to get Ireland back to work and to build the knowledge-based economy that we so often talk about.  The conscious decision by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party to make cuts to education spending and to increase class sizes is detrimental to both of these crucial goals.  Deputy Paul Gogarty talks a good talk when it comes to these education cuts.  I call on him to show his hand now.  Will he stand over this targeting of the most vulnerable in our society or will he actually stand up for what he says he believes in and walk away from this Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Likewise, cuts to health have been affecting the delivery of health and personal social services since the autumn of 2007.  The "national emergency" the Minister for Health and Children declared in 2006 because of the numbers of patients waiting for many hours, and in some cases, days, on trolleys and chairs in accident and emergency units has been forgotten not because the situation is better but because the so-called emergency is now the norm, despite the Minister's much vaunted but ineffective plan of action.  While she ploughs on with her precious and ideologically driven co-location of private for-profit hospitals, the provision of life saving units are being denied.  It appears an issue has to be aired on the Joe Duffy show for a week before it is sorted by the HSE.  How Deputy Harney can hold her head up is a mystery to me and how Government backbenchers can stand behind her is something they will have to explain to the electorate at the next election.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The recession is being used as an excuse to make cuts to the public health service but no real action is being taken to tackle the waste in the health service such as the use of brand drugs instead of generic drugs, the co-location plan and the subsidising of the private sector through the private beds in public hospitals.  The list goes on.  Everyone else is expected to take a pay cut but the consultants' contract is untouchable.  In the meantime, we face the non-renewal of contracts for up to 1,400 so-called temporary workers in the health services.  Under the guise of reorganisation, the Minister and the HSE are slashing services in our small hospitals across the State, worsening the overcrowding in large hospitals such as Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick and the big Dublin hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Health and education are just two areas where the cuts have hit the most vulnerable the hardest but there are many more.  A government that can bail out the banks to the tune of €7 billion, but cannot protect its most vulnerable in their time of need is not a government that anyone in their right mind would want to be in power.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Today's budget will not restore our international reputation.  Our reputation internationally has been damaged by this Government's failure to manage the economy and regulate the financial sector, and by its over-reliance on construction and shambolic handling of the public finances.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, spoke today as if his party had not been in government for more than a decade, as if he and his colleagues were not responsible for the crisis which the country faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The Government has made several attempts to fix the State's finances.  Each time it has fallen short and this was its last attempt.  This budget is not even a first tiny step in the right direction.  I doubt anyone is convinced that Fine Gael could do a better job.  If the past is anything to go by, not to mention its policy documents of the past few weeks, Fine Gael's solution will be as punitive as it is negative, cuts and privatisation will not sort out this economy.  Fine Gael believes it will be elected to govern next time around because of Fianna Fáil.  I believe, however, that people are starting to look for something different.  The old two-party system is teetering on the edge of history and an alternative is starting to emerge.  My party leader made a call at our Ard Fheis to the parties of the left to form an alliance of the left.  I ask my colleagues on this side of the House to consider this again.  No party that claims to be of the left should prop up a right wing government.  I call on the Labour Party today to go back to its roots and to abandon its policy of abolishing tax reliefs for trade union membership.  If ever there was a time when people need to be members of unions, it is now.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">People want change.  They want a new model of development for the economy, not one that relies on the boom and bust method, which economists can sit back and comment on, but with which real people must live.  Nobody in the two main parties believes in shared pain for everyone.  They will protect the well off and target the less well off, as has been seen here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">We can go forward in this State, we can turn this economy around but we cannot do it by clinging to the politics of the past.  It is time for real change.  This budget has been far more depressing than even I had expected with cuts in education and all public services at a time when injecting funds into labour intensive projects was needed to stimulate the economy rather than this slash and burn approach.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_66">Financial Resolution No. 1 sets out the new rates and bands which will apply from 1 May next.  For the period from 1 January to 30 April 2009 the income levy is payable on all income up to a ceiling of €100,100 at a rate of 1% with a rate of 2% applying on the range €100,101 to €250,120, and 3% on the balance.  With effect from 1 May 2009 the rates will double to2%, 4% and 6%.  Coupled with this, the entry point to the middle 4% rate will be €75,036, or €1,443 per week, while the new, higher 6% rate will cover income in excess of €175,084 or €3,365 per week.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">The resolution reduces the exemption limit for persons aged under 65 years from €18,304 to €15,028.  In recognition of the fact that some persons may have already availed of some element of the higher exemption limit of €18,304 in respect of payments of emoluments for the period to 30 April 2009, specific provision is made whereby such use of the exemption for that period will not give rise to an underpayment of the levy.  For legal reasons it is necessary for the levy to be charged on an annual basis and, accordingly, a composite rate of the levy applicable for 2009 is set out in the resolution.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">A number of technical amendments are provided for in the legislation and these copper-fasten existing Revenue practice regarding the income levy.  The amendment of the levy will assist in coping with the current severe budgetary constraints facing the country.  The Government is satisfied in the circumstances that there is preparedness to make a sacrifice to ensure we can maintain a sound budgetary policy, which is an essential element of Government strategy for delivering adequate social services and Government programmes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">After the application of these measures for a single worker on the average wage, Ireland is still likely to have the lowest tax wedge in the European Union and one of the lowest tax wedges in the entire OECD.  Married couples with children on average earnings will continue to face the lowest tax wedge in the OECD.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">The second resolution relates to mortgage interest relief.  The tax relief is currently available for interest paid on qualifying loans relating to an individual's principal private residence subject to certain limits.  The relief is granted at source by the lender under what is known as the tax relief at source or TRS system.  The measure provided for in this financial resolution will curtail mortgage interest relief such that it will only be available for the first seven tax years from the date on which a mortgage is taken out.  This means that any taxpayer who has received mortgage interest relief for more than seven tax years on an existing qualifying loan will no longer be eligible for such relief from 1 May 2009.  It is important to stress that there is no change in tax treatment of interest paid on qualifying loans by first-time buyers because, by definition, they are in year 1 to year 7 of their first mortgage.  In addition, they benefit at the rate of relief announced in the last budget, that is, 25% for years 1 and 2, 22.5% for years 3, 4 and 5 and 20% for years 6 and 7.  However, tax relief will no longer be available for the eight year and subsequent years.  For non-first-time buyers, the relief will continue to be available only up to the limit of seven tax years on each qualifying loan.  This covers both existing qualifying loans and any new qualifying loans taken out from now on.  The rate at which relief will be available is the 15% rate announced in the last budget.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">The new rules for mortgage interest relief will continue to provide significant support for first-time buyers and others who will now take out a new loan to purchase a new home, move home or take out a loan for the repair, development or improvement of their current home.  These mortgage holders will no longer be entitled to mortgage interest relief as a result of this measure and will be granted relief on apro rata basis for the first four months of 2009 as follows: for a single person, interest paid in the first four months of this tax year will qualify for relief at 15%, but if the interest paid in that period exceeds €1,000, then the relief is confined to €1,000 at 15%; and for a married couple, interest paid in the first four months of this tax year qualifies for relief at 15%, but if the interest paid in that period exceeds €2,000, then the relief is confined to €2,000 at 15%.  In addition, where such an individual carries out a new qualifying loan between 1 May this year and 31 December this year, only a proportionate amount of the annual relief limit will be available in 2009.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">It is appreciated that this measure represents a curtailment of the existing relief but I believe that this can be justified given the significant reduction in interest rates and in house prices in recent times.  However, the measure continues to protect first-time buyers and others who bought their homes when house prices were very high.  Furthermore, the earlier mortgage interest relief will continue to provide significant support for the purchase of new homes and repair and improvement of existing homes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">As was indicated earlier today, this relief is not set in stone and it is intended to keep it under review.  The relief is very costly to the Exchequer.  The abolition of the relief for all new mortgages or loans that are taken out after some date in the future cannot be ruled out.  However, in that event those who are already claiming the relief at that time can be reassured that they will still qualify for tax relief for the duration of the seven year period relating to existing qualifying loans.</summary>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_525">We will be opposing both these resolutions.  Prior to the announcement of the budget, the Government gave the impression that it would be a fair one, would spread the pain across all income groups and that it would not be extremely unfair to families.  Financial Resolution No. 1 proposes a doubling of the income levy for people on a moderate income.  People earning below the minimum wage will now have to pay the income levy at a rate of 2%.  A married couple in receipt of one income of, say, €50,000 a year, will pay a €1,000 extra a year in terms of this income levy.  It is a punitive measure and lacking in innovation.  It is a book-keeping exercise.  It does not take into account people who are suffering and under pressure in terms of the cost this imposes on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Many couples and single people have mortgages.  It is proposed that all mortgage interest relief will be eliminated after the first seven years of the mortgage.  These people would have bought their houses in 2002 at prohibitive prices as the building boom was getting under way.  One of the reasons they bought them was that they qualified for mortgage interest relief.  The Government is now pulling the rug from under these people and, effectively, abolishing any form of mortgage interest relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">These two measures are outrageous in any person's language.  If the Government had hit the very high income earners with the imposition of very high rates, they would have been the people who could have afforded such a hit.  Under the income levy proposal, the Government is hitting a couple on an annual income of, say, €50,000 with a levy of €1,000 per annum and this measure will now cost them an extra €500 per annum.  A couple in receipt of an income of €40,000 per annum, will be hit with an income levy of an extra €400 per annum.  We will be voting against this resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">This budget hits middle income earners suffering financial difficulty.  It also hits the lower paid across a range of measures.  A person on the minimum wage will now have to pay the income levy.  People will also suffer the loss of mortgage interest relief at a time when they are struggling to make their repayments, even those interest rates are decreasing.  We will oppose both these financial resolutions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_529">The first point I wish to make is that these measures are likely to have a major deflationary impact.  We have to seriously consider in light of the current state of economic activity the implications of that.  In the October budget there was an increase of the equivalent of 1.5% of GDP.  In February 1% was taken out and now 2% will be taken out over nine months.  In other words, the effective total GDP effect will be approximately 5%.  International literature indicates that 2% is a heavy hit.  In any western economy one cares to consider, 2% is a heavy hit.  This is a hit of the order of 5% taken over the year.  That is enormous in an economy projected to contract by 8%.  When the Minister for Finance went to take out €1.8 billion in taxes, that was more than most sane economists recommended.  I sincerely hope we are not around to pay the price for it as the year goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">In addition to that, these resolutions are opposed from these benches for the reasons that they pull back the threshold further.  It is not only that the levy is being doubled, it is that the resolutions pull back the thresholds further.  As a result, they are more punitive on lower paid people and the overall impact is more severe.  Add that to the implications of the increase in the PRSI threshold and effectively for most workers the new PRSI threshold means that most of them will be caught in that spiral as well.  The reduction in the thresholds at which the levies apply, the doubling of the levies, the increase in the PRSI threshold and the doubling of the health levy added together will have a huge impact on people in the PAYE sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">There might be some relief in the criticism of the Government if, in fact, it had addressed some of the categories that traditionally had not been paying their fair share.  For example, there is a minimum shaving with regard to the reliefs available to landlords.  From memory, the estimated take is approximately €90 million as compared to a possible €800 million, so it is tokenism.  The Government does not acknowledge the existence of tax exiles, and perhaps there is a certain symmetry in this, seeing that they do not exist in terms of contributing to the cost of running the services in this State.  Out of sight, out of mind, they are not referred to or included at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">If one looks at the effect of the measures today and add them to the effect of the October budget, one sees that extraordinary costs are being imposed on average workers.  Somebody on the national wage, say, £15,500, will pay €1,154 per annum.  Somebody on €30,000 will pay €1,680.  Somebody on €40,000, the modest end of the middle income spectrum, will pay €2,600, or €50 a week more.  Somebody on €75,000 will pay just short of €5,000 — €4,842 or €93 per week.  These are very savage cuts.  Those who wrung their hands and called for more savage measures on the taxation front have got them today.  The balance has erred in terms of the amount taken out of the economy in further tax increases.  It must inevitably have a further deflationary effect on an economy facing a steep downward trajectory.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The proposal from the Labour Party for a new rate of income tax of 48% for those on incomes of €100,000 and above would be a much fairer way to have addressed it.  In making reference to the minimal gesture regarding landlord relief, I notice that, of course, commercial property is entirely excluded.  Overall it means that those who are caught in the net are going to be squeezed until the pips squeak while the situation regarding those who are outside the net is for another day — in effect, they must wait for the report of the Commission on Taxation.  We are one commission or committee away from facing it now.  While we all seem to be agreed in this House that what is required is the broadening of the tax base, like St. Augustine it is a case of, "Not now, Lord", not yet.  We tip the forelock towards broadening the tax base, but we inflict the optimum of punishment on that core segment of taxpayers already caught.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">As soon as people have an opportunity to reflect on today's figures, they will be in disbelief at what they find, taken together with what they paid following the budget in October, what public servants paid in the pension levy, the 1% levy, now to become 2% and then 4% and with the threshold being brought down.  This is a very serious development.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">These are the more serious aspects of the resolutions before us.  People may hold views with regard to the excise duties or whatever, but these considerations are relatively minor in the context of those before us.  There are macroeconomic implications of the take here, which totals almost 5% of GDP in the fiscal year for an economy that is contracting at the rate that ours is.  That is a very serious situation, it goes too far and I ask the Taoiseach to acknowledge that.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_536">The statement by the Minister for Finance to the effect that the Government has taken care "to ensure that the measures are equitable and highly progressive" is incorrect.  Based on an initial analysis of the figures, today's budget will create a larger demographic sector of the working poor.  When the income levies and health levy are factored in as well as the fact that most people working in the private sector have had to endure pay cuts across the board, the real income they will be left with will be so marginal that it will not enable them to have an adequate standard of living.  We all appreciate that measures had to be taken.  However, they should have been taken on the basis that they would not be regressive.  There is now a large demographic cohort of ordinary working families who will be devastated financially by the proposals within this document.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">With regard to income tax, we were always told that the canons of taxation dictated it should be progressive.  I do not see anything in the budget that ensures high net worth individuals will pay a proportionate amount of their incomes towards getting us out of the mess we are in.  I do not see why the Minister for Finance could not have introduced a higher tax rate at this time so as to cushion the blow against middle and low income earners.  It is completely regressive and when people wake up to the fact of what this document contains, it will make them even more angry at the Government than they already are.  That is why I will not support this resolution.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">I have two problems with this resolution.  The first is that the levy is too high on low income earners.  The second is that it is too low on high income earners.  That to me completely lacks fairness and reasonableness.  I had understood that fairness was to be one of the cornerstones of what we are talking about here.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I am concerned that we are going to abandon people on low incomes to moneylenders.  They simply will not be able to sustain this level of taxation at those levels of incomes, that is, below the minimum wage.  The very least I should have expected was an exemption on the threshold of €18,304, as with the income levy.  The proposals we made in the past week would have offered an alternative source of income.  We proposed additional income and savings worth €3 billion during the current year or €5 billion in a full year.  Our proposals would have protected those on the minimum wage from the impact of this economic crisis.  This budget has further implications with which I will deal in the context of the relevant Financial Resolutions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_270">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_540">I wish to comment on the income levy and whether it is fair and equitable.  A number of issues come together in this regard, including the doubling of the levy across all ranges of income and the change in the thresholds so that taxpayers who formerly paid 1% are now paying 4% once they earn more than €75,000.  Add to these the health levy and the new arrangements for PRSI whereby the ceiling has increased from €50,000 to €75,000, and those who earn between €75,000 and €100,000 will suffer a heavy blow.  Budgets present difficulties where separate measures impact on one group of taxpayers in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The Taoiseach has been haunted by the spectre of individualisation, which was introduced by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy.  Under this budget, a family with one income of approximately €80,000 will be hit harder than a family on two incomes coming to the same amount because of the residual impact of individualisation.  The tables provided by the Department of Finance do not provide comparative figures in this regard but I estimate the difference as being in the region of €2,500.  It makes no sense under the principles of equity that two partners who each earn €40,000 should pay so much less than a family which is reliant on a single income of €80,000.  One might ask why the non-earning spouse does not get a job but that option is no longer available.  A family in which one spouse has been made redundant may therefore be hammered to the extent of paying €2,500 more than a dual income couple.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">A married couple with no children on a single income will lose €1,500 on €50,000 or €3,092 at €75,000 excluding the health levy or PRSI.  However, a married couple on one income with two children would lose €2,500 on €50,000 or just over €4,000 at €80,000.  How is it equitable that a couple with two children should pay €1,000 more than a couple with no children?</p>
          <p eId="para_543">This problem arose on foot of several separate decisions impacting on a specific income range.  The new threshold of €75,000 for the 4% levy had a particular impact.  This is not equitable by any standard.  I cannot see how it can be argued that a dual income couple should pay considerably less than a single income couple on the same income.  I acknowledge this is a consequence of individualisation but the issue was raised previously.  I suggest this is an ideological issue given that it could be argued that mothers who decide to work in the home should not be penalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I do not know how the quirk has arisen in respect of increased taxes for couples with children but I presume it pertains to variations in the way payments are made to children through the social welfare code.  It is an extremely serious issue, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">On the general issue of affordability, it is reasonable to assume that the more one earns, the more one should pay.  However, I believe a level should be set below which people should not pay anything because they are hit so often they simply cannot live on their incomes.  It is not equitable to take a couple of hundred euro from people who are on the breadline.  I do not believe the exemption limits are low enough and suggest that the appropriate level is approximately €25,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I am aware the Taoiseach went to inordinate lengths to proof the budget politically but the past nine months saw correction measures in July, a budget in October and the pension levy in January.  To take one example, a school principal earning €80,000 paid a 1% levy last October, a 9% gross public service pension levy and now the original 1% levy is raised to 4%.  This will have a devastating impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">If there was a purpose to this devastation one might agree to it but the budget fails to set out an overarching plan that might inspire confidence in the Government either at home or abroad.  The Minister did very well in the first three pages of his statement and I concurred with the six principles he set out as the basis for the budget.  He had a shot at correcting the fiscal problems and he has announced his intention to do something about the banks in the coming weeks.  However, he did nothing to address the principles of competitiveness and jobs and little in regard to equity.  I cannot recall the sixth principle because it passed me by.  If these principles had been followed through, the budget would have presented a coherent plan to deal with our problems between now and 2013.  That is what the country needed, but given the way it is positioned now I do not think it will stand up to analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">This is a confusing budget to deal with from an Opposition viewpoint because at times the Minister's speech referred to savings in 2009, while at other times it referred to savings between 2009 and 2010, or between 2009 and 2011.  Therefore it was very hard to compare like with like and to distinguish between the one-year effect or how it would play out over the Government plan that has been mapped out.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">I appreciate the Government's difficulty and I do not want to score political points.  The magnitude of the figures the Government is dealing with has not been appreciated publicly in the media.  The Minister claimed today that he was taking out €3.75 billion in nine months.  The 12-month effect of that is around €5 billion.  One must also allow for negative buoyancy.  The money one takes on an income levy is not available to be spent in the shops, so there is a reduction in excise and VAT.  When the finance advisers were factoring that in, the gross take for 12 months must be somewhere between €6.5 billion and €7 billion, which is serious money.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">It must be agreed that this is the biggest fiscal correction ever attempted by an Irish Government since the foundation of the State, both in real and percentage terms.  I do not underestimate the difficulty of the task before the Government because while it is presented as a take of €3.25 billion, one must hit a lot higher and harder in gross terms over 12 months.  However, the Taoiseach should have set that out from the outset, saying this is our difficulty, this is what we are trying to do, this is the magnitude of the problem and this is the extent of the hit over 12 months.  In my estimation, the Taoiseach's job today — apart from the detail — was to establish his own credibility, so that people would say, "It was dreadful but at least we think they might be able to deal with the problem".  If people said "Yes" to that at home and abroad then there would be confidence again for people to start doing things in this economy, and there would be confidence abroad to lend to Ireland.  I do not believe he has measured up to it, although I hope he has done so because we all live in the same country and none of us wants to go down the tubes in some collective political paroxysm.  I hope the budget measures are received positively internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">What was said about the banks was badly presented and it has frightened people.  Once the Minister wrote €80 billion to €90 billion of impaired assets into his script, that became the figure for which taxpayers would be exposed in the vox pop.  We know that is not the figure, however.  Those of us who have examined the background literature — there is not much of it — know that this will be heavily discounted.  As soon as one puts €80 billion or €90 billion out as a figure there is a big problem.  Even if it is discounted by 50% there is still a very big problem in terms of the Irish taxpayer underpinning impaired debts in the banking system to the tune of €45 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Many of the Taoiseach's Deputies and Ministers will be knocking on doors in connection with the local elections, as we will ourselves.  I know he will get cross when I say this, and it is probably unfair to him, but there is a public perception that he is so closely allied to the developer classes in the country that he will bail them out through a banking system, and that the purpose of his bank rescue is to bail out his developer friends.  I do not share that view, but I am telling the Taoiseach that he has a problem in convincing the public that is not the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">My view is simple.  The Government should have taken up Deputy Richard Bruton's proposal to do what they have proposed in Germany, which is to divide the existing banks into bad and good banks.  It could be worked out that way so that bond-holders, shareholders and those who cannot get credit lines would share the pain.  That is my view, which is simple enough.  It was explained in detail in Deputy Bruton's paper, so we are not hiding our views.  We have been more forthcoming in our views than any previous Opposition and we have set them out before the House.  This is a red-letter day.  I knew the Taoiseach would not like that comment but as soon as he goes home and knocks on the doors he will find out.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_555">Now that comment has finally emerged I had better deal with it.  The purpose of trying to sort out our banking system is to secure jobs.  If one talks to any business person in this country today about what is the biggest problem for Irish business, they will say it is about getting access to credit.  It is about keeping jobs going, finding cash to pay debtors, having the ability to fulfil orders and pay employees.  Many employees are prepared to make sacrifices to keep as many of their colleagues as possible in work during these difficult times, rather than going for a simple redundancy route.  Therefore it is about jobs, it is not about looking after anybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Everyone in this House should accept that, for whatever length of time we are here, we are serving the public interest to the greatest possible extent.  If we cannot accord each other that basic axiomatic fact then no wonder we have the distortions the Deputy is talking about.  People are making those sorts of arguments for no purpose other than to continue on with that sort of discourse, even given the seriousness of the problems we face.  In every country people know that as a result of the biggest financial crisis seen in the developed world in 70 years, governments are grappling with the issue of how to capitalise banks properly, how to ensure credit is available, and how to ensure there is a functioning banking system in a modern market economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">With regard to our own domestic experience, we also know that if the present situation were to continue without any policy direction or decision to deal with it, the problem itself would feed and exacerbate the difficulty of getting access to businesses.  Let us be clear therefore that it is about jobs.  When people ask what we are going to do about jobs, and at the same time go down this <i>cul de sac</i> of ascribing to the Government some malign motive in taking what is a hugely important strategic decision, it serves no purpose other than precisely the one mentioned by the Deputy — perhaps some semblance of electoral advantage in that people will listen to that as being the true motivation for what we are trying to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">I do not mind people disagreeing with me or the Government on policy options or positions we bring forward.  There was no support in all circumstances in this House for the State guarantee or recapitalisation, but they were necessary measures to effect some semblance of stability in a financial system that was in genuine distress in this country.  That is indisputable.  People can have whatever views they like after that, but those facts do not go away.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">We are trying to ensure that banks in this country get back to their core franchise of looking after businesses that need credit, people who need mortgages, and depositors who can have a sense of security in their deposits in future.  Families need to be able to get on with their business, using the credit system to effect the quality of life they enjoy.  That is what it is about, and nothing else.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Let us have a debate on the merits of the budget.  People can have different models and different views, which is fine.  I do not mind that but we should not allow an issue that is so important for the economic future of this country to be brought down that cynical <i>cul de sac</i>.  I am sure there are some people who may hold that view no matter what the evidence and will never change their minds on such things.  There is nothing I can do about that either, but it should not be allowed to dominate this important debate.  In respect of that issue, we are simply setting out in this budget the general policy direction we need to take, with a lot of detailed work to be completed in terms of legislative changes that are required and a whole range of issues that have been raised in a preliminary way this evening in the House.  We can have those debates and that discussion but it is wrong to portray or characterise the motivation of Government as anything other than trying to protect the interests of the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The taxpayers and workers of this country are not best served by continuing to suggest that the present situation should continue regardless, or that there is a way of getting around this problem other than by dealing with the issue, that is, by acknowledging the impairment of assets and loss of value.  On the Deputy's point, reference to book value is not to suggest for one moment that this will be the valuation of assets which will come across to the assets management agency.</p>

We will take this step by step and in a transparent and open way and we will have our debates.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">Deputy Noonan raised this issue in the proper context and I acknowledge what he had to say.  Let us have a debate on the issue rather than on side issues.  While one cannot ask anyone to avoid the opportunity for political attack, as this debate begins — it will continue in the coming weeks and months — I want to say clearly and openly that the motivation behind this initiative by Government is to protect jobs in this country and protect the ability of businesses, ordinary families and mortgage holders, those who do their business in banks, to secure access to credit to get on with doing business.  That is what this is about.  Whatever their business is with the banking system, whether it is a family or a commercial or private business, there is no other motivation or issue of concern.  There is nothing else.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">There will not be any question of anything going off the rails.  As regards what would be the reaction of international markets, as the Deputy knows there has been much misinformation about the level and exposure of Ireland inc., let alone the banking system in relation to these matters, including in places where one would expect people to know a bit better.  For example, in relation to the covered institutions a suggestion was made that the whole IFSC was covered.  This then entered the equation on the total exposure and someone mentioned an absurd figure of 800% or 900% of GNP.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Deputy Burton referred to a remark I made at a speech last week about the exposure notionally being 230%.  I made that remark in the context of the previous figure of 900% which was clearly absurd.  The 230% figure on total exposure is also absurd because it suggests that every loan in every bank under the covered institutions is a bad debt.  This is not in any way to suggest that these decisions are not important matters which have to be taken into the balance.  It is for the purposes of accuracy and having an informed debate because unless we have the basic facts, it is very hard for anyone to get to the point.  The whole purpose of this debate is to make sure we bring clarity, not to foment confusion.  In other debates on referenda and other issues, we often give out about people who foment confusion.  We are not too bad at trying a bit of that ourselves and some people cannot allow an opportunity to do so pass.  We live in a democracy and we all have our own way of walking, as they say.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">I return to the issue of the amount of money being taken out of the economy and the effect of the two measures under debate on hard-pressed low and medium income families.  I concur with previous speakers who noted that these measures will cause a great deal of hardship and remove a large amount of money from local economies.  People will not have any money to spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">My constituency colleague, Deputy Noonan, referred to how various types of families are affected by the measures.  I propose to focus on the family highlighted in example 6 in the Budget Statement, which refers to a married couple with two children on an income of €30,000 per annum.  The family in question will lose €1,900 or 5.8% of their income and more than that again if they have a mortgage for seven years or more.  A family on €30,000 per annum simply cannot afford to lose €36 per week.  I have cited the example of just one family.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">All but one of the Deputies from my constituency are in the Chamber.  In recent months, I have referred many families in circumstances similar to those I described to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and various other agencies.  Following the measures announced in the budget, I am certain many more such families will be unable to survive.  My concern with regard to these two measures is that the Government was not sufficiently conscious of their effect on families such as the one I described.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Clearly, there are broader issues involved and the Taoiseach addressed a general issue on the budget.  These two measures will, however, hit families very hard, particularly those on low incomes.  In addition to the large number of jobless people who will not have money to spend in local shops, families in the circumstances I have described will not have any surplus money and will probably not be able to pay their bills.  I do not believe the Government has thought through how these measures will affect such families.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_588">It is regrettable that the budget does nothing to stimulate the economy.  There is no support for small and medium size enterprises, many of which are going to the wall on a daily basis.  I listened to Deputy Noonan make a point in relation to a reduction in excise duties and VAT but the real reduction we are witnessing is the continued haemorrhage of jobs among those directly employed in the retail and services sector.  This does not make news because the job losses are not 100, 200 or 300 in single employment entities but a constant, continual loss of employment opportunities as retail and service sector businesses close every day before our eyes.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">While there is a loss in excise and VAT in terms of people's ability to spend, that is a further by-product of these budgetary measures.  This is compounded by the fact that we are losing the contributions of those people in those employments and one has a further drain on an ever contracting Exchequer position, as these individuals are entitled to jobseeker's allowance and other supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">One has to take on board that there is an aggregate impact.  All of the issues arising from these financial resolutions, be it the change to the income levy and health levy, the increase in the PRSI ceiling or the corresponding reduction in the entitlement to mortgage interest relief under the income tax provision in Financial Resolution No. 2, severely impact on their own.  Taken together, they will unquestionably have a devastating impact on a significant swathe of individuals and families in this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I do not have to go to the examples cited in the appendices circulated with the Supplementary Budget Statement.  One only has to instance families, particularly those in the public service sector who are already crippled by the pension levy, the doubling of the income levy, the doubling of the health levy and no entitlement to mortgage interest relief after seven years.  Many of those families have young people in third level education.  The situation is very grave.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The Minister has done away with the potential to have any spending power and the opportunity to play any part in the rejuvenation of an ever deteriorating economy.  This will lead to a further loss of jobs and a lengthening of the dole queue.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">I will not speak for as long as the Taoiseach who, I am afraid, is not listening.  These measures, in the absence of real initiatives to address the need to stabilise employment and create new employment, will add to our problem.  This budget is very negative.</p>

          <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
          <p eId="para_594">I am very concerned about the reduction in mortgage interest relief.  Property debt is a significant problem and the Government is turning its back on it by reducing interest relief.  It was already reduced in the last budget.  A typical couple might have seven or eight years paid off their mortgage and, more than likely, will have a couple of children because the mortgage gets dealt with in the early years.  They could be down by up to €900 a year.  Their health levy will be doubled, PRSI has increased and they have the income levy as well.  It is a significant hit on such a family who, more than likely, have a couple of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The Government should not try to argue this is being done because interest rates have come down.  If one got a mortgage seven years ago the interest rate was much lower than it was last year.  It is wrong.  People made a decision based on that policy.  Property debt is a major problem in this country and this change is fundamentally wrong.  It is an added pressure on people who cannot afford it and who are more than likely those with young families.  It is a big mistake and I want the Government to look at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The Minister, Deputy Lenihan spoke about the banks and referred to €80 to €90 billion in loans.  I want clarity on that.  In his speech the Minister said, "the principal uncertainties in relation to asset quality in the Irish banking system lie in the banks' land and development loans".  We have consistently been told by the regulator in committee meetings that those loans are approximately €40 billion.  Yet, the figure in the budget is €80 to €90 billion.  That alone needs clarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I accept all sides of the House want this matter to be addressed in some way.  There are various ideas and the Taoiseach is willing to listen to them.  Regarding making money available to local businesses, if moving these assets away from the banks frees up that money we need to make fast decisions and have a quick debate on it because the next six to eight months are serious for small businesses.  After that, it is probably too late and many small businesses will have folded.  We need to move on it because we cannot wait until next year for the banks to free up that money.  It has to happen now.</p>

          <p eId="para_599">I got to my feet to speak because the Taoiseach adopted a position on the very high moral ground in his response to what I regard as a very friendly remark from Deputy Noonan who gave him a piece of friendly advice.  The quote "Methinks the lady does protest too much" and cocks crowing three times come to mind very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Does the Taoiseach seriously expect the House or the country to believe that there is not a very close association between Fianna Fáil and the building industry?  There is.  The main funders for Fianna Fáil for a long period of time were building contractors and developers.  That is a reality.  The people who now owe money to the banks are the same people who used to be the funders of the party.  That is why there is a suspicion among the wider public.  I fully accept the Taoiseach's words in this House but there is a suspicion that there is a relationship between the actions the Government is taking and the fact that the people who bankrolled it are now in serious trouble.  That is the reality in the real world.  I accept the Taoiseach's word that is not what he is doing today and has no relationship to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Deputy Noonan said it is very necessary for the Taoiseach to explain in detail, as Deputy Burton said, to the country and the House exactly what is happening and what is being done with the banks.  The Taoiseach said somebody else would do it next week but I think he should do it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_603">I wish to emphasise the point made by Deputy Noonan, in terms of the impact of what is proposed in the budget on single income families.  The debate we had on tax individualisation a number of years ago when the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy introduced it and the debate which has developed since then comes back onto the table here.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">If one looks at the annexes provided in the Supplementary Budget Statement, it can be seen that a family with two children and a single income of approximately €75,000 is losing more than €4,000 of its income.  A double income family with exactly the same income loses just over €2,000.  There are many families who are changing from having two incomes to one income at the moment because of the number of people who are losing their jobs.  We are widening the gap between the unfairness of treatment in the taxation system between single income and double income families on exactly the same household income.  I appeal to Government to look at that issue.  I do not want to get involved in the other debate, which is more political.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I wish to raise another, more general issue which is linked to this.  If one looks at table 7 in the budget, which contains budgetary projections from 2009 to 2013, one can see net current expenditure, as well as gross current expenditure increasing dramatically over that period.  I cannot understand that rationale.  Clearly, the major problem for the State regarding the current deficit is because we have allowed current expenditure to increase on the back of an unsustainable income that has now collapsed, in terms of taxation revenue.  Yet, we are continuing to pursue a net current expenditure programme which increases from €46 billion this year to €54 billion in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">In doing that we are requiring revenue to chase and overtake it to try and close the deficit problem.  I cannot understand the rationale behind allowing current expenditure to dramatically increase over a five year period at a time when we are trying to close the deficit.  The result of that will be increased pressure on the Government to raise more and more revenue through more and more taxation which will have knock-on impacts on everything from competitiveness to jobs, spending, confidence and all the other things.  I ask the Taoiseach to try to help us understand the rationale behind current expenditure projections in the context of the major challenge we face to close the deficit and raise extra tax revenue.</p>

          <p eId="para_607">A few years ago there was a headline in one of the daily newspapers which said, "It's payback time".  I never knew what that meant at the time but I know now because this is definitely payback time.  The Government has turned on the entire population and has issued a pummelling to it that has never been witnessed since the foundation of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">It is not one single measure that is causing the problem.  This is not personal; the Taoiseach is a decent and affable fellow and I have no doubt he does not want to do this.  The series of hits that the public will have to take would be bad enough if taken one at a time, but taken all together they can only have one effect, namely, to damage the economy further.  Any prospect of economic recovery is gone out the window.  Nobody will want to spend money because nobody will have any money to spend.  The Government will have taken it from them; it will have stuck its hands in their pockets and walked away with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I cannot see how this can improve the competitiveness of the economy.  How will this create jobs?  It will do nothing except assist the Government in paying the bills it ran up of its own accord over the last eight or nine years by buying two elections.  Two elections were bought and paid for, but the public will now have to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">I am amazed the Taoiseach has not gone to the country with this.  It deserves to be put to the people.  The public do not approve of this kind of nonsense.  If they had known about this two years ago they would not have voted for the Government, but they did.  If they got an opportunity now they would not vote for them.  The only reaction I can have to the proposals I have heard today is one of shock.  In my time in this House I have never seen such a concerted and concentrated attack on the public.  The result of this is likely to be more negative than anything we have seen so far.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_299">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_611">I thank Deputies for their contributions.  There has been a suggestion that the changes to the income levy are not progressive.  The levy is progressive.  Those with higher incomes pay the most and the burden on lower earners is much less.  Around 30% of income earners — 670,000 people — remain exempt from the levy, as do medical card holders above the ceiling.  That the principle of fairness was central to the Government's decisions is demonstrated by the fact that the top 1% of income earners — in other words, those with incomes greater than €175,000 — contribute 24% of the total income levy yield and those earning more than €50,000 contribute 70% of the total levy yield.  The entry point to the income levy is still €750 higher than the entry point to the tax net in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I accept that these are impositions on people in various income bands.  There is no question about that and it is not being disputed.  However, from a wider perspective, the fact that one third of our tax base is gone means there is a structural issue that we must address.  The progressiveness of the levy is demonstrated by the fact that people on €20,000 to €25,000 are going back to 2007 levels of taxation, while those on €50,000 are going back to 2005 levels of taxation and those on more than €100,000 are going back to 2002 or 2003 levels.  There is a table in the documentation, showing average tax rates on annual earnings in percentage terms, which confirms this.  People on €30,000 were paying an average of 12.9% of their earnings in tax in 2008.  As a result of this supplementary budget this will increase to 16.9%, which equates to a 4% increase year-on-year.  The average level in 2005 was 16%, and this was reduced to 12-13% over the following three years.  Thus, there is a step back to a previous period, but that is what is required to make the correction.  Given the constraints of a supplementary budget, the levy was the most effective way of doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">We will also consider what we can do in terms of tax rates in the future based on the findings of the Commission on Taxation.  These will not dictate what happens, but it will give us an opportunity to have a systemic overview of our options for broadening the tax base.  How can we achieve new sources of income?  How can we ensure we remain pro-enterprise and pro-employment?  As I said, the tax wedges still remain among the lowest in the OECD.  In redesigning our tax system for the future — given the return to growth we expect, which will not be back to the levels seen in earlier years — we must have some increase in income tax contribution.  In good times we see, rightly, continuing reductions in income tax, which means that more income is available for discretionary spending.  However, as part of the redesign of our tax system, average tax rates must increase to those of three or four years ago for those on €50,000, while those on €25,000 return to the tax rates of two years ago and those on €100,000 return to rates last seen much longer ago.  That illustrates the progressive nature of the income levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">If we consider the levy itself we will see that the impact for people on low incomes of around €20,000 will be 1.1%, while the impact for people on more than €100,000 will be 8%.  There is no question but that it is progressive.  Second, it does not apply only to PAYE workers but also to those who are self-employed.  It is calculated on the basis of their gross income, before any deductions, without allowing people to reduce their imputable income for taxation purposes.  This has the effect of ensuring progressivity.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned that a family on an income of €30,000 would lose €1,900 per year.  The table I have before me shows a reduction of €1,380 for such a family, although I am not saying that is insignificant.</p>

          <p eId="para_617">Yes, but if one of the children is between the ages of three years and three months and four and a half, the family will receive the benefit of the pre-primary school year, which is worth much more than the yearly early child care supplement per child — in fact, it is double the amount.  This amounts to a more targeted approach which will ensure the benefits of pre-school education go directly from the system to eligible children.  In the past, when child care costs were high and unemployment was low, people had to pay very high rates for crèche facilities and so on.  The early child care supplement was the simplest method then, but this is a far more targeted approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, for coming forward with a proposal such as this which will cost less for the taxpayer but afford a benefit for pre-school children that is greater than that obtained from the direct payment.  That is the sort of lateral thinking we need to see if we are to effect the savings necessary to achieve a budgetary policy that is sustainable while ensuring we do not cut services.  In this regard we are developing a service which was not there previously.  This area was dealt with by direct payment to families for the purported purpose of providing child care, but since it was paid to families directly it could be used for other purposes depending on the family's circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Deputy Ó Caoláin stated that he opposed the levy, but also made the point that we do not spend enough on services.  The problem is that the Deputy does not have a sustainable budget strategy.  He wants us to collect less tax, spend more and create jobs.  That is his position.</p>

          <p eId="para_632">Deputy Rabbitte made a point about the deflationary impact of the measure.  Clearly, taking money out of the economy has an adverse impact in some respects, but unless we bring some type of order to the public finances, the drift in the deficit means our position is not sustainable.  We have had to be careful to emerge with a deficit of 10.75%, taking into account the deterioration in the public finances since the beginning of the year.  The mix we have brought forward in terms of tax take and expenditure, without unnecessarily decimating services, is the best way in which we could begin to address this process over a period of years.  As people's tax take has increased as a result of these levies and their disposable income has correspondingly decreased, we are beginning to see costs coming down.  By reducing costs, we are improving the relative position of those being asked to pay more tax in the present circumstances.  It is a point that can and should be made in terms of assessing the ultimate relative position of taxpayers in regard to the measures we have introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The introduction of these measures comes against a background of reduced tax take from workers in all income groups as a matter of policy during good times, which is the correct approach to take during periods of growth.  Now that we are in recession and in a situation where the economy is quite fragile, we do not have the option of simply stepping back and making no decisions in regard to taxation and spending in this financial year.  That would be an irresponsible approach which would allow the deficit to increase and would sap the confidence of the international community in terms of the determination of the Government to address the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">As I said, we have faced a difficult situation in recent months.  However, on every occasion, even without the full support of the House, we have brought forward initiatives which have helped to bolster international confidence in the preparedness of the Government to take whatever decisions are necessary.  We all agree that unless there is restoration of order to the public finances, the prospect of economic recovery lengthens further and further.  As we saw in the late 1980s, corrective measures can have an adverse effect on an already difficult economic situation.  However, this does not take away from reality that we must take the necessary steps, even in these difficult circumstances.  Not to so do would weaken the economy to an even greater extent in terms of our ability to fund the widening chasm between taxation and expenditure that has arisen.  There seems to be agreement in the House that the structural problem is of the order of 8% to 8.3%.  We can at least have a rational debate about what should be the proper response to eliminate that structural deficit over the period of the plan.  We all hope the recessionary cycle will go into a growth phrase over the course of 2007-13 and provide buoyancy in regard to the cyclical aspect of the deficit.</p>

To clarify, in respect of his reference to a person earning €80,000, the income levy rate of 4% applies in respect of income above €75,000 and not to the full €80,000.

          <p eId="para_637">In regard to the tables, the question of the impact of individualisation is an ongoing issue.  The aim of individualisation was to provide each person with his or her own non-transferable standard rate band.  Individualisation involves narrowing the gap between the single and the married one earner band so that, at the end of the process, the single band was to be the same as the married one earner band and each spouse in a married couple would have the same non-transferable standard rate band.  There have been many modifications of this system since its introduction and we have not gone down the road of full individualisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">In regard to the question of the impact of individualisation in respect of the levies and other issues that arise, this is something I will reflect on in the context of the Finance Bill in order to ascertain whether anything can be done about that.  As the Deputy said, it is part of the system we have.  There are benefits to that system in terms of making sure that single people were not subjected to higher marginal rates than was necessary in terms of incentivising employment.  I cannot give a considered reply to the detailed issue the Deputy has raised but I hope to do so during the course of the budget debate.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_85">Resolution No. 3 provides for excise duty increases in tobacco products with effect from midnight tonight.  The increase amounts to 25%, inclusive of VAT, on a packet of 20 cigarettes withpro rata increases on other tobacco products.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">The price of a packet of 20 cigarettes, as the most popular price category, will increase to around €8.35.  The price of cigarettes in the State will continue to be the highest in the EU, for example, some €2 per packet dearer than in the UK and more than twice the average price of the EU as a whole.  The overall tax take from a packet of cigarettes following this increase will be €6.67, which is just under 80% of the retail price.  The excise duty component is €5.19, which is 2.5 times the average excise duty of €2.07 for the EU as a whole as at 1 January this year.  The high price of cigarettes in Ireland reflects the action taken over the years to ensure taxation policy plays a central part in the Government's strategy to protect public health by discouraging smoking.  Given the high levels of taxation and prices compared to other countries, a larger increase in excise duty would not have been appropriate at this stage.  Account has been also taken of the fact that it could make Ireland a more attractive location for cigarette smuggling.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">The Revenue Commissioners have applied significant resources to tackling all aspects of cigarette and tobacco smuggling and they have engaged the tobacco industry in this matter.  This measure is estimated to yield €32 million in 2009 and €45 million in a full year and have a consumer price index, CPI, impact of 0.11%.  The increase is expected to reduce cigarette consumption by approximately 0.8% in the next 12 months.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">Financial Resolution No. 4 provides with effect from midnight tonight for an increase in mineral oil tax on auto diesel, which, when VAT is included, amounts to 5 cent on a litre.  The same increase is applied to jet kerosene for non-business use and to diesel use for private pleasure navigation.  This is the first increase to the rate of mineral oil tax on auto diesel since December 2003.  Following the increase, auto diesel is expected to be approximately 10 cent per litre cheaper than in Northern Ireland.  The expected yield from this increase is approximately €70 million in 2009 and €100 million in a full year.  The CPI will increase by approximately 0.4%.</summary>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_998">I do not have a difficulty with the proposed measure relating to tobacco, although I am sceptical that this will result in an 8% reduction in the consumption of cigarettes.  The evidence is that as the price has increased, there has not been a corresponding reduction and while I hope there is a corresponding increase in the tax take, I have doubts about that as well, as the black market for cigarettes in Ireland is expanding and developing.  We have a battle on our hands to combat that illegal industry as people's incomes come under more pressure.  I encourage the Government to ensure the policing measures adopted regarding cigarette smuggling are examined and beefed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">My reason for being present relates to the excise duty increase on diesel.  I accept the Government needs to find money from somewhere and it makes sense to target this area.  My problem is that the Government is targeting diesel but not petrol.  I understood clearly the rationale in this year's budget was that a price advantage would be proffered on diesel over petrol on the basis of emissions.  Presumably, this was due to the influence of the Green Party.  The decision has been reversed.  It is a fact that, in equivalent sized engines, diesel produces significantly lower emissions than petrol.  The Government made the sensible decision to ensure a price advantage for diesel over petrol to encourage people to buy diesel engines to drive down emissions, to improve the efficiency of engines and so on because diesel was more expensive than petrol in the autumn of last year for supply and demand reasons primarily.  Why has the Government reversed this policy?  If there is an issue regarding competitiveness and fuel prices north and south of the Border, surely that applies to diesel as well as petrol.  The Government's policy in this year's budget was correct to give diesel an advantage over petrol from an excise perspective.  Why has it reversed this policy?</p>

        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_319">
          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1000">I do not want to oppose the proposed excise increase on cigarettes because price can have an influence on young people and ensure they do not take up smoking.  It will not make a difference as a preventative measure for older people.  However, money collected in this way should be used to help people to give up smoking since that does not happen currently.  I strongly recommend such provision be made, as we will not see a reduction in numbers smoking otherwise.  The smoking ban initially led to a reduction in the numbers smoking but then numbers began to increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">It is extraordinary that an increase in the price of diesel has been proposed in this supplementary budget.  What has happened to the Green Party Ministers?  They do not attend the House for the Order of Business anymore and they do not appear to have had an influence on the preparation of the budget.  I do not know whether they are even interested in what is going on.  Fianna Fáil has taken over 100% but anybody with an interest in reducing carbon emissions and being more environmentally friendly would not target diesel for an excise duty increase.  Until recently, diesel was more expensive than petrol, which was unprecedented, and we had difficulties in ensuring we could sell the message that we wanted to reduce carbon emissions and people could make a choice to their benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">I refer to the reality in my constituency of Wicklow.  A public transport service is not available in large tracts of the county.  It is not as if people can make a choice to use public transport.  That is not an option for thousands of people living in County Wicklow but many commute to Dublin or travel long distances to work elsewhere.  These hard working people have been hammered in this budget through increased income and health levies, cutbacks in child care provision and a range of other blows.  It will take people a day or two to come to terms with what has been taken from them in this budget.  This increase is yet another blow.  The Minister can say it amounts to only 5 cent on every litre but that will ensure €100 million is collected in a full year.  The ordinary commuter will pay that amount.  As it is, the Government takes a sizeable chunk of the cost of petrol, gas and other fuels.  It is not as if the State is not taking a good percentage out of every litre bought but, in this instance, in addition to the taxes the Government is imposing on the average working family, it is imposing a tax on them every time they use a diesel engine car, which is unacceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_1003">I have no problem with the increase in the cost of cigarettes, as I was hoping the Minister would announce a higher increase.  Even though that would not be popular, there is logic to it as it would discourage people from smoking and the money could be used specifically to help the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">There is absolutely no logic, however, to the retrograde step of increasing the excise duty on diesel.  It is an economically retrograde step for small industries that depend on haulage to keep their markets in the Six Counties and Britain where the sterling-euro exchange rate causes them to struggle.  This is an added cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">This also affects public transport.  This budget is already screwing Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus by way of the substantial reduction in the subvention for Córas Iompar Éireann despite its being one of the lowest public transport subventions in the European Union.  We have all been lobbied by taxi drivers who are struggling.  Most of the taxis in the State run on diesel which is logical.  Those drivers are being hammered again by the increase in the cost of diesel.  This is the opposite of what the Government should have done.  It should intervene to impose a moratorium on taxi plates.  The drivers do not have alternative employment but are stuck driving taxis with ever-increasing costs which they will transfer to the public.  Taxis are dear enough since the Government recently agreed an increase in taxi charges with the Taxi Regulator even though the unions did not look for that increase.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should examine this again.  It is not logical and is the wrong road to take.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_1006">This section of the budget caused me some surprise.  Will the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment tell us the expected take from the increases in excise in the budget?  I thought there was scope for the Government to do more in this area than it has done because it would raise money immediately and do so more fairly than applying levies that hit the pay packets of working people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Strong cases have been made on health grounds for increased excises on tobacco and alcohol.  The Minister for Finance referred in his statement today to cross-Border smuggling in respect of alcohol, tobacco and, I think, petrol.  RTE recently screened a very good documentary about smuggling, particularly of cigarettes which made clear that enforcement is the problem.  The customs and excise officers catch some of the smugglers but are not able to bring them to court or when they do the fines are so derisory as to make a joke of the process.  If the Government made some serious effort on the enforcement side it would be able to get a higher take in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">I agree with my colleagues who have spoken about the bizarre decision to increase the excise on diesel but not on petrol.  The Minister rightly spoke today about competitiveness and the need to get costs down in the economy and to do things that will encourage employment.  Diesel is employment-related.  We live on an island and so have high transport costs but this measure will add to those costs and will have a knock-on effect on employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">Was the Green Party at the Cabinet table when decisions were made on this budget?  I can find some evidence in the statement of the Government's having taken on board some of the suggestions Fine Gael and the Labour Party made in our respective pre-budget statements.  I can find no evidence of anything that is even remotely close to something the Greens might have wished to achieve in this budget.  This measure in particular baffles me completely because I would have thought, for the reasons that Deputies Coveney and McManus have stated, that it would have been the reverse.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1010">I have no problem with the tobacco increases.  I would even be tempted to advocate a higher charge because of tobacco's adverse effect on people's health and all the consequences.  If that happened, however, I would have concerns about the enforcement issues the previous speaker has addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">The diesel increase is unfortunate.  The Government probably went for a quick fix here on the basis that sticking 5 cent on to a litre would throw up €100 million, without sufficiently considering its impact on competitiveness and businesses across the land.  Everybody who stands up here talks about how hard-pressed business is.  We all know that is fact, not waffle.  Cash turnover, calling in debt and so on are important issues for businesses which were probably never as cash-strapped as now.  What products are not transported?  Even on a small island such as this transport costs are astronomical.  Those who work in the transport sector are still reeling from the major impact of high oil prices in recent years.  Now that the oil prices are beginning to return to a manageable margin this excise is a retrograde step.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">It is designated as a ‘mineral oil tax' which raises an interesting question.  What if the Government were to introduce a decent tax on our mineral reserves?  That would be a more strategic, more far-sighted and profitable application than going after people in the transport business and small companies.  The Corrib field is worth at least €10 billion yet the rights to it were given away by people who are no longer here so there is no point harping on about that.  Unfortunately, this move is symptomatic of the Government's propensity to move to the easy option to grab a few bob when a much more strategic approach could and should have been taken.  It would have had more merit.  This move sets competitiveness back again.</p>

          <p eId="para_1015">Speaking as a doctor and a non-smoker, I can see the case for increasing excise on tobacco from a health point of view.  I am concerned, however, by the Government's projection that it will raise €32 million from this.  I do not think that will happen.  There is a law of diminishing returns with taxation. There is a significant amount of cigarette smuggling as we all know.  The year on year, monthly returns from tobacco are interesting.  Last month was the first in which the year on year return from excise on tobacco went down.  That might perhaps be because of a sudden reduction in smoking, for the first time ever, but the likelihood is that it is due to fraud and smuggling.  This is one of the many holes in the budget.  Revenue from excise on tobacco will fall for several reasons and the Government will have to address that.  It will have to come back in its mini-budget in June or September, or whenever it will introduce the next budget——</p>

          <p eId="para_1017">——and address that issue again.  The monthly year on year returns from excise on alcohol are falling because of the law of diminishing returns.  I will not be two-faced about diesel.  My party proposed to increase excise on diesel by more than the Government proposed.  However ours was part of an overall package that did not hammer middle-class families through massive increases in taxation, which the Government has done here.  That is horrendous.  This is a tax and spend budget from the 1980s.  The Government is taking €4,000 from the pockets of the average family and €2,500 from the average working person.  It is recreating all those problems we had in the 1980s between PAYE workers who pay all the tax and others who can avoid it, and between those who benefit from welfare payments and those who do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Deputy Gilmore asked about the influence of the Greens in this budget.  It is clear that the PDs' influence is also missing from this budget because when it formed part of this Government it kept taxes down.  The Government is returning to tax and spend socialism and will tax people out of their jobs and onto the dole queues.  The mistakes the Government has made are huge.  I expect we will have another mini budget in a few months time and if not we will be faced with a much greater economic crisis as a consequence of this budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_1022">The Irish people use three general drugs as social drugs of choice in large quantities, namely alcohol, cannabis and cigarettes or tobacco.  If the Government wanted to stop people smoking cigarettes, and did not just want to raise revenue, it would put €5 on each packet.  That would stop people from smoking.  This is simply a revenue raising exercise.  As far as I can calculate the Government takes in €1.35 billion per year in cigarette taxes.  I am not sure if that is accurate but I did a rough calculation on what the Government gets on this increase, and I know the amount I pay every day for a packet of cigarettes and roughly the revenue the Government takes from that packet.  The Government should respect the 1 million smokers in the country and not denigrate them at every turn.  They are good cash cows for revenue and should be treated with respect and not as the Government usually treats them in this House.</p>

Resolution No. 4 is another whammy for public transport and the transport industry after a series of measures this Government has taken.  For example, all last year the Government had the opportunity to do something about the withdrawal by the European Union of the fuel rebate, to negotiate some sort of continuing support for public transport at EU level, and it failed to do that.  Here again we have another measure which will make things much more difficult.  At the same time in the capital budget we are removing approximately €320 million of spending on transport.  The net impact will be a smaller subsidy for public transport.  The most sinister phrase in the budget on capital spending is, "in public transport the way ahead will also see some deferrals and rescheduling of other programmes".  This presumably refers to the whole range of public transport initiatives including perhaps, despite the Minister, Deputy Dempsey's recent speeches, metro north, the interconnector, the western rail corridor, the Navan rail line and so on.

        <summary eId="sum_223">Financial Resolution No. 5 decreases the three tax free CAT group thresholds applicable to gifts or inheritance taken on or after 8 April 2009 by 20%.  These tax-free group thresholds, which are indexed each year in line with inflation, are based on the relationship between the disowner and the beneficiary of a gift or inheritance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_224">The new tax free thresholds will be €434,000 for group A, inheritance and gifts from parents to children, €43,400 for group B, which is inheritance and gifts between brothers and sisters, grandparents to grandchildren, uncles and aunts to nieces and nephews and €21,700 for group C, inheritance and gifts between all other persons.  Deputies will note that the proposed new threshold amounts do not represent a precise 20% reduction.  They have been rounded down to the advantage of beneficiaries.  It is estimated that the additional yield arising from the budget proposal will be in the order of €15 million in 2009 and the full year yield is expected to be in the region of €18 million.  The impact of the rate increases has to be considered in tandem with the proposed 20% decrease in the three tax free CAT thresholds.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_225">In overall terms, the estimated yield from the rate increase and the threshold reduction is €16 million in 2009 and €24 million in a full year.  Deputies should also note that the legislation does not contain the current tax free group threshold figures.  Instead, it contains figures which were set in 1999, indexed to the CPI.  In order to achieve the intended reduction in the tax free group thresholds, it is necessary to insert the figures shown in the resolution, into the legislation.  In other words, when the current figure of €381,000 for the group A tax free threshold is replaced by €304,775 and is multiplied by the appropriate CPI factor, it gives us a new group A tax free threshold, which will be €434,000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_226">Financial Resolution No. 6 increases the rate of tax on gifts and inheritance, taken on or after 8 April 2009, from 22% to 25%.  It is estimated that the additional yield from the budget proposal will be in the order of €15 million in 2009 and the full year yield is expected to be in the region of €18 million.  The impact of the rate increase must be considered in tandem with the proposed 20% decrease in the three tax thresholds.  In overall terms, the estimated yield from the rate increase and the threshold reduction is €31 million in 2009 and €42 million in a full year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_227">The receipt of a gift or inheritance can constitute an important benefit and a potential source of income for a beneficiary through the acquisition of assets such as property or money.  As such, these individuals must be expected to contribute to the requirement to raise additional revenue for the Exchequer at a time of serious pressure on the public finances.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_228">Financial Resolution No. 7 increases the rate of capital gains tax applicable to the disposal of other assets from 22% to 25%.  It applies to disposals made on or after 8 April 2009.  It is estimated that the additional yield arising from the budget proposal will be in the order of €30 million this year and the full year yield is expected to be in the region of €45 million.  It will be appreciated that it is difficult to accurately determine the effects of a rate increase in Exchequer receipts because of declining asset valuations and a decrease in the number of transactions.  There is a degree of confidence that the rate increase will not determine disposals, however.  Capital gains on the disposal of an asset constitute an important source of income to the owners of these assets and as such these individuals must be expected to contribute to the requirement to raise additional revenue for the Exchequer at a time of serious pressures on the public finances.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_229">The CGT rate increase of 3% to 25% is mirrored by the 3% raise in the CAT rate and a rise in DIRT by 2% from 23% to 25%.  As a result a similar rate applies across the three taxation areas which cover sources of incomes based on assets and savings.  This is part of the base broadening process which this Government started in budget 2009 when these rates were also increased.  Change of this nature helps to ease the additional tax requirements on labour and consumption by increasing taxes on wealth and on sources of wealth.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_230">Financial Resolution No. 8 gives statutory effect to the budget announcement that the rate of tax applying to life assurance policies and investment funds is being increased with effect from 8 April 2009.  This amendment applies to the rate of exit taxes and domestic life assurance policies and investment undertakings under the gross roll-up regime introduced in the Finance Act 2000.  It also increases the rates of tax that apply to profits and gains on life assurance policies and investment funds in other EU member states, EEA states and OECD countries with which Ireland has double taxation agreements.  Under gross roll-up, investments may accumulate without the imposition of tax.  However, an exit tax applies where a chargeable event occurs, such as receipt of payments from or the disposal of investments in the life policy or fund, or the ending of each eight year period following the acquisition of the policy or units in the fund.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_231">There are varying rates of tax in these investments depending on the frequency of the payment to the investor and, in the case of the foreign investments, whether the income or gains are correctly included the investor's tax return.  The rates are generally at the standard rate of income tax, currently 20%, plus 3% or at the standard rate plus 6%.  As an anti-avoidance measure, where the investment is held in a personal portfolio investment undertaking or personal portfolio life policy, the tax rates applied are the standard rate plus an additional 26%.  Similarly, where a payment is in receipt of a foreign life policy and is not correctly included in the investor's tax return, the rate of tax that applies is at the investor's marginal rate plus an additional 23%.  Each of the above rates is being increased by 2%, which is expected to yield the Exchequer an additional €5 million in 2009 and €8 million in a full year.  The combined projected additional yield from this measure and the 2% increase in deposit retention tax and tax on special savings accounts and special term accounts is expected to be €50 million in 2009 and €70 million in a full year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_232">Financial Resolution No. 9 gives legislative effect to the budget announcement that the rates of direct interest retention tax would be increased by 2% with effect from 8 April.  The resolution amends section 256(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to give statutory effect to the new rates of DIRT applicable to deposits held in banks and other financial institutions.  The changed rates are as follows: the general 23% rate which applies to deposit interest, including deposit interest arising on special savings accounts and special term accounts, has been increased to 25%; and the 26% rate is being increased to 28% in the case of interest which was not payable annually or at more frequent intervals and where the interest cannot be calculated until the maturity of the investment.  This includes investments such as tracker bonds, where the amount of interest payable depends on the changes in a financial or other index or the number of years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_233">The resolution also amends section 267B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to increase the 23% rate which applies to special share accounts and special term accounts held in credit unions to 25%.  This measures is expected to yield the Exchequer €45 million in 2009 and €62 million in a full year.  The combined projected yield from this measure and the increased exit tax on life assurance and investment funds is €50 million in 2009 and €70 million in a full year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_234">Financial Resolution No. 10 provides for an increase in the current 2% non-life levy by 1% to 3% and by a new 1% levy on life assurance policies.  The non-life insurance levy, which has been in place for many years, does not apply to voluntary health insurance, reinsurance, marine, aviation and transport insurance, export credit insurance and certain dental contracts.  The increase in the levy is unlikely to deter people from taking out insurance because it is a relatively small part of the cost of insurance.  People are legally required to have certain types of insurance, for example, drivers are required to have motor insurance and mortgage lenders usually require borrowers to take out home insurance.  It is important for people to take out home insurance and business property insurance to cover future unforeseen events.  The increase in the non-life levy will apply to premiums received on or after 1 June 2009 in respect of offers of insurance or notice of renewal of insurance issued by an insurer on or after 8 April 2009.  The new life levy will also apply to premiums received on or after 1 June 2009 in respect of life insurance policies.  The new levy will be a very small part of the cost of life assurance, the purpose of which is to provide for expenses of future events.  The yield from the measure in respect of the non-life levy is estimated at €40 million in a full year and €27 million in 2009, while the yield from the life levy is estimated at €114 million in a full year and €83 million in 2009.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1176">The majority of these resolutions provide for increases in capital taxation.  I share the view that capital taxes in Ireland should be considerably higher because it is wrong to tax income from work at such a high rate while taxing wealth not gained through work, such as inheritance or capital gains on property, at a lower rate.  That is why I have no difficulty in seeking significant increases in capital taxes provided that they form part of a wider package involving reduced taxes on income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">These resolutions, however, merely comprise yet another major tax grab by the Fianna Fáil led Government.  Death and gift taxes are being increased, as are taxes on life assurance and savings.  These come on top of the horrendous increases in tax on work through PRSI increases, the Lenihan levy, the health levy, excise increases and the previous budget's increases on VAT and taxes on second homes and parking spaces.  The Minister for Finance has indicated his intention to tax children and homes in the next budget.  I have not even mentioned the travel tax on those flying to this country.  The Government's entire economic and budgetary strategy appears to be tax and more tax.  My party opposes this view because we do not think one can tax one's way out of recession.  A much more sophisticated approach is required.  First, one needs to control spending.  The adjustment should come two thirds from spending and one third from tax increases.  Some measures also need to be included which will stimulate demand and employment.  We have put those views across for reducing both VAT rates, abolishing the travel tax, and bringing the pension fund back home to invest in infrastructure and new State enterprises.  The Government's strategy, however, is just about tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">What really defines this budget and the entire policy is subhead C15 which refers to gross current expenditure at €62.4 billion this year, €64.5 billion in 2010, €65.4 billion in 2011, €67.4 billion in 2012, and €68.9 billion in 2013.  It is spend, spend, spend and when the Government has finished doing that, let us spend some more.  How will the Government manage that?  It will hit people on tax.  Tax revenue will be €34.4 billion this year, €35.3 billion in 2010, €38.9 billion in 2011, €41.3 billion in 2012 and €43.73 billion in 2013.  This is the budget that Fidel Castro or Kim Il Sung would have eaten their hearts out for.  These are the pure tax-and-spend, old-fashioned policies of the early 1980s, the kind of failed policies that ended up with a national debt of 120% of our gross domestic product, unemployment of 20% and a recession-depression for the best part of a decade.  That is where the Government is going.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">We have learned nothing from our economic history in this State if we think this kind of approach will work.  It will not work because the Government will not get the returns from tax increases that it expects.  It will find out that these attempts to tax everything that is not already taxed while taxing everything else more will not bring increased revenues.  It will drive money out of the country and drive people out of jobs.  The Government will have to come back here either in three or six months' time with a new budget that involves some of the measures that are necessary, including reduced spending.  One cannot increase spending from €46.3 billion to €54.5 billion in five years.  The Government has already spent too much.  We already spend 48% of our gross national product, our national income, on public spending.  It will be well over 50% within two years, so the Government cannot go on like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">Tax and spend is not the solution.  That is my argument in a nutshell when it comes to these particular issues.  We will certainly be voting against this.  I could countenance increases in capital taxes if they were part of a process that involved reducing taxes at work but certainly not in this scenario.  This policy will lead us to ruin.  It is back to the 1980s.</p>

          <p eId="para_1183">The batch of financial resolutions before us covers quite a wide range.  If taxes on income are to increase — and they clearly are in this budget in the form of the increased income levy and changes in PRSI — then there is a consistent logic in applying similar increases at least to capital taxes.  On the issue of capital acquisitions tax, I understand why and I agree that in times when property values are falling the threshold for capital acquisitions tax should also be reduced.  I have some difficulty however in following the logic of what is being done here.  The Tánaiste took us through the reductions which are being made and then took us through the upward adjustments that are then being made on that figure in line with indexation.  I am not entirely clear how that indexation works, so she might return to it in her reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">The Labour Party does not have any difficulty with the increase in the rate of capital acquisitions tax from 22% to 25%.  I suppose the same logic applies to capital gains tax, although I am surprised at the yield the Tánaiste suggested would arise from that increase.  Given the extent to which capital gains are not being made at the moment and also the likely impact on transactions, the estimated yield is probably on the optimistic side.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">I note the Tánaiste said there was a policy to have a consistent level of capital taxes at 25% in the context of the Government's policy to widen the tax base.  When he was presenting the budget, the Minister for Finance indicated that it was intended to introduce a property tax, probably in the next budget but certainly in a future budget.  From what the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have said, can we anticipate that the level of a property tax will also be at 25% whenever it is introduced?</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">I do not agree with the proposed increase in DIRT, which is a tax on people's savings.  In this context, we are talking about people, many of whom have worked hard all their lives and have paid their taxes.  The savings which attract DIRT are after-tax income.  Many pensioners have seen the value of their private pensions decline.  People were advised in pre-retirement courses to take out shares in banks, but have seen the value of those declining.  This is a further tax on pensioners who have lost their entitlement to the medical card and may have some small savings on deposit.  It is not something with which I can agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">As I understand the stamp duty changes in financial resolution No. 10, the effect of the proposed increases is that the levy on life insurance will increase.  In addition, the levy on mortgage insurance will increase, which will drive up the mortgage bill.  Mortgage holders who have been benefiting from a reduction in mortgages, which is welcome, will find themselves facing a double whammy on their mortgages as a result of this budget.  They will lose their mortgage interest relief and the insurance portion of the mortgage will be increased.  Similarly, this resolution will also increase the cost of motor insurance, which comes on top of an increase in the price of diesel, thus hitting people whose pay packets are already being hit.  When one adds up all the different hits on a person at work, they include the cost of travelling to work, the loss of the early childhood supplement, a large reduction in income as a result of levies, the loss of mortgage interest relief, an increase in mortgage insurance, and increased diesel and motor insurance costs.  The Labour Party agrees with some of the proposals contained in this batch of financial resolutions, such as the change in the capital acquisitions tax threshold and the rate of capital taxation, but other measures are unfairly impacting on people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">I wish to make a final comment in respect of what Deputy Varadkar said and I understand the point he is making.  The Government envisages that tax revenues in 2013 will be €43.7 billion.  If our economy is in such a state that it will only produce tax revenues of €43.7 billion by 2013, we have a much greater problem than we believe.  The Government has argued that as a result of what it is doing, it will restore order to the public finances, the economy will recover and people will presumably return to work and start spending again.  We have had a large decrease in our tax revenue not because of our tax rates but because people are losing their jobs and fewer people are paying income tax.  As a result of job losses and concerns about the future, people are not spending as they did previously and there has been a significant decrease in revenues from expenditure taxes.  We also know what has happened to the property market, with the consequential decline in taxes from transactions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">If there is not a bigger recovery in tax revenues by 2013 than the €9 billion provided for in the projections, the budget will not have been a road map to recovery but, at best, a "business as business is" in 2009 and we are in for a much grimmer period economically than the Government has suggested might be the case.  The Labour Party certainly hopes for and wants an economic recovery such that as a result either of increased domestic economic activity and, hopefully, an upturn in the global economy, tax revenues — by virtue of buoyancy and the activity that will take place in the economy — will have improved much more substantially than projected in the Government's figures.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1190">The Tánaiste is faced with a diversity of opinion on this side of the House.  I have no problem with the change in capital acquisitions tax and not much difficulty with the change in capital gains tax.  However, I have a major problem with the introduction of a levy on life assurance policies and the increase in the levy on non-life assurance policies.  The vast majority of those fortunate enough to be able to take out a mortgage from a financial institution are required, upon doing so, to take out a life assurance policy.  As part of the deal, it is unavoidable.  Such people already face a problem arising from the decision in the budget to slash mortgage interest relief after seven years.  As a result of the economic downturn they are in substantial difficulty.  The ordinary person in the street will be forced to dip even deeper into their pockets to meet the cost of the new levy and the increase in levy on non-life assurance.  I have a major problem with this measure because it is grossly unfair to catch people in this manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">The Tánaiste travels around the country as much or more than any Member of the House and will be aware that people are in serious trouble.  This is not a cliché but a statement of fact.  We know the overwhelming majority of people with mortgages, most of which are substantial coming off the back of the boom, are genuinely struggling.  As with many other aspects of the budget, the Government's strategy, in introducing this measure, was to take a short-sighted, individualistic and blinkered option.  It chose to grab €140 million from people who, if they are lucky enough to get mortgages, will have to pay a substantial amount.  This is an unfortunate decision, particularly when measured against the broad range of tax measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">On the one hand, one has the ordinary Joe and Josephine soap who have to dig deep to pay for life insurance, while on the other end of the income scale we have people who can employ tax consultants to provide the best of advice — in their terms — to enable their clients to get off very lightly.  The position is grossly unfair.  The Government's stab in the dark, as it were, in raiding a particular pocket was extremely short-sighted.  The budget did not contain any strategic long-term measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">I do not have a problem with the increase in DIRT tax which probably does not go far enough.  Deputy Varadkar argued that Government policy was one of tax and spend.  The Budget Statement indicates that savings in transport will amount to €300 million, including a reduction of €150 million or 8% in investment in roads.</p>

          <p eId="para_1196">The centrepiece of this budget should have been job retention and job creation.  Deputy Gilmore and I both made the point that the revenue stream will not improve unless we maintain existing jobs and create new jobs to cater for the 370,000 people on the live register.  As ever more people join the dole queues, the drain on revenue through unemployment benefits and welfare payments becomes larger.  This is the element of the budget that disappoints me most.  I do not say this to make a party political point but because I genuinely believe the jobs issue needs to be tackled most.  While we can argue about the other issues, the crisis will not begin to bottom out until such time as the issues of job retention and job creation are addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1197">It is probably appropriate in the discussion on this group of proposals to say something about wealth and I am encouraged to do so by the Tánaiste.  The first thing that strikes one when one looks at the yield across the ten measures is the relatively low figure they produce when aggregated.  In assessing the budget one should contrast each one of these low figures with the high yield figures arising from the cuts and the implications on the other side of the budget speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">I ask the Tánaiste to respond to one or two points I will make.  Will she explain the reason there is such antipathy to the study of wealth in the Department of Finance and other Departments?  I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance recently asking how many studies had been carried out in the past ten years on the transfer pattern and accretion of wealth.  The answer, when one deconstructs it, was that hardly any studies had been done on wealth.  The reason I asked the question is that most of the commentary in the financial press in the run in to the budget concentrated on the balance between, on the one hand, what would be its impact on income and what needed to be done by way of raising tax and, on the other, what cuts in expenditure should be made, with considerable emphasis on the high proportion of expenditure on the social welfare budget.  There was, however, almost a deadly silence about wealth and what took place during what is described as the Celtic tiger.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, travels the world talking about how he built the Celtic tiger.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">It is very interesting to note what has happened to the wealth accumulated during the Celtic tiger.  I throw in, as a casual comment, a statement of the obvious, namely, that property values have fallen.  Nevertheless, property values increased dramatically as a result of the disgraceful decisions taken by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, when he was a Member of the House.  For example, I saw a figure on what happened when capital gains tax was reduced.  A great deal of the money went into property straight away.  In 1981, for example, housing related property was valued at €39 billion whereas this figure had increased to €553 billion in 2006.  Perhaps that is irrelevant to many people.  What was happening in between with that money?</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">I will, on another occasion, go into the implications of claiming to have a successful economy.  Today ours is referred to by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan as one of the best in the world in the final paragraph of his speech.  In fact, there was high growth rate and exports had flattened out.  Why was the Government doing that?  It was because it was revaluing the property base of the economy.  This was preceded by a whole series of transactions from which people made an enormous amount of money.  I understand one of the reports of the Revenue Commissioners suggests the cost from 1999 to 2006 of urban renewal was some €1.423 billion.  Where is there a single line in this budget that suggests there is any clawback by way of capital regained from the people who benefited from that?</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">In 2003 three of the top 400 earners had reduced their effective tax to zero and 48 others had kept their tax liability under 5%.  Has the Government gone after any of these people?  Building car parks, spas and so forth were the top choices of such people who referred to "effective tax" and were advised by people on tax avoidance.  A total of 86% of the people who benefited from that policy earned more than €200,000.  I fire these figures in to show it is not a case of "we" lived beyond our means and suddenly have to reduce our income, as the Minister for Finance said, to 2007, 2005 or 2003 levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">Some people did awfully well.  I would be less than honest if I did not say the Tánaiste's party knew many of them very well.  She knew the people who benefited from urban renewal.</p>

          <p eId="para_1204">I will be very direct about it, in so far as she encourages me to be.  The banking element of the budget follows the consequences of the speculative economy abroad to the four winds to try to suggest we, as taxpayers, must recover stability in a banking system which was ransacked by people who behaved disgracefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">Let us be clear about why we are raising all of this.  What does it cost per day to run the country?  It costs some €55 million.  We borrow a significant proportion of that and pay two or three points over the borrowing rate because of Mr. FitzPatrick and his little toxic clique.  The Tánaiste knows that toxic clique and it was well placed across the corporate sector and all of the banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_1207">After I have listened to all the guff today, the various banking elites are still in place.  We will return to that issue another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">I wish to discuss capital gains tax.  This Government, which created the problems the budget is addressing, has no interest in wealth.  It is one of the great scandals that the media has neglected.  It is as if it does not matter.  Once one has it, one can hide it.  Once one has made one's gains from all of the different schemes available, it does not matter.  Who are the easy people to go after?  The laziest way to go after the people most easily targeted is through levies.  One can even achieve this in an eight month period.  On the expenditure side one can get rid of the Christmas bonus.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">What about all the people who shifted, when capital gains tax was initially reduced, into property?  They borrowed from banks which were not real banks but were, in fact, speculators' clubs.  What we had, and what the former Taoiseach describes around the world as the most successful economy in the world, had moved from being a real economy with a real banking system into a speculative economy that had a little racket going for people who were shifting their balances from one balance sheet to another at the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">I appreciate the detail which the Minister and Members of the Government go into to explain the yield and everything like that.  I acknowledge the officials are preparing real figures and there are exceptions.  Auditing, accountancy and public finance have been significantly degraded by the people involved in auditing accounts in our banking system.  It has reached a point where they have not only dragged the economy down but have dragged fine professions down too.  That is the real truth of it.  The changes and the different ways we have to respond to different property values are like discussing Hamlet without the ghost.  I am very interested to hear the Tánaiste being realistic in replying to what I have to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">I ask the Tánaiste to tell me what studies have been carried out regarding wealth, the contribution of transfer patterns regarding the increase in wealth and the Commission on Taxation.  Will the commission suggest how the Government can claw back money from those who abused every one of the property related, tax driven systems?  It is a small group of people.  How will the Government access the wealth?  It has not all gone away.  These are real issues.  To be frank, most of the other issues are simply small potatoes which could waste our time late at night when there is no political intention or will to ever address the question of making those who are wealthy contribute in the same way as people who pay income tax or who are trying to benefit from the other side of transfers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">The phrase used in the financial press is that one is looking at the "transfer pattern".  When it editorialises and questions, one finds it is talking about social welfare.  There has been another major transfer pattern.  There are people who reduced their tax contribution to the State in effective tax terms, in some cases to zero and other cases to nearly 5%, not to speak of the several thousand who moved themselves out of the country altogether and who were happy to have an Irish passport but were unwilling to pay their tax.  These are the people who are the real scum of our society.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1214">I support the remarks of my party leader and Deputy Higgins.  The story of the budget has been one of a savage attack on the incomes of working people in particular and on people who live on social welfare benefits.  That is its fundamental impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">There is major anger which is now boiling over in people and we have heard it on the phones and in e-mails.  I met a person who was weeping thinking about the kind of threats and implementation in the social welfare budget today.  It is something the Tánaiste should be profoundly aware of because the tumbril is coming for her and the Government.  This budget marks a watershed and the public will feel the need for vengeance on 5 June and on any other date the Government decides to seek a mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">I did not have the opportunity over the six or seven months of this intense financial crisis to make the point that this Government has no mandate.  When people voted two years ago, if they voted for anything they made a last minute decision to stick with the then Taoiseach, for whatever reason.  They were not happy with who they thought might be the alternative Taoiseach.  They stuck with the then Taoiseach and we then got a Government nobody had voted for, led by Deputy Cowen, the Tánaiste and a number of senior Ministers.  The Government has no mandate whatsoever to introduce these fundamental changes.  It is a Government that has an air almost of illegitimacy about it because people have not had a chance to vote on these matters and take decisions about where the country should go.  If a general election was held, no matter what the outcome, people would be prepared to consider all the options prepared by such a Government.  However, the Government does not have that backing, as our spokesperson said, and that is a fundamental problem for our democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">It is a pity we do not have the report of the Commission on Taxation in assessing the resolutions.  It must be said that the resolutions on capital gains propose relatively minor changes.  It is striking that the most important change to capital taxation was made by former Deputy McCreevy, who slashed the rate.  Due to the massive property bubble the resulting gains to the Exchequer were considerable, although that was not predicted by the Department of Finance.  Looking at the overall figures put forward on the capital side by the Department, one can see that for the rest of this year a return of €61 million is predicted, but who can believe the predictions of the Department of Finance?  I have a fundamental problem with the management of our economy by that Department over the past 12 years.  I have raised the issue of forecasting by the Department at the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, and I will be delighted to raise it in two or three weeks' time when the Secretary General and his staff come before us again.  I will ask them to provide an account for the whole financial system over the past 12 years.  What on earth happened to the senior Department of State when casino banking took over our banking system, wrecked this economy——</p>

          <p eId="para_1219">——and indebted our people for decades and perhaps generations?  Was the Department of Finance on the bridge when that happened?  How can I accept its predictions when it has been wrong year after year on so many issues, including tax returns and gross domestic product?  Will the yield, for example, be a great deal higher than it predicts?  We had the balance right when we were in the territory of 40% capital taxation, whereby people who had made serious gains were required to give some of that super-normal profit back to the people, the community and the State.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, the former Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and former Deputy McCreevy dismantled all that during their great 11-year regime.  They ran the budget on a phoney basis, relying on the property bubble.  That is the central problem we experienced.  Today we are told, and we will be told over the next week, that working families on €40,000 or €50,000 and much less will be paying for this for the rest of their lives.  That is what the Minister has done in his pay-back budget, and the Government will be paid back on 5 June — it had better believe it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">I do not know where Deputy Varadkar has been over the past year and a half or two years, but his Milton Friedman-Chicago school economic system has collapsed.  It has fallen apart; it has failed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1222">It does not work anymore.  We are now trying desperately to rebuild a different model.  There were parts of the world in which that rotten, corrupt style of capitalism, the Anglo-Saxon model, never really took hold.  One could cite, for example, the Scandinavian democracies.  Proudly led, for the most part, by Labour Party or social democratic Governments, they were prepared to find the right balance of taxation, including capital taxation, to provide high employment economies with large budgets and considerable spending on health, education, welfare and public transport, whatever was necessary for those states.  We, unfortunately, had the kind of Government Deputy Varadkar still seems to yearn for.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">I agree with the comments of my colleagues with regard to DIRT and the implications of the second last resolution increasing the levy on non-life insurance premiums, which will surely be another deflationary influence and will make things that little bit harder.  Tonight many people following this debate will say this is the straw that broke the camel's back.  This must end.  Working people cannot support this approach anymore.  Therefore, I say to the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that, in the words of the AIB shareholders, they should just go.  Let us have an election and a proper Government with a mandate, which will bring in policies that will suit the whole country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1233">The constituency calls are coming in already and I have just one question to ask the Minister, which is with regard to the withdrawal of tax reliefs for nursing homes.  I do not want to comment on the merits or demerits of the issue, but will the measure apply from midnight tonight or will provision be made for persons who have poured foundations?  Will they have to go up to the wall and template?  Will they get it with full planning permission?  It seems that anyone who has made arrangements to the extent of obtaining full planning permission should get the relief.  If they do not get it they will not build anyway so there is no loss to the Exchequer, but there is a possibility of extra nursing home beds being provided in certain cases.  The Minister's colleague, the former Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, might be interested as well because the same provision gives tax relief for PPPs for private hospitals.  Some of these would have gone to planning permission stage and some of them would have made financial arrangements.  Thus, we would both be interested in the answer to that question, although perhaps for different reasons.  I am particularly interested in nursing homes, but there are certainly implications for private hospital projects as well.  I presume there is some transitional measure.  As there is no financial resolution, I assume the measure will not come in from midnight tonight.</p>

          <p eId="para_1238">One must be reasonable.  Deputy Morgan said we may not necessarily get agreement from all sides of the House when it comes to the issues we are discussing here in an amalgamation of all the financial resolutions.  This is correct.  I would normally concur with Deputy Varadkar's views on capital gains.  A tax on capital would be the preferred option in normal circumstances, but unfortunately we are not in normal circumstances as we have had to deal with major difficulties in our public finances.  However, I accept his view that increasing CGT and CAT is the right thing to do.  It is a question of widening the tax base.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">Deputy Gilmore raised the issue of property tax.  The Minister for Finance indicated that it is intended to examine the introduction of such a tax.  That has not been finalised by the Government but the Commission on Taxation will put forward its views in the autumn and we will work through how best it can be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">I have been in this House many years and have listened on many occasions to Deputy Higgins speak about issues to which he clearly has an emotional attachment, particularly in regard to foreign policy and aid.  He and I may not be in agreement in terms of our views on various aspects of social policy, but I appreciate his views.  However, it is slightly disingenuous to talk about the Nordic model of social policy.  In places such as Sweden, although one can spend a great deal of money in providing social services on the back of extreme wealth, diversity is the way in which any culture or any family can make decisions.  Having a situation where one can determine by diktat how people are reared or how they live is not necessarily a good social policy.</p>

However, they are methods by which we can increase our tax base and accrue further income to the State outside of taxation on labour.  I am sorry about the increase in the cost of cigarettes.

          <p eId="para_1291">That is definite.  We should be encouraging people — in fact it should be made law — to take out life insurance and critical illness cover.  In some cases, people have no choice and are forced by the banks to do so.  I believe people should be legally required to take out critical illness cover.  It is wrong to introduce a deterrent that will put people off taking out life insurance and critical illness cover, which are important.  These policies result in enormous savings to the State and should not be penalised further.  While I accept an increase may be necessary in respect of life insurance policies which pay out a lump sum, general straightforward life insurance policies which provide no lump sum payment should not be hit.  It is wrong to do so.  Also, it sends out the wrong message.  We should be encouraging people to take out insurance.  Critical illness cover is just as important as life insurance.  It is a pity the the Government is going down this road.</p>

I accept an attempt is being made to address the bad debts issue.  We all agree the issue must be addressed although we may differ on the method by which that is done.  The proposed method will in my opinion take a long time.  We were told by the Taoiseach that this will be the answer to freeing up money to businesses and so on.  However, that is no good if it is going to take six or eight months to take effect.  Small businesses need money now.  Six months time will be too late.  This year is about survival.</p>

This Government will make decisions on the basis of the sustainability of the banking system to ensure the country can move forward, thus returning us to a situation whereby enterprise, employment and access to working capital and the methods by which we continue to operate business and create export potential take place.

I feel that liquidity in the banking sector will improve on the basis of the decisions to be made by this House, which were indicated today on the floor of the House by the Minister for Finance.  Along with all of my agencies, I will continue to work with the banks on a constant basis to put forward the view that there is an absolute necessity to support enterprise.  A new framework has been introduced by me and my agencies to ensure that happens.  We will continue to do that <i>ad infinitum</i> until the liquidity of the banking sector is such that it enables businesses to improve and prosper.</p>

          <p eId="para_1415">I was reminded of Minnie Mouse when I saw that the work he did to try to save the Dell facility in Limerick was unsuccessful.  I was not a bit surprised.  This economy will not move into the recovery stage until we create new jobs and look after small and medium-sized enterprises.  Fine Gael produced an excellent document last week.  The Labour Party brought out its document yesterday.  I do not feel that anything in this budget will protect small and medium-sized enterprises.  Nothing in it will encourage outside investors to come to Ireland and replace companies like Dell which have gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1416">It is great to see Coca-Cola in County Wexford.  In 1997, County Wexford lost out when the Fianna Fáil-led Government took Coca-Cola out of the county and moved it to another part of the country.  We are only getting what we were due ten years ago.  The Coca-Cola jobs comprise the only employment this Government has ever brought into County Wexford.  I assure the House that it was not the Government's work and commitment that brought Coca-Cola into County Wexford.  One of the major factors that enticed Coca-Cola was the infrastructure that is available at Rosslare Europort.</p>

That is very important to this country, especially if it is to attract foreign direct investment.  I accept that it will be difficult to attract further such investment.  We have done that in the past on the basis of our rate of corporation tax.  Our research and development tax rates are 20% and 25%.

That is development-led land that is partly built on, built on and not built on at all.  I asked repeatedly at committee meetings, and I have been assured by the regulator's staff that they have checked the loans and counted them up, and the exposure was €39.4 billion to be exact.

The implementation of the scheme for the Civil Service is being dealt with by the Department of Finance. It is understood that implementing the scheme in the Civil Service has given rise to a number of issues, particularly in relation to procurement, warranty and insurance.  The Department of Finance has, it is understood, raised these issues with the State Claims Agency, Chief State Solicitors Office and the Office of the Attorney General.  Once these issues have been clarified, the Department of Finance will issue a circular providing for a scheme in the Civil Service.   This scheme can provide a framework for a similar scheme in the wider Public Service.</p>

There are a number of persons in the National Economic and Social Development Office employed under contract.  The expiry of a fixed term contract is determined by the terms of that contract. The decision as to whether to renew such a contract depends on a number of grounds, including the existence of objective reasons for renewing the contract on a fixed term basis. In the context of the moratorium, the renewal of fixed term contracts is treated in the same way as all employment in the public service. In relation to all public service posts including fixed term positions, no such posts can be filled without the prior sanction of the Minister for Finance.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_2450">Table 1 sets out the percentage of GDP spent on Research and Development for each year from 2000-2008. However, it should be noted that, in Ireland's case, it is regarded that the level of R&amp;D performed as a percentage of GNP is a more relevant measurement as these figures exclude the profit repatriations from multinationals. Table 1 also outlines the level of R&amp;D as a percentage of GNP. It should be noted that the figures for 2007 and 2008 are estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2451">The background to these figures is that gross expenditure on R&amp;D in the Irish economy has almost trebled in the ten years from 1998-2008, growing to an estimated €2.6 billion in 2008. The continuous growth in R&amp;D performance reflects the Government's commitment to investing in Ireland's science base as one of the key cornerstones underpinning future jobs in Ireland and the lynchpin of our transformation to the Smart Economy. The significant infrastructure investment underpinning the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation over the 2007-2013 period, and the return on that investment, are central to the robustness of our economic future. During the last decade the government has instituted a number of measures designed to enhance the level of R&amp;D performed in Ireland in both the Business and Higher Education sectors. The Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) is ten years in place and continues to transform the research landscape in Ireland by investing in human and physical infrastructure to strengthen national research capabilities. Biotechnology and ICT were identified as key areas of opportunity for Ireland and in response the Government created the Technology Foresight Fund in 2000 and subsequently established Science Foundation Ireland to invest in academic researchers and research teams who are most likely to generate new knowledge, leading edge technologies and competitive enterprises in these areas. The Government also continues to support the performance of R&amp;D in the business sector through the R&amp;D tax credit and a variety of supports and programmes run by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.</p>

            <p eId="para_2484">The reply to Question No. 64 of 2nd April 2009 refers.  The changed economic and employment market situation has meant that many of the workers who would have benefited from training programmes for those in employment are now unemployed. It is against this background that we must adjust our training programmes to the new reality. That is why my Department is implementing a number of initiatives to increase training for the unemployed.  Accordingly, the finite budgetary resources for training are increasingly being deployed towards activation measures to support training for greater numbers of unemployed persons. It is in this context that the Skillnets Training Network Programme allocation for 2009 has been reviewed and the allocations committed to individual projects have been adjusted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2485">Proposals made to my Department from Skillnets as to how the enterprise-led skillnets training network model might potentially assist in the training and upskilling of the unemployed and of part-time workers have already been the subject of joint discussions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2497">The Construction Industry (Pension Assurance and Sick Pay) Registered Employment Agreement (REA) is an agreement reached between employers and trade unions representative of workers in the sector. The REA requires employers in the construction sector to become and remain a party to a contributory pension scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners and sets out the conditions upon which pension and mortality payments are payable and the associated minimum amounts and benefits. The REA does not specify any particular pension scheme to apply but rather sets out the general criteria within which any such scheme should operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">I have no function in relation to the negotiation of, or changes to, this REA or any other Registered Employment Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2499">The Construction Workers Pension Scheme (generally referred to as CWPS) has been established on foot of the Registered Employment Agreement. The conditions upon which such pension, mortality and sick pay benefits are payable and the amounts thereof must not be less favourable than those which are set out in the REA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">The Construction Workers Pension Scheme is an independently run occupational scheme and I have no function in relation to its operation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2502">FÁS as an agency of my Department operates the Community Employment (CE) and Job Initiative (JI) schemes.  Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2503">The Job Initiative Programme (JI) was launched in July 1996 and provides full time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, unemployed for 5 years or more, and in receipt of Social Welfare payments over that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2504">The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities. The programme is sponsored by voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2505">Following changes introduced on 10 November 2004 by Minister Micheál Martin there have been no compulsory lay-offs on the Job Initiative Schemes. Contracts for existing participants are renewed and CE participants to support the service being provided replace those who leave voluntarily.</p>
            <p eId="para_2506">This Government will continue to support the positive role of FÁS Employment Schemes in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.   I am keeping the operation of the Schemes under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.  The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following table.  As the 2009 budget has not yet been finalised, the amounts stated are subject to change.</p>

            <p eId="para_2565">I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 28 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2566">I can confirm that the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department has received a number of applications from the company concerned.  Owing to a very significant influx in the number of redundancy applications filed with the Department in the latter part of 2008 and, to date in 2009, there is a considerable backlog of applications waiting to be processed in the Section.  I am conscious that many employers who have paid the due entitlements to workers are genuinely waiting on rebates for cash flow purposes and my Department is trying to process these claims as quickly as possible in the circumstances.  I have taken a number of measures, including the provision of additional staff resources in the Redundancy Payments Section, to deal with the increased workload and I expect that given some time, these measures will assist in making significant inroads into the backlog of applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_2567">As it stands, the Section is currently processing applications for rebate payments submitted online by employers dating from very early November 2008.  I understand that, in the case of the company referred to, there are a number of applications filed spanning the period from early November 2008 and into the early months of 2009.  I expect that the applications in question will be examined very shortly given that the Section is currently processing applications filed since early November 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2571">In 2006, the Irish Government decided that, following their accession to the EU, nationals of Romania and Bulgaria would still have to apply for work permits in order to work in Ireland. Following a review of the situation in 2008, Government decided to maintain this requirement. The considerable challenges now posed as a result of the downturn in the global economic environment and its direct impact on the labour market have been factors influencing this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2572">While nationals of Romania have to apply for work permits in order to work in Ireland, they are given preferential access to our labour market, ahead of   non-EEA nationals. In addition, Romanians who have been in the State on a valid employment permit for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer are not required to renew their employment permit in order to remain in the workplace.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2591">The Tánaiste and I are acutely aware of the difficulties which the inability to deliver an acceptable turnaround of redundancy rebate payments is giving rise to for both individual employees and the business community and together, we are taking steps to address the issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2592">The huge increase in the number of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department in the latter part of 2008 and, to date in 2009 is unprecedented and is giving rise to delays in the processing of redundancy payments for individuals and companies within a reasonable timeframe.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics which indicate that, as at 1 April 2009, the number of new claims lodged with my Department was 20,798 which is more than 50% of the entire level of applications lodged for the whole of 2008 i.e. 40, 607.  The number of claims received is averaging 1,600 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2593">Because of the huge surge in the number of claims received in Redundancy Payments in 2008, customer service targets have slipped as existing staff levels are insufficient to cope with such a massive increase in claim numbers.  I can confirm that applications made online for rebate payments dating from early November 2008 are being processed and from October 2008 in respect of claims filed manually.</p>
            <p eId="para_2594">Since the start of the year, I have re-allocated an additional 15 persons to the Redundancy Payments Section and a further re-allocation of staff is due to be made in the next couple of weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2595">In addition, I have just introduced a new temporary arrangement so that the dedicated information centre of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) will be able to give out better and more up-to-date information to callers about the status of their applications.  This will ensure that staff in the Redundancy Payments area of operation will be able to focus fully on and prioritise the most important aspect of the task, the actual processing of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_2596">I can assure the Deputy that this matter is under constant review in my Department and that every effort is being made to deal with an increasing backlog in an attempt to ensure that claimants get the best possible service at, what is for them, a very difficult time.</p>

The amount of funding each received from 2006 to date is as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_2601">The Deputy might also wish to be aware that while FÁS, an Agency which comes under the remit of my Department, does not provide "direct multi-annual funding" to Community and Voluntary Organisations, it does provide funding for community based employment and training programmes to make learning accessible in local areas.  Such programmes are organised in conjunction with community, voluntary and public organisations.  In this way, local organisations help to develop their area by sponsoring programmes, typically in the areas of social services, healthcare, heritage, arts, culture, tourism, sport, environment and education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2602">In 2008, over 30,000 people benefited through training and work-experience programmes, with approximately 1,400 voluntary and community sponsors involved. Each of the sponsor groups are contracted on an annual basis taking into account the overall budget available, sponsors business plans, any past history of the project including progression and certification. The project work must respond to an identified community need and offer valuable work experience to the project workers. Local Partnership Area groups would also be involved in this process.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_2647">As outlined in the Government's "Building Ireland's Smart Economy — A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal" Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) is playing a central role in Ireland's sustainable economic renewal.  SFI has a number of programmes, which are specifically designed to promote strong industry/academic collaborations.  The awards and 2008 funding provision for the most significant of these programmes, SFI Centres for Science, Engineering and Technology (CSETs) and the Strategic Research Clusters (SRCs) are set out in Tables 1 and 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_2648">The financial allocation to SFI for the full range of programmes for 2009 will be set out in the Revised Book of Estimates following the Budget announcement on 7th April.</p>
            <p eId="para_2649">To date, SFI has made awards to 9 CSETs and 17 SRCs in total. These industry-embedded research groups are formally linked to over 150 multinational and small to medium high-tech enterprises that employ over 60,000 people in high value jobs in Ireland.  These groups have been integral to IDA Ireland's strategy of attracting more R&amp;D-based foreign direct investment to Ireland. In recent years SFI has gradually shifted the focus of investments from individually-led investigator groups to groups within enterprise clusters with over double the number of SFI funded world-class Principal Investigators now being located within the CSETs and SRCs when compared to the 2004 position.</p>
            <p eId="para_2650">These SFI funded activities are consistent with promoting research and development as a key part of the enterprise agenda, assisting as they do the retention and attraction of quality employment in Ireland, and thereby increasing the value of Irish industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_2651">In addition, SFI also operates an industry supplement to SFI funded researchers and the 2008 expenditure associated with this programme amounted to €701,864. Therefore total payments made by SFI in 2008 for all the industry / academic collaborative programmes it supports (CSETs, SRCs and Industrial Supplements) amounted to €39.19m.</p>

         the practices from which retailers are prohibited from engaging in under the Competition Acts in their dealings with suppliers; the number of such prohibited practices which have come to light in each of the past three years; and the response of the Competition Authority thereto. 
        [14660/09]

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_690">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2743">Retailers, like all other undertakings, are subject to the provisions of sections 4 and 5 of the Competition Act 2002.  They are therefore prohibited from engaging in a variety anti-competitive practices such as price-fixing, market sharing abusing dominance etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2744">In addition, the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 inserts a new Part 2A immediately after section 15 of the 2002 Act.  The Part deals specifically with competition in the grocery goods trade and prohibits certain practices by grocery goods undertakings (defined as an undertaking that is engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of grocery goods).  Breaches of the prohibitions are civil only.</p>
            <p eId="para_2745">Section 15B(1) prohibits a grocery goods undertaking, directly or indirectly, attempting to compel or coerce another grocery goods undertaking, whether by threat, promise or any like means, to resell or advertise for resale any grocery goods at:</p>
            <p eId="para_2746">a price fixed directly or indirectly by the first mentioned grocery goods undertaking, or</p>
            <p eId="para_2747">a price above a minimum price fixed directly or indirectly by the first mentioned grocery goods undertaking.</p>
            <p eId="para_2748">This prohibits, not retail price maintenance itself (which is already prohibited by section 4 of the 2002 Act, and which is a criminal offence) but any attempt to force retail price maintenance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2749">Section 15B(2) prohibits a grocery goods undertaking from applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with any other grocery goods undertaking.  This is meant to catch unilateral behaviour by a non-dominant undertaking.  If the undertaking was dominant, the behaviour would be caught by section 5 of the 2002 Act.  A typical case might be a large supplier who gives better discounts or rebates to a supermarket than to a smaller store.  However, it should be noted that the provision prohibits discrimination where the transactions are equivalent: it does not, for example, prohibit a supplier from providing volume discounts to retailers based on the size of purchases, or from providing better terms to those who pay cash rather than on credit or wait to pay per the terms of an invoice period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2750">Section 15B(3) prohibits a grocery goods undertaking from directly or indirectly compelling or coercing, whether by threat, promise or any like means, another grocery goods undertaking to make any payment or grant any allowance for the advertising or display of grocery goods.  This is intended to prevent large supermarkets refusing to specially advertise or display new products unless they are paid to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_2751">Section 15B(4) prohibits a retailer from directly or indirectly compelling or coercing, whether by threat, promise or any like means, another grocery goods undertaking to make any payment or grant any allowance to the retailer in consideration of any of the following matters:</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">providing space for grocery goods within a new retail outlet on or within the first 60 days after its opening to the public;</p>
            <p eId="para_2753">providing space for grocery goods within a newly expanded or extended retail outlet on or within the first 60 days after the opening to the public of the expanded or extended part of the outlet;</p>
            <p eId="para_2754">providing space for grocery goods within a retail outlet on or within the first 60 days after its opening to the public under new ownership.</p>
            <p eId="para_2755">All the prohibitions of section 15B are subject to subsection (5) of the section.  This provides that the conduct described in the section will not be prohibited unless it has the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition.  The reason for this proviso is that some of the behaviour referred to is capable of having a pro-competitive effect in certain cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">The Competition Authority is the statutory independent agency responsible for the enforcement of competition law in Ireland.  The Competition Authority's role in relation to alleged breaches of the legislation is to investigate those alleged breaches. The Competition Authority investigates alleged breaches of the legislation either on its own initiative or on receipt of complaints from the public.  If, having conducted an investigation, the Competition Authority believes that there is evidence that a breach of the legislation has occurred, it brings the matter to the Courts, either directly itself or through the Director of Public Prosecutions, depending on the nature of the alleged breach.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">It is the Courts alone that decide whether a breach of the Acts has occurred or not.  There is also a right of private action to the Courts for any person aggrieved in consequence of a breach of the Competition Acts.  I am not aware of any decisions by the Courts in the last three years relating to breaches of the Acts in the grocery goods trade.</p>

            <p eId="para_2761">The formal decision by SR Technics to close the Dublin facility was first conveyed at a meeting on  11 February 2009.  However, I had been aware for some months before that date that the company was engaged in a major review of group operations which would have consequences for the Dublin facility.  IDA had intensified its engagement with the company with a view to assisting the Irish subsidiary to achieve the optimal outcome in the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2762">The Government is anxious that as many jobs as possible are secured at Dublin Airport.  We would like to see the SR Technics Group do what it can to assist  and I have conveyed this and the widespread concern in Ireland that every effort be made to maintain the maximum number of jobs at the facility at Dublin Airport, to SR Technics at Group level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2763">IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have formed a project team to promote the operation through the IDA overseas network of offices and to meet with and assess expressions of interest in the operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2764">There are a number of expressions of interest from different parties in acquiring at least elements of the business and both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are actively exploring options with interested parties.  Time is needed to assess these proposals by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. Actual involvement by IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland in providing financial or other supports will be dependent on a company or companies submitting proposals for consideration and seeking approval for State support in the normal way. It is not proposed to take the Irish operation into public ownership.  The sector operates on the basis of a competitive market and the Dublin operation, whether publicly or privately owned, will have to compete on a level playing field with other companies in the same market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2765">The State Agencies will continue to engage with all groups, indigenous and overseas, interested in building commercially viable and sustainable operations to secure as many of the jobs as possible at Dublin Airport.</p>

         the number of people working in the public service under temporary employment contracts on a fixed term basis who will lose their jobs as a consequence of the non-renewal of those contracts due to the moratorium decision announced by the Minister for Finance on 27 March 2009; the organisations in which such terminations will occur; the number of individuals who will lose their jobs as a consequence of this decision; the annual saving that will accrue to the Exchequer as a consequence of the non-renewal of these contracts; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2767">The moratorium is effective from 27 March 2009 to end 2010. Currently this Department employs 10 people on temporary contracts, which are due to expire on dates between 1 May and end 2009. It had not been anticipated that any of these contracts would be extended but this would have been considered in the context of the Department's business needs, prior to the expiry of each contract. Therefore, none of the people concerned will lose their jobs specifically due to the moratorium. The saving in salaries that would accrue to the Exchequer as a consequence of the non-renewal of these contracts would be €249,592 on a full-year basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2768">IDA Ireland</p>
            <p eId="para_2769">IDA Ireland currently employs 21 people on fixed term contract, all of these posts are affected by the decision.  The estimated saving in salaries would amount to €221,897 in 2009 in respect of 6 posts and €773,605 in 2010 in respect of 15 posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2770">Shannon Development</p>
            <p eId="para_2771">Shannon Development has a total of 9 people on fixed term contract, which will be affected by the decision before the end of 2010.  There is an estimated saving of €253,264, however, as Shannon Development meets its pay and administration costs from own resource income, the savings involved here will not accrue to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2772">Forfás</p>
            <p eId="para_2773">Forfás has 9 staff engaged on a fixed term contract basis. The terms of these contracts will expire over the period 2009-2011.  Those contracts due to expire in 2009 would result in savings in that year of €52,000; annual or full-year savings would amount to €201,000. The contracts due to expire in 2010 would result in a saving of €117,000; the annual or full year savings on these contracts would amount to €234,000.  Savings in 2011 on contracts due to expire would be  €69,000, with annual or full-year savings amounting to €75,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI)</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">There are 10 staff employed in NSAI under a fixed term contract of employment. The salary cost of these 10 individuals and eventual savings in the period in question amounts to €550,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs)</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">It is understood that 2 people across the CEB Network will be affected by this instruction. The salaries for these positions range from €20,001 to €50,000. Enterprise Ireland Enterprise Ireland has 29 staff on fixed term contracts in permanent posts, mainly overseas, where contracts will expire before 31 December 2010.  It is estimate that the non-replacement of these posts could save up to €1.2 million.   Personal Injuries Assessment Board The Personal Injuries Assessment Board has 6 fixed term contractors employed whose contracts are due to expire at varying dates by mid 2010. The savings made will not accrue to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2778">FÁS</p>
            <p eId="para_2779">FÁS currently has 52 staff on fixed term contracts. Forty-one of these staff are due to finish their contracts in 2009 and eleven in 2010. The renewal or otherwise of these contracts would normally be dependent on the prevailing operational requirements. If all contracts were renewed it would represent an additional cost to the organisation of €940,000 in 2009 and €1,800,000 in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2780">Science Foundation Ireland</p>
            <p eId="para_2781">Science Foundation Ireland has 1 member of staff currently serving on contract, this contract will expire before the end of 2010. There will be no savings accruing in 2009 and minimal related savings in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2782">Health &amp; Safety Authority</p>
            <p eId="para_2783">There is one person in the Health and Safety Authority employed on a fixed term contract due to expire in June 2010.  Based on the recent decisions from the Department of Finance this contract will not be renewed.  No savings will accrue to the Authority in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2836">The Financial Regulator has informed me that on 19 October 2001 AIB Capital Markets plc in accordance with the obligations imposed in the Central Bank's Handbook for Investment and Stockbroking firms, submitted a copy of an AIB Group Internal Report entitled "Special Investigation Goodbody Stockbrokers — Trading in AIB Shares" and a copy of a management letter addressed to the Internal Audit Committee of the Board of AIB to the Central Bank. The work related to this report had been undertaken from May to September 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">The report articulated that the arrangements that Goodbody Stockbrokers (Goodbody) had put in place to allow them to trade in AIB shares had not operated in accordance with those previously communicated to the Central Bank and the Irish Stock Exchange. The original arrangements presented were designed to allow Goodbody, as a stockbroker, to trade in AIB shares in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990 which restricted trading by a company in its own shares. The Companies Acts were subsequently amended with effect from 4 August 2001 enabling Goodbody, as stockbroking subsidiary of AIB, to trade AIB shares.</p>
            <p eId="para_2838">Subsequent to the submission of the report the Central Bank met with senior personnel in AIB, as part of its examination of this matter.  I understand that under confidentiality legislation at the time the Central Bank was precluded from passing on information to other parties, including the Minister for Finance. Ultimately significant personnel changes took place in Goodbody.</p>
            <p eId="para_2839">The Financial Regulator has also informed me that the procedure at the time, in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, was for suspicions of money laundering identified by the Bank to be reported to the Garda and I can confirm that all reporting obligations were met by the Central Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_2840">I have not received a copy of the Report or had discussions with the Financial Regulator regarding the Report.</p>

         his views on reducing the €250 donation threshold above which charities can claim tax back in an effort to address the shortfall in funding experienced by charities involved in overseas development.

            <p eId="para_2842">Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 allows tax relief on donations made by either individuals or corporate bodies to eligible charities and other approved bodies, including first and second level schools and third level institutions. The minimum qualifying donation for relief purposes to an eligible charity or approved body is €250 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_2843">Reducing the threshold to allow tax relief on smaller donations, as the Deputy has proposed, could significantly increase the current cost of the scheme to the Exchequer. The relief is already very generous. There is no upper limit on the amount that can be donated generally and relief is granted at the donor's marginal rate of income tax.  Donations can be cumulative, so that a donation of just €5 per week over the course of a year would qualify.</p>
            <p eId="para_2844">The donations scheme was one of the tax reliefs examined as part of the 2005 overall review of tax reliefs and exemptions.  The review concluded that the €250 minimum threshold is serving its purpose and should be retained at its current level, subject to ongoing review. The Deputy may wish to note that the full text of the review can be found on my Department's website at www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/other/revtaxreliefsvol3.pdf.</p>
            <p eId="para_2845">The Commission on Taxation, as part of its remit, is reviewing all existing tax reliefs, including relief under section 848A.  It is expected that the Commission will furnish its report to me at the end of July 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2855">The pension related deduction has been introduced as one of a range of measures required to help address the economic crisis, including the serious imbalance in the Exchequer finances. The deduction applies generally given the fact that public servants enjoy the benefits of a public service pension which provides for greater security and more favourable terms than the generality of private sector pensions.  The deduction is a reasonable means of reconciling the need to achieve the necessary savings while seeking to ameliorate the impact on lower paid staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_2856">On the point raised by the Deputy I would point out that public servants who have paid 40 years contributions continue to enjoy the considerable benefits which are reflected in the pension and lump sum payable on retirement.  In the circumstances I am satisfied that it is fair and appropriate that such public servants pay the pension related deduction.</p>

         when the Revenue Commissioners on-line service will provide an on-line facility for payment of the new income levy for businesses and individuals who make their returns to the Revenue Commissioners through the on-line system; the system used at present by Revenue for calculating the amount of income levy received since its introduction on 1 January 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2858">As the Deputy will be aware the income levy is effective from 1 January 2009. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the arrangements for the introduction of the Income Levy were focused on limiting administrative and compliance costs for employers. Employers incorporate the payment of the Income Levy into the existing monthly form P30 and the Income Levy is included with PAYE tax payments. This mirrors the current arrangements for payment of the Health Levy (and previously the Employment Levy), which is also incorporated in the form P30 and is included with PRSI payments. The monthly apportionment by Revenue between payments of PAYE tax and Income Levy for the 2009 tax year is determined by applying a breakdown formula derived from a tax-forecasting model maintained by Revenue. The precise breakdown between PAYE tax and the Income Levy will be available in the first quarter of 2010 on receipt of the forms P35 from employers. Facilities already exist for businesses to file both the P30 and P35 on-line.</p>
            <p eId="para_2859">A similar approach will be taken in respect of payments of Income Tax and Income Levy for self-assessed individuals for 2009. In calculating their Preliminary Income Tax for 2009, due no later than 31 October 2009, the self-assessed individual will be required to add the income levy to the amount of their income tax payment due. Such taxpayers will pay a single amount and Revenue will apportion the payment between Income tax and Income levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2860">The 2009 tax return for self-assessed taxpayers is not due until 2010. In this context the on-line service for self-assessed individuals to file returns for 2009, providing for a separate calculation of tax and levies due, is expected to be available by 1 January 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2862">The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) have advised me that it is not possible at this stage to quantify the effect of the downgrade on funding costs. Yields have been falling recently from the levels reached in late January and, at this point, the NTMA are of the view that it appears that the effect of the downgrade had already been priced in by the market.</p>

While the rating methodology is public, the agencies do not set targets or criteria for individual countries.  Finally, while losing the AAA rating is disappointing, I would remind the Deputy that prior to October 2001, Ireland was rated AA+ by at least one rating agency.</p>

            <p eId="para_2868">I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 43, 46 and 55 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2869">Public servants who are members of public service pension schemes are liable to pay the pension-related deduction legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. On this basis, third-level researchers on fixed-term and temporary contracts must pay the deduction, since they are members of the relevant occupational pension schemes. They are just one of many groups of non-permanent public servants paying the deduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_2870">Distinctions between public servants on the basis of whether they are permanent or temporary, and if temporary what contract duration applies, are irrelevant insofar as liability to pay the deduction is concerned. The pay of the post, in terms of whether it features incremental progression, is likewise irrelevant.</p>
            <p eId="para_2871">In recent years fixed-term researchers in third-level institutions have been made pensionable, and this has significantly improved the attractiveness of a research career. These researchers accrue pensionable service even for short-duration appointments and that service can be aggregated with past and future service in other pensionable public service employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2872">Section 6 of the Act provides for a refund of the deduction in certain circumstances, and should reassure third-level researchers on short-term non-renewable contracts who have no prior public service employment history and who may be concerned about accruing no pension benefit at the expiry of their contract due to insufficient service. A deduction refund may be payable provided that the departing employee has accrued no benefits under any public service pension scheme, has not received a payment in lieu of scheme membership and has not transferred the service to another public service pension scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2873">Section 8 of the Act grants the Minister for Finance a limited special discretion to exempt groups of public servants from payment of the deduction. Specifically, where he is satisfied that due to exceptional circumstances, a particular class or group of public servants are materially distinguished from other classes or groups who are subject to the deduction, then the Minister may fully or partly exempt this group from paying some or all of the deduction, if he believes it would be fair and equitable to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_2874">The deduction is required at a time of great pressure on the public finances and takes account of the valuable pension benefits available to public servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2875">In light of all the above factors, I am satisfied that it is fair and appropriate that public servants on fixed-term and temporary contracts, including third-level researchers, are subject to the pension-related deduction. In the event that any class or group of public servants makes an appeal for exemption from the deduction under section 8 of the Act then such an appeal will be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_2890">I refer the Deputies to the answer to Question No. 158 of 31 March 2009. The Payment Services Directive (PSD) provides the necessary legal framework to support the development of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), a major payments industry initiative aimed at eliminating any remaining difference between domestic and cross-border payments within the eurozone.  The Directive introduces standard rules for payment execution in all Member States, seeks to ensure fair market access to new payment services providers and introduces harmonised standards of consumer protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_2891">The Directive comes into effect on 1 November 2009 and my Department is currently preparing legislation to enable Ireland to apply the Directive provisions by that date. A set of draft regulations was submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in February 2009 for formal drafting and work is now progressing to produce a final set of regulations, which will give effect to the Directive by the required transposition date.  It is anticipated that the relevant regulations will be published in Summer 2009 and be given effect from 1 November 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2892">As regards the competent authority for the management of the transposition of the Directive into law in Ireland, Section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972 allows me, as Minister, to make Regulations in order to fulfil Ireland's obligations which arise by virtue of our membership of the EU.  In this case, the Directive will be transposed through a Statutory Instrument. The Statutory Instrument will designate a competent authority for the authorisation and prudential supervision of payment institutions, as required by Article 20 of the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2893">My Department consulted relevant stakeholders on two occasions in 2008.  In February 2008, it held a public consultation on the national discretions available within the PSD and in October 2008, it held a further consultation on the draft text of the transposing regulations.  My Department plans to hold another consultation when the text of the regulations is more advanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_2894">I am aware generally that industry participants have sought and received assurances from my Department that the Directive would be transposed in time and officials from my Department and the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland continue to be available to meet relevant stakeholders as necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_2896">Discussions have been progressing satisfactorily with the trustees and administrators of the funded pension schemes of the five older universities and certain non-commercial semi-State bodies (IDA, SFADCo, FÁS, Bord Bia, Irish Goods Council, Arts Council, CERT and a number of regional tourism organisations) which have funded schemes, with a view to providing consistency and clarity for the future in terms of meeting the liabilities of these schemes. This follows consideration some time ago of the pensions difficulties facing those universities by a working group under the Higher Education Authority which recommended such discussions. The liabilities of the funds at the end of 2008 are estimated to be approximately €3bn with the assets valued at €1.7bn at that time. As regards the impact on the public finances, the current classification of these funds under the EUROSTAT rules is such that the transfer of the assets of the universities' funds and the SSB funds established under Trusts would impact positively on the General Government Balance (GGB) when received. The initial revenue and subsequent investment return would be offset in the future by the payment of pension benefits which would be recorded as Government expenditure at the time of payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">The background to this is that all funded schemes must now meet minimum funding standards under EU law unless they are covered by the State. This has presented problems for the universities and non-commercial SSBs with funded pension schemes where the State ultimately carries the liability but where this is not clear enough to warrant exemption under EU law. In that context, it is proposed that the assets of those schemes would be transferred to the State along with the liabilities which would then be met, effectively, by the State on a pay as you go basis in the future. The terms and conditions of the schemes would be no better nor worse than the members would be entitled to anyway. If agreement is reached, legislation to give effect to all this would be required.</p>

            <p eId="para_2899">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the monthly apportionment between payments of PAYE tax and Income Levy for the 2009 tax year is determined by applying a breakdown formula derived from a tax-forecasting model maintained by the Revenue Commissioners. The precise breakdown between PAYE tax and the Income Levy will be available in the first quarter of 2010 on receipt of the forms P35 from employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2900">On this basis, it is estimated that approximately €55m per month has been collected in Income Levy in February and March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2901">A similar approach will be taken in respect of payments of Income Tax and Income Levy that will be made by the self-employed for 2009 (preliminary tax) which is due for payment by 31 October 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2906">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government took the decision to take Anglo Irish Bank into public ownership with effect from 21 January 2009, in order to stabilise the bank and ensure financial stability. This took place in a context where Anglo's funding position had weakened and unacceptable practices in the bank had caused serious reputational damage at a time when overall market sentiment towards Anglo was negative. The Government's decision to take Anglo into public ownership was taken as a final step only after the alternatives for stabilising the position of the bank had been pursued.</p>
            <p eId="para_2907">Certain matters relating to corporate governance at Anglo prior to its being taken into public ownership, are now the subject of ongoing investigations, including by the Financial Regulator and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2908">As I have stated previously, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on or in any way prejudge the outcome of these investigations. However, if the Deputy has information in relation to particular transactions at Anglo Irish Bank which may give cause for concern, I am of course disposed to referring such matters to the Board of Anglo, or the relevant statutory authority, as appropriate, for review.</p>

The amount to be paid in respect of 2009 is €1.584 billion.  The contribution is normally paid quarterly and the payment in respect of the first quarter of 2009 was made in March.</p>

The recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland was effected on Tuesday, 31 March 2009 from the Fund's resources.  The balance of this year's contribution and the further payment of €1.416 billion will be paid to the Fund for the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Bank when that bank has completed the necessary internal procedures to approve the issuance of preference shares.

            <p eId="para_2975">Decisions on awards are made by the Committee for Performance Awards (CPA), which includes a majority of private sector members.  The main roles of the committee are to monitor the application of the scheme of performance-related awards and to bring independent judgement to bear in approving objectives for the persons covered by the scheme and in approving recommendations for awards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2976">Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the schemes, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments — including the Department of Finance — are outlined in the annual reports of the committee.  The Committee's Annual Reports 2006-2008 covering the operation of the scheme in 2005-2007, are available on the Department of Finance website www.finance.gov.ie.  The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information.  I, as Minister, have no role in either the assessment of performances under the scheme or the allocation of individual awards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2977">As the Deputy may be aware, on 5 February last I announced in the Dáil the discontinuation of the scheme for Assistant Secretaries, Deputy Secretary and related grades subject to consultation with the relevant Staff Associations. Therefore no assessments or payments have been made in respect of performances in 2008.</p>

         if, with respect to his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 143 of 31 March 2009, he will set out the interpretation of the Valuation Act 2001 in circumstances in which a sports club has more than one premises, not all of which are licensed; if for the purpose of this Act, one or more properties belonging to the club could be exempted from rates when those properties do not operate a licensed premises; if this is not the case, if he proposes to amend the Act to that effect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2979">At the outset, I might mention that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act, 2001 and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative.  The statute does not accord me, as Minister for Finance, any function in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2980">The position is that the Valuation Act, 2001 provides for the exemption from rates of "Community Halls".  To be a classified as a Community Hall, the premises need to be used for purposes which are not for profit or gain and involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are used for purposes which are of a recreational or otherwise of a social nature.  Many sports clubs achieve exemption from rates under this provision.  However, the Valuation Act, 2001 specifically excludes premises of a club registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904 from this provision.  Therefore, the premises of such a registered club is rateable.  Essentially, this means that clubs licensed to sell alcohol are rateable.  It is important to point out that this exclusion, whereby ‘Registered Clubs' cannot be treated as exempt under the Community Hall provision, has the effect of excluding all premises occupied by the club and not just those premises used for the sale of alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_2981">The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and a licensed sports club is competing with other commercial licensed premises, all of which are rateable.  Therefore, in equity, exemption from rates can only be achieved by the cessation of the club's registration under the 1904 Act.  I have no plans to provide for special treatment of licensed clubs under the Valuation Act, which maintains the long-standing principle that all properties are valued in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2982">I trust that the foregoing explains the position in relation to registered clubs, which form part of the rateable valuation base.  Should a club have concerns regarding the valuation of their property or any part of thereof, including its rateability, they may, on payment of the statutory fee of €250, apply to the Commissioner of Valuation for a revision of the valuation.  If dissatisfied with the outcome, they may appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</p>

            <p eId="para_2984">I presume that the Deputy is referring to the 60% statutory redundancy rebates that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment administer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2985">Taxes paid by employers include tax levied directly on the employer such as income Tax or Corporation Tax but also fiduciary taxes such as PAYE Income Tax, Income Levy or VAT levied on the employees or customers of that employer.

            <p eId="para_2986">In the circumstances and given that there is no provision in taxation, social welfare or health legislation to offset tax liabilities in the manner suggested, it is not possible to offset the 60% statutory redundancy rebates against a tax liability due to Revenue.</p>

            <p eId="para_3036">The pension related deduction applies to income earned by public servants on or after 1 March 2009.  Should any over-deductions have been made in individual cases in respect of industrial action taken prior to that date, such deductions would fall to be restored in line with normal practice.</p>

         if, in the context of correspondence (details supplied), he will ensure that small businesses do not suffer additional burdens in the forthcoming budget, such as increasing the price of diesel, which could be extremely damaging to such small and medium-sized businesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3441">I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 103 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3442">In 2008 the Women's Health Council published a report on Female Genital Mutilation.  The Council's research found no evidence that Female Genital Mutilation is being carried out in Ireland among migrant ethnic communities now living here.</p>
            <p eId="para_3443">A National Action Plan to Address Female Genital Mutilation, drawn up by non-governmental organisations and statutory agencies including the HSE, was launched on 25th November 2008.  The Report indicated that there are 2,585 women living in Ireland who have undergone Female Genital Mutilation.  I understand that since then the HSE has had a number of meetings with AkiDwa, the African and Migrant Women's Health Network in Ireland with a view to establishing a National Working Group to implement the recommendations of the National Action Plan, including the recommendation that a uniform data collection system be established to record incidence/prevalence of FGM in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3444">My Department is currently working with the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (COSC) and other relevant agencies in the preparation of a National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  The Strategy will set out the general vision, objectives and actions to tackle these issues.  Female Genital Mutilation will be among the gender-based violence issues which the Strategy will address.</p>
            <p eId="para_3445">Legal advice which I obtained in 2004 strongly indicated that Female Genital Mutilation would constitute an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_3446">In September 2006, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in its concluding observations on Ireland's second period report urged Ireland to continue its efforts to end the practice of Female Genital Mutilation through, inter alia, prohibiting it by law.  I am currently examining the question of introducing specific legislation to ban the practice in the content of the UNCRC's recommendations.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Mary Wallace)</from>
            <p eId="para_3455">Food labelling is currently governed by Council Directive 2000/13/EC, transposed in 2002, with several amendments since.  This applies to the labelling of prepackaged foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer or for supply to mass caterers.  The principle underlying this Directive is that the purchaser must not be misled and it has helped to ensure that the consumer is provided with the information required to make healthy consumption choices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3456">In January 2008, the European Commission presented its proposals on updating and harmonising this legislation.  The proposal is still under discussion.  This proposal consolidates existing legislation in the area of food labelling and introduces, inter alia, new provisions for Country of Origin Labelling, a mandatory nutrition declaration and allergen labelling.</p>
            <p eId="para_3457">In November 2008, Ireland submitted its position paper on the proposal.  This paper was informed by submissions made to the FSAI by many of the key stakeholders.  Ireland's position will be further informed by the outcome of an FSAI Consumer Survey, to be completed in June 2009.  In its position paper, Ireland supports mandatory Country of Origin Labelling; shares the concerns of a significant number of other member states with regard  to National Schemes; welcomes the proposal for mandatory allergen labelling and supports the highlighting of allergens on labels; supports the equal treatment of all alcohol products; asks that consideration should be given to bringing alcohol products into the scope of the legislation; supports the retention of the Commission's proposal with regard to the use of "per portion" expression alone in certain cases, and does not support the proposal for a minimum font size of 3mm for display of mandatory particulars and suggests that other aids to legibility, such as contrasting background, be explored.</p>
            <p eId="para_3458">Since January 2008 a number of meetings have taken place at European Union Working Group level, attended by officials from Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The next meeting is due to take place on 27 April 2009.  On 16th March 2009, the European Parliament examined the proposal.  Parliament has indicated, however, that it will not be in a position to conduct the first reading of the document until after the May European Parliament elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_3459">At this stage, it is likely that the proposal will not be finalised until end of 2009 at the earliest.</p>

            <p eId="para_3464">I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 86, 92 and 104 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3465">The Adoption Bill 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, was published on Friday 23rd January.</p>
            <p eId="para_3466">Under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries which have also ratified the Hague Convention, and countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement which meets Hague standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3467">While it is true to say that our current Agreement with Vietnam is based on Hague principles, as part of the preparations for our new legislation we need to ensure that our Agreement reflects the Hague Convention as comprehensively as possible.  A new Agreement allows the opportunity to elaborate and strengthen some existing provisions to meet the standards which have been set in draft legislation.  There have been considerable developments in inter-country adoption in Vietnam since the Agreement was signed 5 years ago.  This progress also needs to be reflected in any new Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3468">In December 2008, the Irish Government issued a formal request to the Vietnamese Authorities stating that we wish to enter into discussions immediately for the purpose of negotiating a new Agreement to follow on from the existing Agreement which will expire on 1 May 2009.  The Vietnamese Authorities have responded positively to Ireland's request.</p>
            <p eId="para_3469">Ireland offered to provide the Vietnamese Authorities with the text of a draft agreement as a basis for negotiations.  A draft bilateral agreement for inter-country adoption was delivered on 6 March, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, to the Vietnamese Authorities for their consideration.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Vietnamese Government have invited a delegation from Ireland to discuss the provisions of the draft agreement provided.  The delegation will travel in the coming weeks for an intensive round of discussions on the draft agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3470">I would like to again reiterate my personal commitment and the commitment of the Government to conclude an agreement with Vietnam.</p>
            <p eId="para_3471">As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has a long and positive relationship with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam but I must also emphasise the need to respect the authority of that jurisdiction, having regard to the sensitive nature of discussions regarding inter-country adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_3472">The work to prepare for and advise the Government on this issue and the implementation of Government's decisions is being given the highest priority.  These are complex matters which require careful consideration.  At all times, the Minister and the Government, and officials advising them, are guided by the need to respect and protect the best interests and rights of the child.</p>

            <p eId="para_3487">Under the new arrangements effected by the Health Act 2008, a much simplified system of assessment for eligibility was introduced in respect of persons aged 70 or over, based on the significantly higher gross income thresholds rather than the standard net income limits.  The gross income thresholds are €700 per week for a single person and €1,400 for a couple, as against net income limits of €201.50 for a single person and €298 for a couple.  Under the net income assessment system, allowance may be made for rent/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  However, these would not be a factor for the vast majority of older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_3488">Where a person aged 70 or over does not qualify for a medical card by virtue of their gross income being over the specified thresholds, the person may apply to the HSE for a medical card or GP visit card under the existing net income thresholds.</p>

            <p eId="para_3498">Since the enactment of legislation and regulations giving prescriptive authority to nurses and midwives in May 2007, the Health Service Executive has funded 248 nurses and midwives to undertake the six-month education programme provided in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and University College Cork.  These nurses and midwives are from 61 clinical areas and 83 health service providers across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3499">The regulation of prescribing is twin track.  In addition to provisions set out in the 2007 regulations An Bord Altranais, whose key functions include registration and regulation of nurses and midwives in Ireland,  has devised a registration and notification process and has introduced practice standards for nurses and midwives with prescriptive authority.  In order to prescribe a registered nurse or midwife must have successfully completed the approved education programme, have the appropriate clinical experience, be registered with An Bord Altranais as a Registered Nurse Prescriber, and have authority from the employing health service provider to prescribe a range of medicinal products within her/his scope of practice.  To date a total of 70 nurses and midwives throughout the Health Service Executive have registered with An Bord Altranais and have the authority to prescribe medicinal products.  This group are from a diversity of health service providers and clinical areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3500">I am satisfied that significant progress has been made in relation to the introduction of nurse/midwife prescribing.  Improving patient care is at the heart of this initiative with patients receiving earlier interventions and therefore a better service.  Since the first Registered Nurse Prescriber wrote the first prescription in January 2008, Registered Nurse Prescribers in 20 health service providers in the Health Service Executive reported writing 2962   prescriptions for 2485 patients involving 4300 individual medicinal products.</p>
            <p eId="para_3501">I would also like to announce that following a comprehensive tendering process the Health Service Executive has engaged a team from University College Dublin to conduct an independent external review of nurse prescribing.  The team commenced its work in January 2009 and is expected to report  by the end of June 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_3507">There have also been significant improvements to the physical infrastructure at St. Vincent's Hospital as the national adult tertiary referral centre for patients with cystic fibrosis.

            <p eId="para_3512">Final decisions on the operation in 2009 of the structured programme of youth cafes in are still under consideration.  At this stage, the focus of my Office is to bring greater coherence to the approach taken to date, retaining the strong inter-agency element and identifying appropriate models for the future development of youth cafés.  Since September 2007 my Office has undertaken a small survey of some of the existing cafés looking at mission/objectives, management and organisation, service levels and the role of young people. Following that survey the National Children's Advisory Council (NCAC) was requested to advise on the development of a youth café model. Research was carried out by the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) and a draft report has been forwarded to me for my consideration. This work will ensure that funding is targeted and co-ordinated most effectively on a model or models of youth cafés which meet the needs of young people themselves.  It will also ensure that any funding that may be available will augment without displacing existing inter-agency resources. The NUIG has also been requested to prepare a toolkit and guide to support groups setting up youth cafés. This will be a "how to" guide which will deal with issues such as guiding principles, practical operational matters and provide advice and tips on the day to day management and ongoing development of a café as well as setting up cafes. A draft of the ‘toolkit' is currently being finalised. I intend to launch the NUI Galway Youth Café report and the toolkit along with the announcement on the advancing the youth café programme in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_3546">I presume the Deputy is referring to a 24 hour social work service for children. The Government and the HSE remain committed to the development of a comprehensive needs-based service for children at risk. I personally chair regular meetings between officials from my Office and senior child welfare and protection managers in the HSE aimed at improving the provision of services to children at risk.  A key component of these discussions has been the provision of out of hours care.</p>
            <p eId="para_3547">In this context, the HSE is now putting in place a standardised national system whereby Gardaí can access an appropriate place of safety for children found to be at risk out of hours under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. This service will conform with Child Care Regulations and with the National Foster Care Standards. The provision of this service aims to ensure that children presenting as ‘at risk' outside of normal working hours are provided with an appropriate emergency place of safety thereby reducing or eliminating social admissions of children in an acute hospital setting. Foster families are currently being recruited with a view to commencing the service on or before 1 June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3548">In addition, and instead of developing a stand alone social work out of hours service, it has been agreed to develop alternative proposals based on a more integrated approach which builds on the HSE's existing out of hours services including GPs, acute hospital services and mental health services.  This should provide a more effective and integrated service by using existing resources and strengthening the links between services such as mental health and social work to appropriately address incidents occurring outside usual working hours. The aim is to ensure that persons seeking personal social services outside normal working hours can be provided with appropriate advice, information, support and, in emergency situations, access to specialist staff, such as staff working in the areas of mental health and suicide prevention.</p>

            <p eId="para_3709">Under the new arrangements effected by the Health Act 2008, a much simplified system of assessment for eligibility was introduced in respect of persons aged 70 and over, based on gross income rather than net income, as applies otherwise for means-testing of eligibility for medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3710">The simplified approach taken for persons aged 70 and over who held a medical card prior to 31st December 2008 is close to a self-assessment system.  In introducing the measures, I emphasised my belief in the honesty and integrity of the vast majority of older persons in our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_3711">Long-standing provisions of the Health Act 1970, as amended, continue to apply.  For instance, under Section 49(1) there is a requirement for a person to notify the HSE of any change in his/her circumstances which would render him/her ineligible for services.  In addition, under Section 50, when a person has obtained a service and it is later ascertained that he/she was not entitled to the service, the HSE may charge the individual for any services provided to him/her for the period for which he/she had no entitlement.  Failure to notify the HSE or the use of a service one is not entitled to is an offence on summary conviction.</p>
            <p eId="para_3712">Where a person aged 70 or over does not qualify for a medical card by virtue of their gross income being over the specified thresholds, he/she may apply to the HSE for a medical card or GP visit card under the existing net income thresholds, which allow for medical, nursing and other relevant expenses to be taken into account (The net weekly income thresholds for a medical card are €201.50 (single person) and €298 (couple) and for a GP visit card are €302 (single person) and €447 (couple).</p>
            <p eId="para_3713">Notwithstanding the above, the HSE may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for himself/herself and any dependants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3714">Persons who are in any way confused by the new scheme are encouraged to seek advice from their local health office which will continue to provide any necessary support, and which along with the HSE National Helpline (1850 24 1850), will handle enquiries from clients in respect of their medical card entitlements.</p>

            <p eId="para_3718">Under the new arrangements effected by the Health Act 2008, a much simplified system of assessment for eligibility was introduced in respect of persons aged 70 and over, based on gross income rather than net income, as applies otherwise for means-testing of eligibility for medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3719">The simplified approach taken for persons aged 70 and over who held a medical card prior to 31st December 2008 is close to a self-assessment system.  In introducing the measures, I emphasised my belief in the honesty and integrity of the vast majority of older persons in our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_3720">Long-standing provisions of the Health Act 1970, as amended, continue to apply.  For instance, under Section 49(1) there is a requirement for a person to notify the HSE of any change in his/her circumstances which would render him/her ineligible for services.  In addition, under Section 50, when a person has obtained a service and it is later ascertained that he/she was not entitled to the service, the HSE may charge the individual for any services provided to him/her for the period for which he/she had no entitlement.  Failure to notify the HSE or the use of a service one is not entitled to is an offence on summary conviction.</p>
            <p eId="para_3721">Where a person aged 70 or over does not qualify for a medical card by virtue of their gross income being over the specified thresholds, he/she may apply to the HSE for a medical card or GP visit card under the existing net income thresholds, which allow for medical, nursing and other relevant expenses to be taken into account (The net weekly income thresholds for a medical card are €201.50 (single person) and €298 (couple) and for a GP visit card are €302 (single person) and €447 (couple).</p>
            <p eId="para_3722">Notwithstanding the above, the HSE may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for himself/herself and any dependants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3723">Persons who are in any way confused by the new scheme are encouraged to seek advice from their local health office which will continue to provide any necessary support, and which along with the HSE National Helpline (1850 24 1850), will handle enquiries from clients in respect of their medical card entitlements.</p>

            <p eId="para_3725">Following enactment of the Health Act 2008, the Health Service Executive (HSE) wrote to all medical card holders aged 70 years and over in January 2009.  Persons who were in receipt of a medical card on a non means tested basis were requested, if over the income limits set out in the Act, to make a declaration to the Executive, on or before the 2nd March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3726">To-date, 19,954 medical cards for persons aged 70 and over have been returned or removed from the medical card register.  10,690 of these cards were returned to the HSE by persons aged 70 or over whose weekly income was in excess of the specified thresholds and a further 9,264 medical cards were removed from the medical card register as part of a data quality exercise, where for example, the HSE had been advised that the card holder is deceased or the card holder was not known at the address, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_3727">If card holders have been removed from the HSE's medical card register where they have not declared to the HSE that they are in excess of the specified thresholds, they should contact their Local Health Office immediately and as soon as the details can be confirmed, their General Medical Services eligibility will be restored.  Local Health Offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process, and along with the National Helpline (1850 24 1850), will deal with enquiries from clients in respect of their medical card entitlements and completion of application forms.</p>

            <p eId="para_3751">I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3752">The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible, in an effective and efficient way.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, so that people can have confidence in the services and the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_3753">The HSE has commissioned a number of reviews in relation to how acute hospital services should be organised, including the Teamwork/Horwath Report in relation to the Mid-West region, which the Executive has recently published. The Report highlights the need for changes to be made in the provision and organisation of acute hospital services across the region, particularly in relation to accident and emergency services, critical care, acute surgery and medicine. The Report found that the services were too fragmented, carried increased risks for patients and staff and were not sustainable in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3754">The HSE has indicated that certain changes to the present arrangements for the provision of some acute services, including accident and emergency services, must be made, in the interests of patient safety and also to make best use of the clinical resources available within the Mid West region.  The HSE has been engaged in a consultation process with key stakeholders as it formulates detailed plans in relation to emergency care, critical care and surgical services in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_3755">The HSE plans involve the reorganisation of the arrangements in Ennis and Nenagh so that these hospitals provide an urgent care/minor injuries service for 12 hours a day as part of a regional Accident and Emergency structure. These hospitals will also continue to admit appropriate medical cases. Protocols are in place to ensure that all trauma, paediatric and obstetric emergency cases will be brought directly to the major tertiary centre rather than the local hospital. As part of the new arrangements the ambulance services in North Tipperary and Clare have been enhanced and  an advanced 24-hour paramedic service is in operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3756">The plans also involve the reconfiguration of Acute Hospital services into a network and their better integration with primary care services across the region, with a regional centre at the Regional Hospital Limerick that will deal with complex and specialist cases.  The changing nature of health service delivery is such that smaller hospitals can meet much of the demand for less complex services, especially those that are increasingly done on a day case basis.  Day surgery and diagnostic service activity at Nenagh and Ennis will also be significantly enhanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_3757">I am satisfied that the measures being taken by the HSE are necessary and appropriate in order to ensure the provision of safe and effective health services to the people of the Mid West region. My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the detailed operational issues raised.</p>

This has also had a positive impact on processing times.  The average processing time from application to decision for the generality of valid applications for certificates of naturalisation is now at 23 months.  The Citizenship Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2007. Applications for certificates of naturalisation have been received from nationals of 181 countries.</p>

Therefore, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of Citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  The procedures involved have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.</p>

            <p eId="para_3868">Further processing of applications for naturalisation currently commences after 18 months on average.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months.  This is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years.  In 1999 there were 739 applications whereas in 2008, the number of such applications was 10,885.  An element of cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale and more complicated cases can at times take more than the current average.  In many cases outside the average timescale, delays can be due to the non-return of important information by the applicant themselves or can be due to outside agencies with which we liaise being required to conduct more intensive investigations to resolve the merits of an application.</p>

            <p eId="para_3877">The Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements under Part 2 of the Act.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any sex offenders who enter the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3878">An Garda Síochána has a system in place for the monitoring of persons subject to these requirements.  The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit monitors and manages the notification provisions.  The Unit maintains all information relating to persons who have obligations under the Act.  There is a nominated Garda Inspector in each Garda Division who has responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the requirements of the Act in their Division.  As soon as the Domestic Violence and Assault Investigation Unit is advised by a relevant authority, such as the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service or a foreign law enforcement agency, of the impending release or movement of sex offenders into their area this information is immediately passed to the nominated Inspectors, who are advised of information relevant to their Division.

Notification is made at any Garda Divisional or District headquarters and may be done so in person or by post.  Thereafter offenders must, within seven days of the event, notify the Garda of any subsequent changes to their name or address.  Offenders who leave the State for an intended continuous period of seven days or more must inform the Garda in advance of their leaving.</p>

            <p eId="para_3882">Under the Refugee Act 1996, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications and appeals in respect of refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.  These offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3883">I am informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that the guidelines for staff dealing with the investigation of applications for asylum regarding the use of Wikipedia are that it should not be used as a primary or reliable information source and the information available on Wikipedia cannot be relied upon.</p>
            <p eId="para_3884">I am informed by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal that Members of the Tribunal take account of best international practice and the jurisprudence of the High Court when assessing country of origin information and that Members have been advised that Wikipedia should not be used as a primary or reliable source of country of origin information. In this regard the Deputy should be aware that an appellant is entitled to provide to the Tribunal any country of origin information he/she so wishes to support his/her own case and the Tribunal must consider it.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3889">I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 to 164, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3890">The persons to whom the Deputy refers are failed asylum seekers.  This applicant and her daughters applied for asylum on 21 January 2005.  Following a full and detailed consideration of their applications by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and an unsuccessful appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, they were refused declarations of refugee status on 2 September 2005.  Following a full and detailed examination of her and her daughters' files, pursuant to section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, Deportation Orders were signed in respect of the applicant and her daughters on 23 November 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_3891">The Refugee Act, 1996 (Section 19) makes provision for the protection of the identity of asylum seekers throughout the period during which the asylum application is being investigated.  Under this particular provision, the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, the Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their respective officers must take all practicable steps to ensure that the identity of asylum applicants is kept confidential.</p>
            <p eId="para_3892">This clearly prevents any enquiries or investigations being made in the country of origin of asylum applicants.  The legislation also states that no matter likely to lead members of the public to identify a person as an applicant under the Act can be published without the consent of the person.</p>
            <p eId="para_3893">The validity of the Deportation Orders was challenged by way of judicial review. Following a full hearing in the High Court, Mr. Justice Feeney refused all relief sought and upheld the validity of the Deportation Orders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3894">The applicant and her daughters made an application pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006, S.I no. 518 of 2006, requesting my predecessor to exercise discretion to accept and consider an application for subsidiary protection applications from them. This application was refused. The applicant then challenged by way of judicial review the decision of my predecessor to refuse to exercise discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006, S.I no. 518 of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3895">Following a full hearing in the High Court, all reliefs sought were refused by Mr. Justice McGovern and the validity of the decision was upheld.  The applicant has appealed the judgement of Mr. Justice McGovern to the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_3896">The applicants lodged an application to the European Court of Human Rights under Article 34 of the European Convention of Human Rights and Rules 45 and 47 of the Rules of the Court.  The applicants sought a declaration that their rights under Articles 3, 6, 13 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated.</p>
            <p eId="para_3897">The total costs of the enquiry referred to by the Deputy are subject to the normal civil service travel and subsistence rates and have not yet been fully invoiced.</p>
            <p eId="para_3898">As the other matters raised are either sub judice or speculative, I do not propose to comment any further.</p>

            <p eId="para_3902">The first, second and third named persons, a husband, wife and dependant child, applied for asylum in the State on 5 September 2005. The third named person was included in her mother's asylum application.  The fourth named person was born in the State in late 2005 and was subsequently included in her mother's asylum application.  As the immigration case histories and up to date positions of the two adult asylum applications are almost identical, for the purposes of the Deputy's Question, I will deal with the two cases as one.</p>
            <p eId="para_3903">The applications for asylum of the persons concerned were refused following individual consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the first and second named persons concerned were informed, by separate letters dated 19 March 2009, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them and their two children.  They were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they and their children should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, they were notified of their entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</p>
            <p eId="para_3904">The 15 working day period referred to in my Department's letter of 19 March 2009 expires on 16 April 2009.  It is open to the persons concerned to submit written representations and/or apply for Subsidiary Protection within that period. In any event, final decisions on their cases will not be made prior to the expiry of the 15 working day period referred to above.</p>

            <p eId="para_3913">Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 20 May 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.</p>
            <p eId="para_3914">By correspondence dated 10 June 2008, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the person concerned by her legal representative. Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The person concerned and her legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 3 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3915">Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 12 March 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post which obliges the person concerned to leave the State. To this end, the person concerned is required to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday 14 April 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3916">I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified. The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>

Representations were submitted by the first named person concerned at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_3980">The Deputy may be aware that the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2004 made significant changes to the Civil Service Superannuation Scheme.  That Act increased to 55 the minimum age at which superannuation benefits may be paid to ‘new entrants' to the Prison Service.  Whilst the compulsory retirement age for members of the Prison Service remains unchanged at 60 years, staff who entered the Irish Prison Service prior to 2004, can retire with full pension entitlements at age 50 provided they have 30 years actual prison service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3981">Having set out the current provisions I am assuming that the Deputy is seeking information on Prison Officers who applied to retire before reaching 50 years and, accordingly, details of officers who may have retired early on grounds of ill health have not been incorporated in the reply. The Director General of the Prison Service informs me that there have been no applications for early retirement in the last 12 months and no early retirement applications are being processed at the current time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3982">I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for the Irish Prison Service to predict, with any degree of certainty, what  level  of application(s) may or may not  be made for early retirement over the next 12 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_4005">Following the decentralisation of the Citizenship Division to Tipperary Town, substantially increased resources have been made available to it in order to reduce backlogs and provide a better quality service to all applicants. This has also had a positive impact on processing times. The average processing time from application to decision for the generality of valid applications for certificates of naturalisation is now at 23 months. The Citizenship Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4006">The Deputy will appreciate that a certificate of naturalisation is an exceptional and important document that facilitates a non-national becoming a citizen of Ireland. Therefore, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of Citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. The procedures involved have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.</p>

         his plans for the future of St. Patrick’s Institution; and his policy in regard to youth offenders. 
        [14615/09]

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_829">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4010">As the Deputy will be aware the Irish Youth Justice Service was established as an executive office within my Department to develop an integrated response to youth offending. That Office has published a National Youth Justice Strategy  for the period 2008-2010 in which the vision for managing youth offending is clearly set out.</p>
            <p eId="para_4011">In relation to St Patrick's Institution I would point out that whilst it is currently the designated detention centre for young male offenders aged between 16 and 21 years of age, the Irish Youth Justice Service will ultimately  take responsibility for the detention facilities for all boys under 18 years. In that regard construction of the new National Children Detention Facilities is scheduled to take place on a phased basis so as to ensure the continued operation of the existing children detention facilities. It is anticipated that phase 1 should be completed by end 2012 and phase 2 by end 2014. The Deputy will be aware, however, that tendering for the construction of the new facilities will be subject to Government approval and to the necessary funding being made available.</p>
            <p eId="para_4012">In the interim, the separation of children and young adults in St. Patrick's Institution has taken place in so far as is possible, given the physical limitations of the St. Patrick's site.  The Special School (B Division) was opened in April 2007 specifically for this purpose.  It has a bed capacity of 44 and is self contained.  Inmates aged 16 and 17 now have a residential area, communal dining area, and education, work training and recreational areas that are separate from young adults.  This has created a separate and enhanced regime for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_4013">When the number of such prisoners exceeds 44, priority is given to the 16-year-olds, and those 17-year-olds who cannot be accommodated in the Special School are accommodated in the drug-free D Division of the main institution.  A small number of 17-year-olds with specific individual needs are kept in the young adult part of the institution.  These include sex offenders and vulnerable inmates who, for their own protection, are accommodated separately.</p>
            <p eId="para_4014">The new prison facilities at Thornton will have a separate, self-contained, stand alone accommodation unit for 16/17 year old male offenders.  The accommodation is being provided as an interim measure pending the provision of the additional accommodation by the Irish Youth Justice Service.</p>

            <p eId="para_4022">Section 113 of the Act provides that where a court is satisfied of the guilt of a child and that the appropriate way of dealing with the case is to make a compensation order, it may order that the compensation be paid by the parent or guardian of the child instead of the child.  Section 114 of the Act provides that a parent or guardian may be ordered by the court to enter into a recognisance to exercise proper and adequate control over their child.  If the child is found guilty of another offence as a result of said parent or guardian failing to exercise such control, the parent or guardian would forfeit the recognisance.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4187">One of the priorities I have set for An Garda Síochána in 2009 is the targeting of serious crime, in particular organised, gun and drug related crime.  The Garda Policing Plan for 2009 contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in criminality.</p>
            <p eId="para_4188">Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2005 to deal with serious crime, including murder and other violent crime, and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary focus of the Operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.</p>
            <p eId="para_4189">Under Operation Anvil, up to 22 March, 2009, 2,400 firearms have been recovered.  There have also been over 7,000 arrests for serious crimes such as murder, serious assault, robbery and burglary and over 70,000 searches for weapons, drugs and stolen goods.  An Garda Síochána will continue to address the issue of illegal guns relentlessly through Operation Anvil.</p>
            <p eId="para_4190">I am determined that the highest priority will continue to be given to frontline policing.  Funding for Operation Anvil will increase in 2009 to €21 million from €20 million in 2008.  Other key operations will be maintained through 2009, and I am determined that any savings that have to be made will not be allowed to diminish frontline policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_4191">Since my appointment as Minister, I have expressed concern at the number of handguns which have been licensed here in recent years.  Some time ago, I directed my Department and An Garda Síochána to carry out an urgent and intensive review of the firearms law.  Following that review, I have brought forward proposals for strengthening the  law.  These include no new licences being issued for handguns, subject to limited exceptions in relation to Olympic sports.  Existing licences will not be renewed unless applicants fully meet the requirements of a radically tightened licensing procedure where the safety of the community will be paramount.  While a de facto ban on new handgun licences is already in place, my proposals will also be given legislative form in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_4192">Work is also underway in my Department on other legislation which will assist in tackling criminal gangs, including legislation on covert surveillance, retention of telecommunications data and forensic sampling.</p>
            <p eId="para_4193">A significant element of the fight against organised crime by An Garda Síochána is the use of specialist units.  Units with expertise in specific areas operate under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the National Support Services, who has overall responsibility for the coordination of measures designed to address organised crime throughout the State. Specialist units include: the Criminal Assets Bureau which identifies and targets funds accumulated by criminals in order to seize such assets and deprive them of the profits of their criminal activity;  the Organised Crime Unit which has a specific remit of targeting those suspected of involvement in organised crime, including the trafficking, importation, sale and supply of drugs; the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation which is responsible for the investigation of individuals and organisations involved in Money Laundering; and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation which is responsible for investigating the activities of organised criminal networks; and the National Drugs Unit and dedicated Divisional and District Drugs Unit. These units are also supported by the Garda Security and Intelligence Section which assists with the provision of intelligence briefings and timely information.</p>
            <p eId="para_4194">An Garda Síochána also maintains close liaison with other law enforcement agencies throughout Europe and elsewhere, exchanging information and intelligence, which has led to a number of successful joint operations.  An Garda Síochána currently has a number of liaison officers on secondment to other jurisdictions and to other international bodies such as Interpol and Europol.  Through these officers information is passed between law enforcement agencies to ensure that national borders are not, and cannot, be used by criminals as a means of frustrating law enforcement agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4195">An Garda Síochána follows an integrated approach involving the coordinated use of Garda resources and using criminal legislation to its fullest extent. Developments are kept under constant review by senior Garda management.</p>

            <p eId="para_4202">I presume the Deputy is referring to young persons under 18 years of age who have come into conflict with the law when he mentions "young criminals". The Children Act 2001, as amended, provides the framework for dealing with children who come into conflict with the law. Comprehensive statistics on the number of children who have come into conflict with the law in 2008 are not readily available. However much of the detail requested by the Deputy is available for 2007 and earlier years in the annual reports of the Committee Appointed to Monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme as set out in Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended. The Report for 2007 was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 18 December 2008. The reports for the years 2004 to 2007 are also readily available on the Irish Youth Justice Service website (www.iyjs.ie).</p>
            <p eId="para_4203">In February this year, the Central Statistics Office published a report on Garda Recorded Crime Statistics 2003-2007.

This report is available on the Central Statistics Office website (www.cso.ie).In the time available it has not been possible to collate the balance of the information requested by the Deputy. I will communicate further with the Deputy when the information sought is to hand.</p>

            <p eId="para_4205">I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have no reason to believe that organised criminal gangs in Ireland are supplying firearms for criminal purposes to persons in other jurisdictions.</p>

            <p eId="para_4208">Where intelligence, supported by evidence, is available, law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions put operations in place, as appropriate, to prevent and detect such criminality.  Where information exists that a person who is wanted in relation to a particular crime in this jurisdiction is living abroad and the relevant legal requirements are met, a European Arrest Warrant is applied for or extradition is sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_4209">Operations against organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are undertaken on an ongoing basis.

            <p eId="para_4215">I am informed by the Garda Authorities that membership of organised crime gangs tends to be fluid and the nature of criminal activity is such that offences committed by members of gangs may or may not be connected with the individual's membership of such gangs. The identification of offenders as members of a criminal gang is not an essential factor in the prosecution of offences. It is not therefore possible to ascertain the precise number of criminals who are also members of criminal gangs operating in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4216">With regard to criminal gangs, I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that currently there are two categories of organised crime groups operating within this jurisdiction. The first category consists of individuals/groups that are well established and tightly structured and are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences. The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures, and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland. Organised criminal gangs operating in Ireland  are targeted by the Gardaí on an ongoing basis using Intelligence-led operations undertaken by specialist units of An Garda Síochána, under the remit of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services. These units include the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Organised Crime Unit, and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_4217">The Gardaí also use a multi-agency approach, whereby all of the National Units from National Support Services act in a coordinated manner. These units are also supported by the Security and Intelligence Section who assist with intelligence briefings and the provision of timely information.</p>
            <p eId="para_4218">I am further advised that information on organised crime groups is disseminated to Europol on a regular basis. An Garda Síochána liaises with other law enforcement agencies throughout Europe and elsewhere, exchanging information and intelligence on Irish criminals living abroad. This has led to a number of successful joint operations targeting attempted importation of drugs and firearms resulting in a number of significant arrests here and in other jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4219">An Garda Síochána adopts best practice by coordinating Garda resources and using the available criminal legislation to its fullest extent. This approach is being closely monitored and kept under constant review by senior Garda management in conjunction with Regional Assistant Commissioners and heads of units.</p>

We therefore aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is appropriately represented in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums. Over the past three years, Ireland has been represented in 62 election observation missions, involving more than 270 Irish observers. The missions have been organised primarily by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

            <p eId="para_4251">When a request for electoral observation is received, suitably qualified volunteers are contacted, taking into account their place on the roster and any specific criteria for the mission, including relevant language proficiency. Following completion of the internal selection process, a draft list of nominees is submitted for Ministerial approval. The roster is updated as each mission is completed, to ensure that all registered volunteers have an opportunity to participate in a mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_4252">In the case of European Union election observation missions, all candidate observers must register with the European Commission as well as with Irish Aid.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_4277">The practice of female genital mutilation is a clear violation of the human rights of women and girls. Furthermore, it infringes on children's rights to special protections, it has serious social, health and psychological consequences, and it perpetuates negative gender-based stereotypes. The World Health Organisation estimates that between 100 million and 140 million girls and women worldwide are currently living with the consequences of female genital mutilation. In Africa alone, three million girls are at risk annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_4278">The Government is active in global policy development, funding and research to address this appalling practice. We recognise that it is a form of gender-based violence, and that it is an important element in our comprehensive approach to tackling such violence, through our aid programme. The Government's 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid includes a firm commitment that Ireland will build its support for measures focused on preventing and responding to gender-based violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_4279">Through Irish Aid, the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Government was a co-founder of the Joint Consortium on Gender Based Violence, in which we remain an active member. It brings together representatives from Irish Aid, the Defences Forces, and Irish development, humanitarian and human rights Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in order to promote a coherent and coordinated response to all forms of gender based violence, including female genital mutilation.    The Government has increased its funding in this area in recent years, from €110,000 in 2005 to €2.6 million in 2007. Irish Aid's funding guidelines for NGOs have been revised to highlight gender-based violence as a priority for the aid programme. In addition, the Government's agreements with a number of United Nations Funds, Programmes and other agencies include specific commitments to addressing gender-based violence. The Government engages with a number of organisations working to achieve the ending of the practice of female genital mutilation and supporting victims, including a range of UN agencies and Irish NGOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4280">The Government has also provided funding for an important joint programme on female genital mutilation undertaken by the UN Population Fund and the UN Children's Fund, with the aim of achieving the ending of the practice in seventeen countries by 2012. While this programme focuses on promoting social change, it also includes support for victims of the practice through the integration of its implications into reproductive health strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4281">We recognise that the achievement of significant progress on gender-based violence is integral to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. This includes progress on the ending of the practice of female genital mutilation, which will have direct implications for the empowerment of women, the improvement of maternal health, the reduction of child mortality, and ultimately the reduction of poverty, which remains the overarching priority of our aid programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4283">A number of programmes operating in my Department provide funding to community and voluntary sector organisations: the Reconciliation Fund for North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation; the Emigrant Support Programme; the Communicating Europe Initiative and the Irish Aid programme, Ireland's programme of official development assistance. Funding under these programmes is provided on an annual basis, with the exception of the Irish Aid programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4284">A significant part of the Irish Aid programme is provided on a multi-annual basis. International donors, including Ireland, are agreed that predictability of aid is vital if countries and organisations are to manage their development programmes effectively.    In this context, Irish Aid provides multi-annual funding to a number of Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) with a proven capacity to operate within a clear set of policies, an agreed budget and programme of work and a rigorous monitoring and reporting framework. Such funding is provided through a number of channels, including the Multi Annual Programme Scheme (MAPS), which has been internationally recognised for its innovative approach to sustainable development funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_4285">Five major Irish NGOs receive MAPS support from the Government: Concern, Trócaire, Goal, Christian Aid and Self Help Africa.   Since 2006, over €259 million has been allocated to these organisations under MAPS. The funding supports the NGOs' work in food and livelihood security, rural economic development, health, education, gender equality and the fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>
            <p eId="para_4286">The Irish Aid Civil Society Fund, which is open to all Irish-based NGOs, is designed to provide resources for the development activities of civil society organisations. Multi-annual block grant funding arrangements have been in place for a number of years with Oxfam, Action Aid Ireland, World Vision Ireland and the Irish Fairtrade Network. During 2008, new block grant funding agreements were reached with 17 other NGOs, including Aidlink, Christian Blind Mission, Children in Crossfire, Frontline, Plan Ireland, Progression Ireland, SightSavers International, War on Want Northern Ireland, Vita and VSO Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4287">Multi-annual funding is also provided to NGOs in Ireland's nine priority countries in the developing world, for work in sectors including education, health, rural development, food security, and human rights. Irish Aid also provides multi-annual funding to organisations in the development education sector in Ireland, through a Development Education Grants Funding Scheme.  Full details of funding provided between 2006 and 2009 is available in the annual reports of Irish Aid, which can be accessed at:</p>

            <p eId="para_4294">I have set out, in tabular form, figures for entertainment incurred by my Department in Ireland. As requested by the Deputy, the figures have been presented to reflect the period prior to, and since, the most recent Cabinet changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4295">In the time available, it has not been possible to provide a breakdown of the overall figures in the particular format as requested by the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_4296">The State/Official Entertainment budget includes the costs of official entertainment hosted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers of State at my Department as well as costs associated with the presentation of credentials by the Diplomatic Corps. The budget also covers expenditure associated with State and Official visits to Ireland by Heads of State, costs associated with Official or State Visits abroad by the President, certain costs associated with official visits abroad by the Taoiseach and miscellaneous expenditure associated with visits and events such as printing of invitations and the purchase of flags.</p>
            <p eId="para_4297">The General Entertainment budget is provided for various types of official entertaining carried out by Divisions of my Department including entertainment costs incurred in relation to the Irish Aid programme.</p>

The Department's practice with regard to the appropriate level of entertainment provided is based on agreed EU Guidelines and on reciprocity. Costs savings are sought wherever possible and, to this end, the panel of caterers used by the Department has recently been expanded, resulting in greater competitiveness and reductions in cost. Business is allocated on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender for each individual assignment. In addition, in accordance with our procurement guidelines, separate requests for tender are issued for any event with a total cost in excess of €5,000, directed at keeping the costs down through selecting a company that provides best value for money, as well as high quality service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4346">There have been significant reductions in the budgets assigned for general and state entertainment in my Department for 2009.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_4376">Universal access to reproductive health is one of the goals of the Programme of Action agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994. The fifth of the Millennium Development Goals, adopted internationally in 2000, aims to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters, and to achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015. The Government is fully committed to action in support of these goals, which will also make a vital contribution in addressing the global HIV and AIDS pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_4377">The Government's 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid outlines our commitment to supporting the specific health needs of women and girls within the overall approach to health in developing countries. It makes clear that the health needs of women and girls, particularly in the areas of basic healthcare and maternal and reproductive health, must be at the heart of an effective strategy to improve health in the developing world.</p>
            <p eId="para_4378">Unfortunately, only limited progress has been made on this issue since the Cairo Conference in 1994. Every year, some 500,000 women die and a further 10 million suffer severe illnesses or disabilities as a result of complications in pregnancy and childbirth. Underlying this tragedy is the lack of access by women in developing countries to good quality maternal and reproductive health services, including family planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_4379">The Government's aid programme adopts a comprehensive approach in addressing the reproductive health needs of women and young people, through involvement in global policy development, funding and research. Ireland's assistance is directed at programmes at both global and country levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_4380">The Government works with several partner agencies in the UN system to address maternal health issues. One of the main obstacles to the achievement of universal access to reproductive health is the lack of empowerment of women in developing countries. The issues involved form the core mandate of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), with which Irish Aid has a close relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_4381">In recognition of its important mandate, the Government has engaged with and contributed substantially to UNFPA. We provided funding of €20.5 million over the three years 2005-2008, covering a range of programmes, including Trust Funds for Global Reproductive Health Commodities Security, Maternal Health, and Obstetric Fistula. Ireland has also funded a joint programme between the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and UNFPA to ensure that the implications of the practice of female genital mutilation are integrated into reproductive health strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4382">Ireland is also working closely with a number of partner countries on these important issues. For instance, in Tanzania, we are working on increasing access to maternal health care; in Ethiopia, we are addressing adolescent reproductive health needs; in South Africa, we are focusing on the prevention of gender based violence; and Irish Aid has been central to the development of maternal health services in Northern Province in Zambia.</p>

            <p eId="para_4386">Further to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 269 of 3 March 2009, there are a total of two US officials of Administrative and Technical status attached to the Embassy of the United States who act as liaison officers at Shannon Airport. They have been notified to this Department by the Embassy under Article 10 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as incorporated into Irish law by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967.</p>
            <p eId="para_4387">The two officials concerned are based in Shannon, rather than Dublin, because they are engaged in assisting with the transit of US Government or Government-contracted flights carrying US government officials, civilian and military personnel and cargo through Shannon Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_4388">The two officials concerned liaise with the Irish authorities in relation to flight notifications and permissions through the US Embassy in Dublin. As necessary, they also liaise directly with the airport and other authorities in Shannon on technical and logistical issues that arise in relation to transiting aircraft or their passengers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4389">The stationing of the two US officials in Shannon is fully consistent with the Vienna Convention and is not governed by a specific formal agreement. The current arrangement, which has applied since 2003, operates to the convenience and satisfaction of both the Irish and US authorities and I consider it to be proportionate to the present level of US government air traffic through Shannon.</p>

            <p eId="para_4394">Most of Ireland's expenditure on Official Development Assistance (ODA) is provided under Vote 29 and administered by Irish Aid, the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Further contributions to ODA are made by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Co-operation Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_4395">In 2008, total ODA amounted to approximately €900 million or 0.58 per cent of GNP. While the need to reduce public spending makes it unlikely that we will reach a similar percentage of GNP in 2009, I would expect that Ireland will this year retain its position as the sixth highest donor in the world as a percentage of GNP.</p>
            <p eId="para_4396">The Government intends to continue working towards the target of 0.7% by 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4397">The EU is on track to meet its development aid targets. In November 2005 the EU Member States, including Ireland, formally undertook to achieve the 0.7% target by 2015. (Member States which joined the EU after 2002 will strive to increase their ODA to 0.33 % of GNP by 2015.) The EU confirmed the commitment to these targets as recently as the Doha Conference for Financing on Development in December 2008. Government representatives use every opportunity to urge our EU partners to work together to meet this goal.</p>
            <p eId="para_4398">In 2008 the EU expenditure on ODA reached 0.4 % of GNP and total EU aid figures for the year exceeded €49 billion. The EU is the largest aid donor in the world. Within the EU, Ireland has the fifth highest ODA/GNP ratio.</p>

The staff employed in the Department are engaged in the delivery of its objectives as set out in the Department’s Annual Business Plans which can also be accessed through the same website.  The number of staff in the Department, including the National Archives, is currently 164.  Of this number, the number of staff in the sports capital grants section of the Department is 14.</p>
            <p eId="para_4411">Over 7,400 projects, providing a range of essential sports facilities, have benefited from sports capital funding since 1998 bringing the total allocation in that time to over €725 million.  At this time an overhang of €175m in commitments is still to be drawn down. The staff in the sports capital unit are currently employed on the management of this drawdown of funding for projects in respect of which the entire grant allocation has not been drawn down.  The management of each of these projects can be complex and time consuming to ensure that grantees comply with the conditions of the Programme in relation to tendering, tax clearance, legal and planning requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4412">In addition, staff in the Unit are involved in finalising a five-year strategic plan to inform the future development of necessary sporting facilities throughout the country. The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  The strategy will also identify the wider economic, health and social case for continued investment in sports facilities.  It will aim to prioritise areas for future investment and to ensure continued impact on participation in the relevant areas including those in lower socio-economic groups.  It will address future sports facility funding and provision and will inform decisions on future rounds of the Sports Capital Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4422">The Deputy will be aware that in addressing the public finances all areas of expenditure have been examined and the budget in relation to sport, like all areas, has been impacted following this process.  Nevertheless the huge social and economic benefits of sport are acknowledged by this Government and are reflected in the unprecedented level of Government funding for sport over the last number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4423">In the period 2004 to 2008, more than €1.2bn has been spent on Sport. The allocation in 2009 (prior to today's budget) is just over €199m.  While there is a reduction on the 2008 allocation — due mainly to the payment in 2008 of €116m towards the Lansdowne Road project which is not repeated in 2009 — I am confident that the 2009 allocation will be sufficient to sustain Irish sport in the current difficult economic climate.</p>

            <p eId="para_4520">I propose to take Questions Nos. 253, 256 and 263 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4521">During 2008 an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a National Carers' Strategy.  The work of developing a Carer's Strategy was well advanced by the group.</p>
            <p eId="para_4522">However, faced with the current economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time lines which could be achieved.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4523">I am aware of the proposals put forward by the Carers Association.  My officials met last week with the Carers Association to discuss those proposals which are within the remit of the Department.  However, Deputies should be aware that recommendations described as "cost-neutral" usually do have a cost, in terms of administration, or in follow on effects.  The Government remains acutely aware of the sacrifices made by carers and has sought to make many improvements in services and supports for carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4524">The Carers Allowance scheme has been significantly improved in recent years and in budget 2009, I continued this process.  The rate of carer's allowance for those aged 66 or over increased by €7 to €239 per week and for those aged under 66 by €6.50 to €220.50 per week.   These increases took effect from January 2009.  Recipients of carer's allowance are also eligible for household benefits, free travel and the respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4525">Since 1997 weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_4526">The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been 332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_4527">A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package.  These levels surpass the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure that those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.  From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  It is estimated that combined expenditure on carer's allowance, carer's benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carers will be €650 million in 2009.</p>

         the way casual work and short-time work, respectfully, are defined by her Department; and if she will address the anomalous position that exists at present where two jobseeker’s who have lost two days of work can qualify for two different rates of payment as a result of the different ways the number of days in the working week are calculated using the different short-time and casual work definitions.

            <p eId="para_4529">The jobseeker's schemes provide income support for people who are seeking their first job or have lost work and are seeking alternative employment.  A fundamental qualifying condition for both the Jobseeker's Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance is that a person must be available for full-time work.</p>
            <p eId="para_4530">Where a person is employed for up to three days in a week, they may claim Jobseeker's Benefit or Assistance in respect of the remainder of the week, subject, <i>inter alia</i>, to having sustained a substantial loss of employment, being available for full-time work and, in the case of Jobseeker’s Assistance, satisfying a means test.  A person is regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment if they have lost at least one day of insurable employment in any period of six days, provided their reckonable earnings or reckonable income are reduced as a consequence of the loss of employment.  Benefit is not payable where a person is available for part-time work only.</p>
            <p eId="para_4531">When determining the classification of casual and short time workers, each case is examined on its own merits and, because of the variables necessarily involved in making a determination as to entitlement, payment rates and extent of entitlement are individual-specific. Employment on a casual basis implies that the number of days worked will vary each week with the amount of work available.  There will be no established pattern of days.  This variety will also be reflected in the wages paid.  Variations in hours or days worked must be due to the employer's requirements, as opposed to a work pattern chosen by the employee.  In addition, there must be no guaranteed minimum hours or wages each week.</p>
            <p eId="para_4532">Short-time employment means employment in which, for the time being, the number of days systematically worked in a working week is less than the number of days which is normal in a working week in the employment concerned.  Short-time work must be systematic, i.e., there must be a clear repetitive pattern of employment each week.  The person must also work at least one day in each week that he or she would normally be working.  In the context of changing economic circumstances there is an increased number of people claiming Jobseeker's Benefit and Assistance categorised as both systematic short-time and casual.  The application of the jobseeker's payment scheme conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis is being kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_4688">Civil Service posts at the levels of Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards.  The operation of the scheme is overseen by the Committee for Performance Awards (CPA).  Details of awards to individual officers under the scheme are not disclosed on the basis that they are confidential to the officer concerned.  However, I can say that for 2005, 2006, and 2007, awards totalling €21,200, €22,400 and €22,000 respectively were made to two officers in my Department.  The 2007 award was approved on 18 March 2008.  No payments have been approved for 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4689">The Scheme for Performance Related Awards also applies to officers of the Permanent Defence Force at the level of Brigadier General and Major General.  The following awards were made under this scheme:</p>
            <p eId="para_4690">for 2005 an amount of €119,500 was awarded to a total of 12 personnel;</p>
            <p eId="para_4691">for 2006 an amount of €106,800 was awarded to a total of 10 personnel; and,</p>

            <p eId="para_4693">The 2007 awards were approved on 16 April 2008 for 11 personnel.  One award was subsequently approved on 19 December 2008.  No payments have been approved for 2008.</p>

It is a matter for each local authority to determine the extent to which these facilities should be provided and to allocate resources accordingly.  Kildare County Council was awarded grant aid by my Department in 2006 towards the provision of a playground in Kilcullen. The grant has not been drawn down by the local authority as I understand that the project has yet to commence construction.</p>

In addition to the inspection activities of local authorities, implementation of the Nitrates Regulations is supported by farm inspections carried out by staff of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the context of the operation of the Single Farm Payment Scheme and cross-compliance requirements.</p>

Following a further response from the Council, I will decide whether to give a direction under section 202(2) of the Act regarding the making of a further special amenity area order.  For the present, it is not my intention to publish the report in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_4888">In February 2009 my Department requested Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and Kildare County Council to carry out evaluations of lands in the Liffey Valley which fall within their functional areas, in order to assess the suitability of some or all of these lands being designated as part of an extended area of special amenity.  A response from Kildare County Council is under consideration.  Replies are awaited from Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council.</p>

In the case of the old Disabled Persons' and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes, these are funded by 67% recoupment available from my Department together with a 33% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The detailed administration of the schemes, including the assessment and approval of applications, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_5074">Following on from the 2009 Budget Day announcement on 14th October 2008 of the rationalisation of State agencies, the Government has now formally approved proposals for the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector, which includes the creation of a single strengthened national inland fisheries authority to be known as Inland Fisheries Ireland.  This authority will replace the existing Central and seven Regional Fisheries Boards.  A restructuring implementation group which includes representatives of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards has been established and is developing the key features and structures of the model.  Primary legislation is required for this implementation and in this regard a draft Heads of Bill has recently been approved by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_5075">I wish to advise the Deputy that I have met with angling representatives on a number of occasions since the announcement last October regarding the proposed restructuring of the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_5076">As regards financing I consider that the establishment of a single authority creates the potential for administrative cost savings over time.  In addition to financial savings, the new model will consolidate and thus ensure the better use of existing resources and deliver improved value for money management of the State's resource without impacting on the core conservation and management functions currently exercised by the Fisheries Boards.</p>

The first payments for 2008 REPS 4 applications issued in the last week of January to those whose applications required no correction following the administrative checks. Further payments continue to be made as applications are cleared. The balancing 25% payment will be made as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5399">Dairy farmers incomes are comprised of the market price paid for milk and direct income support from the EU.  Market forces have a major influence on the price paid for milk.  World market prices determine the returns received by dairy processors and these in turn are reflected in the price paid to farmers.  In essence, farm gate prices normally reflect the returns from international markets of dairy product sales.</p>
            <p eId="para_5400">Dairy product prices reached record high levels in 2007 and early 2008 and producer prices also peaked in that time.  Since then international dairy product prices have fallen back considerably.  I have made clear to Commissioner Fischer Boel that a range of supports would help to restore confidence and put a floor under market prices.  My efforts so far have resulted in the restoration of export refunds for butter, skimmed milk powder, whole milk powder and cheese, the early opening of APS for butter, and the operation of butter intervention purchasing at close to the intervention price.  I believe that the key elements that will lead a recovery are competitive export refunds that allow the sale of dairy products onto world markets and the continuation of intervention under the tendering mechanism provided that these arrangements remain relatively attractive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5401">At the recent meeting of the Agriculture Council in March the Commission was reminded forcefully by me and other Ministers of the importance of fully using all available supports to manage the market in the coming period.  I will continue to monitor developments in the dairy sector closely and intervene again with the Commissioner as the market situation evolves.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_969">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_5411">I believe the present labelling legislation does indeed provide the necessary strength to protect consumers with regard to the labelling of fishery products.</p>
            <p eId="para_5412">The regulation referred to by the deputy deals with the establishment of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) and defines the framework for Community support for the sustainable development of the fisheries sector, fisheries areas and inland fishing.  The issue of labelling of fisheries products is, however, governed by S.I. No. 320 of 2003 which gives effect to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 104/2000 and to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2065/2001 laying down the conditions for informing consumers about fishery and aquaculture products.</p>
            <p eId="para_5413">The Regulations set out the specific information required on the label where fishery products are sold at retail level to consumers. In addition, for the purposes of traceability, this information must be included on the commercial documents for the fishery products throughout the marketing chain, such as during processing, at wholesale level and for use by mass caterers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5414">The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) have a primary role in the enforcement of these regulations and have published a guidance note on the labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products which is available on their website. The guide specifically details the labelling and packaging requirements for fishery and aquaculture products and may be consulted for a more detailed guide to the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5415">In brief the labelling requirements of the Regulations apply only to raw fish and aquaculture products to which no other ingredients have been added (except salt). This includes live fish, fresh fish, chilled and frozen fish, fish fillets and other fish meat (whether minced or not), dried fish, salted or brined fish, smoked fish (whether hot or cold smoked fish), crustaceans (except those which are both cooked and peeled), molluscs (except when cooked). Each label is required to indicate where the "wild fish" was caught at sea and in the case of aquaculture products where they were "farmed" or "cultivated".</p>
            <p eId="para_5416">Recently a case brought against a company for breach of the regulations was dismissed, not for salmon labelling issues but because the judge felt that the evidence put before her did not adequately prove that the salmon was farmed as set out in European Council Regulation 1198/2006.  I understand that FSAI and Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) are reviewing the case in its totality and the implications arising, I await their findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_5417">In another case brought against the same company, they admitted falsely describing fish as being "caught at sea" when they were in fact farmed and declaring that particular fish were caught in the north-east Atlantic Ocean when they were in fact captured in Norway.</p>
            <p eId="para_5418">I take these instances as evidence that the FSAI are active in their role of protecting consumers from misleading labelling. I also believe that the legislation is robust enough to support this.  Potential damage to Ireland by companies trying to manipulate legislation to gain some sort of competitive advantage must be prevented and any such activities will not be condoned.</p>
            <p eId="para_5419">In the overall context, I would favour strengthening of the current labelling EU Regulations to ensure that there is more information available to the consumer.  I am particularly interested in ensuring that the consumer has enough information to understand where fish have been caught.  It should enable the consumer to make an informed choice and I will be pursuing these issues at EU level.</p>

            <p eId="para_5475">The new Nitrates Regulations, which revise and replace the Regulations made in 2006 and 2007, were  made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 26 March 2009. The Regulations were developed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in conjunction with my Department following a comprehensive public consultation process and are intended to address two main issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_5476">Arising from a judgement by the European Court of Justice in relation to the Dangerous Substances Directive, changes to the Regulations were necessary to provide for strengthened enforcement provisions and more specific requirements in relation to farmyard management. The new Regulations also provide the legal basis for the operation by my Department of the derogation under the Nitrates Directive and make a number of other amendments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5477">In relation to enforcement provisions, the new Regulations strengthen the enforcement powers of local authorities. The local authorities were designated as the competent authorities under the 2005 and 2006 Regulations and they remain the designated competent authorities for the purposes of the new Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5478">The Regulations also provide for enhanced cross-reporting arrangements between the local authorities and my Department. However, my Department's role in implementation of the Regulations is confined to cross-compliance inspections under the Single Payment Scheme and the operation of the derogation arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_5534">Schools can now apply to my Department in the normal way for language support posts. These posts are approved on a provisional basis initially and will be confirmed in September 2009 following receipt from the schools of actual enrolments of pupils requiring language support. It is estimated that notwithstanding the budget measures there will be over 1,400 language support teaching posts in our primary and post-primary schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts.  By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_5594">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.  The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and was supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5595">The school referred to by the Deputy has DEIS Urban Band 2 status and therefore qualifies for a range of supports including the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_5596">additional non-pay/capitation allocation based on level of disadvantage;</p>
            <p eId="para_5597">additional financial allocation for school books;</p>

            <p eId="para_5602">access to the school meals programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5603">A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that were dissatisfied with their DEIS classification. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools who applied for the review in August, 2006. There was an application for review received from the school to which the Deputy refers. Regrettably, the school was unsuccessful in that process.  The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2006-2010.  There will not be an opportunity before this for the school to be considered for reclassification from DEIS Band 2 to DEIS Band 1.</p>

            <p eId="para_5606">I propose to take Questions Nos. 373 and 390 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5607">The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.  In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_5608">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5609">The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_5610">Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009, available on my Department's website. The application form for appeal is also available on my Department's website. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

            <p eId="para_5612">The cost of substitution for teachers undertaking work associated with the state examinations during term time claimed for the 2007/2008 school year was 1.23 million euros.  This information relates to the costs incurred for secondary and community/ comprehensive schools only and the data is obtained from claims submitted to my Department by the managerial authorities of those schools.  The information for the substitution costs incurred for Vocational Education Committees is not readily available.  The substitution costs of teachers employed by them undertaking work associated with the state examinations are paid by each individual VEC.</p>

            <p eId="para_5614">The school to which the Deputy refers is operating with provisional recognition from my Department.  It is entitled to grant aid for rental for its accommodation, for school transport and for the payment of teacher salaries.  Teacher allocations to all second-level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules, each school is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are, in the first instance, a matter for each school.</p>
            <p eId="para_5615">In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions.  This concession is available as a short term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_5616">The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The Principal of a school can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools. This Board operates independently of my Department.  Discrete allocations are also made to second-level schools to cater for example for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with language difficulties.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_5622">I wish to advise the Deputy that there will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability.  These special classes which are to close predate the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities. All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_5623">All primary schools were allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD).  Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5624">Teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. This minimum was not met in the school referred to by the Deputy. Therefore, the school no longer qualifies to retain the class.</p>
            <p eId="para_5625">When the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation. The number of these special classes has decreased since 2005 in line with falling numbers as pupils are supported through the additional teaching allocation provided and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.</p>
            <p eId="para_5626">I understand that the school in question has written to my Department making a case for retention of the class and this is currently under consideration. It would be expected, however, that provision would be made for these pupils within mainstream classes with support from the General Allocation Model.  I wish to reiterate to the Deputy that pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have, access to additional teaching resources to support their education.</p>

            <p eId="para_5688">I propose to take Questions Nos. 382 and 393 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5689">I have received correspondence on this issue in recent days, and I am prepared  to meet a deputation of relevant interests to discuss the matter. However diary  commitments do not allow for a meeting in the coming weeks, and officials of my  Department will be in touch with the correspondents to arrange a meeting as  soon as possible, probably in late May.</p>
            <p eId="para_5690">Dance is included in the strands in the Physical Education curriculum in  primary and post primary schools. In addition, students may choose Dance as one of the courses available within the Arts component of the Leaving Certificate  Applied programme (LCA). The LCA is taken by some 7% of the student cohort and a maximum of 4 credits from a total of 200 credits in the assessment of the LCA is available for the Dance component. The LCA does not provide for direct entry into higher education, but students may progress to Post Leaving Certificate courses and from there to higher education.</p>
            <p eId="para_5691">My Department is faced with an extensive range of competing needs for  investment in education, ranging from addressing educational disadvantage,  inclusion of pupils with special needs and newcomer students, meeting the  demands of a growing population, strengthening the mathematical, science, and  technology aspects of provision, enhancing the professional development of  teachers, investing in research and development and promoting second chance  learning. Within that context, investment in mainstreaming of dance education  as a subject for points for the purpose of third level entry is not a priority  at the current time.</p>

            <p eId="para_5729">The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall  level of day to day funding for primary schools which will see funding increase  from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5730">The primary school capitation grant has increased from €81.26 per pupil in 2000  to its current rate of €200, which was an increase of €21 on last year. This  represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since  2000. The ancillary grant has increased from €151.50 per pupil to €155 per  pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_5731">Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full  ancillary services grant will get €355 per pupil — or almost €25 extra — in  this school year to cover their day to day running costs, with a primary school  of 200 pupils, similar in size to the school referred to by the Deputy, getting  €5,000 more. In 2000, a primary school with 200 pupils was in receipt of less  than €27,000 to meet its day to day running costs. That same school under these  new rates will receive €71,000. This excludes the salary of teachers and  Special Needs Assistants which are paid by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5732">Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of  children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special  classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €512 to  €986 per pupil — an increase of 59% from the rate in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_5733">By any standards there have been very significant improvements within a  relatively short period of time and the Government is committed to further  increasing funding for schools as resources permit. While increasing resources  is important, we must also focus on measures to enhance the quality of  education in our schools to ensure that increased resources lead to the best  possible outcomes for our children.</p>
            <p eId="para_5734">We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level  that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the  moment given economic circumstances. I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_5736">There are a number of different arrangements under which teachers may retire early on pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_5737">Teachers who are not new entrants as defined in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 may retire voluntarily from  age 55 years onwards.  Where the teacher is aged 55 but under 60 he or she must satisfy the following conditions: have completed at least 35 years pensionable service, or have completed at least 34 years pensionable service and have 3 years pre-service training, or have completed at least 33 years pensionable service and have 4 years pre-service training</p>
            <p eId="para_5738">While this pre-service training can be taken into account for the purpose of qualifying for retirement at 55 years of age, it cannot be used to credit service on which benefits will be based.  There is no actuarial reduction in benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_5739">Teachers aged 50 (or aged 55 if a new entrant), who have competed at least 2 years pensionable service, may also retire early and avail of cost neutral early retirement.  Superannuation benefits, actuarially reduced, come into payment immediate on retirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5740">A voluntary Early Retirement Scheme had operated from 1996 in the case of primary teachers and 1997 in the case of post-primary teachers until its suspension with immediate effect in October 2008 on foot of Budget 2009.  The Scheme consisted of three strands.  Strand 1 related to teachers who were consistently experiencing professional difficulties in their teaching duties.  Strand 2 related to teachers whose retirement would provide their school with an opportunity to enhance the education service being provided through facilitating change.  Strand 3 related to teachers who were in posts which are surplus to requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5741">Over the past 12 months, 998 primary, secondary, community and comprehensive school teachers chose to retire early; ie under the 55/35 year rule, cost-neutral early retirement and voluntary early retirement (now suspended).  The tabular statement attached sets out the number of teacher awarded pension each month, on early retirement, from April 2008 to March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5742">Currently 263 applications from teacher are being processed in my Department for early retirement between now and the end of the current school year.  It is estimated that in the 2009/2010 school-year in the region of 900 will opt for early retirement.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_5752">A revised second-level mathematics curriculum is being introduced on a phased basis.  This developmental initiative, Project Maths, is being directed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, in collaboration with the Department of Education and Science and the State Examinations Commission.  Five revised syllabus ‘strands' will be introduced over a three-year period, and this began in a small number of schools in September 2008, where Strand 1 (statistics and probability) and Strand 2 (geometry and trigonometry) have been introduced.  To inform the curriculum development process, the 24 schools initially involved in introducing the revised strands will provide feedback on their experiences so that any refinements identified as necessary can be incorporated before the changed syllabus strands are introduced in all other schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_5753">The phased changes in Project Maths are being introduced simultaneously at first year and fifth year in post-primary schools.  The changed teaching and learning approaches under Project Maths give greater emphasis to student understanding of the underlying concepts and processes involved in mathematics and the application of knowledge and skills to solving problems in meaningful contexts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5754">A planned programme of professional development for teachers of mathematics is currently underway in the 24 initial schools.  This will continue as the remaining strands are introduced in these schools for successive cohorts of students.  Additional support is being provided through a dedicated website (<i>www.projectmaths.ie</i>), where further and updated information is publicly available.</p>
            <p eId="para_5755">As part of the developmental initiative, teachers in the 24 schools are using, adapting, refining and developing a range of teaching and learning plans which will then be available as a resource for mathematics teachers in all other schools when they commence the revised syllabus strands.  International research has shown that change is more effective and long-lasting where teachers work collaboratively in adopting and adapting new methods in their classrooms.  As each phase of the project rolls out, additional teaching resources and support materials will be available which have been used in the initial group of schools and refined by teachers in their classrooms.  Educational publishers are kept informed of the developments and they will publish revised textbooks in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_5756">There is a two-year gap between the introduction of the changes in the 24 schools and their roll-out to all other schools, which begins in September 2010.  To support the roll-out, all teachers of mathematics will have professional development in the form of seminars and workshops over a four-year period, beginning in 2009/2010 — the year before the introduction of the first two changed syllabus strands in all schools.  This will involve professional development workshops/seminars for each teacher of mathematics in each of the Strands.  It is intended that additional forms of support for teachers, including school-based in-service, will also be available.</p>

            <p eId="para_5759">I propose to take Questions Nos. 397 and 398 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5760">The State Examinations Commission is charged with operating the certificate examinations to the highest standards of openness, fairness and accountability.  In doing so, the Commission provides for the establishment of examination centres in both publicly funded schools and in the private sector.  In addition, individual candidates are accommodated as external candidates and generally sit the examination in a recognised examination centre near them.</p>
            <p eId="para_5761">The Commission maintains consistency, quality and reliability through the processes it has in place for the preparation of examination papers and other test items, and through the quality assurance procedures it implements at the examining and appeal stages of the state examinations.  The Chief Examiner for each examination takes all necessary steps to ensure that the agreed marking scheme is applied by each examiner and that the established standard is applied  to the work of all candidates who sit the examination.  The Chief Examiner oversees the examining process established by the Commission aimed at ensuring this.</p>
            <p eId="para_5762">The same marking scheme is applied strictly and in exactly the same way to the work of all candidates in the cohort taking the particular examination.  Each candidate is anonymous and examining proceeds without reference to school location or centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_5763">Ongoing and systematic monitoring is a critical element of the marking process.  The monitoring is designed to enable each examiner to apply the agreed marking scheme consistently and accurately to all scripts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5764">Appealed scripts are re-marked in accordance with the same standard as applied in the initial marking, and the same marking scheme as utilised in the initial marking.</p>
            <p eId="para_5765">The Deputy may be inferring that candidates in certain fee paying schools are being advised by those schools to register as examination candidates in another centre, to reduce the prospect of an unusually high proportion of high grades being awarded in a single centre, and perhaps being subject to review.  There would be no point in schools doing this.  Firstly, examiners are assigned scripts without knowing the identity of schools or candidates.  Secondly, the quality assurance measures mentioned above do not apply at the level of a school or an examiner.  The work of all candidates is marked in accordance with the published marking scheme, regardless of the level of performance of any other candidate in that examination centre or school.  Finally the State Examinations Commission operates a very transparent appeals process, where candidates may view their scripts, match them against the published marking scheme and make a decision whether to appeal their result.</p>
            <p eId="para_5766">I am satisfied that we have an appropriately structured examination system where results are based on the demonstrated knowledge skills and competences of candidates, and the type of school attended has no bearing on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_5768">I am aware of the correspondence received in my Department from the school referred to by the Deputy.  The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5769">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website.  This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5770">The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5771">The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_5772">Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009, available on my Department's website.  The application form for appeal is also available on my Department's website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>
