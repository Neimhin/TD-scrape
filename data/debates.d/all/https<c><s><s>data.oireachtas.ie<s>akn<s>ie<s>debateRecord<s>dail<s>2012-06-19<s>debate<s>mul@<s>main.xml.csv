#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The Government is committed to fundamental reform of health care that will deliver a single tier health system, supported by universal health insurance, where access is based on need, not income.  A new insurance fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy.As part of the reform programme, the Government is committed to introducing universal GP care within the current term of office.  It has given its approval to the preparation of the heads of a Bill to progress the phased introduction of free GP care.  It is envisaged that the first phase will provide for the extension of access to GP services without fees to persons with illnesses or disabilities to be prescribed by regulations under the new legislation.  A provision of €15 million was made available in the 2012 Estimates for the first phase.  Funding for later phases will be addressed during the budgetary process.In February I established an implementation group on universal health insurance which will assist in developing detailed implementation plans for universal health insurance and driving implementation of various elements of the health reform programme.  It will also assist my Department in preparing a White Paper on financing universal health insurance which will outline the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance.  It will be published as early as possible within the Government's term of office.The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful sequencing for a number of years.  The implementation group will continue in existence throughout the health reform process and oversee implementation of the reforms and consult widely.  The introduction of universal health insurance and universal GP care is a policy matter for the Government, not a matter for the troika.  However, in implementing policies the Government must have regard to the targets agreed with the troika and set out in the national plan for recovery.

He has outlined the steps he is taking for the introduction of universal health insurance.  It will be some years before we see the type of model on which the system will be based and the cost implications for the State.  The perception is that universal health insurance and universal GP care will be free, but they will have to be paid for by someone somewhere along the line.  The issue must be discussed early on as it is a fundamental shift in how we fund the health service and make it available.  The people have a right to know who will bear the cost.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Will the Deputy, please, ask a question?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Does the Minister agree that a difficulty arises in the meantime in that the private health insurance system is in crisis?  Many families are opting out of private health cover altogether.  We now have a situation where people are downgrading the insurance package they normally take out.  There is increasing evidence that health insurance providers do not provide adequate cover in the sense that they are changing the terms and conditions of policyholders, in particular of older people.  Does the Minister agree that VHI has failed to cover the Mahon private hospital in Cork and that it remains closed?  In the context of having competition within the health insurance industry there must also be competition among health service providers and that is an indication that the Minister's policies, even at an early stage, are being undermined by VHI because it is not covering a hospital that could provide adequate care for its policyholders.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  We all understand that nothing is free and that somebody must pay.  However, we are discussing making something free at the point of delivery so that no one need be concerned about being able to pay.  I hope all sides of the House agree on this point.  We do not want a situation in which someone must make a decision between attending a doctor or paying an ESB bill.Regarding the Deputy's contentions on the health insurance market, 46,000 people have left the insurance market since the end of March 2007 to the end of March of this year.  This is a modest decline in private health insurance coverage, 2% of the overall market.  Some 2.139 million people, 46.6% of the population, are still covered by private health insurance.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Everyone is in favour of universal primary care, but we do not know its exact cost or who will bear that cost.  If the cost is taken from the Minister's current health budget, services elsewhere will be cut.  A couple of weeks ago, we were counting the number of incontinence pads available to people in Kilkenny.  This is how serious the situation is.The Minister is the major stakeholder in the VHI on behalf of the Irish people.  In the context of universal health insurance, does he agree that it is flying against his policy of covering private hospitals to increase accessibility and make treatments available to its policyholders?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The Deputy has raised a number of issues.  I assure him that I, as the VHI's major shareholder, have made it clear that it is not the company's job to determine the market.  However, as a court case involving a particular hospital is ongoing, it is not wise for me to comment on the specifics of this issue.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	7	In 2011, I indicated that the issues raised by the case of Michael Shine would be the subject of an inquiry by an Oireachtas committee.  This was dependent on the powers that had been proposed under the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  As I cannot now proceed as proposed, I am considering how best to deal with these issues.  I must take into account the fact that Garda investigations are continuing, with investigation files having been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  I also understand that civil cases are pending against Mr. Shine.  It would be wrong to initiate any other inquiry that might impede these investigations and possible cases.  However, I remain determined to reach a fair and satisfactory outcome that will help to give closure to the victims concerned.Dignity 4 Patients has requested ongoing funding from my Department, including funding for counselling services.  Ongoing funding for any service is a matter for the HSE.  The HSE recently granted Dignity 4 Patients €22,500 for one year's office supplies and voluntary support.  The HSE advised Dignity 4 Patients that it could not provide any funding towards staffing costs, particularly given the fact that the HSE provides counselling services.  The HSE has suggested that Dignity 4 Patients should consider working more closely with other similar agencies to continue to support its client group.In conjunction with the HSE, my Department is also considering an application for lottery funding from Dignity 4 Patients, which could cover one-off spending.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	8	In the Minister's responses to me last week at the health committee and again today, he indicated giving consideration to how best to deal with the issues involved in the Michael Shine case.  As he has already indicated, some of the possible options in terms of an inquiry or how it would be constructed may not be open to him at this time.  What consideration is he therefore giving and what options do he and his Department have for that consideration?  The Minister suggests that any ongoing Garda investigation or specific individual cases may be an impediment to proceeding in a full way.  Is there potential to look at the distinction between an investigation of Michael Shine and an examination of the system from the hospital to the Garda and from the Health Service Executive to the Department of how they actually responded in this and the many cases presented around his abuse of young hospital patients?I also stress the need for support for Dignity 4 Patients.  I take some hope, as I did from the Minister's replies last Thursday and this morning at the health committee, that additional supports will be provided to help to anchor secretarial backup for Dignity 4 Patients which is a significant organisation providing important support and making representations for a body of men who need help and support.  I urge the Minister to make every effort to approve national lottery funding for it.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	9	All options are being looked at, but it would be premature at this point to go into specifics.  I am concerned that we need to bring closure for those who have suffered in this instance.  I am, however, somewhat hamstrung by the fact that there is litigation pending.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Is it possible for the Minister to establish for how long this investigation by the Garda is likely to continue?  It has been ongoing for years.  If it is to be trundled out as a reason we cannot progress a logical stepped investigation, we must ask what is causing the delay.  Why is there such an absence of progress on the Garda's part in this regard?  We need to know the facts.  Is there a multiple of cases being brought?  We do not know all the facts.  It was regrettable that the referendum on Oireachtas inquires did not succeed, one that I supported and in which I campaigned with the Minister.  It was an all-party supported proposition and it is regrettable that it was not adopted, but the people are sovereign.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	11	That is another issue.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	13	On the Deputy's last point, I am afraid there is not.  I share his frustration at the delay in the investigation.  I understand it is not with the Garda, but there is a multiple of files with the Director of Public Prosecutions who is, correctly, independent of the Government.  It is a cause of concern, however, that it seems to take forever to have a decision made on some files.  As things stand, I cannot influence the matter one way or the other, nor would it be proper that I could.  At the same time, I understand how it frustrates people.  It frustrates the Government too, not just in this area but in several others where there are major issues of public concern.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The demand for day services, including rehabilitative training, for school leavers continues to grow.  The HSE expects approximately 654 school leavers will require services in 2012.  This year disability services are required to cater for demographic pressures such as new services for school leavers from within their existing budgets.  In previous years demographic funding was provided to meet this need.  The 2012 budgets have been reduced by 3.7% and the moratorium on staff recruitment gives rise to additional challenges in service provision.  In excess of 4,500 individuals avail of day services in Dublin-mid-Leinster.  Nationally over 25,000 individuals take part in these day programmes, including almost 3,000 in rehabilitative training.  Significant investment has been made in this area during the years, particularly in respect of young people leaving school.  In Dublin-mid-Leinster 164 individuals will be leaving school in 2012 and a further 103 will complete rehabilitative training.  Potential solutions have been identified for almost 80% of these individuals and considerable progress has been made.It is not correct to claim that there will no longer be funding to support young adults leaving schools.  However, current funding must be utilised to best effect.  The HSE is working with all relevant service providers to maximise the use of available places.  The HSE and disability service providers have agreed that families will be notified by 10 July if a place is available or if an individual is to be placed on a waiting list.  Some funding will be made available through Genio and the outcome of these applications will be made known in the coming weeks.  The HSE and disability service providers acknowledge that the waiting period is a difficult time for individuals and their families, but every effort is being made to achieve an equitable and sustainable outcome.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	15	This issue was brought to my attention by a constituent in County Wicklow who is the sole carer for his daughter who this year will graduate from a special school.  With other parents, he met an official from the HSE who told them and the service providers, including Sunbeam House in Wicklow, that additional funding would not be made available.  Sunbeam House has indicated that places are available, but it lacks the €14,000 required to fund them.  My constituent also applied for carer's allowance.  I recognise this payment involves a different Department, but I want to explain his situation.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I ask the Deputy to frame a question.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I will.  My constituent was refused carer's allowance based on the Chief Medical Officer's assessment that his daughter could take care of herself.  I have a copy of the assessment made by the educational psychologist and a letter from a GP, both of which are ambiguous in stating his daughter needs full-time care.  He has been told, therefore, that he will not receive carer's allowance, even though he has submitted paperwork and clinical testimony that show he should receive it.  A few days ago he was called by the HSE and told that it would read his letter in 13 weeks if he was lucky.  The HSE official has told him he is not getting a place, but he has not been told that there are potential solutions and that he will hear further about them.  For the small number of people in this position, I ask the Government to make a commitment that funding for rehabilitative training will be made available.  We know there is funding available in other areas.  The figure for public sector pay increments has increased by €180 million.  The majority of State agencies under the supervision of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have increased their stationery and travel costs.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	20	There is no way I can make such a commitment, as I think the Deputy is aware.  Nobody will receive a definite refusal or placement until 10 July.  We continue to work on the matter.This is an issue that arises every year.  I acknowledge what the previous Government did in this regard, but the difficulty is that a long-term sustainable plan was never put in place.  This is not something that falls out of the sky; it happens every year.  The Department of Health alone spends €1.5 billion on disability services annually.  I do not know how much is spent on social welfare, education, transport or enterprise supports, but I know we are spending a significant amount.  Equally, I know we cannot continue to have this sort of emergency arising every year.  We must have a sustainable plan going forward.  That gentleman and his daughter need to have security going into the future and we are working on that.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The phrase was "demographic pressure" and, as the Minister of State acknowledged, the HSE is acting like it is surprised that these young adults turn 18 each year and that their conditions remain the same.  What will the Minister of State and the Minister do to fix a ridiculous process that causes a great deal of trauma for the parents and young adults involved?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	22	This is no surprise to anyone when it happens.  In fairness to the HSE, it has worked exceptionally hard since April to resolve this issue and we can see from the decrease in numbers that there has been significant success.  I have just left the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, where a forum is taking place to bring together those with disabilities, their carers and their advocates to engage in a process which will give us an implementation plan for disability.  It is amazing; we have an Act, we have strategies and sectoral plans but no implementation plan.  We are now working on that and I believe it will give us a solution.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The Government is committed to reducing the cost of the public service through reducing the numbers employed, combined with measures to increase efficiency.  We must ensure the maximum levels of safe services are provided within the resources available.  I acknowledge and welcome the improvements in productivity being achieved by health service staff through the public service agreement through, for example, redeployment, streamlining of management structures, changes in skill-mix and more cost-effective rosters.  In dealing with the significant number of retirements during the recent pensions grace period, the HSE focused in particular on protecting and maintaining critical front-line services.It is HSE policy not to rehire retired staff members.  In exceptional circumstances, however, it may be necessary to rehire on a short-term basis to meet critical service needs.  A total of 38 recently retired staff have been rehired.  These comprise 11 consultants, four other medical staff, 19 nurses, a radiographer, a senior orthoptist, an attendant and one clerical officer.  The HSE is not in a position to provide cost information in the time available, and this will be supplied to the Deputy as soon as possible.  Pension abatement rules apply to all appointments of retired staff in the HSE and elsewhere in the health sector.No retired member of staff has been rehired by the Department.  Arrangements are in train to engage three retired staff members on a temporary basis for the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the EU.  No costs have arisen to date in this regard.In the non-commercial State agencies, two retired staff have been engaged on a consultancy basis.  One former public servant was recruited, following open competition, on a part-time basis for a fixed term of five years.  The nature and cost of these three positions is detailed in the tabular statement.

The real difficulty is when we pare back the figures and look at the number of agency staff being employed by the HSE.  We are talking about a potential €204 million this year, which does not take into account the full impact of locums.  The budget could be dramatically more than €204 million.The Minister gave a commitment last year in the Dáil when he said the costs of agency staff were horrendous.  So far, in the first quarter of this year, there has been an increase, to €51 million, in the amount of money being spent on hiring agency staff.  That is not sustainable.  On a quick, back of the envelope calculation, that could employ 3,000 full-time nurses or 1,000 consultants.  We must recognise that €204 million is a sizeable sum every year.  It has the potential to address the deficiencies in front-line services by having a streamlined system of recruitment in areas that need it rather than depending on temporary staff all the time.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The figure of 600 to 700 rehired retirees which has been quoted in the media relates to the years 2010 and 2011.  Since the grace period, 38 people have been rehired out of a total workforce of 103,000, which is pretty minimal.  I have made it clear that I do not want staff rehired if people are available to be hired.  I want to give young nurses, doctors, administrators and anybody due to come into the system a job and not re-employ staff who have retired, but sometimes people in specific areas, particularly consultants must be.  I know of a hand surgeon who was rehired but there are only two in the country and we could not do without his services until a new consultant is appointed.  I hope that goes some way to explaining this.With regard to the Deputy's contention about the use of agency nursing staff, we are very much focused on reductions in this area and I look forward to the public service agreement to address that issue.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I accept the commitment of the HSE and the Minister not to rehire staff.  I was first to accept in the context of the incentivised early retirement scheme that it was a necessity to do so in cases where people with the required skillset were not available immediately to replace those retiring.  I have no difficulty with rehiring staff on short-term contracts to address deficiencies in skillsets.However, I refer again to the broader issue agency staff.  During the first quarter of 2012, €51 million was spent on these staff.  If that continues, the spend for the year will be well in excess of €200 million.  This does not include the cost of locums and other temporary measures.  The total cost, therefore, could be between €220 million and €230 million by year's end.  Does the Minister agree there was a commitment to reduce this expenditure by 50%?  If that is to happen, no agency staff will be hired for the second half of this year because the entire budget was spent in the first six months.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	27	There is very often a lack of clarity around this.

It was not an incentivised retirement scheme; it was simply a case of those who had the option to retire doing so on their current terms and conditions which were due to change.  Some people took the option to retire while many others did not.  We are grateful to those who did not because we had a challenge in the health service to maintain services but we managed to maintain a safe service through the grace period, despite dire warnings from the Opposition to the contrary.  A great deal of work remains to be done on the reorganisation of the health service.  When I leave the House later, I will attend the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to launch the new emergency medicine programme, which will improve matters in our accident and emergency departments.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	30	There has been no reduction in 2012 in the number of scheduled outpatient clinics for the specialties referred to due to cost containment at Waterford Regional Hospital.  I have circulated a table with the activity for the hospital for the first five months in 2011 and 2012.  The current initiatives to address waiting times at the hospital are as follows: the existing patient administration system is being modified to facilitate reporting of patients waiting for an outpatient appointment to the National Treatment Purchase Fund from July 2012; all referrals are being uploaded to the patient administration system; and validation of the waiting list will commence once this upload is completeI refer to regional dermatology services.  In line with the Health Service Executive's southern area service plan for 2012, extra resources have been allocated to support the appointment of two additional consultant dermatologists to assist the existing single-handed consultant.  One of these posts is a national cancer control programme, NCCP, post to assist primarily with the skin cancer workload.  The second post is in the HSE's dermatology outpatient clinical programme.The regional orthopaedic service provides the south-east trauma orthopaedic service based at Waterford Regional Hospital as well as the elective orthopaedic surgery service at Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital.  There are 84 orthopaedic clinics held each month, of which 33 are trauma clinics.  The majority of clinics are at Waterford Regional Hospital, with other monthly outpatient outreach clinics taking place throughout the region.In line with the service plan for 2012, three additional physiotherapist posts have been allocated in line with the roll-out of the HSE's national musculoskeletal clinical programme.  Two of the three appointees are now in their posts and it is anticipated this will result in approximately 1,000 appropriately selected patients being seen from the regional orthopaedics and regional rheumatology waiting lists.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.An internal initiative with nurse-led arthroscopy clinics is to commence, which is anticipated to reduce the orthopaedic waiting list by 500 patients annually.  In addition, two other nurse-led clinic initiatives are due to commence - a glaucoma clinic and a macular degeneration clinic – both of which will assist with the provision of new clinic slots for patients requiring a consultant appointment.  The fourth consultant post will be progressed once consultant appointment unit approval in place.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	31	On assuming office, the Government indicated that tackling hospital waiting lists would be one of its top priorities in the area of health service provision.  The Minister has spoken on several occasions about the pain and trauma associated with seriously ill people waiting months and years for treatment.  The statistics for Waterford are horrifying, with 18,925 people on outpatient waiting lists for more than 12 months, one of the highest levels in the country.  The main issue is not the total number of patients on the waiting list but the length of time they are waiting for treatment.  For example, the latest figures show that 5,847 patients are waiting more than a year for orthopaedic outpatient appointments in Waterford, including 570 who are waiting more than four years.  Surely the Minister will accept that these data indicate an index of pain that is unacceptable in the 21st century.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I assure the Deputy that it is the Government's priority to ensure waiting lists are tackled, and we have prioritised action in this area in a very logical fashion.  The most acutely suffering patients are those awaiting treatment in emergency departments, a situation that is being tackled by the special delivery unit.  I am pleased to report that the first five months of this year saw a 20% reduction in the number of patients on trolleys in emergency departments.  There are still far too many in that situation, however, and a great deal of work remains to be done.  Several clinical programmes will be implemented to address the problem, including the intermediate care programme which will ensure, in the first instance, that older people are admitted to a specialist ward and their acute medical care needs are addressed.  Rehabilitation will commence immediately on the ward for such patients and, where it has to be prolonged beyond a week, they will be moved to an intermediate care facility for six to ten weeks.  If, following a careful assessment which rules out the feasibility of a home care package, they are found to require long-term care, they will be accommodated in a transitional facility until their preferred long-term position is available.To sum up, unscheduled care was the first priority of the Government on assuming office, and we are now moving to address problems in the area of scheduled care.  Every hospital in the country, apart from Galway and another facility in the west, met its target of ensuring patients are waiting not longer than 12 months for an appointment.  We have only recently begun, for the first time, to get the figures for outpatients.  These are not complete figures, although we hope such will start to become available from the end of next month.  I have no problem with people knowing the full extent and truth of the situation.  The end figure may be 200,000, or it might even be greater.  To put that in context, 200,000 people are seen every month at outpatient facilities throughout the country.  I am very pleased Deputy Halligan agrees with me that those waiting longest should be treated first, once the urgent cases have been dealt with.  It is not fair that people are left waiting years for treatment.  We never had a handle on outpatient figures before this Government came into office but we are getting a handle on them now and are determined to address the problems in this area.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The response to what the Minister has said is coming from the staff of Waterford Regional Hospital, some of whom have publicly stated that the present situation is untenable.  The problem must be addressed.  I also understand data for differential waiting times for medical card and privately insured patients are not collected annually.  The Minister spoke about tracking trends, but one cannot track them.  Despite the lack of disaggregated data for waiting times, does the Minister accept that we would not find too many private patients who have been waiting for as long as public patients?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I have no difficulty in accepting that, which is why the Government has made it a priority that a system of universal health insurance will be introduced during its lifetime in order that people will be treated based on their medical need, not on what they can afford.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 121 together.In July last year I announced the establishment of the special delivery unit, the development of which is a key part of my plans to radically reform the health system in Ireland.  I identified two key priorities for it, namely, addressing trolley waiting times and reducing the maximum waiting time for elective surgery.  I am happy to say the SDU has delivered notable improvements on both objectives.The next phase of work in the area of unscheduled care includes a focus on monitoring the total patient journey time, including time spent on trolleys, as part of the new national score card for measuring performance.  New target times which are being introduced this year are for 95% of all attendees at emergency departments to be discharged or admitted within six hours of registration and that those who need to be admitted through emergency departments should wait no more than nine hours from registration.  Galway and Roscommon hospitals will be expected to comply with these targets.  This phase commenced in February.Acute hospital services, including complex emergency medicine, must be delivered safely.  We know that the requirements for safe delivery of a clinical service include a sufficient volume of activity to maintain clinical skills.  The delivery of any service in a given hospital will be determined by the level at which that service, in the context of changing clinical and technical practice, can be provided safely.All services provided by the HSE are carried out in the context of HSE service plans and informed by a range of issues, including clinical best practice and patient safety.  The HSE is working with the Health Information and Quality Authority to determine the type of services that can be safely provided across the range of acute facilities.  However, I have requested that no changes take place in service delivery without informing me before their implementation.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	36	We are still not getting clarification from the Minister, even though others and I have been asking for a long time about the fate of accident and emergency services in places such as Loughlinstown, Bantry, Mallow, Navan, Dundalk, Ennis, Portlaoise and Nenagh and whether they will be downgraded, as mooted,  a move I would consider to be utterly unacceptable.  Can we have clarity as to when these decisions will be made and we will be informed?The Minister spoke about the reduction in the number of patients waiting on trolleys and the new target that they would only be waiting six hours either to be admitted or discharged.  Are these claims of success belied by the fact that in the first four months of the year 26,000 patients had to wait on trolleys?  The reason there has been a reduction in the number is that the Minister is packing trolleys and beds into wards and essentially causing overcapacity.  The real problem is that he is refusing to reopen the 2,000 beds which have been closed in the system and provide the necessary staff.  He seems to be considering closing accident and emergency services in smaller hospitals.  However, this does not add up.  He cannot seriously suggest he is going to improve the position when the bottom line is that 2,000 beds have been closed, there are not enough staff and he is planning to close or downgrade accident and emergency services in a number of hospitals.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	37	As I stated in response to an earlier question, we have reduced the number of people on trolleys by 20%.  I have acknowledged there are too many people waiting on trolleys and that we are now to move to a model using the total patient journey time.  There has been much criticism in some newspapers of the employment of consultants from the United Kingdom who have behind them the achievement of a four hour journey time from registration to either admission or discharge.  They are in this country, on relatively short-term contracts, to help us get a handle on how our system is managed.  The system and the management thereof have constituted the problem.  We have excellent doctors and nurses, and some excellent managers and administrators, but the system itself, because of the central control and command, has disempowered the front-line staff and those at local level from making the sorts of decisions they need to make to have the service run more effectively and efficiently.  We are addressing that.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Is what has disempowered the front line not the fact that it has been massacred in terms of numbers?  Some 5,000 nurses and midwives have been lost from the system.  Some 2,000 have been lost in the past year and, as I said, 2,400 beds have been closed.  The front-line workers and the INMO and other organisations are saying that is the problem the Minister needs to address.The target of six hours from registration to either discharge or admission seems utterly fantastic given the backdrop of cuts being imposed on staff and beds and the fact not even the nine hour target has been met.  The HSE performance report shows not a single hospital in the health service has met the nine hour target, never mind the six hour target.  Is it all a question of bandying figures, indicating targets that are unrealistic and massaging the trolley figures by simply packing too many trolleys and beds into wards that do not have sufficient capacity or staff?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The Deputy's contention on packing trolleys into wards is utterly untrue.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	40	It is not untrue.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	41	There is a full capacity protocol, which has four bars to it.  It has been in operation.  It is not ideal but it is far safer to have patients in wards than in emergency departments.  International practice and research have proven that.  It is a matter of working differently and having shorter stays in hospital, more primary care and chronic illness care in the community.  All these developments will take time.The Deputy asked about small hospitals.  That issue is being addressed through a small hospital framework document, which will be circulated shortly to the various interested parties for consultation.  Local politicians will be included.We are about maintaining safe services and appropriate services in the hospitals.  As I stated previously, all the brouhaha about the removal of some services from the small hospitals will be nothing by comparison with the riot that will occur when we start to remove from the bigger hospitals services that more rightly belong in the smaller ones.  We are determined to do so, however.  Let the large type 4 hospital deal with the tertiary and regional care issues it should be dealing with.  It never made sense to me that people with varicose veins and inguinal hernias should be going to big hospitals such as Beaumont, the Mater and St. Vincent's.  It is like sending a ten year old Volkswagen to the Ferrari testing centre to have it serviced.  It does not make sense, although it would surely do a great job.The Deputy mentioned Portlaoise hospital.  It is not in the group in question as it is a level 3 hospital.

Is it not the case we cannot move patients from accident and emergency departments into the wards if there is not adequate provision of beds to cater to that need?  Are we not creating a continuing crisis for people, particularly in accident and emergency departments?  This has its echo throughout all hospital systems.  I urge the Minister, as he was a voice here over a long period of time and made the case consistently in Opposition, to recognise that, while there are other aspects to it, some of which he has named, we cannot continue to keep our heads in the sand in relation to the 2,400 acute hospital beds which, according to the INMO, are now closed.  Whether he accepts that figure or the HSE's lesser figure is academic.  It is the need that exists.  I would join others in appealing to the Minister to accept that and address as urgent the need for the reintroduction of beds within the system and even to give us a sense of a plan or timeframe within which he will work towards this and, equally importantly, the lifting of the recruitment embargo.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	43	There were many issues raised.  We have had the emergency department crisis running for several years.  There was a ten-point plan issued several years ago at the height of the Celtic tiger and it failed to address this issue.  The issue here has not been moneyper se alone.  It must be about reforming the way we work and the system we work in, and that is what we are about.I want to place on the record of the House my gratitude to all those working in the front line who have done sterling work to maintain a safe service, as I stated, during the grace period and also to achieve the progress they have achieved to date.We in this House and everybody working in the health service knows there is a great deal more to do.  We know there is waste and inefficiency.  We know we have a system that is a whole of itself and no one part of it can function independently of the others.We have a considerable job of work to do in terms of sorting out primary care and ensuring the right patient is seen by the right person at the right time.  There is a great deal of work consultants are doing that GPs could be doing, there is a great deal of work GPs are doing that nurses could be doing, and there is much work that nurses are doing that health care assistants are doing.One must ask the question why it is that one model for a hospital in this country has nine nurses to each health care assistant while another has three.  Why can some community nursing units only manage a ratio of one nurse to one health care assistant when the London School of Nursing recommends one nurse to 2.5 health care assistants in a community nursing unit?  There is a host of stuff.I mentioned physiotherapy in one of the other questions.  This is important because it shows we can change the way we work.  In Cork, they succeeded in this, and it started in the UK.  They screened GP referrals to consultants for orthopaedics and found that 40% of them did not need to see the surgeon at all.  The physiotherapist was able to deal with them.  I am sure that applies to other areas with other specialties too.  Then we have a nonsensical system where if one wants to get counselling for a patient in the public system, one must refer him or her to the psychiatric clinic.  A whole host of things must change.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, eligibility for public health services in Ireland is based primarily on residency and means.  All persons normally resident in the State are eligible for inpatient and outpatient public hospital services, including consultant services.  It is unacceptable for a patient to be informed at short notice that a hospital will not treat them because they are in the wrong catchment area, and my Department has been working with the HSE to clarify its policy in this area.A letter issued to all hospitals on 15 May from the national directors of the HSE and the chief operating officer of the special delivery unit, SDU, setting out the position on catchment areas.  With immediate effect all hospitals were instructed to refrain from any further limiting of historic catchment areas, that is, to further refusal of referrals from areas from which such referrals have been accepted since 2009.  This will be retrospective to the start of this year, in most cases subject to discussion.  This will apply to both new referrals and to existing patients in long-term care or treatment.My prime objective is to ensure the safety of patients and I am pleased to say this issue was given the immediate attention it required and was dealt with in a rapid and efficient manner.  I am confident the regional directors of operations, RDOs, working with the hospitals have gained their full co-operation in eradicating this issue.  The SDU will continue to work with the HSE to embed improved GP referral systems which will enhance patient access to the health services.

Both responses invite more questions than they answer.  In the response on 6 June, the Minister speaks of "informal catchment areas", issues with the areas that are "typically cyclical" and in referring to hospitals, he referred "to what they view" as their catchment areas.  In the 6 June reply, the Minister's opening line states, "any individual hospital often has a number of ‘catchment areas' reflecting the different geographic areas" depending on the procedure being sought or the particular referral type.There is a strange situation here and it is vague and unclear.  Are there hospital catchment areas officially recognised by the HSE or are there not?  It must come down to simple questions.  If there are, can we have a map of these catchment areas that apply across the network of acute hospital sites throughout the country.  In the particular instance that gave rise to the question in the first place, and while I welcome the address, as the Minister has indicated, it was where a patient was unable to secure the procedure in the hospital within his area of domicile.  He sought access to St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin, which specialises in the procedure, but was told it would not look after him because he did not live within the catchment area.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I made quite clear what we have done to address it.  I will relieve Deputy Ó Caoláin's confusion for him on why different procedures have different catchment areas.  It is simple and we alluded to it only a minute ago.  There are hospitals that are local, there are hospitals that provide regional services and, therefore, the region becomes their catchment areas, and there are hospitals that have national tertiary services, the catchment area of which is the country.What has arisen in this case is that some hospitals, with their budgetary constraints, saw that patients were not in their regular catchment area for ordinary secondary care and would not accept them when in the past they had been accepting them.  We have stopped that.  This will not be a problem under money-follows-the-patient, which is rolling out as we speak.  We started in orthopaedics and it will roll out across all the specialties.  Under that scenario, hospitals will be getting paid for each patient whom they treat.  This is another really important part of getting rid of a self-serving system and turning it back into a patient-centred service.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	50	In the his reply to the question on 6 June, the Minister went on to state that it had been "agreed in the interim that any planned and agreed changes in referrals-catchment areas should not impact on patients who are already on a waiting list in a particular hospital or are patients in long term care/treatment".  That is fine in terms of those who are already there, but these are important decisions.  Where are these decisions being made?  Who is making determinations of changes in catchment areas?  Who is the body of persons entrusted with this task?  Is there any engagement with the public in terms of the raft of experiences?  We have only cited one in terms of the question for written answer on 6 June.What can the Minister advise in the current examination of all this?  Is it within the HSE, are there specific catchment areas properly and officially recognised by the HSE in relation to these hospitals, and can the Minister provide us with copies of that information?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I will not be providing Deputy Ó Caoláin with copies of that information.  This is a consultation process that will be predicated on safe clinical practice, but also on the principle, to which I alluded in the previous answer, around the smaller hospital framework.  If we are going to have a situation where we want the larger hospitals that have that received investment to deliver the tertiary services and the regional services, such as neurosurgery and cardiac surgery, then we must advise patients that they should be going to their local hospital for the ordinary procedures, such as gall bladder, varicose veins and inguinal hernia repair.People should attend third or fourth level hospitals only where there is serious comorbidity and risk.All Deputies are exercised about the future of small hospitals.  I want to ensure smaller hospitals have a vigorous and full workload, are performing procedures and providing services that are safe, while leaving more complex procedures to larger hospitals.  I will not tolerate large hospitals trying to hold on to all their services, as has been the case in the past.  They may be good at accepting new services, especially in areas such as cancer care, but they are reluctant to transfer other services to smaller hospitals.  Member do not agree with that approach.

The equipping and commissioning phase should take approximately three months following completion of the building.

As she will be aware, a psychiatric unit was promised at Beaumont Hospital 25 years ago when the hospital was constructed.  I understand she turned the sod for the new mental health unit in January.  Is she confident the January 2013 timeframe is a realisable deadline?

Will she also assure the House that, against the background of many other concerns Deputies have about existing service units, the new unit will be adequately staffed and resourced to meet the day-to-day needs of its cohort of residents and service users?  Given that it will not be completed for another six or seven months, will she advise when the new unit will be put into service?  What interim arrangements have been made in the north Dublin area following the decision to cease admissions to St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane?  I have received many representations and expressions of concern on this matter, as has, I have no doubt, the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, who is a resident of the area and represents the Dublin North constituency.  The wider population across north Dublin is concerned about local psychiatric services.

On foot of serious concerns the commission had expressed about St. Ita's Hospital, a number of residents of the facility were transferred to St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, as part of a temporary arrangement.As the new mental health unit at Beaumont Hospital is an acute facility under licence from the Mental Health Commission, it must fulfil the staffing obligations laid down in the Mental Health Act.  Staff levels at the unit must correspond with the level determined by the commission.  We should not have any concerns in that respect.The Government cannot ignore an instruction from the Mental Health Commission.  For this reason, the project is proceeding and by the summer of 2013, it will be built, equipped and accessible to those for whom it has been specifically designed.  The safeguard we have in this respect is that we must respond to demands made by the commission.

My notes indicate that the north Dublin area is under significant pressure as a result of staff shortages, the ending of admissions to St. Ita's Hospital and the retirement of psychiatric nurses.  While the impact of retirements is not unique to north Dublin, they are certainly causing a particular problem in the area.  On what has been described as a "temporary arrangement", does St. Vincent's Hospital in Fairview have the potential to meet projected demand in the next 12 months?  It will be at least one year before the new facility opens, hiccups or snag lists that may present aside.We discussed last December's promise to make 414 additional appointments in mental health services, for which funding has been provided.  Will the Minister of State indicate what progress has been made in that regard?  Will any of these appointments be designated for the new facility or, given that they are supposed to be in place before the end of the year, the north Dublin area?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The use of St. Vincent's Hospital in Fairview is a temporary arrangement and those currently residing in the hospital will be moved into the new unit in accordance with the wishes expressed during consultation with them and their families.  A particular issue arises with regard to staffing in the Dublin and mid-Leinster region.  Having met its targets in terms of reducing bed numbers and in its community based service, the recent exodus of nurses pushed staffing numbers in the region below a safe level.  This issue is being addressed.On the 414 additional posts, people are being recruited from panels in the other three regions and new panels will be established, where required.  The appointees will be in place by the end of the summer.  On the Dublin and mid-Leinster region-----

The list of medicinal products provided under the scheme is reviewed on a regular basis.  The application in respect of the product in question is under consideration.The HSE has identified the potential for a significant budget impact with this product and it has, therefore, been referred to the HSE drugs group which examines how new medicines can be introduced into clinical care pathways as and when resources become available.  In addition, the chief medical officer has been requested to engage with the HSE to examine the current decision making process and ensure a robust system is in place to drive decision making around medicines and evidence based prescribing.  It is expected that the chief medical officer will report on this matter in the coming weeks.I am pleased to inform Deputies that we have agreed with the pharmaceutical companies on a sum of moneys to be reimbursed to us which will allow us to open negotiations on a more comprehensive deal and release the new drugs in question.

Clinical trials and international evidence show the drug can give quality of life to people with the condition.  It is an oral-based therapy, which should decrease the cost of its provision by the HSE.There is a broader issue at stake.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics assesses the impact of and the value for money provided by high-tech medicines.  We have reduced dramatically the base level at which we consider a drug to be suitable in terms of improved quality of life.  However, the reduction from €45,000 to €20,000 means we are playing God with more people.  This cannot be allowed to continue and it will have a devastating impact on people's ability to access high quality, high-tech innovative drugs that make a difference in terms of quality of life.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The pharmacological unit carries out a health technology assessment of a medication, but that is only part of the equation.  The HSE has a group that further advises on and evaluates the matter above and beyond what the pharmacological unit has stated and the health technology assessment has shown.  It is not true to say, therefore, that this alone decides whether a drug will be made available.  The "Ipi" drug would never meet the health technology assessment requirements, but there were wider considerations taken into account by the group, given its impact on patients, and, therefore, it was made available.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I welcome the initial comments made by the Minister.  He has said the decision will be made in a matter of weeks.  Is he talking about two, three, five or six weeks?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	66	It will be made as soon as is practicable.  That is all I can say.  In the case of some of these drugs, it is not as simple as making a decision today, following which it will be available immediately.  There are other things that have to be done and the position is different in the case of each drug.  There is a major responsibility on everybody to be involved, not just policymakers and politicians but also clinicians who prescribe these drugs and the drug companies that produce them.  No matter how well the economy is doing, we have limited resources and have to prioritise in how we accommodate a new drug.  Other drugs have to make room for it within the pot.  This means that they have to drop in price.  That is only right and proper.  Clinicians need to engage, as do patient groups, as well as policymakers and politicians.

It is available in the neighbouring jurisdiction and most European countries.  At last Thursday's meeting of the Oireachtas health committee the Minister rightly referred to the frustration caused in engaging with the pharmaceutical industry, particularly by its slowness to engage, bring down prices and address all of these issues.  Will he elaborate on the progress he is making in making Gilenya available?  Is the slowness of the industry to engage a factor in this regard?  What about its reluctance to accept the critical need to reduce the high cost of medicines for all citizens?

However, the pharmacoeconomics centre stated recently that €45,000 was the threshold.  Who decided that it should be reduced to €20,000?  This rules out a lot of high-tech drugs being made available or which it is recommended should be made available at the very least.  This is a fundamental factor in the availability of high-tech and breakthrough drugs.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	69	The decision was made within the HSE and the pharmacological unit.  I will have to find out for the Deputy precisely which individuals were involved.  As the drugs are being made available, nobody will suffer loss as a consequence.  The last thing anybody wants to do, or the last thing anybody should do, he or she a doctor, a politician or the Minister for Health, is to play God.  That is a not a place I ever want to be in.  We have to have a societal answer which involves all of the people mentioned, namely, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, politicians and members of society at large, as represented by patient groups and others.  We are always going to have this issue, especially the question of how drugs are priced.  Sometimes one wonders if prices are just plucked out of the air.  We all understand research and development are very important and encourage those involved, as we are very mindful of the importance of the pharmaceutical industry in this country.  At the same time, however, some of the prices need to be subject to scrutiny.  We will be doing this.  To answer Deputy Ó Caoláin's question, the drugs reference pricing Bill which will be brought forward before the summer will go a long way towards addressing this issue.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Next week's summit has been described as "do or die" for the euro so serious and urgent is the situation facing us.  Analysts are predicting that Spain will require a full sovereign bailout.  Its bond yields have risen to unsustainable levels and the situation in Italy is equally serious and urgent.  We know that a committee of what are known as the four wise men - Van Rompuy, Juncker, Barroso and Draghi - is meeting to come up with proposals and more or less examining a newer version of the European Union treaties to create a fiscal union.  Various proposals have been articulated which we have discussed in the House, including a banking union, a fiscal union, giving the ESM a banking licence and giving additional regulatory powers to the European Central Bank.  The single most important thing that could be done to save the euro would be to enable the European Central Bank to become a lender of last resort.  Will the Taoiseach outline the Government's position on the European Union?  Fifteen months into its lifetime, it is hard to discern its position on such fundamental issues, particularly the creation of a fiscal union which is now being identified as essential to save the euro.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that changes of this scale would necessitate significant changes to the existing European Union treaties and a further referendum in Ireland to facilitate consideration of such changes?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I recall the Deputy saying not one comma of the memorandum of understanding agreed with this country would be or could be changed.  There is a difference between what people might want to have in a European context and what is actually achievable.  The issues raised by the Deputy are all part of speculative discussions.The agenda for the European Heads of Government meeting has not yet been determined by President Van Rompuy.  I assume that following the meetings of the G20 and G8, there will be further analysis of what is going to be Europe's response.  It is important to understand that the situation which has unfolded in the recent period has probably gone against the head - from some perspectives - for Europe.  Ireland gave a very strong and clear decision in respect of the fiscal stability treaty, the people of Greece made a very clear decision in respect of their view on the kind of government which should hold power in their country and the people of France made a clear decision in the context of bestowing an overall majority on President Hollande.  In addition, we had the first movement in a bailout for Spanish banks amounting to €100 billion.  Obviously, this did not solve the problem.  The Deputy will be aware that €3 billion in Spanish 12 and 18-month bills issued this morning at 5.07% and 5.1%, respectively.  In comparison, the rates achieved at the auctions in May were 2.98% and 3.30%.The issues that have been raised here are extremely serious and sensitive in nature.  Questions are being asked, not only by the United States but also by Canada, India and China, as to what is going to be the response from the eurozone countries.  Within the range of issues the Deputy mentioned, it is necessary to consider what can be achieved in the short, medium and long terms.  It has been my view for some time that giving the ESM a licensed facility to inject money directly into the banking system is important.  Equally important is the separation of the sovereign from the banking crisis.  That is an issue which could have been addressed in this country a number of years ago but it was not.Fiscal union is not going to be achieved in the shorter term.  It is clear that there is vehement opposition on the part of many countries to elements of fiscal union.  We have made it very clear that we would support, in principle, a banking union.  In my view, such a union could be achieved in a relatively short time if the political will exists.  However, as I informed the Deputy on previous occasions, there are 17 different governments - with one bank - and they all have their own opinions.  As far as Ireland is concerned, we have obviously been working for quite some time with our colleagues and counterparts in the troika in respect of a re-engineering of the promissory note.  Deputy Martin will be aware that the troika is finalising its technical paper on this matter.  The negotiations to which I refer are continuing.The agenda for next week's meeting has not been drafted and it will not be drafted until the G20 and the G8 conclude their deliberations in Mexico.  A two-day ECOFIN meeting will take place this week.  I assume the questions the Deputy has raised will, in part, be included on the agenda for that meeting.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I did not really receive a reply to the question I asked regarding the Government's position on the fundamental changes that have been articulated.  The Taoiseach stated that the agenda has not be specified by President Van Rompuy.  However, all analysts are stating that said agenda is quite straightforward, namely, how can we save the euro.  There is also a question relating to the steps that can be taken at the summit to give some confidence to the markets that the euro can be saved.  The matters to which the Taoiseach referred - the referendum on the fiscal stability treaty, the failed bailout relating to the Spanish banks and the elections in Greece and France - have had no impact on the central question facing us in respect of the sustainability and survival of the euro.  The two big issues relating to the euro relate to Italy and Spain.  In that context, consideration must be given to the steps that can be taken in respect of ensuring a sustainable confidence in the capacity of the European Union-----

I ask that it publish such a paper because I am of the view that such questions are going to come our way sooner than the Taoiseach thinks.  We need to be honest and up-front with the people and outline the relevant issues for them in a transparent fashion.  It should not be a case of the four wise men on the committee coming in behind the scrum and of the issues eventually being articulated for the public.  Will the Taoiseach publish a paper in respect of the Government's position on Europe?  Will he indicate what issues he has put on the agenda, from an Irish perspective, for next week's meeting?

Do I not recall that it was the philosophy of the Government of which he was a member to state that this was the cheapest bailout in history?  Remember that?  Does the Deputy remember the fact that people did not even realise that the IMF had arrived on our shores?  Of course we should be honest and up-front with the people.

The result in the French election was also very clear.  However, these have not have an impact on the banking crisis.  I have made the point before that this is a banking crisis within the eurozone.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I thought the Taoiseach stated previously that it was somebody else's crisis.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	84	What is required, therefore, is a European response at a political level.  The Deputy is well aware, from all of the reports and analysis to which he refers, of the range of difference that exists.  Some analysts want the sovereign to be separated from the banking debt and we support that suggestion.  Others want the ESM to be licensed to inject money directly into banks and we also support this suggestion.  I was one of the first to put this suggestion forward.Ireland continues to seek a re-engineering of the promissory note that was drafted in the way that it was.  The Deputy is aware that this note requires the Government to produce or borrow €3 billion per year.  The first element of this has, admittedly through a convoluted process, been put out to 2025.  We are not happy with that as an end result.  As has been pointed out on numerous occasions, this is a medium-term project and I do not expect answers in respect of it by next week.It is important to say that the statements made by Commissioner Rehn and the IMF are important in the context of Ireland.  It is not a case of publishing a paper.  The various issues to which the Deputy referred all form part of the discussions and the need to deal with some is more immediate than is the case with others.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	85	What is the country's position?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	86	In the context of Ireland's position, what we want is a re-engineering of our promissory note.  In so far as Europe and the eurozone are concerned, I would like adequate firewalls to be put in place.  I would also like the structure of the ESM to be changed in order that it might inject money directly into the banking system.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	87	That would require a referendum.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The domiciliary allowance is a monthly payment made to families with children who have disabilities so severe that they require care, attention or supervision substantially in excess of that required by other children of the same age.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that this morning, parents from the Domiciliary Care Allowance, DCA, Warriors group travelled to the Dáil to raise again the issue of allowances for the families of children with disabilities.  When they arrived, they invited him and his Government to walk a mile in their children's shoes.  I applaud them for their campaigning work on these issues.  I want the Taoiseach to explain to the Dáil why the Government felt it necessary to write to the thousands of families in receipt of this payment and to place the payment under threat.  He should be aware of the real anxiety and worry the review letters that were sent out have caused.The stress to which I refer is added to by the unfairness relating to and lack of transparency in the decision-making process used to award the allowance in the first instance.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, announced last month that she would review this process.  I welcome that development.  When will the review be completed?  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that while the process is under way, no parent or child will have the domiciliary care allowance cut off?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	94	This allowance is paid at the rate of €309.50 per month.  The rate has not been reduced by the Government and it is not intended to reduce it.  The State pays domiciliary care allowance to parents and guardians to recognise the role they play in bringing up their children.  It was introduced in the 1970s in recognition of the extra care and attention many parents provided for children with a severe disability who were cared for in their own homes.  Responsibility remained with the health boards and the HSE until April 2009 when it was transferred to the then Department of Social and Family Affairs and the scheme was put on a statutory footing.  Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment to the parent or guardian of a child who requires care, attention or supervision substantially in excess of that required for other children.  The allowance has not been reduced by the Government.  Last May the Minister did say she proposed to carry out a policy review.  The proposed terms of reference have been set out by the Minister who will bring a memo to the Cabinet shortly.  It is her intention, once the membership of the group is finalised, to get the review under way as soon as possible.  The first meeting will take place around the middle of July and monthly meetings will be held thereafter until the end of the year.  This is a serious and sensitive matter.  As such, the Minister has been careful in her comments about the requirements of the review and how it is to be carried out.  It is also important to say there was no reduction in the domiciliary care allowance of €309.50 payable in respect of each child.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	95	As ever, the Taoiseach has not answered my questions.  The matter is not the rate at which the allowance is payable but the awarding of it.  I hope the Taoiseach is aware of the considerable distress caused to families throughout the country by letters referring to a review of the award of the allowance.  I note that the Taoiseach has accepted that the process by which the allowance is awarded is flawed, lacks transparency and must be reformed.  Meanwhile, he must provide some level of reassurance for families with children who have severe disabilities that their payment is not under threat.  I ask him to make that commitment.  Meanwhile, the review of the process is under way.  Will the Taoiseach make a commitment that no family will have the domiciliary care payment withdrawn?  That is a straightforward question to which he must give a straightforward answer.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	125	That would be an outrageous thing to suggest.Since the Government introduced the hated and unjust household charge, there has been an unprecedented campaign of mass boycott and resistance to this attempt to impose further unjust austerity on ordinary people.  Last week even the IMF had to acknowledge the scale of the popular campaign of opposition to the hated household charge and suggest the Government address issues of fairness in its policies.  At the weekend even Labour Party backbenchers started to get the jitters when they heard the outrageous suggestion the Government was thinking of circumventing the boycott campaign by taking the successor property tax directly from people's pay packets through the PAYE system.  This suggestion blows apart the Government claim that the planned property charge has anything to do with equity or fairness.  It is just another tax on workers.Why does the Taoiseach not admit that the Government's efforts to impose household charges and property taxes on ordinary working people are a shambles?  They are not wanted by the people, are unjust and should be completely abandoned.

Why does the Taoiseach not save thousands of ordinary people the trouble of buying bus and train tickets to Dublin on that date by telling them he is abandoning the household charge or any property charge aimed at low and middle income families?

Were the minority who have not yet paid the household charge to do so, the Minister for Social Protection and everyone else would find it easier to deal with sensitive cases.  The Deputy who has been elected in the same way as everyone else chooses to tell people deliberately to break the law.  He should be ashamed of himself.  He has decided to have his national march which he seems to need as a monthly fix on 18 July.  He should not assume the Dáil will rise for the summer recess on that date.  He might be speaking in Molesworth Street on that day, but he might find the Dáil will sit for a further period.  I would be careful about that if I were he.  The memorandum of understanding and the troika agreement in respect of the country's programme require that a value tax on property be introduced.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.Since I have taken office I have visited Northern Ireland on four separate occasions.  The first, sadly, was to attend the funeral of PSNI Officer Ronan Kerr who was killed just over one year ago.  I attended the opening of the new Peace Bridge in Derry last June which was a highly symbolic visit.  In November I visited Belfast for a number of engagements, following which I attended the plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, in Armagh.  I returned to Belfast on 19 April when I gave the annual Chancellor's lecture at the University of Ulster.The Government strongly supports the efforts of the Northern Ireland Executive and as co-guarantor of the peace process with the British Government, we wish to see the stable political and security situation continue in Northern Ireland.  I have met the First and Deputy First Ministers on several occasions, both in Northern Ireland and in this jurisdiction, including at events such as the presidential inauguration and during the visit of Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping.  My discussions with them have always been constructive as we seek to engage on a range of issues affecting both jurisdictions.  I have met with a variety of other Northern Ireland politicians both during my visits to Northern Ireland and in Dublin, including most recently Mr. Mike Nesbitt, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and his deputy leader, Mr. John McCallister.Contact at ministerial level North and South continues throughout the year through a programme of meetings that are held between plenary sessions of the North-South Ministerial Council.  The NSMC institutional meeting took place on 27 April and was chaired by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.I hosted the 14th NSMC plenary meeting in Dublin on Friday, 15 June.  There was a very good discussion between members of the Cabinet and the Northern Ireland Executive including on the economic situation both at home and across the European Union.  Jobs and growth are absolute priorities for us all.  I indicated that the Government will work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive in the lead up to and during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union to be held from 1 January 2013.  We also discussed a range of important issues of common interest including bank restructuring and NAMA and other areas where the NSMC has seen good progress such as in education, health, research and innovation, transport and tourism.  Both you, a Cheann Comhairle, and Speaker Hay are to be commended for the efforts they have made and are making in respect of the North-South parliamentary forum.  We recognise the importance to our economies and tourism sectors of major events such as the forthcoming Irish Open in Portrush; the success this year of theTitanic experience in Belfast, which has and is attracting record crowds; and next year The Gathering; the Derry City of Culture; and the Fleadh Cheoil.We reviewed progress on the A5-A8 roads projects.  The A5 is of particular importance to the north west as it will greatly improve connections between the region and Dublin and Belfast.  Despite the very difficult economic situation we face, the Government remains committed to this project.  At the plenary meeting last Friday, I again reaffirmed our commitment to contribute £22 million sterling in each year 2015 and 2016 which will enable two major sections of the roads project to proceed.  I also made it clear that we will examine the prospect of an additional funding contribution after 2016, in the context of our next capital expenditure review framework, which is likely to be in 2015.We noted the good progress that has been made in other areas of North-South co-operation, such as the north-west gateway initiative.  We also discussed some of the institutional aspects of the Good Friday and St. Andrews agreements, including on the North-South parliamentary forum.  A programme of North-South Ministerial Council meetings, up to the next plenary meeting to take place in November, was agreed.  In summary, North-South co-operation is progressing steadily.  I recognise that there is room for greater levels of co-operation to the mutual benefit of everyone on the island.  Through the framework of the NSMC I look forward to seeing further progress being made in this regard over the coming period.The next British-Irish Council Summit will take place in Stirling, Scotland this Friday, 22 June.  Its main theme will be marine energy and there will also be a focus on youth unemployment, a topic we discussed at the previous British-Irish Council Summit which I hosted in Dublin in January.As I said recently in a reply in this House I hope to be in a position to visit Belfast again shortly.  Arrangements will be made in due course for that visit.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I have tabled five of the 11 questions being taken together.  The reply illustrates a certain sense of drift in North-South relations.  I get no sense of urgency or active engagement between the Governments on the North-South agenda.  In concrete terms there is no real urgency in pushing co-operation forward or in fulfilling the potential of the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement.  We should remember that the Good Friday Agreement is about a process, not an end in itself.  I have no sense that the Government, with the British Government, are committed with the parties in Northern Ireland and the Executive in having a far more effective and productive North-South delivery and engagement into the future.  It seems that little substantive time has been given by the Irish and British Governments to North-South issues during the past 12 months.  There is a sense of drift and a lack of anything new.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to me in concrete terms what advances have been made in the North-South agenda in the past year?  Has anything concrete emerged in terms of the timetable for the establishment of the North-South parliamentary forum?  Regarding the review of North-South bodies, has the creation of additional bodies, in particular one to replace the Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, been discussed?  When are we likely to see progress in the review of North-South bodies?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I suppose that one of the things that causes Deputy Martin's perception of this is the actual normality that has been restored between the Assembly and the activities of the Oireachtas.  I have outlined much of what has happened since the last meeting.  Clearly, the impact of, for instance, the Titanic Experience has been enormous in the sense of the number of visitors flocking to Belfast.  Clearly, with the performance of Graham McDowell and others, the Irish Open in Portrush will be of pretty significant importance in terms of numbers going to it.When one looks at it, dealing with the reduction in corporation tax, for instance, is an issue that is a matter for the British Government and the Assembly.  There was a discussion about that at the North-South Ministerial Council.  A great deal of work has been carried out on that.  There were quite a deal of discussions on health, for instance, with the opening of the new South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen, which the Minister made perfectly clear was also open to patients from Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo, if necessary.  As to the question of the sharing of services in Altnagelvin Area Hospital for radiotherapy, to which the State contributed, it is open to people from County Donegal and so on.  The same applies in the issues that are now being discussed with the Ministers for education.  There was agreement on Friday that third level education and its capacity and potential should be issues for discussion at the next meeting.  Work is ongoing there between both of those Ministers.I do not want to interfere in the work that is going on between the Ceann Comhairle and Speaker Hay in respect of the North-South parliamentary forum except to say that the Ceann Comhairle informed me formally by letter of having received a number of papers that were quite constructive in the sense of being able to set this up.  I commend Speaker Hay and the Ceann Comhairle on their efforts in this.  I think that will be an important element of the process, as Deputy Martin rightly pointed out, that began way back with the Good Friday Agreement.I do not accept that there is any sense of drift.  What is becoming perfectly evident is the normality of relations between the peoples of Northern Ireland and the Republic and the normal relations that are evident in the work going on between the Oireachtas, its agencies and bodies and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I have had a number of meetings with the First and Deputy First Ministers, for instance, at last Friday's meeting.  Both the First and Deputy First Ministers want to go to China later on in the year.  I think it will be in November.  We have agreed to make available to them all of the contacts that were established following Vice President Xi Jinping's visit here and my own visit to China along with the Ministers, Deputies Bruton and Coveney.  It just shows the impact of how quickly things can happen.  Protocols were signed in respect of China importing pork, beef and seafood, including fresh fish, from Ireland.  We want to make these connections available to the First and Deputy First Ministers and their delegation.It is normal and working well.  If there is a particular issue that Deputy Martin thinks is not receiving sufficient attention, I would be happy to follow up on it.  The close relationship between the Ministers for justice, Mr. Ford and Deputy Shatter, was perfectly evident at the North-South Ministerial Council meeting last Friday.  It is not usual for two Ministers for justice to attend like that, but there is a great deal of co-operation, for example, in intelligence sharing and services sharing, in respect of the issues with which they are dealing.From that perspective, I found the meeting to be very constructive.  As the Deputy First Minister said, a great deal of the issues that were set out were, in Civil Service language, dispensed with.  Any difficulty that we had in respect of, for example, the A5 and A8, was very clear.  We have committed to the £22 million sterling in 2015 and 2016.  We are also committed to reviewing the possibility of any further financial contribution beyond that when we look at the review framework in due course.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I remain unconvinced by that answer.  The entire North-South agenda needs a fresh initiative, fresh engagement and an injection of additionality to what we have experienced to date.  The former Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen, made clear commitments to the A5 and A8 projects some years ago, but they have been somewhat diluted since.  This is a great pity.Regarding the review of North-South bodies, I get no sense of moving the agenda on in terms of what additional bodies could be established to the island's benefit.  Discussions on co-operation as regards Altnagelvin Area Hospital and oncology services have been ongoing for three or four years.  I am seeing nothing new in terms of hard, concrete, practical steps that can be taken on a North-South basis.  Nothing I have heard today suggests otherwise.  I am not mistaking this for normality.  We have had good relations since the Good Friday Agreement and there have been good initiatives under the various North-South bodies and agencies that were subsequently established, from InterTradeIreland to the Food Safety Promotion Board and from Tourism Ireland to Waterways Ireland.  In the early days, these had concrete, substantive, project-based achievements that delivered considerable momentum.  Nothing of that calibre is in evidence currently.With the British Government and the Northern Executive, will the Taoiseach commit to examining the North-South agenda seriously, in particular the review of North-South bodies, which has been waiting for some time to be signed off on?  What are the conclusions of the review and what is the Government's response to an additional North-South agency?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	181	There was no conclusion at the meeting on Friday about additional bodies.  Clearly, there were a number of issues outstanding in regard to some of the existing bodies.  For instance, the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, committed to working with his counterpart in respect of the continued planning of the Erne Canal, which has been an issue for a very long time.  There is no funding for it now, but there is no reason to believe one cannot put in place a strategy and a plan to open it.  It would have enormous implications for tourism.A number of groups have been seeking to see me.  I have committed to meeting relatives of those who were killed at Ballymurphy.  I also said the same thing on Friday to the Minister, Mr. Kennedy, in respect of Kings Mill.When Deputy Martin says "fresh impetus", "new initiative" and "new ideas", I am only too interested in hearing what these might be.  The North-South jobs and employment situation is one of great interest.  We discussed the scale of the public sector in Northern Ireland.  As Deputy Martin knows, it is exceptionally large in terms of numbers.  The issues that affect the construction and building sector and the creation of jobs and employment are not new, but it is important that new initiatives be taken to stimulate these areas.It is more than just Altnagelvin.  We did not have any discussion before about the South West Acute Hospital.  The point was that it was open for patient care for people from Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo.There are exciting opportunities in the whole area of third level education, as well as second level where appropriate.  Both Ministers are working on an exciting programme there.  It is not a case of saying this has ground to a halt just because matters are normal.  We have had questions on PEACE III projects and some delays involved between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and its counterpart.  This is being ironed out by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and his officials.  These are all issues and events to be completed.Of concern to the Deputy, and everyone else, is the question of community involvement.  Unemployment is a big issue particularly for young men.  We do not want the rise of dissident activity encouraging young men in particular to go the wrong way.  That is why community facilities and interaction are important.  When I was in London in March, I signed the strategic partnership agreement in Downing Street with the British Prime Minister.  Both he and I agreed to visit Northern Ireland on as regular a basis as is possible - not at the same time - to involve different communities and projects.  This would keep it at a high level of interest and demonstrate political support for the work communities are doing there.  That is fundamental to what we should be at.If Deputy Martin has particular or fresh initiatives in mind, I would be happy to hear from him.  The working groups, with some changes that have been made, will keep this at a high level.  Perhaps we might discuss this before I go up there in the next several weeks.  If there are issues which require our attention, we would be happy to involve ourselves in them.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	184	No, I said on behalf of Deputy Adams.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I am glad to hear the Taoiseach sound a positive note in respect of the potential afforded by North-South co-operation.  I note from the communique from the North-South Ministerial Council meeting that issues around the economy, the eurozone crisis and fiscal developments were discussed.  In these challenging times when money is tight with the ongoing air of uncertainty internationally, it is a no-brainer and makes perfect sense for us, North and South, to maximise areas of co-operation including the potential for inward investment.  It is welcome the contacts the Government has made in China will be made available to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  We need, however, at some stage to be talking about joint delegations and missions as we are looking for investment into a small country and a small island.  We have yet to reap the benefits of deep co-operation on issues such as that.The Taoiseach referred to corporation tax in his response to Deputy Martin.  What is the Government's position in respect of the devolution of fiscal powers for the Northern Executive and Assembly?  I note the Taoiseach's comments on the north-west gateway initiative which, when up and running, will be a win-win on both sides of the Border.  As he outlined a commitment to the N2-A5 road project, albeit a diminished one, when does he envisage it to be completed?I too have a sense of treading water on the matter of the North-South implementation bodies.  It has been signalled and discussed for a long time but we have yet to see any result in respect of those deliberations.  How does the Taoiseach see these expanded upon or rebooted?  Which new bodies should be appropriately established?We welcome any progress made in respect of the North-South parliamentary forum.  I am aware the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Assembly are in contact on this matter.  However, this has been a long time in the making.  At some stage we need to see it established.  Whereas no one would expect the Taoiseach to interfere, he is the Head of Government.  Will he reassure us he is giving impetus and direction to the matter?  We should not forget the North-South consultative forum.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that too?The Taoiseach was due to travel to the Six Counties in June.  Is that still the case?  If so, will he confirm that he will meet with the Ballymurphy families?  We have raised this matter with the Taoiseach several times and they are anxious to meet him.  They were themselves to travel to Dublin to facilitate such a meeting but I understand he was not keen on a Dublin meeting.  Is he heading to the North in June and will he give a commitment to meet the Ballymurphy families?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I did not have any particular difficulty in meeting the Ballymurphy families in Dublin.  I wanted to save them the trouble of having to come down but I am quite happy to meet them in Belfast when I travel there.  I cannot confirm I will be travelling there this month but it will be in the next matter of weeks.  As soon as I get a fix on that, I will certainly advise the House.No progress was made on the North-South consultative forum on Friday which I regret.  I was a member of the body which was involved in the creation of the first British-Irish Parliamentary Association way back in the 1980s.  There was the same sort of talk about this being set up going on for ages.  When it happened, it began to move very quickly, however.  The Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker, Mr. Hay, have my full support in the work they are doing in this regard.  Deputy McDonald can take it that we are anxious that it would be set up as quickly as possible.  This could bring a new initiative and new impetus to what herself and Deputy Martin spoke about.  Politicians certainly have a habit of that.The structures of the North-South ministerial meetings are such that one does not have the opportunity to have in-depth discussions about making decisions in some of these matters.  Much of that has to do with the quality of the interaction between Ministers in between meetings.  That has to be driven by Ministers themselves in respect of the issues they wish to see pursued.Deputy McDonald made an interesting point about fiscal powers.  It remains to be seen what will happen in this area.  We would be generally supportive of a decision to reduce the level of corporation tax rate in the North.  That would make the issues of the island economy stronger and clearer.  The intention here is to devolve responsibility down to local authorities.  It is a matter for the Executive as to what it wants to do in Northern Ireland.The timescale for the A5-N8 road upgrade have been set out by the planners and the Executive.  The centre section is in question - they have decided which sections they want to start.  From memory, I cannot tell the proposed completion date.  We are supportive of this project.  If economic circumstances were better here, we would have a different perspective.  I explained to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister that due to constraints here, we deferred many major infrastructure projects in the Republic but that we wished to make a valid contribution to the A5-A8 project which was accepted.Deputy McDonald's point about the joint delegations is interesting.For many years Northern Ireland did not have much of an input in holding the Presidency of the European Union, but we have appointed somebody from there to the permanent representation in Brussels to inform our own people of views in the North and keep members there fully informed about issues, the logistics and the scale and range of matters to be discussed during Ireland's Presidency.The Deputy will be aware that Ireland is following Cyprus and preceding Lithuania and Greece.  Some serious issues may fall to be decided during the Irish Presidency, including the multi-annual financial framework, in other words, the budget of the European Union for the period 2014-20; the single patent regime, depending on whether the Danish or Cypriot Presidency is able to complete the process in that regard; and copyright, the digital market and the expansion of the Single Market.  These issues are tied with decisions which will be taken in the coming period and arise from the issues raised by Deputy Martin.In respect of the Presidency which we will hold from 1 January 2013, we will involve the Executive and the Assembly through the appointment of a person to the permanent representation in order that they will understand the issues and the scale of what will be involved.  That is a constructive and progressive approach which I think is accepted by everybody and certainly welcomed by the members of the North-South Ministerial Council.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I accept that the council meetings afford a limited opportunity to engage in detailed discussions.  I assume the Taoiseach's direction to Ministers is to engage proactively with their Northern counterparts.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Yes.  Each has an agenda that can be worked on between meetings.  The next meeting is due to be held in November and a range of issues will be negotiated and, I hope, agreed between now and then.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	189	That is good.  Perhaps it does not need to be said that in areas such as education and health, where budgets are under stress and we want to protect the quality of service delivered, there is enormous scope for positive initiatives that would offer a win-win outcome on both sides of the Border.  However, I would like the Taoiseach to go further than simply saying that while devolution of fiscal powers may be a good idea, it is for the British Government and the Executive to sort it out.  He has correctly recalled that he is co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and, by extension, the process of peace building, reconciliation and reunification across the island.  This is a matter on which the Government could legitimately take a position.  God knows, in exchanges in this Chamber the fiscal circumstances of the North are referred to repeatedly.  That is fine in the cut and thrust of political debate, but there is an onus on the Government to take a view on enhanced powers for the Assembly, with particular emphasis on fiscal powers.  Bear in mind that the devolution of these powers is the very step that will make stronger and deeper North-South co-operation possible.The Taoiseach will travel to the North in the coming weeks.  It was our understanding he would go there in June.  He has indicated that he will meet the Ballymurphy families and he knows what they are seeking.  They want an investigation, an apology from the British Government and a recognition of the innocence of their loved ones.  I am conscious that the issue has been ongoing for some time and if his visit to the North is delayed, I ask him whether he is prepared to meet the families in Dublin.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	192	There is a serious legacy for the people concerned and I am happy to meet them in Belfast.  However, if my trip is put back unduly, I do not object to that.I disagree with the Deputy on lots of things, but I agree that perhaps we should have a discussion on the devolution of fiscal powers and what is actually happening.  I have seen reports on schools being closed in Armagh and the difference in the taxes applied to property in Northern Ireland and here.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Rates.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	194	There are very different views on these matters.  We have started a process of restructuring and reorganising local authorities.  That process commenced in Limerick and Tipperary.  There have been changes to the county enterprise boards and the functions of local authorities, as well as in the efficiency and value for money achieved for what taxpayers pay here.  In due course perhaps it might be appropriate to discuss the way fiscal powers apply in Northern Ireland, how the citizens are confronted with that issue and how they pay.  A very different prospect is being described here from some quarters in this House.  Perhaps the Deputy and I might agree that a debate should be held on these issues at the appropriate time, as distinct from the normal cut and thrust of business in this House.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I do not raise the issue to start a slagging match about what is happening in the North versus what is happening in the South.  The system is very different.  For example, the Taoiseach has referred to the rates system that applies in the North.  It is legitimate to discuss these issues, but the net point concerns whether Dublin takes a position on the powers that need to be devolved to the Assembly.  As Deputy Martin correctly pointed out, this is not a static matter.  The process is live and we have to ensure it is given fresh impetus and is seen to deliver for the citizens to which the Taoiseach referred.I am not precious about where the Taoiseach meets the Ballymurphy families.  I just want him to meet them.  They offered to come to Dublin to facilitate a meeting and I appreciate that he has made it clear that he will meet them here in the event that his visit to Belfast is delayed.  It is not a question of location; we just want the meeting to proceed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I have no difficulty with that.  When the Deputy speaks about taking a view on the structure of fiscal arrangements in Northern Ireland-----
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	197	On the devolution of fiscal powers.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	198	----- it is like the financial transaction tax.  Some countries in Europe have declared their support for it, but others are opposed.  We have a clear view on the matter, but we cannot influence other countries in terms of the way they structure their tax systems.  We would not want to be disadvantaged by any decision made on a financial transactions tax that might apply in Paris, Amsterdam or Frankfurt but put us at a competitive disadvantage against London.  The British Prime Minister was equally vociferous on the matter.I would be happy to meet the Ballymurphy relatives.  I was asked a similar question at the meeting on Friday about meeting the Kingsmill relatives.  I told the Minister for Regional Development, Danny Kennedy, MLA, that I would be happy to do so when I had the opportunity.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	199	On the Taoiseach's response on the fiscal question, does he agree that the constitutional relationship between Ireland and Great Britain lies at the heart of the matter?  Ultimately, the fiscal framework that governs Northern Ireland stems from the constitutional framework.  The Good Friday Agreement was an advance in terms of sharing, the North-South bodies and the totality of relationships between Ireland and Great Britain and between the North and the South.  What has been thrown up is interesting but the context is more fundamental than a mere discussion in this Chamber about who taxes whom and how they tax.  It goes to the heart of the subvention from Britain to Northern Ireland, which is substantial, and goes to the heart of the constitutional relationship between North and South.  The Good Friday Agreement has a stay on that in terms of if the majority is willing to change that status, the British and Irish Governments would facilitate that.  Is that the context the Taoiseach envisages for a discussion of the fiscal framework in Northern Ireland in its constitutional context or is there another context?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	200	Comparative studies are relevant and would help develop a greater understanding of how the system has evolved and operates in Northern Ireland as distinct from down here.  Clearly there is a value in both Members of the Assembly and the Oireachtas understanding the way the financial framework operates in Northern Ireland, with the subvention from Britain, and how we do our business down here.  Clearly, as has been pointed out, we have lots of rows in here about who pays what in Northern Ireland and who pays or does not pay what down here.  It is of value to people to understand the different systems and how, given those responsibilities, there may be opportunities for expansion of trade or business that could benefit both communities.  That is what I mean by that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 14, inclusive, together.I met former US Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her accompanying congressional delegation in Dublin on 13 March.  I welcomed her warmly to Ireland as she has always shown such support both for the peace process in Northern Ireland and to Ireland in general.  We spoke about Irish-US relations in advance of my trip later that week to the United States for the St. Patrick's Day period.  I also briefed her on my own visits to the US in February, including attending the roundtable on investment organised by former US President Bill Clinton.I briefed her on the Irish economy and our public finances and the Government's efforts to return the economy to a position of strong growth and job creation.  She assured me of continued US support both on Northern Ireland and for our recovery efforts.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Former Speaker Pelosi has been a constant friend of Ireland and her and her friends in the Irish Caucus have never wavered in their support for the peace process and for economic activity and development in the country.  She had close relations with the last Government and with President Obama.  I also was glad to have the opportunity to meet her.One of the important bilateral issues between Ireland and the US in recent times has been the fact that Washington may have in some way vetoed the writing off of key parts of Irish bank debt in 2010.  The Taoiseach has come into the House on many occasions to tell us he is leaving no stone unturned in his efforts to renegotiate the bank debt but he did not raise it with President Obama, as he said to the House in recent weeks, or with Secretary of the Treasury Geithner.  The Minister for Finance did not raise the issue with him either.  Did the Taoiseach raise the issue with former Speaker Pelosi?  As one of the key leaders of the Democratic Party, she has considerable influence.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I raised the Irish economy, the public finances and the Government's wish and intention to return our economy to a strong growth and job creation agenda.  She assured us of continued US support both on Northern Ireland and for our recovery efforts here.  The meeting with her delegation, which comprised seven other representatives, covered a range of issues in respect of the diaspora, connections between Ireland and the US and so on.  I certainly briefed her on the general programme of what we wish and she assured us of continued US support both here and for Northern Ireland.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	204	That is not the question I asked.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The Deputy asked about the bank debt.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Week after week, the Taoiseach comes in and says he has taken the opportunity to raise issues with foreign leaders or to update them.  We take it these leaders would be aware of all the issues from the briefing notes they get.  I asked about one of the big issues but any time someone from the Government meets someone from the US Government, this is the one question no one will ask: did Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, veto an attempt to write down Irish debt or to make senior bondholders make a contribution at the famous G7 meeting.  Did he or did he not?  The Taoiseach has not raised the issue with President Obama.  Did he raise it with former Speaker Pelosi?  The Minister for Finance would not raise it with the Secretary of the Treasury.  It is a big issue and very interesting and we would like to hear from the US Government its reasons and perspectives for not wanting senior bank bondholders to make a contribution to the resolution of the situation at that time.  It is widely reported but for some reason every time we raise the issue in the House we get a blank stare and no answer.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I will give the Deputy an answer.  I did not raise the issue of Timothy Geithner or his actions or comments with Nancy Pelosi.  We discussed a range of issues and I briefed her on the position as far as the Irish economy is concerned and what the Irish Government is doing and the efforts we are making to restore our economy to strong growth and a jobs agenda and all of those issues.  Neither did former Speaker Pelosi raise any comments or actions of Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner at the meeting.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	208	What follow-up work has taken place in the three months since the visit?  Aside from briefing Nancy Pelosi on the economic situation here, which must have made for a pretty depressing briefing session, what support was sought from the Irish in America to help rebuild the economy here?  What specific issues were discussed?  Was there any discussion of the Global Irish Network initiative?  Was the issue of undocumented Irish living and working in the US raised by the Taoiseach?  Many of them have built their lives there and they deserve the support of Government.  Unfortunately, many more will be joining them because emigration is now a major phenomenon again.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Far from the situation being regarded as depressing or there being a feeling of hopelessness, the American delegation was absolutely on a high about the reputation this county has had restored in the United States to a point where we are seen internationally in the words of former President Clinton and President Obama as being a country that is making real progress in difficult and challenging times but heading in the right direction.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	210	"Punching above our weight," was how he put it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	211	It confirmed the pipeline of investment into this country from the United States remains exceptionally strong.  During the course of the referendum campaign, as the Deputy is well aware, quite a number of chief executives of major multinationals from the United States not only put their money where their mouths were but spoke publicly about the reasons they wanted to invest in this country - because of our demographics, our tax situation and the talent pool that exists here.Of course no one likes to see anyone leave.  When I came back from London a fortnight ago, a young man from the west of Ireland sat in the seat beside me.  He is a married man with two children who was in the building business.  He left and is now involved in inspections on oil rigs because he went after courses to up-skill himself and said his work now takes him worldwide, with an enormous potential.  It is not all bad news.  We regret there are those who leave because of economic circumstances and that is all the more reason the Government must focus as a priority on jobs.  The American delegation, which comprised Representatives George Miller, Ed Markey, Nick Rahall, Richard Neal - well known to Ireland - Carolyn Maloney, Mike Doyle and Keith Ellison, was intrigued by the scale of reputation our country has in the US as a place in which to invest and work and the reputation of our people to interact with, and I was happy about that.The question of the undocumented Irish was raised.  Clearly, the situation is not easy in the legislative sense in the US, given the paralysis that exists on Capitol Hill, although I note the decision of President Obama last week in respect of illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children and who are aged under 30 not being deported anymore.  That will impact principally on the Hispanic vote.  I understand the number of undocumented Irish who would be affected by this measure is small but that is no reason to believe the ongoing work in respect of E3 visas should not be brought to a conclusion.I referred to the impact of the Global Irish Economic Forum internationally and Ms Pelosi, as former Speaker and leader of the CODEL delegation, was enthusiastic about the prospect of Ireland emerging from the programme and being seen to be a success story in a difficult time for Europe.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I am struggling to believe that a delegation from any part of the globe could come here and get an honest briefing and be, as the Taoiseach put it, on a real high.  Whatever about recognising the positives in terms of demography, the work ethic of Irish people, their ingenuity and so on, there is nothing here about which to be on a real high.  I am also surprised the Taoiseach's reaction to the rate of emigration is that nobody likes to leave.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	213	Correct.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Statistics tell us that nine people an hour leave the country.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	215	And none of them likes to leave.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	216	That is pretty catastrophic.  That is not casual tourism or people heading off for a jaunt, and the Taoiseach should recognise that in his commentary.Will the Taoiseach be more specific about the issues I raised?  What is he doing in respect of the undocumented Irish?  I acknowledge others are active on this matter but what initiatives is he taking and what contacts does he have?  Where does he see this going?With regard to the interest and support from Irish America, I appreciate his comments about general goodwill, a supportive view in respect of the North and positivity in wanting to help economically, but what concretely are the asks?I had a meeting with the Taoiseach recently about the constitutional convention.  We have underlined to him many times, and he shares our understanding, that the relationship with the diaspora has not been leveraged to its maximum historically to be of benefit to the State.  I am anxious this would happen and, therefore, I made the argument to him that the global Irish community has to be given a stake in the constitutional convention and its outcomes.  Will he be more concrete?  I understand he has had general conversations but what are his specific asks?  What specifically is he doing on the undocumented Irish?

We have drifted somewhat and I have other questions to deal with.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	218	When I was in the US, I made it my business to meet a number of Democrats and to speak to a number of Senators and Congressmen on both sides about the issue of the E3 visas.  The Deputy will be well aware of the political interchange that goes on between Senators and Congressmen in various parts of the US who have an interest in this issue but, clearly, the position in so far as the party system is concerned has been paralysed because of politics on a range of issues.  A Bill sponsored by one party may not be accepted by the other but the party may be able to tag it on other legislation going through Congress.  To be honest, I feel it will not be sorted out before the presidential election in November.  The stakes in a number of states are probably too political.  I may be wrong - I hope I am- that this could be resolved in terms of the E3 visas for the undocumented Irish.  I am aware that the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform is working with the Republican Party to sort out a number of misunderstandings to see whether extra assistance can be brought about.  We would like this resolved but I made it perfectly clear to the delegation that it is not our right or our position to attempt to interfere in the process they are going though.  I met them face to face both here and in the US and I put that to them.I happen to know a little about emigration and about the people who were forced into it in years gone by and those who have to deal with it now.  When I was in Beijing, all of the 500 Irish people I met were there by choice.  They have a different view from those who, unfortunately, have to emigrate.  It is important we have a fix on those who emigrate to America, Australia or wherever else and that there is a connection with them.  It is easy now from a digital perspective and they should be constantly informed as to the progress being made in their part of the country and where employment might be created.I met the Deputy and other party representatives about the constitutional convention, and the diaspora will be tied in and will be encouraged to participate in the work, discussions and arguments through the website and all the information that will be published there.  I welcome the fact the diaspora will be able to do that.  There are many, varied, deeply held and widely respected views among members of the diaspora and they will have a full opportunity to participate in these discussions.  As I explained to the Deputy previously, the diaspora comprises people who have left voluntarily, those who have left involuntarily, the Army, the Navy and those who serve our country in different parts of the world.  They all will have the opportunity to deal with the convention.I referred in passing to the fact that next September, the Army-Navy college football game will be played in the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.  A total of 33,000 American personnel will travel and they will stay for a week with their spend expected to be more than €60 million in Dublin and its hinterland.  Enormous opportunities will present for business and new connections to be made.

Croke Park has made a big pitch for one of those.  It may well be, if Ambassador Rooney is in a position to leverage it, that the Pittsburgh Steelers will be there.  Wembley is the other venue that has made its case.  Next September there is an opportunity for many people who have never been here previously to get a flavour of Ireland and all the excitement that college football brings with it.  Businessmen and investors will come to Ireland for the game and many will travel to Belfast, Cork, Galway and so on.  It will be a brilliant opportunity and we strongly support it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The Taoiseach answered my previous question about the Pelosi-Geithner issue straight up eventually.  Why did he not raise the role of the Secretary of the Treasury in vetoing any attempt to burn bank bondholders in 2010?  Why is there a reluctance to raise the issue with anybody in the American Administration?

It is simply the case that we had a lengthy and broad agenda and there were many other issues we had to discuss.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I am intrigued as to why the matter was not raised.  When we ask in this House about meetings with President Obama or the Minister for Finance's meeting with the Treasury Secretary, Mr. Geithner, we are told that nobody mentioned the G word or the word "veto" in respect of the possible role played by Mr. Geithner prior to Ireland's bailout.  I am very interested to discover the position of the United States Government in this regard and why, for example, it might have had a view at the time that bank bondholders should not be burnt or whether it set down at a G7 meeting that there could not be any attempt to force senior bondholders to make a contribution.  This issue has been debated and analysed at length.  We know, for instance, that Mr. Trichet at the ECB was of the view that no bank could be allowed to fail and that senior bondholders must not be burnt.  What is intriguing is that this view was apparently supported by the United States Government.  I am asking why nobody seems to want to ask this question of the American Administration and the American President.  It is a perfectly fair question and it is reasonable that people in this House should ask it.  Why does no member of the Government, in meeting with members of the United States Government, seek their views on it?  Have our diplomats, by way of their channels of information, picked up the view of the American Administration on the issue and, if so, have they relayed it to the Taoiseach, Tánaiste or Minister for Finance?

I recall Deputy Martin's statements about that.  I am not sure whether he, as Minister, had any contact with Mr. Geithner in his role at that time or whether he spoke to members of the American Government.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	241	What is the status of the health governance Bill?  Many hospitals are in a very serious situation in terms of their capacity to pay bills and we are seeing overruns in budgets throughout the State.  I understand management at Beaumont hospital, among others, has indicated that it may not be in a position to pay staff in the autumn because of the crisis that is emerging in its finances.  Since the abolition of the board of the Health Service Executive there has been a vacuum in health governance.  The relevant Bill must, therefore, be brought before the House as a matter of urgency.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that it will be dealt with before the summer recess?The Taoiseach seemed to indicate earlier in an admonition to Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett that 18 July is a moveable feast and may not be the definitive date for the House's rising for the summer.  The Government Whip proposed the schedule of sittings through to July to all the other Whips.  Is the Taoiseach now proposing to change it?

On the Deputy's second point, Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett indicated earlier that he and his people intend to organise a national march in protest at household charges on 18 July, that being the date on which the session would end.  I advised him that he should be very careful about his authority to determine the date on which the Dáil will rise.  We have a great deal of business to do before then, including the personal insolvency Bill and other serious items of legislation.  That is why the Dáil is sitting late, not, as heretofore, two days before it rises, but right through from now until the rising date.  We will confirm the date to Members in good time, but there are several items of legislation of serious import which we must get through.

When does the Taoiseach expect to receive the report of the group chaired by Dr. Don Thornhill in regard to the proposed property tax?  I note that this matter is causing some disquiet with the Taoiseach's coalition partners.  Will he clarify when the report will be completed, whether it will be debated in the Dáil and when he expects to bring forward legislation on the matter?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	250	It is not causing any disquiet at all.  As the Deputy observed, the Government set up a working committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Don Thornhill.  I can confirm that Dr. Thornhill and his committee have completed their work and a copy of the report was furnished to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon.  I wish to discuss the new online grant application system and, in particular, the website grantsonline.ie.  The issue relates specifically to self-employed parents who have had difficulties when using this new website.  When parents get to the stage of the online process which asks for their income for 2011, those who are self-employed are having a problem.  The website asks self-employed people to submit an income for 2011 but it gives them no option to input details for 2010, the most recent tax year for which they have fully accounted.  For PAYE workers the most recent completed taxes are for 2011 but for self-employed people, their most fully completed taxes are for 2010.  Self-employed people who, for tax purposes, operate under the system of self-assessment are not required to submit their 2011 tax returns until 31 October of this year.As the Minister of State knows, for self-employed people, the system of higher education grant applications was always based on the most recent set of accounts and on the most recent tax return.  Basing the system on the most recent tax return was a fair and equitable system and ensured the income figures were accurate and were accurately reported.  I have been contacted by many parents who do not know what to do.  They are unsure what figures they should give.I am aware there is a support desk in place which allows people to make contact if they are having problems.  However, as the Minister of State knows, this support system, which can be contacted by telephone or e-mail, does not necessarily give the answer for which parents are looking.  While the support desk is very welcome, the advice being given needs to be clarified for the parents in question.  In one case, a parent telephoned the helpline only to be told this is how the new system operates and that he or she should put in an estimate for his or her self-employed income for 2011.  To me and many others like me, this is unacceptable.  The system of grant applications must be fair and based on actual income which can be verified by means of documentation from Revenue.  Any other system would be unfair and would lead to further complications.To be fair to all applicants, the system should be open and transparent, and every applicant should be treated equitably and fairly.  The only fair way to assess income is based on verified tax returns or audited accounts.  If any other method of declaring income is used, it could be open to exploitation.  This problem is more than likely an anomaly on the website, and I hope the Minister of State can rectify it.  I believe it can be rectified easily.The Department of Education and Skills has made significant and welcome changes to the grant application process.  It has been standardised and now involves a streamlined, easily accessed system.  Instead of having 66 awarding authorities, we now have one body, SUSI.  Every grant applicant can now apply online.  This is to be commended and welcomed.This week is the last week of the leaving certificate examinations.  As students complete their exams, they look forward to a universal system under which they need not worry about having to engage in a convoluted process of applying for higher education grants.It is vital that we learn from the mistakes associated with the medical card process.  We saw what happened after the streamlining.  It is vital that the grant application system does not make the application procedure more difficult.  As with all changes, evolution is required, but I hope the new online system will take on board feedback.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I am responding on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  I thank Deputy Buttimer for raising this important matter.I am pleased to inform the House that the Department of Education and Skills funds a student grant scheme for third level and further education students.  Under the terms of the student grant scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.The 2012 student grant scheme regulations were issued to coincide with the new universal online grant application system, which went live on 11 June.   Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, which has been established as a unit of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, has commenced operation for all new grant applicants for the 2012-13 academic year, and all of the applications are being made online.  This new application process is applicant-centred and aims to provide a more efficient service for the student.  The existing 66 grant-awarding bodies will continue to deal with the renewal of applications for their existing grant holders for the duration of their current courses.Articles 19 to 25 of Student Grant Scheme 2012 set out how reckonable income is to be assessed for the purpose of qualifying for a student grant.  The means-test arrangements of the student grant scheme are applied nationally.  In all cases, including in respect of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income within a specified reference period is assessed with certain specified social welfare and HSE payments excluded.Article 20(1) of Student Grant Scheme 2012 states the reference period within which reckonable income may be determined for an academic year shall be 1 January to 31 December of the relevant calendar year.  For the academic year 2012-13, all income arising in the reference period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 is assessed.  Reckonable income limits are also based on this reference period.  Article 20(2) of Student Grant Scheme 2012 provides that, where the business year differs from the reference period, the income shown in the business accounts for a year that ends between 1 January and 31 December of the relevant year will be considered.The assessment of means under my Department's student grant scheme is based on gross income from all sources within the reference period.  Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point, eliminating any distortion that might arise from different spending decisions.  The income taken into account is gross income before any deductions for PAYE, income tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, PRSI and the income levy.I am sure the Deputy will agree it is necessary to assess all applications for support on a consistent basis from the same starting point, be the applicants employed or self-employed.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I hope there will not be difficulties such as the one that arose in the medical-card streamlining process.  There have been teething difficulties with the grant application process.  I have listened to and read the Minister of State's reply.I hope applicants will be communicated with.  I fully support what the Department is doing and I hope the Minister of State and Minister interpret my remarks as constructive.  What we are doing is positive and the process should be simple and straightforward.  I hope we communicate the content of the Minister of State's reply today, but not just through social media and online.  We must disseminate the information proactively, avoid confusion and make the process simple.We have done a great job in changing the system and I hope it will not be difficult, complicated, cumbersome or confusing.  We want to achieve the opposite.  I hope the process we have set up will achieve this but I have a small worry that it will not.  As the Minister of State knows, some 41% of undergraduate students who receive a grant have the student contribution paid for them by the State.  This comprises a vast and significant number of people who will use the website.  It must be made clear to them what is at stake.  There ought to be confidence in the system and it ought to be easy to use.  The Department has a mentoring network in place across the country and I hope it will work.

It is in all our interests, particularly those of young people, that the new service operates as effectively and efficiently as possible.  The customer experience will be monitored closely and we will work hard to ensure consistent customer service.  People ought to feel they are being treated fairly and equitably.  I am confident the lessons learned from other systems, which might not have operated as effectively and efficiently as they should have done, will be taken on board in rolling out the grant application service across the country.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important subject for the Topical Issue Debate.This is the second year in a row in which parents are facing a school year having to buy unnecessary and expensive new editions of textbooks, despite repeated promises from the Minister that he would prioritise this issue.  The Minister announced this time last year that he had received a commitment from eight book publishers that they would sign up to a code of practice on revised editions.  It was promised that there would be no new editions produced unless there had been significant changes to the curriculum.Implementation of the code of practice means there will be no revisions to existing textbooks for four years unless there are changes required because of curriculum or examinations changes.  Old editions are to be kept in print for two years, unless annual sales fall below 500 copies.  This means, in future, a new edition of a textbook will be available for a minimum of six years.  Publishers also confirmed that revisions to textbooks will be available online.  Why has the code not been adhered to?  Since the meeting in October 2011, has the Minister examined this issue, and has he made further changes?This year, parents are again under considerable financial strain as they must buy new editions despite there being only minor changes to the textbooks.  A number of constituents contacted me on this issue, and they are downright worried and scared about the cost of school books for the coming year.  In some cases, it is almost impossible to see what the changes are in the revised editions.  The book publishers in question are failing to abide by the code of practice agreed to last year.  The Minister must take action on this issue.  While book rental schemes are very important and it is right that publishers offer discounts to schools that buy in bulk under the schemes, we still need to stop publishers from getting away with bringing out unnecessary new editions of textbooks each year.In February, the Minister for Education and Skills answered a parliamentary question on the book rental and loan schemes from our education spokesperson, Deputy Brendan Smith.  I welcome these schemes, but this is not good enough.  We need to go further and ensure the publishers do not get away with publishing revised editions when there is clearly no change in these books.What are the views of the Minister of State on the introduction of pilot schemes within schools for the use of Android tablets as an alternative to traditional books?  As we are moving increasingly to a digital age and the Government has highlighted the importance of innovation and IT, what measures has the Minister brought in to streamline this method, and in comparison with cost and cost-effectiveness, is this the way forward over traditional types of learning?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I am taking this Topical Issue Debate matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  I thank Deputy Kirk for raising the matter and welcome the opportunity to clarify the position on it.The Minister is conscious that the cost of textbooks is a considerable burden on families.  Textbooks are an important way in which students can be supported in their learning and the Minister knows the range and quality of textbooks has increased in recent years.Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn has attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families.  Shortly after coming into office, he met members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks.  He also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.The association responded positively to the Minister's approaches and agreed a voluntary code of practice among its members.  The code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at substantial discounts in order that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.All these developments are welcome, and the Minister looks forward to seeing the members of the association implement these commitments.  My Department has not received any complaint that would suggest that the code is not being implemented, but if the Deputy has evidence to show the code is being breached, I would ask him to provide me with it and I will take it up directly with the Irish Education Publishers' Association.Recently published research by my Department shows that there is a high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary school level.  The research indicates that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme and I encourage this practice across all schools in the education landscape.  Results at second level are not as conclusive.  Since his appointment, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has also engaged with the National Parents Council, at both primary and post-primary levels, and with other organisations such as Barnardos and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to ensure textbook costs to students and their families are kept to a minimum.I refer the Deputy to the report on textbook rental schemes in schools and the allocation of textbook grants by the Department of Education and Skills, and the draft guidelines on developing school textbook rental schemes which the Minister published on 28 May last.  These documents will help to inform the debate on the issue.  Following receipt of the opinions of the representatives of teachers, principals, school management, parents, students and others on the policy options outlined in the report, the Minister hopes to make a decision by the end of the summer so that if there are any changes to the book grant scheme, schools will have a year's advance notice.On the final point raised by Deputy Kirk on the availability of the textbooks on digital tablets in schools, significant work is ongoing in certain schools in furthering that particular aim.  There are also discussions ongoing between publishers and the Department.  Indeed, publishers are also having their own discussions and negotiations with tablet suppliers and others as to how that could be rolled out throughout the country.  A significant amount of the movement on this must come from the publishers and the tablet suppliers, but the Department would be anxious to facilitate that process in any way it can.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  If I might respond to his invitation, I draw his attention to an area which needs examination.  On one of the radio programmes yesterday, there was an animated discussion about the home economics textbook for post-primary for the coming year and the fact a new textbook was produced.  A number of parents were certainly exercised about it and, at a minimum, it bears examination to see where the facts of the matter lie.I exhort the Minister of State to ensure the Department and the Minister keep an eye on what is a vital area.  There are many parents for whom, because of mortgage demands and personal commitments here and there, the cost of schoolbooks is a significant burden at a particular time of the year.  Of course, it is not easy to spread it out over the years.  Clearly, the number of initiatives that have been brought forward will help in their own way to alleviate the matter.  We need to do everything possible to alleviate the financial pressure on hard-pressed families to ensure the best education is available for their young people.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I assure the Deputy the Minister will continue to impress upon the publishers the need to reduce textbook costs overall.  As I stated, they committed to the code of practice.  It is the Minister's intention they will fully implement that code of practice.  My Department will publish guidelines on textbook rental schemes once the period of consultation is complete, and that is expected to happen in the coming months.  I agree with the Deputy it is unfair for publishers to continue to place what we all agree is an unnecessary burden on parents who are significantly burdened, and anything we can do to prevent that from happening we most certainly will do.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter.  I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is present to take it.Malachi was born on 6 September 2006 with the condition hydrocephalus, a learning disability, evolving cerebral palsy and epilepsy.  He attends a school in Newbridge, which is 35 miles from his home.  The family, because of his health condition, cannot allow him to go on the bus and must bring him a round trip of almost 70 miles in the morning and the same in the evening.  That amounts to 140 miles a day.They want to move the child to St. Lazerian's school in Carlow, which is ten miles from the family home, would give a round trip of any given day of 40 miles, and is an improvement of 100 miles.  One can see immediately, from a convenience, financial and family liaison perspective, the advantage in this regard.Malachi is a young boy with significant physical and medical needs.  He has an intellectual disability within the severe to profound range.  He depends totally on those around him.  He is like a six month old baby.  He cannot speak, walk or hold himself upright.  He must be lifted in and out of bed.  He has major problems.The facilities in the school in Newbridge are specific to Malachi and cannot be used, from a measurement perspective, etc., for any other child.  I cannot see but that the HSE, in its wisdom, would look at this case and say, from a sympathetic and family perspective, that it, too, would like to see Malachi moved to the facility in Carlow, and whatever facilities he has to help him attend the school transferred to the HSE in Carlow.  It is a simple, family-orientated matter.  It will ensure these parents, who have two other small children, will be able to have some prime time with their other children as well instead of being on the road for hours each day to provide for their loved one, Malachi.It seems a simple matter, but the family has met total resistance in trying to overcome this problem.  I would hope the Minister of State would see logic in the argument.  It is a simple, family-orientated argument.  It is to ensure a family can exist in the present environs of the struggle the parents have to provide for their child as well as looking after their other two small children.  It beggars belief.  Is the HSE that looks after the Carlow area and the HSE that looks after the Kildare area poles apart?  Can common sense not prevail to help a family which urgently needs permission to move a child to another school?  The long school journey for their son generates substantial costs in terms of petrol and car maintenance and requires that two small children are left at home while they journey for longer periods.  If a little common sense were shown, the problem would be overcome.  I hope the Minister of State accepts the logic of the proposal.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I will skip much of the reply provided as it deals primarily with disability issues at national level.I thank Deputy Jack Wall for raising this matter.  As he will know, the disability budget nationally was cut by 3.7% in 2012.  The Health Service Executive's national service plan states that at least 2% of this reduction should not impact on services and needs to be generated from other savings and increased efficiencies.  The HSE, through its national consultative forum on disability, which includes representative organisations and agencies from the disability sector, is seeking to identify and agree a framework to address the savings required, with minimal impact on front line services.  The executive has assured me it is endeavouring to ensure services are protected, where possible, from reductions in front line services.  Some reductions in services will be unavoidable, even with such efficiencies, but this will be done to minimise the impact on service users and their families as much as possible.Disability services for children have a long history in Ireland and many organisations provide excellent support and interventions for children and their families.  However, as they have developed independently, they were often established to serve one specific group of children only.  The result has been a wide variation in the services available in different parts of the country and for different categories of disability.  We need to find a better way to provide services for all children with disabilities.The Health Service Executive, working with the non-statutory and voluntary organisations they fund and others in the health, education and disability sectors, has established a national project - Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People - which will change the way services are provided.  The project is based on the recommendations of the report of the national reference group on multidisciplinary services for children aged between five and 18 years, which was produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multidisciplinary services to children.As I noted, the written reply outlines the global position on disability services in some detail.  On the young child with special needs whose case Deputy Wall raises, I understand the circumstances of the case are known to the Health Service Executive.  The HSE is considering, as sympathetically as possible and having regard to the financial and other resource constraints applying, how the health service supports required by the child to allow the move from the special school in County Kildare to the special school in County Carlow from September this year could be met.  It has indicated, following a request from me, that it will keep me informed regularly of developments in the case.I fully accept the case Deputy Wall has made.  It appears logical that the child in question be allowed to move schools.  Few people with multiple disabilities and a high level of need are being placed in residential care, which is as matters should be.  Most of those in such circumstances live in the community with their families and receive supports, as occurs in the case of the boy in question.  The Deputy stated he hopes common sense will prevail.  I hope sense is as common as he believes it to be because sometimes it is not shown.  We are working on this issue and I hope a solution will be found.  As Deputy Wall noted, it does not make sense to leave matters as they stand.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I appreciate the Minister of State's comments on this issue.  The family in question want to co-operate and work with the Health Service Executive.  They understand the facilities available in the school in Newbridge are specific to their son's needs and could not be used by another child.  A move to another school would not generate additional costs, other than a requirement that the HSE in County Carlow match the funding currently provided in Newbridge.  The family would benefit from the move by saving time and transport costs.  We will work with the HSE and Minister of State on this issue.  I spoke to an official of the HSE earlier who was more than helpful and I am hopeful the issue will be resolved to the satisfaction of the family in question.  If permission to move their child to another school is granted, it will make a major difference to the family's quality of life.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	300	Although we live in a time of tight resources, we spend a substantial amount on disability.  We need to ensure the system adopts a person - in this case a family - centred approach.  The system must show a degree of flexibility.  While I am not certain if boundary issues arise in terms of health board areas and so forth, such issues should not act as a barrier and should be overcome.  We will continue to work on the issue.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter.  I condemn the decision by Bus Éireann to withdraw all public transport services serving Abbeyleix and Cullahill in south County Laois and Johnstown in north County Kilkenny.  This is the first of a number of savage cuts by Bus Éireann which will result in the withdrawal of services along the main roads from Dublin to Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick and the North, respectively.  I ask that this decision be reversed.We have lost the railways and every month now we lose vital bus services through towns.  As a result, the affected areas will not have access to any form of public transport.  The chairman of the National Transport Authority and managing director of CIE informed Members at a recent meeting that nothing can be done because the services in question are run on commercial lines.  I ask that the Government and Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, who is a party colleague of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, agree to the transfer of the public service obligation from rural transport links to cover what were, until this week, Expressway services along the M7.  The state aid service needs to be expanded.  The bus service in County Laois, which has been provided since the time of the Bianconi transport service more than 100 years ago, is about to cease.  I ask the Government to ensure, at the earliest opportunity and through the National Transport Authority and Bus Éireann, that people in County Laois who need to take a bus to work or to attend vital health appointments under the centralised service for which transport is required have access to public transport.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I will oppose the withdrawal of public transport services from south County Laois and north County Kilkenny by every means possible.  Bus Éireann's decision is outrageous and can be compared to removing the bus service from the south of Dublin city.  If the plan proceeds, the towns of Abbeyleix, Durrow, Johnstown and Urlingford and the village of Cullahill will no longer have a bus service.  There is no private service on the route, and the first stop will be Urlingford.Bus Éireann receives a subsidy of €200 million a year from the taxpayer.  It is also paid for bus pass holders at a reduced rate for each journey made.  As Deputy Flanagan pointed out, we had a meeting with Bus Éireann representatives today and I raised the issue of a toilet break, because they are proposing a continuous drive from Dublin Airport to Cork city.   The Minister of State knows the length of that journey.  Not too many people would sit on a bus for that length of time without a toilet break, yet the company is proposing that there would not even be a toilet break at Josephine's Restaurant in Urlingford.  In fact, people will have neither a tea nor a toilet break following these proposals.  The company claims there is no commercial obligation, and I wrote to the National Transport Authority two weeks ago about this issue.  The authority wrote back to me and stated there is no public service obligation to provide these services.  We fleshed it out today at the meeting with the delegations from Bus Éireann and the NTA, and this was confirmed.I ask the Minister of State to take this back to the Government.  We must have a public service obligation on the N7 and the N8.  It was confirmed for us that the Limerick route is also in danger of being lost, according to the CEO of Bus Éireann.  We cannot wipe whole counties off the route.  If all these towns are bypassed and only the motorway is used, there will not be many passengers.  The proposition by the company is ludicrous.  We need stops and passengers will use a good service when it is available.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I am taking this on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Minister is speaking at the Road Safety Authority's workshop on the road safety strategy this afternoon and is unable therefore to attend this Topical Issue Debate.  He apologises for that.  For reasons which will be explained, the Minister has no direct responsibility in this matter.  I think both Deputies have made the case I am about to make.There are two types of commercial service, namely, private bus company operations and Bus Éireann's expressway services.  These services receive no Exchequer funding and have to cover their own costs.  The Government does not make decisions on these routes.  They are made by the National Transport Authority, NTA, the independent licensing body, following applications from operators.  In addition, there are public service obligation, PSO, contracted services operated by Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  Luas services are also contracted services, but that company is currently able to operate without subvention.Bus Éireann expressway services form part of the commercial network of services operated by the company, all of which are licensed by the NTA.  Five of these routes have been amended recently and two have been issued with new licences.  In addition, amendments to two routes are under consideration and one is under appeal.  The inter-city expressway services are purely commercial services.  Such services operate in competition with private operators in the inter-urban bus market.  For example, Aircoach provides 17 express services daily between Cork and Dublin.As part of its expressway turnaround plan, Bus Éireann is making changes to a number of its commercial services to meet the customer demand for limited stop services with quicker journey times and airport connections to ensure such services are commercially viable.  Failure to react to this market demand and competitive pressure would result in a reduction and loss of expressway services and jobs.In the coming weeks, it is understood Bus Éireann will be making changes to the Dublin-Cork expressway service to reflect the demand from its customers in large population centres along the route for shorter journey times and more direct services.  This will see the journey time on the Dublin-Cork expressway service reduced by approximately 50 minutes, by using the M7 and M8 motorways, while still allowing for the extension of the service to Dublin Airport.  This will mean the Dublin to Cork expressway service will not serve Abbeyleix, Durrow, Johnstown or Horse and Jockey once the revised route comes into effect shortly.  Daily patronage of Bus Éireann's services in Abbeyleix, Durrow, Johnstown and Horse and Jockey is not commercially sustainable.  Portlaoise and Urlingford will still be served.  Bus Éireann is following a viability and efficiency plan designed to address significant financial challenges related to factors such as a 20% fall in passenger numbers, fuel cost increases and competition.  It is important the company responds effectively to achieve sustainable finances in the future, particularly as regards commercial services operated in a competitive market.PSO services like Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and other Bus Éireann services are subsidised by the NTA under a PSO contract.  The NTA will be reviewing PSO services to provide a service to towns that lose a long-standing commercial service that is no longer viable.  The NTA will also look at services provided by the rural transport programme to mitigate the effect of the withdrawal of commercial services.The Government is concerned that public transport services cater for the needs of rural areas.  However, commercial realities for bus services operating in a competitive market have to be recognised.  The Minister will encourage NTA efforts at finding alternative services, as mentioned.  However, the overall fiscal position means there must be a realistic understanding of the financial constraints affecting the subvention of public transport PSO services generally.  I understand the concerns expressed by the Deputies and I equally understand that the withdrawal of the service can be devastating.

I would like to seek a meeting of the Laois Deputies with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport this week to deal with certain aspects of this reply.  I would like to remind the Minister of State of the programme for Government between her party and mine, which states the following:We recognise the need to rebalance transport policy to favour public transport.  We will therefore establish a Cabinet sub-committee on Infrastructure to explore the benefits to the public transport passenger of more diverse bus service provision [...] The rural transport network is vital for rural communities as a reliable and sustainable transport service.  We will maintain and extend the Rural Transport Programme with other local transport services as much as is practicable.Will the Minister of State ensure the Government rejigs the subsidised routes to include Abbeyleix and Durrow?  That is essential and is in keeping with the programme for Government.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I would also like to request that meeting.  I requested a meeting with the Minister last week, so it is to be hoped we can have it.  It is vital that Johnstown, Cullahill, Durrow and Abbeyleix are protected.  There needs to be a public service obligation for the route.  I question the issue of commercial viability, and the same case can be made for Mountrath and Borris-in-Ossory on the N7 route.   It is proven that the existence of bus shelters leads to more people using the bus.  We need to work with companies like Adshel and the local county councils to put bus shelters in place to enhance these routes and make them commercially viable.We cannot wipe away this service completely.  The Minister of State mentioned in her reply that the new route will save 50 minutes.  According to the proposed timetable and the old timetable, it will save half an hour.  The motorways are longer in some cases, while buses can only travel at a maximum of 100 km/h per hour on both the motorways and the old N7 and N8.  I question the notion that it will save all this time.  It is unrealistic.  The timetable is unworkable for a number of reasons that I will not go into due to time constraints.  I pointed that out to the Bus Éireann representatives today.  I ask the Minister of State to take back the message that we want this route retained and the service improved.

The sub-committee to which Deputy Flanagan referred has been set up and it is very much about alternative modes of transport and rural transport.  I am not saying the towns of Durrow and Abbeyleix are strictly rural, but they are not enormous areas of population either.  We have to take a look at things like this, but I will convey the request for a meeting on behalf of both Deputies, and will also ensure the sub-committee dealing with this area gets a copy of their concerns.

#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	310	Yes.This Bill will address issues of serious public concern in the operation of the political system in Ireland and incentivise parties to ensure 30% of their general election candidates are women.  It will implement specific commitments contained in the programme for Government in respect of political donations, having regard to recommendations made in the final report of the Moriarty tribunal.  It can be seen as one part of a wider programme to reform our system of politics and government.  Reform should not be feared, particularly when it opens the political process to greater scrutiny.  A closed political system breeds mistrust in politics and for those who work within it.  I see this every day in my political life and would be surprised if practising politicians were not also aware of it.The general scheme of the Bill makes provision for the restriction of corporate donations, a reduction in the amounts that can be received as political donations and also a reduction in the thresholds for declaring political donations.  Political parties will also be required to submit their annual accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication.  The Bill aims to increase transparency with regard to all donations to ensure there is no question of unhealthy relationships.  All political donations will be dealt with in an open and transparent manner.  I very much welcome this development.As an incentive to encourage the selection of a greater number of women candidates, the new legislation includes a provision that political parties will face a cut of one half of their State political funding if they do not have at least 30% female and 30% male candidates at the next general election.  This will rise to 40% after seven years.  This is a groundbreaking political opportunity to incentivise a shift towards a gender balance in Irish politics.  As a man who has been active in politics for some time, I welcome this development.  Irish politics is badly in need of greater female participation.  However, while required, gender quotas are only the first step.  Other change is needed also in order to increase the number of elected females.  Changes to how political representation works are also required.  I refer to a move to conventional business hours and an end to the late night meetings which conflict with the ability to carry on family life.  This would be a positive development for male as well as female politicians.The Government is keen to have greater transparency in the context of decision making and is soon to publish new laws, based on the very robust Canadian model, on the regulation of lobbyists.  These laws will force lobbyists to disclose all their contacts with Deputies, Senators and civil servants.  The proposals dealing with this cover all organisations, including charities, professional bodies and, most importantly, commercial lobbyists, who make representations to politicians and civil servants regarding policy or prospective decisions.  This will be the first occasion on which members of the public will be able to view information on the contacts made between lobbyists and the Government and how intensely these lobbyists push for what they are seeking.  This is a critically important issue and it must be highlighted that the Government's move in respect of it comes only a few months after the publication of the Mahon report which recommended far greater transparency with regard to the role of lobbyists.I understand a number of proposals are being considered in this regard.  I refer to a two-year "cooling-off" period for public servants before they can work in the private sector or any area where a potential conflict of interest might arise in respect of the area of public employment in which they were previously employed.  There were examples of this in the area of local government during the property boom when some local authority managers who were retiring went to work for developers.  A statutory register of lobbyists that will record the dates of all forms of communications, including e-mails or telephone contacts, between lobbyists and office holders or civil servants on policy, legislation or prospective decisions is to be established.  There will also be a public register, with details of contacts to be maintained by an independent body such as the Standards in Public Office Commission or the Office of the Information Commissioner.Open access to the Government is an important matter of public interest and lobbying is, within reason, a legitimate activity.  However, the public should be able to know who is engaged in such activity.  A definition of lobbying should encompass any communication on legislation, policy or decisions being made by office holders, including Deputies, Senators or councillors and senior officials, civil servants or advisers.  If adopted, these proposals will represent a radical change in Irish politics, in which informal lobbying has taken place in the past.  Sometimes this was based on a nod and a wink, while on other occasions it involved the passing of brown envelopes.  All of this occurred with little public knowledge of the extent of the access those seeking to change our laws had to decision makers.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Electoral (Amendment)(Political Funding) Bill 2011.  This is an important item of reforming legislation which will change many things about how our political system is run.  This will be a change for the better.  Changes to the current political funding regime should lead to a move away from the perception of politics as being in the hands of big business and corporates.  The removal of these links is very welcome to me in my role as a politician.  Their removal will allow us to do our work in a fully open and transparent manner.One of the biggest challenges Members face is to restore people's faith in politics and politicians.  This can only happen through reform and the Bill is an important part of our reform package.  Reform of the political system is one of the main reasons that I decided to run for election to Dáil Éireann.  It was a matter that was continually raised with me during last year's general election campaign and even during the recent referendum campaign.  Citizens want to see a change in how politics functions and a reduction in the maximum permitted levels relating to both corporate and individual donations to political parties is a key component in this regard.  This gives rise, however, to a debate on how people expect politics to be funded.  Members of the general public do not want big business to be in a position to provide large donations.  However, they are not very happy when large amounts of taxpayers' money are used to fund parties.Fine Gael holds a national draw once a year.  This is the party's largest source of income and involves individual members and supporters throughout the country buying tickets which cost €80.  The election campaign run by Barack Obama almost four years ago revolutionised how political campaigns in the United States were funded.  Members of the public were encouraged, online and elsewhere, to give what they could in order to be part of Mr. Obama's campaign.  The amounts donated were small, but even giving a couple of dollars allowed American voters to feel part of one of the most exciting political campaigns in the world.  This has the added bonus of giving a sense of ownership and interest in campaigns to the wider public.  I hope the changes to levels of political funding proposed in the Bill will lead to a wider participation in campaigns by more Irish citizens and also that it will lead to larger numbers of interested people giving small donations, thereby allowing them to feel part of the political system.  This could only be a good thing.I wish to address another aspect of the Bill, namely, the measures relating to the under-representation of women in the Dáil.  This is an extremely serious issue and one which should be addressed at the highest level.  We have long moved on from the time when the country was run exclusively by men.  The universally acclaimed achievements of both Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese who, between them, served as Head of State for over 20 years show the very high level of skills, values and political acumen that women bring to the political system.  It is for this reason that I welcome the provisions in the Bill.  However, I would like them to be implemented at an earlier stage than that envisaged because this would ensure they would have a greater chance of success.  If we are serious about introducing gender quotas that will work, political parties must initially look to the forthcoming local elections in 2014.  There is serious under-representation of females at local level.  The level of female representation on councils reached 15% for the first time in 1999.  It rose to a high of 17% in 2004 but then fell back to 16% following the local elections in 2009.  There is no better education for a future Deputy than time spent as a local representative.  Time spent as a local councillor would show candidates that they are well up for the job and increase their confidence, if that is an issue.  It would also vastly increase the chance of more female candidates getting elected to Dáil Éireann.  They would be better known to the local electorate and, perhaps more importantly for candidate selection, well known and proven to the local party hierarchy who select candidates.  From my own experience, my role as a county councillor gave me the experience and belief to go on to be a Deputy.  It is great first step and grounding in the role of a public representative.I note and acknowledge the Minister's points that due to the funding structure of parties being linked to general election performance, it is not possible to tie these proposed changes in at local level.  I am hopeful, however, that even though not required, political parties will start the process of seeking more female candidates for the next local elections.In practice, it will make sense for parties to be seeking more balance in candidates in 2014, once this legislation is enacted, to allow them to be in a strong position to implement these changes at the next general election, thus having a greater percentage of women in the field as potential Dáil candidates long before the next general election.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	312	Caithfidh mé a admháil go bhfuil saghas díomá orm nach bhfuil níos mó san mBille.  Ní fheictear ann ach ar dhá rud.  I am slightly disappointed.  I would have preferred to look at the bigger picture of political reform rather than at the two areas the Bill encompasses.  I know certain things move slowly and I accept the need for due process, consultation and ensuring all angles are covered.  However, it has long been acknowledged that many aspects of political life are in need of reform. The Bill only covers the two aspects of funding and gender.  In the course of the time allowed to me, I will look at other aspects relating to political reform.The Government came to power with a considerable mandate and on a great wave of positivity and expectation that things would be different and that reform was coming sooner rather than later.  I thought we would be moving at a different pace, grasping those nettles that have been stifling society.The constitutional convention is a good idea, but I wonder about how it is to be set up and whether that will enable or inhibit what it is setting out to do.  I know a constitutional convention cannot cover everything, but two aspects being covered, reducing the voting age and the length of the presidential term, are fairly straightforward.  It only requires that they be put to a vote.  Those two items could be covered in a referendum.The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, commented on the significance of making space in civil society for promoting and protecting human rights.  I support the suggestion from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that there be wider ranging participative consultation.  Amnesty International has called for the constitutional convention to examine human rights law and how best to protect economic, social and cultural rights.  It is vital the constitutional convention look at these issues.  There was wide-ranging consultation on the White Paper on Irish aid.  That set a very good example.Figures on gender balance are startling.  We are in an area of male domination, but only numerically.  Intellectually, socially, work-wise, and in multi-tasking and juggling demands, women are the dominant force.  A report published in May of this year shows Ireland well below the European average with regard to the proportion of female members of parliament.  The European average of women members, in both lower and upper houses, is 24.68%.  The highest is 44.99% and the lowest 8.7%.  Ireland hovers around 15%.  In the 27 EU Governments, the average number of women ministers is 25.71%.  The highest, in Sweden, is 54.17% and the lowest, in Greece, is 5.56%.  That might have been a contributing factor to Greece's current woes.  Ireland has 13.33% women ministers.  We do better in the European Parliament, where the average is 34.26% and Ireland has 33.33%.  The figures there range from 61% to 0%.We know we are in a very male-dominated Dáil.  Quotas are proposed.  At the next general election, 30% of all candidates must be women, or political parties will face a cut in State funding.  A side, but important, issue is whether political parties should receive State funding at all.  The Bill does not take into account women who stand as independent candidates.I am against quotas as a way to address the issue of more women in politics, even though I understand the arguments for them.  Parliament is not representative of society in any event.  If that is the principle on which this proposal is operating, it follows that there should be quotas for other groups in society who are not represented here, such as certain socioeconomic groups, age groups, minority groups, new communities, the unemployed and those with disabilities.  We know that certain professions are over-represented in the House.  Everyone who is elected has a duty to represent all their constituents.  I do not see women Deputies as representatives of women and men Deputies as representatives of men.The idea of quotas smacks of tokenism.  Women, if they choose to stand, are very well capable of being elected on their own merits.  We need only look at any community throughout Ireland to see examples of women who are taking dominant and strong roles and getting the work done.  In Dublin Central, two of the four Deputies are female.  We have a perfect gender balance.  Of the two local authority areas in Dublin Central, the inner city ward had a 50:50 male:female ratio until a recent move by one of the councillors, and the Cabra-Glasnevin ward has three female councillors for every two males.Why do more women not stand for election?  I pay tribute to those who do stand, and I do not denigrate anyone in the House but I believe women have more sense than to stand for the Dáil.  Women, in spite of our reputation for talking, are doers.  We do not see enough doing in this House but we hear a great deal of talking.Putting women candidates on the ballot paper is tokenistic.  Apart from anything else, it does not guarantee that women will be elected.  It pays lip service to the aim of getting more equal representation between men and women in the Dáil rather than actually achieving something.The Bill lets the parties off the hook.  They can point out that they have put women on the ballot paper and that it is not their fault if they are not elected.  Political parties have much soul searching to do with regard to election strategy, and I acknowledge the Labour Party as different from the others in this regard.  I am talking about decisions to stand one, two or three candidates, vote management, and so on.  Women are sometimes put on a ballot paper, but in such a way as to make it difficult for them to be elected.  I have heard women Deputies say this, in this Dáil and the previous one.  Women have been on ballot papers and not been elected.  This can depend on where the woman is put.  At the last general election count in Dublin Central, I saw some ballot papers where only women candidates were voted for.  I am not sure that is a good idea.We know of some of the reasons for the under-representation of women in political life.  We know of the barriers at the various stages from self-selection through party selection to the election itself.  We know of the five Cs a woman needs to enter politics, including child care.  I do not totally accept the argument about child care, because men have children too.  I dislike the way child care is seen as the prerogative of the mother.  It is an issue for fathers also.  Why is child care not cited as a factor in male representation?There is evidence from Ireland and other democracies that the sex of a candidate is of less importance than to a voter than the candidate's party, the policy positions taken and whether a candidate is a member of a Government or Opposition party.  I presume the same is true for non-party candidates.Deputy Tuffy referred to quotas, the principle of democratic representation and voter choice.  There is a valid argument that quotas could be seen to contravene the liberal democratic principle of merit and to violate the principles of fairness, competence and individualism.  The point was made that gender quotas could, in some instances, skew the selection process in favour of less able candidates at the expense of other more able candidates, on the basis of their gender.  Another female Deputy said, on that point, that she was relishing the prospect of voting for a mediocre, less able woman because she had been voting for mediocre, less able men for years.  I believe there is no such thing as a mediocre or less able woman.  The point is one of fairness.  Political reform is needed to ensure women will want to stand as Deputies in the first place.Some theorists propose that the more highly educated women are, the more likely they are to participate in politics.  However, although there are greater numbers of women leaving third level institutions, they have not translated into more women entering politics.  Much more is needed in the area of political reform to bring about change in that regard.  I do not believe quotas are the way forward, but I accept that they have worked in other countries.We know that for far too long there was an unhealthy relationship between certain political parties and business and we see the results around us in society.  The unethical, immoral and illegal system of donations in return for favours must be eliminated.  We must also eliminate the possibility of loopholes to get around the system.  One can set the maximum amount that can be accepted as a donation, establish a register of corporate donors and a threshold above which donations must be declared by companies, trade unions and other bodies.  It is all very well to set this down on paper, but the important thing is to implement it, in addition to ensuring there are no loopholes.In June 2009 I stood in both a by-election and the local elections for the first time; therefore, I was somewhat paranoid about receipts and keeping within the limits.  For the by-election I had to furnish the receipts, which I did, but it was not the same for the local elections.  Those responsible took my word on the amount I said I had spent.  I am in favour of supporting a Bill which seeks to address the problematic relationship between politics and business.  The Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, argues that there is a strong case for adopting a new approach to the general funding of parties.  I presume it would include Independents.  Because of the need for increased transparency such funding must be scrutinised.  Unfortunately, even in countries in which there are strict requirements for disclosure there is still a way to buy policies.The Library and Research Service's Bills Digest has an alarming statistic about parties spending more than €10 million in campaigns, yet only €1 million was disclosed in donations.  In 2009 no donations were disclosed by parties, even though it was a year in which local and European elections took place.  In 2010 more than €67,000 was disclosed in donations - the lowest figure since the introduction of the system in 1997.  None of the three main political parties disclosed any donations, yet in the general election in February electoral expenses of more than €9 million were disclosed.  Members of these parties must pay a massive membership fee to cover such expenses.  There is a need for greater scrutiny, but it must be real and meaningful.We talk about equality, parity and fairness.  The allowance introduced for Independents was intended to address the imbalance between those involved in political parties and Independents.  Funding had been going to political parties which meant Independent candidates were disadvantaged.  There are considerable disparities in the allowances for Independents and what is received by political parties.  I acknowledge and support what Deputy Stephen Donnelly has said on the matter.  When we take everything into account, between Exchequer funding, leaders' allowances and staff resources, we see clearly the extent of the imbalance and unfairness.  The total annual amount of Exchequer funding for Fine Gael was more than €2.25 million; iapproximately €1.25 million for the Labour Party ; just under €1.25 million for Fianna Fáil and approximately €700,000 for Sinn Féin, while there was nothing for Independents.  The amount received in leaders' allowances was €2.5 million for Fine Gael; €1.75 million for the Labour Party; more than €1.5 million for Fianna Fáil; just over €1 million for Sinn Féin; €350,000 for the ULA and €950,000 for Independents.If we look at total funding per group, there is more than €5.5 million for Fine Gael; approximately €3.5 million for the Labour Party; €3.75 million for Fianna Fáil; approximately €2.2 million for Sinn Féin and €950,000 for Independents.  When one breaks down the figure among Deputies, it works out per Deputy at €67,000 for Fine Gael Members; €83,000 for Labour Party Members; €172,000 for Fianna Fáil Members; €147,000 for Sinn Féin Members, €86,000 for ULA Members and €41,000 for Independent Members.  I have rounded up the figures.  Allowances are also made for additional staff.  We are aware of the amounts that can be involved in salaries for the various political parties.  No allowances were made for staff for Independents.  Provision is also made for facilities for extra staff such as computers and telephones.As an Independent and following the work of the longest serving Independent Member in the Dáil, I believe in equality and having a level playing field.  I am prepared to eliminate all allowances, but it should be done across the board in order that there is no unfairness, or else everybody should be brought down to the level of allowance received by Independent Members.  That would ensure a much more level playing field.I include referendums among the areas in which political reform is necessary.  It is important and positive to give citizens a chance to have their say, apart from at election times.  Citizens were deprived of a vital referendum on the bank guarantee.  One measure of reform would be to reduce the length of time allowed for a referendum campaign.  One month is too long and a shorter timeframe would be preferable.  We have a discerning electorate, as we saw in the referendums on judges' pay and the extension of powers for Oireachtas committees.  One went through and the other did not.There has been much talk about Seanad reform and the abolition of the Seanad is part of the programme for Government.  A blanket abolition of the Seanad is not the essence of parliamentary reform.  There should be a discussion on the issue and a rational debate on the pros and cons of the Seanad.  There have been some excellent debates in the Seanad and its blanket abolition is not required.  However, there is no doubt that election to it is elitist and undemocratic.  There is a value to the Seanad such as the debates on various topics and legislation and we must examine how to make the most of it.  However, appointment should not be at the behest of university graduates or Members, the convoluted system of panels or include nominees by the Taoiseach.  That said, the Taoiseach made some inspired choices in the current Seanad.  I look on it as a place in which to honour those who have made real contributions to society such as some of the current Members, but it must be done democratically rather than in the way it has been used and abused as a training ground for prospective Deputies and a retirement home for others.On the number of Deputies, the way forward is to examine the work of a Deputy and to divide up the work and the number required to do it rather than saying we should get rid of a certain number of them without being sure of the effect on a Deputy's work.I was most surprised that so many committees were amalgamated.  From my experience of voluntary work, the smaller a committee the more focused it is and the better the work that results.  Large committees were set up.  On the basis of allocating only two minutes of speaking time to each member, with a membership of at least 20, up to one hour would be spent on contributions rather than in discussing an issue.  I welcome the rearrangement of committees and hope it will prove to be a forward step for them.I am disappointed that we are not covering more issues.  It would have been good to see a list of what would be addressed.  My focus is on political funding, gender quotas and a few other aspects of the legislation.
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to the Bill.  While I am a relatively new Deputy, I have been around long enough to know that when it comes to politics and corruption, as politicians, we are presumed guilty.  I do not expect the electorate to forgive and forget what happened in the not-so-distant past.  It has enshrined a deep mistrust in the people of politicians and the Government.  We still are waiting for justice to be done after the release into the public domain of of two damning, yet predictable, reports - the Moriarty and Mahon tribunal reports - and we will not be allowed to move on until that happens.  However, we must try.We must plan for the future without paralysing ourselves with what has gone on previously.  Like it or not, politics costs money.  There is nothing wrong with people making donations to political parties, as long as it is done in a transparent and controlled manner that does not allow for the exertion of influence on policy.  We must also be careful not to create further barriers to entering politics by making it the preserve of an elite.  A mix of low caps on donations, with transparency, is the best way to allow political parties and those with no party affiliation to continue to sustain themselves without the need for additional taxpayer funding, which is the only alternative.I wish to pause for one moment to reflect on what the previous Deputy said about political funding.  It is not the wish of the electorate to fully fund political parties, but at the same time political parties can only adhere to the rules enshrined in legislation, not what they hope they will be in the future.  One cannot retrospectively apply legislation on how political parties publish their annual accounts.  This matter was raised with me when I guested on radio shows and "Tonight with Vincent Browne" and I have heard it raised on Joe Duffy's radio programme and so on.  It is a nonsense that the current Government's wishes for the Bill are being applied to our stance three or four years ago when we were in opposition.  We hope to apply this legislation now in order that it will be the rule in the future, not the past.Funding political parties with taxpayers' money would be an undesirable outcome that the electorate did not envisage when we discussed reform during last year's election campaign.  It is for the good of the nation that the public should engage in politics.  Unfortunately, given the controversy surrounding corruption in politics down the years, people have become apolitical, which is not in the best interests of our nation.Funds for political parties are used locally, for election and referendum campaigns and to allow local members to highlight what they believe to be important information to their electorates.  Members and supporters of political parties volunteer their time and energy to political campaigns.  It is worth remembering that the work involved in putting up posters, dropping leaflets through doors and calling to houses to try to engage people on the issues of the day is done on a voluntary basis by party political or non-political people, whichever the case may be.  Regardless of which party one supports, volunteering as a member of a party is one of the most patriotic things that a person can do.  Funding for local branches and political groups goes towards leaflets and posters as well as meetings that allow branches and local organisations to sustain their contribution to democracy, without which we would be unable to continue.  This should not be regarded as a negative aspect of local politics, as funding must be forthcoming if local organisations of every political hue and none are to be able to campaign.  We need to learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure  we are fully transparent and only accept donations that are genuine personal contributions to democracy without allowing them to be influential transactions.Recently, I read the online musings of an individual who had been involved in American politics for approximately 30 years before moving to Ireland a short time ago.  He found it amusing and surprising that individuals in his social group believed party political people and those who campaigned on behalf of Independents were paid.  We do this work out of a deep-seated sense of public service.  We want to contribute to and change our society.  I say this on behalf of the tens of thousands of members of my political party and others.If we are to keep the tradition of political activism alive, we must create an environment in which fund-raising is allowed so as to minimise the cost to the taxpayer.  The issue of lobbying will be addressed at a later stage via another Bill, but we cannot discuss electoral reform and funding without noting the need for a register of lobbyists.  I do not like to tar all lobbyists with the same brush, but every Deputy knows we are bombarded with e-mails and telephone calls each day as well as meetings with various lobby groups.  Some of those groups are worthy and are seeking access to politicians and Government members for good reasons.  Everyone has a right to be heard and should be allowed access to local and national politicians for the purpose of putting a point across.  There is nothing wrong with that.As we all know, however, especially in these times when resources are not easily parted with and legislation is being constantly updated, lobbying has become a heavily invested profession.  There is a concern that those who shout the loudest or, as in this case, spend the most on professional lobbying are heard over those who might not have the resources or expertise to do likewise.  I look forward to the establishment of legislation that will create a register of lobbyist as well as a fairer platform for all interest groups and businesses to engage with the Government and Opposition.I will make a few comments regarding gender quotas.  Regardless of whether we agree with quotas, Ireland has one of the worst representations of women in parliament of all OECD countries.  I welcome the efforts being made by the Minister to increase female participation in the Dáil on the basis that a representative parliament should correspond to the composition of society.It is a stark realisation that, if we continue as we are, it is predicted that it will take 370 years to reach a level of 50:50 representation in the House.  While I am delighted to know that my great-great-great-great-granddaughter stands a good chance of being elected to the Dáil in the 23rd century, it shows that the well-meaning efforts that parties have already voluntarily put in place to increase female participation are going nowhere fast.  Fine Gael aimed for an increase of up to ten women Deputies in the last election.  We attained six new female Deputies.  All other parties bar one that are represented in the Chamber had similar targets based on various elections over the years and have come similarly shy of their targets.  Unfortunately, quotas are not a guarantee of success.  This is apparent in various other countries that have introduced similar legislation.  While there has been a notable improvement, there has been a high price of failure at grassroots level.   For this reason, political parties need to engage with measures to increase female participation at local level.  We must reconsider how local candidates and talent are found.As a young member of my local Fine Gael branch in Malahide, I was approached to run for the council by one of the strongest female performers in the Dáil, former Minister Nora Owen, who has noted at times the reluctance of successful, ambitious women to enter politics.  We must acknowledge that there are barriers in self-selection and party selection.  Women's participation in politics at branch level is strong.  In Fine Gael, 42% of members are female.  The interest exists - it is just a matter of getting women on the ballot paper and elected.  Contrary to the previous speaker's statement, evidence points to the fact that, once women are on the ballot paper, they have an equal opportunity to get elected.  This has been borne out by statistics.  The evidence portrays the uphill challenge for political parties to find the right candidates for future elections and to encourage women to put themselves forward.  I cannot imagine that any woman would want to be a token candidate for any party.  It would not be good for our democracy or our Parliament if we were to bring a candidate in for the sake of it.We are fast approaching the 2014 local elections.  While I note that the legislation will not apply quotas to them, parties will adopt this approach for their upcoming conventions.  Politics is not a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. business.  Some have suggested that moving to such an arrangement would be easier for the women entering the House, but every Member and everyone who has been involved in politics at any stage knows that politics is seven days per week, 24 hours per day and depends heavily on what is occurring.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute on this welcome Bill, which was promised in the programme for Government.  It addresses two important issues, those being, political donations and women's participation in politics.  I welcome the changes regarding donations.  They are practical, proportionate and necessary.  As a basic premise, we must accept the existence of and necessity for fundraising and donations.  In this, we are no different from any other democratic country.  All democratic countries grapple with the doubts and questions that inevitably hang over dependence on fundraising to fund political campaigns.  Like us, they recognise that there are only two alternatives, the first being that only wealthy candidates could run, as they would not require fundraising of any sort.  The other is, of course, full State funding for candidates in all elections.  Neither of these scenarios would meet the approval of the electorate, certainly not at present.  It would not be in any way desirable to only have wealthy candidates, those who could afford to buy their way into politics.  If we are stuck with fundraising to fund the electoral process, to remove the democratic process from even the possibility of having the taint of the self-interest of donors, we must make it as transparent as we possibly can.  Even at that, we are struggling against public opinion, but transparency is the most important element.  People the world over, not just in Ireland - although we seem to think it is only in Ireland - are predisposed to suspicion of politicians' motivations.  We must do everything possible not to reinforce this disposition.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill's measures which will increase transparency.The reductions in the amounts that can be given are welcome and there is no reason for anyone to criticise them.  It is the transparency measures, however, that will have the most impact in removing the questions and suspicions that surround fundraising.  The new obligation on political parties to submit their accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission is very much welcome.  All political donations over €200 must be included in the annual reports of companies, trade unions, societies and charities.  A register of corporate donors will also be established.  These transparency measures can only be good for politics and will go some way towards restoring trust and faith in the political process.Deputy Farrell referred to the upcoming legislation on registering lobbyists, again a welcome proposal.  The concept of having a register of lobbyists, however, will be extremely difficult.  How does one define a lobbyist?  We tend to think of professional paid lobbyists and public relations people.  The reality is very different.  As a Deputy for many years, I have met individuals, companies and bodies lobbying on their own behalf.  It is self-interest that is driving them, not the interests of the body they represent.  A paid lobbyist is acting at one remove, while far more dangerous is the individual lobbying on his own behalf.  I do not know how that will be provided for in the register.  However, it is a welcome development.  The more transparency we have and the more information is made available to the public on how decisions are made and influence is exercised the better.I must confess I am not nearly as happy or convinced of the merits of the other major measures in the Bill, namely, the introduction of quotas for women.  There are also quotas for men in the legislation.  I understand the motivation behind introducing this measure and that it is based on strongly held convictions of many that this is the way forward for women.  Perhaps they are right, but in my gut I feel this is all wrong.  It is demeaning to women and ultimately will be counterproductive.  Of course, I want to see more women here and at every level of politics.  Our level and quality of representation here are the poorer because of the one-sided male perspective brought to almost every single debate.  This is not to say the female perspective is better or more right.  It simply adds another dimension and prism from which to view the many complex and multidimensional aspects of every single legislative decision made here.  A greater contribution by women would mean our legislative decisions would be informed by the wider societal view in so far as possible.  Better informed means better formed.  This can only happen if the range of societal views have equal value.  I am not convinced the views of women who are artificially leveraged into Dáil Éireann can carry the same weight as those of someone who is elected solely on merit.The actual implementation of the candidate quota will be problematic too.  Most countries that have gender quotas have list systems; therefore, the manipulation of the selection process is not as obvious.  Given the tensions we already have within parties in multiseat constituencies, can one imagine the better candidate or the one with the most votes being passed over because of this legislation?  It is fundamentally undemocratic.  We send monitoring teams all over the world to monitor elections in emerging democracies.  If there is any manipulation of the vote, we are the first to condemn them, yet here we are legislating for something that is fundamentally undemocratic.  There are many issues that make it difficult for women to get here.  Some of them are small such as physical size and the sound of one's voice.  When a man speaks in a loud voice, he is regarded as forceful and authoritative.  When a woman does so, she is regarded as strident and aggressive.  The reason many women are not here is the same they are not at the top in every other profession.  The years one is building a career and a profession one is also building and rearing a family.  Until we tackle the problem of child care for women and encourage them by providing every support to get involved in politics, we are wasting our time.  I support this legislation, but I strongly urge the Minister to introduce a sunset clause into this legislation.  It is anathema to democracy to manipulate the vote.  Until the artificial prop for women is taken away, we will never know whether it is actually working, encouraging and making it possible for women to come forth.
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	315	The Electoral (Amendment)(Political Funding) Bill 2011 has been broughtr to the floor of the House at an important time in politics.  Having reached a watershed, we must decide whether we are going to continue along the road of corporate donations, backslapping and political favours with all the ill effects these have on the health of the political system and the integrity of the body politic.  Alternatively, are we to take the new road offered by the Bill which will help to deliver us from the evils of the aforementioned culture and restore the confidence of citizens in the democratic political system by creating a transparent model where decisions are made on the basis of what is right for the people instead of being influenced by wealthy individuals or corporations against the public good?  The Bill offers us the possibility of a renaissance of the political system.  In passing it, we will empower the citizen by reducing the influence of wealthy individuals and corporations on the political system and reaching towards a position where donations will be smaller but, I hope, more plentiful as ordinary people take ownership of their democratic system.While a blanket ban on donations has been suggested, this raises constitutional issues and is not in the interests of the political system.  I want to see the policy on donations moving more towards one of the recommendations made in the Moriarty tribunal report.  Tax relief on donations up to a limited threshold would encourage a much larger number of smaller donations, as well as having the effect of limiting the power of an individual donor seeking influence in return for his or her donation.  At the same time, it would give individuals, small clubs and those who to date feel alienated from the system ownership of their political system.  In dramatically reducing the threshold of party donations from €6,348.69 to €2,500 a year and individual donations from any one donor from €2,539.48 to €1,000 the Bill is moving in the right direction towards reducing the influence exercised by donors over politicians.  Party donations in excess of €1,500, representing a reduction of some €3,500, and individual donations in excess of €600 must be disclosed to the Standards in Public Offices Commission.  This builds in a policing mechanism which, when coupled with new disclosure requirements placed on corporate donors to register with the commission and furnish it with relevant details of their donations, provides a system under which qualifying donations must be recorded independently by both parties, the donor and the recipient, with the commission providing a transparent policing system.  The fact that irregularities are to be notified to the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions for further action is proof, if proof were needed, that politicians want to free themselves from the suspicions and innuendo visited on them by the previous culture and are openly embracing the new transparency the Bill affords.The Bill will succeed where others have failed in keeping big money out of politics and restore politics and ownership of the political system to those who engage in the democratic system by casting their vote to elect the politician of their choice.  It is the result of the two Government parties working together to deliver on their election commitments to restore confidence in the political system by removing the influence of big money, whether private or corporate, from the political landscape.On the gender balance aspect of the Bill, I support the measures being put in place to encourage females to get involved in the political arena, especially at legislative level.  I recognise, however, that positive steps have to be taken on indirect public policies in this area such as the introduction of measures supporting women in education, the inclusion of politics in education and, more important, provisions to reconcile family and public life by making subsidised child care facilities widely available and legislating for good maternity and paid paternity leave.  While being mindful of Dr. Eoin Daly's neutral perspective on the constitutionality of the effect the Bill may have on the internal organisational autonomy of political parties, we need to do something to encourage more females to get involved in politics.  Provided that we act within constitutional parameters, I am in favour of this aspect of the Bill.All in all, the Bill is a positive step forward in developing our democratic model and restoring confidence in the body politic.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I join other speakers in welcoming the Bill.  It is part of the commitment we made to the electorate 15 months ago to reform the political system, examine the issue of donations to parties and address the need for more balanced representation across Irish society.  I shall address my comments to the issue of gender balance.Other speakers have pointed out that we are at the lower end of the scale when it comes to female representation in Parliament.  Approximately 15% of the Members of the Oireachtas are women, compared to an average of 24% across Europe.  My party's record is not dreadful in this respect, although we need to improve it.  In the last general election 26% of our candidates were women which although the highest of any of the main political parties, was not enough.  If this legislation had been in place prior to the election, we would have been required to field a higher number of female candidates.  The Bill will help us to reach a fairer balance and demonstrate to society that we want a body politic that represents everybody.I am aware of the difficulty in encouraging people to run for Parliament.  In the 2004 local elections the Labour Party fielded one candidate in my electoral area of County Meath and it was not until 2009 that we managed to persuade three female candidates to run for the county council.  I am glad to say all of these candidates were elected.  Three of the four Labour Party members of Meath County Council are female, which is a validation of our efforts in the run-up to the 2009 local elections to encourage females to get involved in local politics.  Next week Meath County Council will elect Councillor Niamh McGowan as its first ever Labour Party female cathaoirleach.  This is a cause for celebration for my party and, I venture, others.For various reasons, it is difficult for women to get involved in politics.  Child care is one reason.  All three female members of Meath County Council have children and I recognise from working with them on a daily basis the problems they face in balancing family life with looking after their constituents.  It is not always possible to achieve this balance without the necessary support mechanisms.  There is an onus on the rest of us not only to pass the Bill but also to reach out to offer help, advice and understanding to those who are thinking about getting involved in local or national politics.  It is not an easy task to find the right balance.  The Bill will force parties to do more in this regard, but it is not sufficient to merely pass laws.  It is incumbent on Members of this House and everybody involved in politics to do more to encourage women to enter the political world.
#DerekNolan	unknown-#DerekNolan-party	unknown-#DerekNolan-dob	unknown-#DerekNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	317	We should not forget the context of the last general election when the people made their choice about the new Government.  One of the major themes of the election campaign was a sense that people wanted change not only in personnel and parties but also in ethics and the type of politics parliamentarians pursued.  The Bill goes a long way towards meeting that desire in the two areas it addresses, namely, corporate donations and party funding based on candidate gender.In regard to corporate donations, the people believe the size of an individual's cheque book should have nothing to do with democracy.  It should be a case of one person, one vote, regardless of how much money an individual has in the bank.  This legislation copperfastens that concept.  I am delighted that the figures set out in the Bill were originally set out in the manifesto on which I campaigned.  The all-party support offered to the Bill shows that the political system has received the message.We are in the midst of an economic crisis of unprecedented scale.  This period is second only to the Civil War in terms of the difficulty of being a public representative because of the challenges people face and the strains on our system of government.  The Bill attempts to outlaw one of main causes of the crisis, namely, the undue influence of people with money over government policy.  The major cause of the banking collapse which has cost the State in excess of €64 billion and wiped out shareholder value for thousands of pensioners was a cosy relationship between Fianna Fáil and business interests.  Nobody would disagree with the contention that a small clique at the top of Irish society used their money to buy influence over elected representatives through supporting party functions.  The economy was shaped by property reliefs and property was seen as the only viable economic course, even as the rest of the world looked at our property bubble with amazement.  Such was the influence of money that the property bubble went unquestioned.  I note that for a number of years limits have applied to the amount that people can donate.  The cap is being reduced from €6,000 to €2,500.  Given how much was bought for €6,000, imagine what would have happened if the limit had been €50,000 or €100,000.The Bill is important not only for its practical implications but also for sending the signal that the Government wants to construct a different regime.  The restriction on corporate donations is welcome, as is the corporate donations register.  Openness and transparency are what people want above all else.  Even if they cannot access the information, the Bill provides the information in order that others can highlight it and make sure the media and public get to scrutinise these issues, which is very important.The personal limits for donations have also been reduced, which is good.  Personal donations cannot be banned because of a constitutional provision.  My own campaigns are funded largely by family, friends and political supporters making very small donations.  That is to be encouraged rather than denigrated as being the same as the actions of people who are buying access.  Those who participate in the electoral system and help to fund politics through fundraising or through donating €100 ought not to be put in the same group or denigrated as being the same as those who have bought access for business reasons or self-gain.  It is important we make that distinction.The linking of State funding of political parties with the number of candidates of either gender at general elections is covered by the Bill and its consequences will kick in at the next general election.  Whether quotas are the way to go is debated by the Government parties and in society.  My instinctive reaction is that quotas are not the way to go, except when the facts cannot be ignored.  It is a fact that of 166 Deputies only a few are women who are so capable.  This must be remedied.I have been involved in politics since I was 18 or 19 years.  When I was in NUI Galway, during freshers' week, we would try to get people involved in politics and the party.  The proportion who would sign up reflected the ratio of women to men in this Chamber.  There would always be a figure of approximately 80% to 85% of young men who would sign up to join a political party.  There was no barrier in place and no one was saying women were not welcome; all a person had to do was sign his or her name, but even at that earlier stage, many more men would come forward.  Arguments made against this include that there are few examples of successful female politicians, but that is not the case.  When I was at university, the leader of one of the parties was a woman, the President was a capable and admired woman and there were other women involved in politics.  If we are to solve the issue of gender representation in the democratic structures, we have a long way to go to make sure women feel politics is for them.This goes back to how we educate children and condition young girls, even in the media.  Society has not followed up on the feminist and equality agenda in the media and through the acceptance of change to the extent we sometimes think it has.  We should look at the education system, the media and a much broader range of areas to encourage the change we need to see in this House because it must be reflected first in broader society.  We can still see it in universities today, where some courses are exclusively male dominated such as engineering, while others such as the social sciences are predominantly attended by females.  While the Bill is good and will encourage parties to do their bit, it is not enough.  More work needs to be done and organisations which fight for equality and which still state the feminist cause is not complete are not getting the hearing they deserve.  There is an acceptance that it is done and the problem was solved in the 1990s.  That is not accurate or fair and there is more work to be done.The Bill, if anything, will change the dynamic here.  I hope it will create a new atmosphere that will spread to other areas of society.  It would be ideal if it had happened the other way around, that we had got the fundamentals right and they had worked their way through to the Oireachtas.  That is not happening or, if it is, it is happening far too slowly.The Bill is quietly revolutionary in its two proposals.  In what it does with corporate donations, it sends a clear signal that no longer will the body politic accept that there can be undue influence exerted by a small clique of those with money, that every citizen is equal, that everyone can participate on a level playing field and that one person, one vote is the cornerstone of how we view and accept influence.  The gender quotas will send a proper signal and sometimes sending the signal is the important thing to do.Not all influence is exerted by money or donations; it can be exerted by favours, cliques and introductions.  Let us not confine the debate on ethics in public life to the idea of corporate donations because they are only one small part of this.  We must also remember that we cannot legislate for a moral compass.  We cannot legislate for someone to follow the rules, declare donations and account for them.  Just because we have legislation that will restrict donations, we should not pretend money will not find its way into the system in other ways or through the brown envelope culture.  While this is welcome and sends a clear signal, we must not lose sight of the broader picture.I commend all those speakers who have spoken positively about this, realising the change in direction it is signalling.  It is something to be proud of, something we all promised and that the people want.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the electoral (amendment) Bill.  The last election signalled a significant yearning among the public for a reform agenda.  Personally, I have not seen any real evidence of a commitment to radical reform emerging from the Government yet.  I live in hope and welcome some provisions in the Bill, although certainly not all of them.  Real, radical reform is what people were crying out for, but there has been no significant evidence that yearning will be satisfied.  I am talking about radical reform whereby we diminish the coercive impact of the Whip system in the Houses and reduce the overweening influence of the Executive over the Parliament that is facilitated by that system.  We need more open votes and an effective accountability structure in committees.  We have not seen this yet, although I accept we are changing the committee structures.  I have yet to see a real, radical commitment to reform, for which the people are crying out, in local authorities, with elected members being given more power.  The jury is out on the Government's commitment in this regard, other than to tokenism.  Part of the legislation is welcome, but there is also an element of tokenism which I will outline in giving my views on gender quotas.Previous speakers have alluded to the corrosive influence of private funds on Irish politics.  That has been well documented in various tribunal reports and it is only right and proper that the Government should act on its commitment to reform that area.  I accept the constitutional restrictions and that people's entitlement to support political parties made it impossible to ban donations entirely.  It is an expensive business to run a political party and people might wish to support that process for many reasons, political, personal and ideological.  It would not be right to diminish that form of political commitment.  The limits being imposed in the Bill are welcome nonetheless.  They need to be followed up by placing an obligation on political parties to publish their accounts with a detailed outline of how they use the significant public funds they receive.  The quid pro quo, rightly, in the legislation to diminish the corrosive influence private funds have had over political parties is that somebody must pick up the slack and the reality is the taxpayer will do so in providing increased funding for parties.  In tandem with this, there must be accountability to clearly show how the funds are spent, including the leader’s allowances and so on.  Independent candidates receive significant funding and there should also be an obligation on them to publish a detailed account of how the money is spent.  This aspect of the legislation is welcome, but elements are missing, including the commitment to publish accounts, which need to be worked on.The other issue I would like to address is gender quotas.  It is a truism that more women are needed in politics.  The House is much the poorer for not having the balance of views and opinions that increased female participation would bring with it.  We have been the poor relations for many years by international comparisons in the context of facilitating greater participation by women.  Is the solution to use the big legislative stick to make provision for gender quotas?  Will that in itself advance the cause of women in politics?  It is a retrograde step that smacks of tokenism and will undermine the commitment of women involved in grassroots politics, while serious legal and constitutional issues need to be addressed.  It is alleged that political parties are old boys' clubs which put impediments in the way of women who want to pursue a political career.  However, of the 176 independent candidates who stood in last year's general election, only 8% were women.  There is no old boys' network and somebody who is politically motivated can put himself or herself on a ballot paper.  Approximately 15% of the candidates for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were women, but the Labour Party led the way and Sinn Féin was second.  Where there was no impediment to getting on the ballot paper as an Independent, however, only 8% were women.  This explodes the myth that political parties are old boys' clubs where in smoke filled rooms every effort is made to thwart the ambitions of would be women politicians.  That is not the case and I am fortunate to share a constituency with a female party colleague, Deputy Áine Collins.  She will have her own views on the legislation and I suspect we differ in this regard, but she is in the House on merit.  She has a track record of involvement in politics from her early days through canvassing, leaflet drops and acting as a director of elections and she worked the political system.  She would not say that within our organisation in Cork North West that there was a glass ceiling in respect of how far she was allowed to progress and the evidence is that she is in the House.  However, we need to address the issue of greater participation by everybody in politics.  Many practical measures could be implemented to encourage this.I refer to my reservations about the legal basis of what is proposed.  The Fourth Report of the Joint Committee on the Constitution published in July 2010 dealt at length with the issue of quotas.  Chapter 5.30 states:The Committee was advised that measures which went further than merely encouraging political parties to take positive measures with regard to female candidates would raise serious constitutional questions.  The right of political parties to organise their own affairs and to select their own candidates without interference is a key feature of political liberty in any free society and this right is plainly protected by the right of association in Article 40.6.1°.  The Committee considers that any measure which coerced political parties to select certain types of candidates or which imposed a quota in that regard would probably be unconstitutional.Chapter 5.31 further stated:The Committee gave consideration to a proposal under which enhanced political funding would be available to political parties who fielded a sufficient number of female candidates.  But since it is clear from the Supreme Court's decision inKelly v. Minister for Environment [2002] 4 IR 191 that any form of preferential funding of candidates using public monies is prima facie unconstitutional, the Committee did not consider that this was a practicable proposition.With regard to the reform, why is there secrecy about publishing the Attorney General's advice on matters that do not threaten State security?  Why not publish the Attorney General's advice on this matter?  The joint committee had access to significant legal advice and it was clearly advised that what we propose to enact was unconstitutional.  The Constitution does not mention political parties, but it makes reference to freedom of association and clearly guarantees that right.  This form of electoral engineering, which the latter part of the Bill is about, is a step too far.  There is a fundamental hypocrisy in the Bill.  It first seeks to address the accepted undue influence of private funds over political parties, but the flip side is that it tries to leverage through public funds an influence over policy and electoral matters.  There is an inherent contradiction and flaw in this, which raises the most fundamental constitutional issues.  If we were a Government of reform, where serious issues do not affect the security of the State, we would have an open and transparent debate on this issue.  The party whip should not be imposed in divisions on legislation such as this.  Let the cards fall where they may.  Other Members probably share my views on the legislation and believe it is the wrong way to go.I nail my colours to the mast.  The House is much the poorer for more women not being involved in politics.  More women should be involved at every level in politics - grassroots, local authority and the Oireachtas - but this is not the way to achieve that aim.  Other options are open to parties to address the issue.  Why not change the party rule book rather than use the Legislature to deliver change with a big stick and use public funds to engineer the result?  Internationally, the best results have been achieved without legislation.  There is a sinister opportunity for those who may wish to exploit it, with power vested in a handful of people at the top of political parties, to thwart the ambitions of individuals under the pretext of this legislation.  Concentrating excessive power in the hands of a few turns many off participation in grassroots democracy.  We need more women to become involved in politics and there are ways to achieve this objective.   This legislation is not the way forward.  It is a form of electoral engineering and a step too far.  As a Government driven to implement genuine reforms, it should allow a more open debate and refrain from imposing the Whip.  Furthermore, the legal advice on the constitutionality of what is proposed should be published without delay.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I thank my colleague, Deputy Michael Creed, for sharing time.  This legislation is somewhat unusual in that it deals with two very different aspects of the political system as it currently operates.  Although it goes part of the road to solving a number of problems, it ultimately falls between two stools.  I concur with much of what Deputy Creed has said in regard to the first aspect of the proposal, namely, the contentious issue of funding of political parties.  The Minister has spoken in the past of the need to eliminate corporate funding, but we are given to understand that the legal advice suggests it might be unconstitutional to ban corporate funding of political parties and candidates in elections.  As a result, what is proposed in the Bill is a significant reduction in the existing thresholds at which declarations must be made and a lowering of the sums that are permissible to donate to parties and individuals.Deputy Derek Nolan rightly observed that one cannot legislate for a moral compass.  The legislation might propose reduced rates and declaration thresholds, but the reality is that corrupt individuals and political parties which choose to operate outside of a moral compass will find ways of breaching whatever rules are in place.  That is not to say that we should not have rules and, on balance, I support what is proposed in this regard.  On the broader issue of political reform, I find myself completely in agreement with Deputy Creed's comments regarding the overwhelming demand from the public at the time of the election last year for a renewal of our political structures and of how the Dáil operates.  Unfortunately, I have not seen sufficient evidence as yet of the Government's intent to enforce effective reform in terms of how the political system operates.  I remain hopeful, however, that significant changes will be made.The second issue dealt with in the Bill relates to the gender of political candidates.  It is absolutely lamentable that such a low proportion of public representatives, at both national and local level, are women.  Politics is certainly the poorer for that imbalance.  However, while I support the notion of gender quotas, they are, to some extent, merely window dressing.  What is required is a thorough review of how the political system operates and the barriers therein which prevent women and other groups from entering politics.  It is not something that can easily be addressed by legislation.  The issues to be examined include, for instance, long Dáil sitting hours and local meetings which politicians are obliged to attend and which invariably take place in the evening and late into the night.  Such practices discriminate against people with young children.  There is an entire structure in place that is the root cause of the failure of women to participate in larger numbers in politics.  Unfortunately, the legislation does not go anywhere near addressing it.  In fact, legislation in general is probably not the right place to seek to address it.I agree with Deputy Creed that there is a significant possibility that the part of the legislation dealing with gender quotas may be unconstitutional.  Given that a joint committee of the Oireachtas concluded less than two years ago that the imposition of gender quotas by way of legislation would be in conflict with the Kelly judgment and constitutionally dubious in respect of the Article 40 provisions on freedom of association, it seems extraordinary that the Government is now of the view that this difficulty can be overcome.  I agree with Deputy Creed that the advice of the Attorney General in this regard should be made public.  The difficulty in getting more women and more people of diverse backgrounds into politics goes very much to the structure of our political system.  What we must confront are issues that cannot necessarily be corrected in legislation but may be tackled by changing how we do our business.  We must ensure the Oireachtas becomes a more attractive place for women and other groups who are not currently represented if we are to encourage them to seek membership of this House in the future.

I acknowledge the positive reception given to it by many Deputies from all sides of the House.  A broad range of points was raised with which I will attempt to deal presently.  If necessary, issues can be teased out in more detail with the Minister on Committee Stage.Based on the contributions of Deputies during the debate, there is a general acceptance that the current system of political funding needs to be reformed.  There was an acknowledgment by many speakers, including Deputy Charlie McConalogue and Deputy Brian Stanley, that the Bill is a positive step in the right direction.  The range of views expressed by Deputies from all sides of the House reflect the wide scope of the Bill.  Points were raised regarding corporate funding of politics, political donations and the gender balance provisions.  Several Members raised concerns relating to political reform in a broader and more general sense and points were made about matters that go beyond the immediate scope of this legislation.  Overall, the breadth of contributions is a positive reflection on the diversity and ambition of the Bill.Several Deputies expressed the view that the measures dealing with political funding do not go far enough.  This point was made by, among others, Deputies Niall Collins, McConalogue, Seamus Kirk and Dara Calleary of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Stanley and Deputy Mary Lou McDonald of Sinn Féin, and Deputies Catherine Murphy, Seamus Healy and Clare Daly.  Fianna Fáil Deputies referred to legislation introduced by their party on political and corporate donations which came before the Dáil in May and November 2011.  The Government's approach, as set out in our Bill, is more comprehensive and will be more effective.A number of Deputies called for the introduction of an outright ban on corporate donations.  The Minister addressed this issue at the outset of the Second Stage debate and I will respond to some of those points now.  Deputy Catherine Murphy observed that such bans operate in other countries, something of which the Government is well aware.  In preparing the Bill, we examined some of those models, including those in operation in Belgium, France and Portugal.  However, we are legislating in Ireland and must be mindful these other countries have different constitutions from ours.  An outright ban on corporate donations raises particular questions with reference to the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution on freedom of expression and freedom of association.  It is the duty of Government to bring forward legislation that is robust and carries with it a level of legal certainty.  This is what we are seeking to do in this legislation.The objective of the Government is to restrict the influence of corporate donations on politics and to enhance the openness and transparency of the whole system of political funding.  The Bill will do that to the maximum extent that is possible and constitutionally permissible.  The approach being adopted is consistent with our commitments in the programme for Government.Deputy Alex White specifically asked if corporate donors who register under the new system will be subject to any further restrictions in the amount they can donate.  To respond to the Deputy and by way of reassurance, I will say that in addition to the specific registration provisions, corporate donors will also be subject to all of the other donation limits that are to apply generally in the Bill.  The theoretical possibility of a group of lobbyists setting themselves up as a corporate entity in order to make donations was also raised by Deputy White.  Were this to happen, the legislation will still allow us to know who the individual members of the entity are and what their purpose might be.  They will also be restricted in what they can donate.  The legislation is comprehensive in this respect.The Bill will bring about real change and real reform.  To quote Deputy Charlie McConalogue, "it will bring about a significant sea-change".  Corporate donations will be severely curtailed and the books of political parties will be opened up to public scrutiny.  The maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation will be more than halved.  There will be greater openness, with significant reductions in the thresholds for the public declaration of political donations.  Other measures in the Bill provide for greater transparency by both donors and those in receipt of political donations.On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Government, I agree with my colleagues Deputies Peter Fitzpatrick, Tony McLoughlin and James Bannon who said we need more transparency and accountability.  Deputy Paul Connaughton captured the essence of what we are doing when he said corporate donations should be discouraged in favour of individual donations.Deputy Niall Collins asked if measures to regulate the disclosure of spending at referendum campaigns would be incorporated into the Bill.  The Government has announced plans to bring forward separate legislation on this matter.  The electoral (amendment) (referendum spending and miscellaneous provisions) Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme published in January 2012.  The Minister hopes to bring that Bill before the Dáil later this year.  It will provide for the disclosure of expenditure and donations at referendum campaigns and will provide for the extension of the spending limit period that applies at Presidential, Dáil, European Parliament and local elections.  The issue of spending that occurs before the commencement of the formal election period was raised by Deputies Clare Daly, Billy Timmins and Jerry Buttimer.The Bill deals with political donations, the funding of politics and gender representation.  The next Bill will deal with the spending side of the equation.  The Government is implementing its programme and fulfilling the commitments it gave to the people.  Deputy James Bannon made a strong case for the establishment of an electoral commission.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish such a body.A number of points have been made about the funding provided to Deputies and Senators and to political parties to support their activities.  Deputies Catherine Murphy and Mattie McGrath, in particular, made contributions on this matter.  Many of the concerns raised relate to the operation of the party leaders' allowance and to expenses paid to Members of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has responsibility for the legislation dealing with the party leaders' allowance.  He is currently considering the introduction of reforms to the arrangements that are currently in place and intends to bring proposals to Government on the matter.  While issues in regard to the partly leaders' allowance and expenses arrangements are important, they fall outside the scope of the Bill.However, the Bill deals with issues concerning the payment of funding to qualified political parties under the Electoral Act 1997.  A political party that does not submit audited accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication in line with the new provisions will have its funding withheld.  A party which does not comply with the gender balance provisions will lose half of its State funding for the lifetime of the Dáil.  In response to a specific question raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy, the Bill does not provide for money withheld from one party to be redistributed to other political parties.  Any savings arising would, therefore, accrue to the Exchequer.The gender balance provisions have generated a good deal of comment.  As Deputy Heather Humphreys noted, it has got people talking.  On behalf of the Government side, I welcome the constructive manner in which points have been made.  It is also acknowledged that some Members are reluctant converts to the approach taken in the Bill.  However, as Deputy Mary Lou McDonald said, "we have done the lamenting about the lack of women in public life, we have to do something that has a good chance of working".  The contribution of Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor was particularly striking.  She said that one can hate quotas but can like their results.  Unless we take action, experience has shown that the current gender balance in Irish politics is unlikely to improve to any great extent for a very long time.  As Deputies Ciaran Lynch and Bernard Durkan pointed out, women have made a significant contribution to the work of this House.  We want to see that strengthened and enhanced.  Those who are sceptical should do as Deputy Sandra McLellan advised in her contribution, namely, they should look at the evidence.  Equivalent measures in other countries have worked.Many Deputies, including some in my party, would like to see the Bill going further than it does.  When the Minister introduced the Bill, he reflected on the fact that the legislation before us is a significant step.  I reiterate this view.  The Bill represents a seismic shift in our approach to gender equality.  The Minister also outlined how the gender balance provisions are to apply and why the provisions are structured as they are.  They are designed to be ambitious, effective, fair and legally robust.The measures in the Bill link the payments made to qualified political parties by the State under the Electoral Act 1997 to candidate selection at a general election.  Payments are made under that Act to parties that contest general elections, based on their performance at those elections.  There is no linkage between these payments and local elections or elections to the European Parliament or the Seanad.  We are, therefore, not in a position to apply a similar measure to candidate selection at other elections as has been suggested by many speakers, including Deputies from Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, the Independent benches and by some Members on this side of the House.In framing the Bill, a key reference point was the 2009 report by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights entitled, Women's Participation in Politics.  To recap, it recommended the introduction of measures to achieve a minimum representation of one third women and men.  The committee recommended linking candidate selection with financial sanctions through the withholding of State funding, which we are doing.  We must lead but in doing so, we must bring people with us.  The objectives of the Bill are ambitious in theory and attainable in practice.It is evident that there are people of different political persuasions who do not agree with what is in the Bill.  Deputy Healy-Rae asked if the Government had "scenario tested" the Bill.  I reassure the Deputy that the Government has fully considered the policy implications of this legislation.During the debate, the question of whether the gender balance measures in the Bill are constitutional was raised by Deputy Joanna Tuffy.  The Minister addressed this matter directly in his opening remarks on Second Stage, and I will do so again.  We believe that the measures in this Bill are legally and constitutionally sound.  We are providing an opportunity for women to stand before the electorate.  The ultimate choice about the balance of representation in the Dáil will be made by voters.As Deputy Regina Doherty said, gender balance measures are not intended to discriminate but to compensate for the barriers facing women.  The funding provided to political parties under the 1997 Act is given by the Oireachtas under legislation and it is open to the Oireachtas to make the funding subject to conditions.  To be very clear, if we did not believe the Bill would withstand legal challenge, we would not have brought it forward.Deputies referred during the debate to the current and past failings in the system of political funding in the State.  On behalf of the Government, I reassure Deputies that the measures in the Bill are comprehensive and far reaching.  In developing the Bill, the Government had particular regard to the recommendations made in the Moriarty tribunal's report, published in March 2011.  While the tribunal report did not actually recommend that corporate donations be banned, it did note that the desirability and feasibility of a complete ban on private political funding is pre-eminently a matter for the Oireachtas and for public debate and consideration, having regard to the constitutional issues that might arise and the national financial exigencies.  It is our view, therefore, that the restrictions to be placed on corporate donors in the Bill will go beyond what the tribunal was in a position to recommend.  The provision in the Bill for the publication of political party accounts will address the Moriarty tribunal's recommendation that all income of political parties be disclosed.  The Bill will go beyond this recommendation by providing that the expenditure of parties will also be reported and open to public scrutiny.  The tribunal recommended that all political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be disclosed.  The reductions in the donations thresholds we are introducing are substantial and significant and address this recommendation.The final report of the Mahon tribunal was published on 22 March, on which day the Bill was being debated in this House.  As my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, said at the time, there are significant lessons to be learned about the relationship between politics and business.  The tribunal's report is a substantial document, both in size and the breadth of issues examined.  It is worth noting that some of the recommendations on political finance are being acted upon in the Bill, specifically with regard to the reduction in political donation amounts and the publication of political party accounts.It is right that the work of the tribunal should inform the debate on the Bill.  Some speakers, including Deputies Kyne, Anne Ferris, Conway and Corcoran Kennedy, referred to the failings in the system of political funding that had been exposed in the report.  On behalf of the Government, I must say I do not agree with the proposition made by Deputy Seamus Healy that we should set the Bill aside and start again from scratch.  A full examination and analysis of the report's conclusions is being undertaken in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  As part of this analysis, the recommendations made on electoral matters are being examined.As experience with the Moriarty tribunal has shown, the Government is both willing and able to respond to recommendations by change.  The Bill implements major reforms in the regulation of political funding.  As I noted, the Government plans to bring forward further reforming electoral legislation later in 2012 dealing with referendum and election spending and other related matters.  There will be ample opportunity to consider the Mahon tribunal recommendations again in these Houses and, where necessary, to legislate for further change.On behalf of  the Government, I thank Deputies for their comments and observations on this important ground-breaking Bill.  The Government looks forward to further consideration on Committee Stage of the specific provisions in the legislation.  It also looks forward to hearing Deputies elaborate further on some of the ideas and proposals they mentioned in their contributions.  Deputy Niall Collins, in his contribution, said political parties are no different from any other organisations in the country in the sense that they all require money to be run properly.  A similar point was made by his colleague, Deputy Seamus Kirk.  We on the Government side agree.  It is worth recalling that the public funding provided to political parties cannot be used to fight election campaigns.  In these circumstances, there is a need to ensure the regulation of political fund-raising is strict, fair and transparent.  That is what we are achieving through this Bill.While money is needed to run politics, politics should not be run by money.  Many speakers, including Deputies Timmins, Buttimer, Finian McGrath, Neville and Áine Collins, made a similar point.  We cannot expect a political system that commands the highest respect from the people unless there is greater transparency associated with how it is funded and unless we have a gender balance among elected politicians that is more reflective of the population.  On both counts, the current system is not fully working and needs to be changed.  Deputies Keaveney, Donnelly, Feighan, Tom Hayes and Ó Ríordáin made strong points on the need to combat cynicism and rebuild trust among the public in politics and politicians.  This Bill will reform the way politics is conducted in Ireland.  We are drawing a clear line between corporate funding and political activity.  Even if one does not agree with what is in the Bill, I hope one will agree it is radical and far reaching.  I ask that the House approve it in order that we can proceed towards its enactment and implementation.

The level at which the legislation is pitched is much too high and needs to be much lower.  A small trader, for example, could be badly caught out if payments were not made in respect of a number of different sub-contracts.Given that the Government intends to enact this Bill, how does it intend to enforce it?  There is not much point in enacting it unless there is a means of enforcing it.The third issue I want to raise concerns the ability of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  It is intended to be part of the enforcement regime and it inquires into fairly significant matters.  A resource issue arises as a consequence.  I would like this dealt with, if possible, in the Minister's summation as it is extremely important.Those who end up receiving the first judgments in the court are those who seem to do best.  This means that those farther down the food chain, who do not have the ability to go to court, fare least well.

We opposed the charge when it was first introduced last December and we continued to campaign against it.  We believe the charge is unjust and unworkable.  It will lead to financial crisis in local authorities and will bring further hardship to low and middle income families.The charge is grossly unfair as it penalises those on low incomes.  The millionaire will pay the same as pensioners and the Taoiseach will pay the same as lone parents, who have had their benefits cut.My party believes that the household charge is a double tax and should be resisted and we continue to support those who resist it.The household charge was introduced because the Government cut funding to local authorities.  The funding was taken from the Local Government Fund and redirected for other purposes, such as bailing out the banks.To raise the €160 million needed for local authorities, a charge of €100 was imposed on people's homes.  It was a cheap and nasty move by the Government, which promised so much only nine months before it introduced this charge.This, of course, led to a massive campaign against the charge.  My party participated in peaceful pickets, protests and mass meetings the length and breadth of the State.  Even today, six months on, and despite the bully-boy tactics, households still remain committed to overturning this charge.Sinn Féin has taken a positive leadership role during the campaign against the household charge.  We did not go for the populist rhetoric of simply demanding people should not pay and then leaving them high and dry.  We felt it was not our role, as political activists and elected representatives, to tell neighbours or members of the public what to do, or to make promises that simply could not be fulfilled.As a political party, we are not in a position to pay for court appearances or to contribute towards them, and others should not mislead the public on that.  Instead, we clearly outlined to the public that we were absolutely committed to overturning the household charge and we would work with communities to bring pressure to bear on those TDs who voted for this charge and to ensure the heat of public anger would bear down on those TDs.The introduction of this Bill is part of this campaign.  TDs who voted for this charge must feel the consequences of their actions.  This is particularly true of the Labour Party, which promised to defend working families and protect against welfare cuts, but which, unfortunately, has strayed away from the vision of Connolly only to become cheerleaders for the right-wing politics of Fine Gael.To the Labour backbenchers I say the following: the public who elected them are sick to the teeth of hearing that things would be worse if they were not in government and the conscience of the Government.  To be honest, for many thousands of families up and down the country, things could not be much worse.  It could not be worse for families who have seen their loved ones emigrate, communities who see essential services closed down, and fathers and mothers who face a future of poverty for their children and long-term unemployment for themselves.  Proud working families have been forced into accepting hand-outs and looking for charity from the likes of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to keep hunger from their children.  To tell these people that things could be worse is a mockery.The Government wants the public to pay three times for local government services.  The public pays for the services provided by their local authority through their taxes.  Households already have to pay for services including waste collection, call out charges for the fire brigade, septic tank charges and management fees, and soon water charges will be added to the list, and now the Government wants the same households to pay an added household charge.I want to take the opportunity to nail some of the myths surrounding the payment of rates in the Six Counties - myself and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, addressed this today.  As well he knows, Sinn Féin is in government in the North as part of a partnership Government.  We are proud of our record in the Assembly, particularly in protecting those on low incomes and in expanding on services being provided by local authorities.  As part of the reform of public administration, Sinn Féin is central to local government reform.The facts are that in the North households pay rates, these rates have been frozen, at the proposal of Sinn Féin, with an average rate being £700; and there is a waiver scheme in place for those on low incomes.It is also a fact that the rates cover a range of services, including refuse collection, fire services, septic tank de-sludging, school transport, school books and water supply.  None of these services is provided by local authorities in this State.It is also worth noting that there are no tolls on roads in the Six Counties and no water charges.  Waste collection is a funding stream for local authorities as private companies pay local authorities to collect the waste because they see it as being valuable.Politics is about making the right decision, not the easy one, and improving the quality of life for ordinary persons on low and middle incomes.  Trading on empty truths does not pay bills, create jobs or strengthen communities.Sinn Féin wants to approach the challenges that face our people with reason and analysis.  Therefore, when we set ourselves the task of overturning the household charge, we approached it with solution-based alternatives.At our recent Ard-Fheis, we launched a Back the Bill campaign to encourage the public to support the Bill to reverse the household charge.  We are happy to have received support both of the Unite and Mandate trade unions, the Dublin Council of Trade Unions and a number of community groups and associations such as SPARK, which represents lone parents.By introducing the Local Government (Household Charge) Repeal Bill 2012, Sinn Féin, with the support of Opposition and, hopefully, some Government TDs, aims to reverse the household charge and reimburse all those who have paid the charge.In opposing this charge, Sinn Féin is also careful to put forward solutions.  The Government could have made other choices.  Funding and savings could have been made from one of the following options.  It could have introduced a new third rate of tax only on income over €100,000 earned by individuals which, according to the figures we have obtained, would have brought in €410 million.  It could have abolished group relief availed of by companies to transfer losses to profitable companies and thereby get a write-down of tax receipts, which would have raised €450 million.  The Government could abolish legacy property reliefs, which would raise €341 million.  They could easily cap all public servants' wages at €100,000 per annum, which would save €265 million.  A 1% wealth tax would raise almost €900 million - less than one fifth of 1% would bring in more than the household charge.Any one of the above would have raised more and covered the cost of local government services.  Instead, the Government chose to dig deeper into the public's pockets, which have been dipped into in five austerity budgets where they have faced cuts in services, increased taxes and less wages in their pocket.Sinn Féin would also call for the improved collection of commercial water rates.  Currently, the collection rate is in the region of 52%, and that needs to be addressed.There should be increased rates on banks.  The banks should not pay the same rates, based on their location and square footage, as the sweetshop next door.  They have a considerable turnover and should pay a higher rate.In towns such as Portlaoise, where there is a significant number of State buildings, there should be rates levied on those State-owned buildings.According to the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, there are other sources of funding that could be considered.  The association put forward a number of options in the past.  There are considerable Lotto receipts from every town and parish in the country and a percentage of those could be retained at local level to supplement the income of local authorities.In other countries it is common for a percentage of revenue generated from value added tax to be retained locally.In December 2011, Labour Party and Fine Gael Deputies faced a choice.  While Sinn Féin put forward workable solutions in our pre-budget submission, the Government chose to take the walk of shame by supporting massive cuts in public expenditure and introducing new charges.  All of this was done in the name of fiscal management and good housekeeping. It is clear, however, that those who made these decisions have not managed a household in many years.  If they had, they would have made different decisions.  The Government must understand that one cannot run a healthy household budget and keep people warm, fed and educated with an ever decreasing income and ever increasing expenditure.Looking abroad one finds that councils in Denmark receive a portion of the corporation tax raised in their respective areas, while revenue from a local wealth tax and tax on natural resources that is levied in Norway is allocated to local authorities.  In Spain, a percentage of a local tax on the development of land is allocated to local authorities.  The Government had many alternatives to the household tax but chose the lazy, unfair option.  By imposing the charge, it is forcing local authorities into a financial crisis, as evidenced by today's decision by Offaly County Council to curtail services.  Councils have had their funding cut year after year by consecutive Governments and are now dependent on revenue from the household charge to fund essential services.  This approach will not work because cuts to funding will affect people accessing public services.  It was the Minister's decisions that brought about the current crisis in service delivery.This Government has handed over billions to zombie banks and bondholders.  Things could be different, however, and the Bill gives Deputies an opportunity to do the right thing, which all of us have been elected to do.  Anyone with a social conscience knows that flat rate taxes such as the household charge are wrong.  For this reason, I urge Labour Party Deputies to join us by rendering redundant the household charge and dumping it in the waste basket of history.  We must instead put in place other structures that provide for more secure sources of funding.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	326	During Leaders' Questions this afternoon, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, stated he lived in the land of reality and added, in reference to the household charge, that it is a law that "the majority of people favour strongly".  If he believes that statement, we are in even deeper trouble than I thought when we have such a delusional Taoiseach representing us at EU level.The household charge has been one of the worst fiascos ever perpetrated by an Irish Government.  It is unjust, unfair and uncollectable.  The law requiring householders to register and pay has been ignored by hundreds of thousands of people across the State.  These are not habitual law-breakers or criminals but decent people who have simply had enough and decided that this imposition on them and their families will not be accepted.  Many tens of thousands of others, and perhaps more again, have paid the household charge but remain vehement in their opposition to the charge.  The Government should not lump them into the group it claims is strongly in favour of the charge.The arrogance of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government in persisting with its efforts to impose this charge is nothing short of breathtaking.  Did it really expect people who have been hit again and again with charges, taxes, wage cuts, price rises and cuts to services for which they have already paid, as my colleague, Deputy Stanley, enumerated, to volunteer to pay an unjust and inequitable household charge?  If that is the case, Government members are already very distant from the reality of people's lives, having taken office less than 18 months ago.Some 47% of Irish adults have less than €100 to spend by the end of the month once bills are paid.  Nearly two thirds of households have less to spend than they did this time last year according to the income tracking survey published in April by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  Some 28% of respondents to the survey indicated they could not afford to pay the household charge, while 45% stated they were struggling to cover the cost of keeping their cars on the road as a result of increases in motor tax and a dramatic rise in the price of fuel.I doubt if any form of tax has been as widely boycotted as the household charge since the days of British rule.  Around 50% of those liable under the legislation have not paid the charge, yet the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and his Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues persist and insist that it can succeed.  One definition of stupidity is repeating the same mistake over and over again and expecting a different result.  That is the stupidity of the Government in persisting with this charge and an austerity strategy that is not working.As with many Deputies, I served in local government before being elected to the Dáil.  I deplore the manner in which the Government has tied the financing of local government to this charge.  With supreme hypocrisy it cut the local government fund, imposed an uncollectable household charge and now blames those who refuse to pay it for the funding crisis in local government.  Such nonsense from a Government that has repeatedly allowed breaches to its own guidelines for the pay of ministerial advisers, refuses to introduce a higher top rate of tax for those receiving more than €100,000 per annum, will not cap public servants' pay at €100,000, persists in paying billions to bank bondholders and follows the futile path of austerity regardless of the consequences.   Having done all of this, it then blames the householder who does not pay the household charge for the crisis in the public finances.The signalled proposal to deduct the successor to the household charge - the property charge in whatever form it takes - directly from the pay of PAYE workers is outrageous.  If the Government believes it has encountered anger over the household charge and chooses to go down that route, it has not seen anything yet.It is long past time the Government cut its losses, did the right thing and abolished the household charge.  I appeal to all Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies and all voices on the Opposition benches to support the proposition in the Bill when it is put to the House tomorrow night.  I appeal especially to Labour Party Deputies to stand by the promise of fairness they gave the electorate in 2011 by voting to scrap the household charge.  People do not object to paying their fair share or contributing to a fair means of funding and financing the needs of the State and its citizenry.  However, the household charge is an outrageous and ill thought out mechanism that is not working and is creating significant hurt in our communities.  It is time to a call it a day and find an equitable and fair alternative.

I can only speak with authority about my home county of Donegal.  There was a grassroots campaign of ordinary people across the county who decided to stand up against the charge.  They organised meetings in packed rooms across the county.  I looked at the profiles, read the local newspaper columns and followed it very closely.  These were not radical far left people or something like that.  These were ordinary people who voted Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn Féin and independents.  They voted across the spectrum but they just cannot accept this charge as being fair.  They know where the money is going.  They know this is not some scheme to fund local council services.  Such services have been run down incrementally over recent years, especially in capital investment.  From a peak of around 1,300 staff in the county council, we are down to fewer than 1,000 now.  That represents an almost 25% cut in our staff.  We have seen a dramatic collapse in capital investment across the county in roads, marine, water and sewerage infrastructure, yet we are told that this charge is for council services.  As we speak, we are seeing libraries and local community services being squeezed in partnership with the council.I discovered something last week that really concerns me, which is the statistics on payment that local authorities are putting out.  The grassroots group in Donegal that has campaigned against this charge quickly disproved a statement put out that 45% of the households had not paid.  They demonstrated that 63% of households in Donegal have not paid this charge.  Is the Minister of State seriously going to bring them all to court?  Will he criminalise two thirds of households in Donegal and half of the households of this State?The leaks to the national media in recent weeks that Revenue officials will be deployed to collect the charge - the whole thing is a farce at the moment - clearly demonstrates that this whole project has not worked.  Will the Government learn from these lessons and take the opportunity to engage constructively with us over the next two evenings, or will it replace the stick with an even bigger stick from Revenue?  The idea of taking money directly from PAYE workers has met with some resistance from the chairperson of the Labour Party, Deputy Keaveney.  I am not sure if he did a solo run or if that is the policy of the Labour Party.  If it is the policy of the Labour Party that it will not support the deployment of Revenue officials, it will be an interesting battle between the two Government parties on how to resolve this.  They are all over the place on this issue.  It is clear the people who voted Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the last election have been let down and have rejected this.I can only speak for Donegal.  I am really proud that two thirds of the people of Donegal have not paid this charge.  All sorts of pressure was applied to them and it is remarkable they have taken that decision.  Donegal was historically a very conservative county.  These are people who never wanted to protest and never imagined they would not make a contribution, as it was presented, to their local council, but that is what they have done.  People of a similar vein across the State have clearly made the same decision.I ask the Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies to take the opportunity to engage constructively with all of us who oppose this charge and work out alternatives, because such alternatives exist.  Sinn Féin presents such alternatives before every budget and we will do it again later this year.  We will show them alternative routes to meet the targets they have to meet.  There are choices.  They do not have to make these choices.  This has failed.  There will be failures and successes in government, but the key challenge is to accept the failures and move on.  This has been a failure.  The Government needs to change direction and look at some other way of gathering resources.  There is flexibility under the troika programme to do that, so it should take that opportunity.Are the Minister of State and his colleagues seriously suggesting tonight and tomorrow that they will go after hundreds of thousands of households in this State that they know to be honourable, decent people?  Will they go down the road of bringing them before the courts and criminalising them?  They know they will not do that, so let us walk away from this household charge, reimburse the people who paid it and look at a fairer way of achieving this.Even the IMF - not a bastion of global social justice - has stated that the Government has to find a fairer way of doing this.  I will leave it to the Minister of State and his colleagues to make their choices, but they face serious problems.  The chairperson of the Labour Party has stated his party will oppose this going through Revenue.  I wonder will they honour this promise.  The Government is facing a battle on all fronts, so it should walk away from this and change direction.

Prior to the last election, the current Government parties promised better, more transparent and more accountable national government.  They stated they would introduce better and improved local government, provide better representation for the Irish people in negotiations with the EU, the ECB and the IMF, and that things would be better for the people of Ireland.  What have we got?  We have got a Government which, like its predecessors in Fianna Fáil, appears to be hell bent on surrendering every vestige of independence, economic sovereignty and democracy.  The Government should have initiated a much-needed public debate on what things are better done at local level, what things are better done at regional level, what things are better done at national level, and how we could fairly fund those.  Instead, this Government and, as a result, the Opposition are expending energy and members of the public are expending their energy looking at ways and means of extracting a further €100 per household from already overburdened citizens.The limits of the Government's reforms appear to be to implement the instructions from the troika and the bond markets.  Instead of offering real reform or debating real reform with the public, the Government is more concerned with fiddling around the edges to appease the troika.  There is no better example of this than the decision to introduce this household charge.  It was introduced because the Government cut funding to local authorities.  The funding was taken from local government and redirected to bail out the banks.  That is the reason for the existence of this household charge.  To raise €160 million needed for local authorities, a charge of €100 was imposed on people's homes.  It shows the Government has failed in its commitment to reform local government.  There are those on the Government benches who try to spin the household charge as an attempt to empower local government with its own funding.  What blatant nonsense.  It has diverted public funds away from local government and put that money into rotten banks.The Government is asking people to pay for services on three occasions.  People fund local government through their taxes and with the privatisation of services such as refuse collection, many households are obliged to pay twice.  Following the introduction of the household charge, the Government is asking them to pay a third time for services for which they have already paid through their taxes.  If it is serious about local government reform, it must begin to think outside the box.  However, the limit of its thinking appears to be the household charge.  This is not the path we should be taking if we really want to strengthen local and national democracy.  The changes required in this regard must be implemented from the grassroots up.  The Government must help people to empower themselves.  It must begin to consider how it can build strong communities and give people the opportunity to change and improve their situation.  The household charge is a double tax and should be resisted.  It is grossly unfair because it penalises those on middle and low incomes.  How could any person argue that it is a fair tax when millionaires pay the same amount as pensioners and lone parents who have already had their benefits cut?There is another risk of which the Minister of State and his colleagues in government must be conscious.  The people of Ireland and other European nations will neither thank nor forgive us if and when our national parliaments end up as no more than glorified but expensive regional councils.  We are well down the road in this regard.  What we are doing is introducing what can honestly be described as insidious legislation designed to meet a set of instructions given to us by unelected people.  Even if these instructions were designed and commissioned by the previous Government - some of the members of which are now part of the Opposition - they are insidious and wrong.  What they are doing is damaging, if not destroying, democracy in this country.Let us engage in a real debate about local, regional and national reform and also on our relationship with our European neighbours and the wider world.  Let us seek to restore democracy, pride, sovereignty and independence.  Let us bin this insidious and unfair household charge.  Let that be the beginning of a new way of governance in this nation.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I listened with great interest to the chairperson of the Labour Party, Deputy Keaveney, speaking on "Morning Ireland" yesterday about the household charge and the impending property tax.  His refusal to rule out the Government's muted call for a property tax to be taken directly from PAYE workers was of very little surprise.  Nor was his bemoaning of what he described as a disproportionate level of protest against the household tax relative to, as he sees it, the total cost of the charge.  It strikes me that it is game, set and match: the Labour Party has well and truly and fully rolled in behind Fine Gael's world view.  Gone are the days when it showed empathy with struggling families or the working poor.  Deputy Keaveney's argument was "Sure what is €100 anyway?"  If ever there was a clear articulation of the need to reduce the pay of Teachtaí Dála, the Labour Party's chairman made it yesterday.  I have no doubt that if he was seeking to raise his family while in receipt of the minimum wage or a social welfare payment, he would have a much clearer appreciation of the value of €100.There is absolutely no point in those in the Labour Party or anyone else referring to the need for fair and progressive taxation while standing over the household charge.  It is a flat tax and takes no account of household income or people's ability to pay.  It has been introduced at a time when families are being put to the pin of their collar in respect of every cent.  Opposition to it is defiantly set against the Labour Party's and Fine Gael's relentless and focused attack on low-income households.  Tax increases and cuts to social protection entitlements have imposed greater percentage losses on struggling families' household money than on the funds of those on high incomes.  While the Labour Party talks the talk of fair and progressive taxation, it certainly does not walk the walk.  Budget 2012 reduced the poorest 40% of households' incomes by up to 2.5%.  At the same time, it protected the top 30% of high earners whose incomes dropped by just 0.7%.We all know that when the previous Government was in power, Fianna Fáil's cuts to social welfare, the introduction of the universal social charge, the widening of tax bands and the reduction in tax credits had a crippling effect on families least able to shoulder the burden.  That is a fact.  However, the Government has tragically opted to follow in the footsteps of that which preceded it.  In the context of this matter, it is worth mentioning that women are most concentrated in the lower income groups.  Single people with children, 73% of whom are women, on average, lost a massive 5% of their modest incomes in 2011.  With Budget 2012, Labour Party and Fine Gael colleagues hit the vulnerable and low-paid again, only even harder on this occasion.Let me make a proposition and float an idea.  The Labour Party has stated this week that it wants to introduce a tax that relates to wealth.  It would be based on the premise that those in a position to pay would do so relative to their wealth and property.  Here is my suggestion: introduce a wealth tax.  Introduce a tax of 1% on all assets with a value in excess of €1 million.  Excluded from this could be working farmland, business assets and the first 20% of the value of primary residences worth in excess of €1 million.  In addition, an ability-to-pay clause could be included in respect of individuals who are asset rich but cash poor and who would require a level of protection.  If the Government does everything I suggest, it will raise up to €800 million.  That is what the yield would be.  This is a considerable amount of money and it could be levied in a fair and progressive manner.If the Labour Party, in particular, and Fine Gael and the Government in general are truly committed to equity and fairness and to each person and family shouldering the burden in accordance with their ability to pay, why not do as I suggest?  Why not drop the household charge which is unfair and has been and will continue to be resisted and opt for a fair and progressive path?  That is the challenge for the Government.  I put it to the Minister of State directly that this is what should be done if the Government's rhetoric about us all being in this together is to mean anything at all.

Internationally, significant financial problems have arisen in countries such as Greece, etc.  This debate focuses on a very narrow part of what the Government must do in order to meet the requirements laid down in the agreement with the troika.  Nonetheless, I accept there is a need for the Government to spell out the position again.  I challenge Sinn Féin.  Later, I will challenge them directly with regard to some of the points they have made.Deputy Stanley has proposed that the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011, which has so far raised more than €94.5 million, be repealed.  This is a significant amount of money in today's challenging financial circumstances and is crucial to the continued funding of local government and the provision of essential local services.  The legislation was enacted relatively recently by the Oireachtas and there is no basis or justification for its repeal.  Given international events and continued uncertainty in the international economy, many will find it incomprehensible that Deputy Stanley and Sinn Féin can make this proposal at this time.The household charge was introduced as part of the agreement with the troika, to which Ireland is committed.  It is a vital funding element of our public services at local level.  The full yield from the charge is estimated at €160 million, based on payments from all liable households.  The purpose of the Act was to give effect to the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland's commitment to introduce a property tax by 2012.  The programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  It was considered that, in light of the complex issues involved, a property tax would take time to introduce and accordingly to meet the requirements in the EU-IMF programme, the Government decided to introduce a household charge in 2012.  I want to emphasise that this charge is, and was always intended to be, an interim measure.The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides, essentially, for the majority of owners of residential property in the State to pay an annual charge of €100.  Liability arises each year on a point in time basis, which is 1 January.  As I have noted, the charge is expected to raise some €160 million on full payment, and revenue from the charge is supporting the provision of the vital services provided by local authorities in our communities.  Internationally, local services are administered by local authorities and financed by local service charges.Deputy Stanley will be well aware of this.  It is accepted practice to fund local service through a property tax and this is the position in Northern Ireland among other places.The Sinn Féin Deputies seem to be exercising a particular form of doublethink at which they are becoming quite expert.

While it is difficult for many households to pay, by international standards it is not a lot of money.  Let us compare it with charges in Northern Ireland.  A home owner in Dundalk pays €100.  Ten miles north of Dundalk, across the Border in Newry and Mourne, a home owner pays an average of €965.  In West Belfast, the former constituency of the Sinn Féin leader, Deputy Adams, every house pays an average of €877.  Should one visit the city of Derry and call on the Sinn Féin deputy leader, Martin McGuinness, MP, MLA, one would find people in his street paying, on average, €698.  The arguments of the Sinn Féin Deputies do not stand up.

The Deputies spoke about three charges down here.  There are two up there.  The regional rate is set by the Northern Ireland Executive in Stormont, of which Sinn Féin is a part.  Councils, on which Sinn Féin have members in many cases, set the district rate, which meets needs such as building control, community centres, leisure facilities, tourism, waste management, and so on.Sinn Féin Deputies cannot have it both ways.  They cannot say €100 is not acceptable in one part of the country while saying the opposite on the other side of the Border.  They cannot face two ways at once.  That is not acceptable, and it is the weakness in their argument.  It would have been better for Sinn Féin Deputies to put the motion and, if it were beaten, to tell people to pay the charge.  Notwithstanding that they do not support the charge, they should encourage people to pay, given the penalties people will face if they persist in not doing so.  People who listen to the "No" voice will end up in greater difficult, and not less.  After two years of non-payment a person will owe €280, compared with a maximum of €200 if the charge was paid on time.  People are being led astray.The law is very clear.  We are talking about the law of the land.  I accept that it is perfectly acceptable to propose a motion calling for the repeal of an Act.  Should the Act not be repealed, and it is more than likely it will not, people can be brought to court for non-payment and will face a fine of up to €2,500.  As well as that fine, a person will be liable to a penalty of €100 per day until the charge is paid.  It is better for people to pay now.This is an interim charge for this year.  We need a property tax and it will be introduced.  It will be more acceptable because those who have more will pay more.In Northern Ireland, payment is unavoidable.  Deputy Stanley claimed Sinn Féin held charges at a certain level.  I am sorry to inform him that a BBC news bulletin of 14 February 2012 reported that Strabane rates were to rise by almost 4%.  On local councils and in the Executive, Sinn Féin supports the increasing of charges on every house and dwelling in Northern Ireland.  In the South, more than 200,000 households are exempt from the household charge.  Anyone who rents a house from a local authority or in the private sector, is in receipt of mortgage interest subsidy from the HSE or lives in category 3 or 4 housing on an unfinished estate does not pay.Sinn Féin Deputies must face the truth.  People cannot accept the validity of an argument that is hollow at its core.  It is bluff and bluster.  It is pointless populism.  It is time for Sinn Féin to face the reality, to be accountable as a political party, to be a true opposition and argue the issues.  They should not encourage people to go into a more difficult financial place where some may end up in court.  I do not want to see people go there.  Sinn Féin should encourage their supporters to pay the charge, notwithstanding the fact that they do not agree with it.  That is the law of the land.  They should obey the law.The average domestic rates bill in Northern Ireland for 2011 was €980.  It is made up of the regional rate and the local council rate.The practical position is that by international standards, the revenue base of local authorities in Ireland has been relatively narrow, with local authorities here being disproportionately dependent on central Government funding.   The figures I have indicate that the total budget spent by all local authorities in the country is approximately €4 billion per annum.  We are talking about taking in approximately €160 million with the household charge.  The charge is small in proportion to the total cost of local government.  The introduction in 2009 of the non-principal private residence charge represented an important step change in how local government is financed and was the first dedicated new source of funding for local authorities in some years.  It did not, however, go far enough to address the imbalance in the sector's financing.  The introduction of the household charge must be seen as a further step in seeking to place the funding of local authorities on a relatively stable, local basis that will not, among other things, be subject to the volatility associated with transaction-based activity.  That is the reality.  We based our tax income on income from the sale of houses.  The shattering reality with which we were faced when the property bubble collapsed and the world economy went into recession was that we did not have a sustainable method of funding Government, in particular, local government.  That is what this is all about.  That is the reality of Government.  It is the reality Sinn Féin has faced in the North and it will have to face in this Parliament if it wishes to be a true Opposition.

A proper broadening of the revenue base for local government will be the result of the household charge and the subsequent full property tax.In this country, local authorities are responsible for certain services and that is where the money raised from the charges will be spent.  They include fire and emergency services, maintenance and cleaning of streets, street lighting, planning and development services, public parks, libraries, open spaces and leisure facilities.  Those are essential local services which benefit all members of the public, including business, and are often taken for granted.  We expect to have streets lit at night and to have open spaces and playgrounds in which children can play and enjoy themselves.In common with all levels of Government, the financial position of local authorities remain under significant pressure.  At the same time, as part of the efforts to close the gap between income and expenditure in the public finances, Exchequer funding of the day-to-day activities of local authorities cannot be immune and, accordingly, the 2012 Exchequer allocation was reduced by €164 million compared to 2011.  Income from the household charge is, therefore, critical in ensuring that local authorities have the necessary resources to continue to deliver services to their communities.  However, within the constraints of introducing a relatively modest charge of broad application, the household charge sought to be as equitable as possible through specific provisions for exemptions and waivers in order to exclude those households in particular difficulty from the ambit of the charge.  I appreciate that even at €100, the charge is not welcome to people, especially those in difficult circumstances.  Members on all sides of the House understand and appreciate the difficulty the charge causes for many.  There is no doubt that it causes difficulty for people.  However, it is a necessary contribution to the funding of the State, which is spending more than it is raising.  Also, given the absence of a tax on residential property, it is a major gap with which we must deal.As there is no existing database of liable residential property ownership in the State, bills or invoices cannot issue.  In this regard, the charge has been made a self-assessment measure and it is for the owners of residential property to assess whether they are liable to pay the charge.  These arrangements are modelled largely on those applying to the €200 charge on non-principal private residences.  As of 15 June 2012, just under 960,000 residential properties had registered for the charge.  That in itself is a mark of the progress of the measure and that the necessity of it is recognised by the broad majority of the population.  Given the absence of any comprehensive tax on domestic property in more than 30 years and the fact that the State does not have a comprehensive database from which to work, this is significant progress in only a five and half month period.  More than 17,200 properties were registered for a waiver on the same date.  While 1 January is the liability date, actual payment of the charge was possible up to and including 31 March 2012.  Therefore, late payment fees and interest only apply if the charge was not paid in respect of a liable property after the three-month period.  Payment by instalments could be made at the time to assist homeowners with the additional cost.  Significant efforts were made to ensure that property owners were aware of the household charge.  We are all aware of the debate in the public domain in that regard.County and city councils have delegated their functions in administering the charge to the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, which is collecting the charge on a shared services basis for all local authorities.

I thought the scripts had been distributed.Similar to the €200 charge on non-principal private residences, an online system was developed by the Local Government Management Agency to enable homeowners to pay the household charge on the Internet.  In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque or postal order.  More than 60% of those who have paid to date have done so via the online system, which has the advantage of being convenient for the public as well as minimising administrative costs associated with the charge to the State.The proceeds of the household charge are paid directly into the local government fund.  Moneys are disbursed back to local authorities from the fund in general purpose grants based on the grant allocations made to local authorities, taking account of the need for appropriate equalisation.  The budgets of local authorities have been passed on the basis of receipts from the household charge.A number of exemptions to the household charge apply.  These include properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since their construction and residential property owned by a Minister of the Government.  Some poor souls thought that the private dwellings of Ministers were exempt but that is not the case.  I am sorry to disappoint those who suggested that.

Exemptions also include a housing authority or the Health Service Executive, voluntary and co-operative housing, residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling, residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts and residential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity, for example, when an elderly person moves into a nursing home.In addition to these exemptions, two important waivers apply in respect of the charge.  The programme for Government commits to giving consideration, in the context of introducing a property tax, to the impact that such a tax would have on the number of households in mortgage distress.  Households in receipt of mortgage interest supplement from the Department of Social Protection have therefore been excluded from the scope of the charge.  Mortgage interest supplement provides short-term support to help eligible households pay mortgage interest payments.  In excess of 18,000 households are expected to benefit from the waiver.A waiver has also been provided for households in certain categories of unfinished housing estates.  These housing estates have been listed in the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 and were informed by local authority returns to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government from the 2011 national survey of unfinished housing estates.  The Government's priority is to address the needs of those estates as quickly as possible but in the interim this waiver will benefit such residents as they work with other stakeholders in developing resolutions for problematic developments.  The cost of the waiver will abate over time as the issues in these estates are resolved and property owners become liable for the charge.  While I accept that the introduction of the household charge is an additional cost to households, the exemptions and waivers provided in the Act, added to the provisions for instalment payments, provide a reasonable response to those in particular need.  I consider it important to reiterate to Members those households for which no liability for the charge arises.  These include tenants in private rented accommodation, tenants in local authority housing, tenants in receipt of the supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement from the Department of Social Protection, households that are purchasing their homes under the shared ownership scheme where the local authorities in question still retain ownership stakes, tenants and-or those living in housing provided by voluntary and-or co-operative bodies, those living in housing vested in the HSE or a Minister, those home owners who have been forced to vacate their properties by reason of long-term mental or physical infirmity and are now living in properties that they do not themselves own, those households in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, home owners residing in certain unfinished housing estates and those residing in properties owned by charities or discretionary trusts.  In all of these circumstances, the Act provides a reasonable level of protection for those in greatest need in our communities.I understand the hardship that many people are facing.  Collection of the charge is a matter for local authorities and the legislation includes care and management provisions similar to those available to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of dealing with exceptional circumstances and where particular hardships are involved.  It is a matter for county and city managers to use these provisions to achieve collection of the charge while responding to difficult cases.In the event of non-payment of a household charge for which a person is liable by a certain date, the legislation provides for late payment fees and late payment interest of 1% per month or part thereof.  The late payment fee to apply in the case of a household charge paid not later than six months after the due date is 10% of the amount outstanding, 20% of the amount outstanding where the charge is paid later than six months and not later than 12 months after the due date and 30% of the amount outstanding where the charge is paid later than 12 months after the due date.These penalty provisions are proportionate to the level of the household charge and are similar to the provisions that apply under Revenue legislation in respect of the late filing and payment of certain taxes.  They are intended to act as an incentive to pay the charge as soon as people can.  The sooner they pay, the lower the penalties applied.  For those failing to comply with the legislation, the rolled up amount of a late payment fee should not be underestimated and non-payment for a period of two years will leave a person owing €280 when account is taken of the charges, the late payment fees and late payment interest.  We want no one to be in that position.  Local authorities also have power to take prosecutions against owners who fail to discharge their liabilities.  Prosecution will be by way of summary proceedings and a court may impose a class C fine, which ranges from €1,000 to €2,500.  This is a great deal of money and includes up to €100 per day until such time as a person pays the €100 charge.Provision has also been made for data exchanges between local authorities and the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, the ESB, the Property Registration Authority and the Revenue Commissioners.  These data are intended to assist local authorities in identifying properties that are liable for the charge and in following up on those households that have not paid.The Government is not solely focused on local government funding issues.  We are seeking to ensure that local government delivers the services that our communities expect as efficiently and cost effectively as possible.  We will ensure that the proceeds of the household charge will be put to optimum use in delivering local services and are determined that local authority cost bases will continue to be rigorously examined and reduced to maximise efficiencies that, in turn, impact positively on business.The public must be reassured that all funds are used to their benefit and that public services are being run as efficiently as possible.  Local government is to the fore of the efficiency effort.  It has managed to maintain front line services while reducing overall numbers between 2008 and 2012 by more than 8,000, some 22%.  In the same period, local government has become more affordable, having reduced revenue expenditure by €736 million, with nearly €200 million in efficiency savings being achieved in the past two years.  This efficiency drive will continue.The Government's commitment to aligning the community development sector with local government will see a stronger role for local authorities in local enterprise and community development while building on local initiative and enterprise.  This in turn will maximise the impact of investment to produce jobs at a local level.  There are many good examples of authorities working effectively with local enterprise to sustain and develop jobs.  The Government's decision to bring county enterprise boards into local authorities by the creation of new local enterprise offices will provide a rationalised, focused and high-quality service to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, through a more holistic approach to business support.  More generally, a new local government sectoral strategy to support jobs is being developed.  It will draw from these initiatives and build on best practice.The household charge has been introduced out of the necessity to ensure that local authority services are funded in a sustainable manner, to close the gap in income and expenditure in the national finances and to ensure that we meet our obligations under the EU-IMF programme.  The public want responsible opposition in the House, but a proposal to repeal this legislation is not responsible opposition.  The public want responsible debate in the House, but Sinn Féin's statements have not indicated a sensible approach to the management of our public finances, the funding of local government or the widening of the tax base.  For Deputy Stanley's party, it is hypocritical to propose the repeal of the household charge, given that party's involvement in government in Northern Ireland where local services are funded-----

However, time is required for that and the household charge was necessary as an immediate measure to meet the troika's timeframe.  This was the context in which the legislation was introduced.In terms of the full property tax, an independently chaired interdepartmental group was established in February to consider the structures and modalities for a full property tax.  Recently, the group completed its work and submitted its report to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The approach to the report will be considered by the Government in due course.The Government is concerned by the equity of any charge.  For this reason, the household charge was introduced as an interim measure, thereby providing the time to consider a property tax fully and to ensure that the issue of fairness and the implications for personal income levels, employment circumstances and property values are given full consideration.  The household charge is also necessary to ensure that local authorities will not need to curtail local service to their communities next year.  However, I accept that the charge is an additional cost on households.  I do not underestimate the daily financial pressures on families.  The charge has been set at the lowest possible level that is consistent with raising the required amount of funding in 2012.  Many of the most vulnerable groups are exempted or entitled to a waiver.  Provision has also been made for payment by instalment.The introduction of the €100 household charge on residential property is one of the measures that must be taken, reflecting the support programme, to close the gap between expenditure and revenue.  However, it should be seen as more than simply a measure to raise revenue.  It is a structural change to the State's revenue-raising system and provides an alternative revenue stream that will not be subject to the volatility associated with transaction-based property taxes.  The household charge represents a new local source of funding for local authorities and reduces their dependence on central government.The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 is crucial, not only to local government financing at present, but to the successful implementation of a future property tax.  The change it represents in terms of how we finance local authorities is essential to the future sustainability of local government and the future well-being of our communities.  If we care at all about the continuing provision of local services and the shaping of local communities, we must vote against this Bill.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I am grateful for the opportunity to partake in this debate on this exceptionally important matter, the household charge, which touches the hearts and minds of almost every household throughout the country.  I try to tune into my local radio station, Limerick's Live 95FM, which is more a regional station, as much as I can, even when in Dublin, through the Internet or on my smartphone.  Each morning the station has a radio phone-in show.  Over recent weeks, I have been struck by the number of people still phoning the show complaining about the household charge.  The one underlying theme in all of these calls is the inherent inequity of the household charge and the unfairness in how it has been applied.During the debate on the household charge legislation, Fianna Fáil opposed it in the form it was presented.  We did so because as a charge or a taxation, it did not meet two fundamental criteria.  It was neither equitable nor collectible.  Tonight the classic example was given of the millionaire versus the pensioner when it comes to how equitable the charge is.  A wealthy person will pay the same charge of €100 as someone in negative equity with mortgage arrears and other personal debt problems, who is out of a job and living on social welfare.  Therein lies the fundamental problem with the charge.  It is foolish to rationalise its concept.  That is the tenor of all the radio phone-in messages to radio stations throughout the country.Fianna Fáil proposed several amendments to the legislation to broaden the exemptions and waivers.  The Government would not hear of it at the time.  We did not even have an opportunity to move the amendments because the legislation was guillotined.  If I recall correctly, the legislation was published on the same day as the budget, which is highly questionable and irregular.  For such a new departure, as the Minister of State described it, and a structural change to the taxation system to be floated in on the same week as the budget and given two hours debate in the Dáil is wrong.  We are supporting this Sinn Féin Bill which will repeal the household charge legislation.  The charge should be re-introduced on an equitable basis.We all recognise local services have to be funded.  However, a root and branch fundamental reform of local government is required.  Any existing reforms are going on too much in a piecemeal fashion.  When the government parties were in opposition, they fought local elections on national issues.  Local elections traditionally and consistently have been a type of mid-term referendum on the Government of the day's performance.  During local elections, candidates campaign on national issues while not being held responsible for their local policies.  That has ill-served local government.  Funding of local government has always been on a centralised basis.  The introduction of the household charge was also done in a centralised way.  A local authority does not have the discretion to levy local taxes which is a problem that feeds into local democracy.Earlier, the issue of septic tank charges was raised.  This charge was debated both at length in committee and this House.  My party, along with Sinn Féin and the Technical Group, tabled an amendment to remove the registration charge of €50 but we were told the charge would raise €25 million.  Then one evening on the six o'clock news the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, prior to attending a Fine Gael public meeting in Dundrum House Hotel, County Tipperary, announced he was dropping the registration fee to €5.  We went from the Government opposing my party's amendment to remove the registration as it was a charge on the Exchequer to the Minister appearing on the news to announce he was dropping the charge to a fiver.  The message that sends to the public is that the Government is all over the shop when it comes to registration fees and charges.  If people are looking at this carry-on with the septic tank charge, of course they will think the same with the household charge.  That adds into the complications for people understanding the whole unfairness of the charge in the first instance.The Minister of State referred to unfinished housing estates, which is a significant issue.  Across the country, there are many unfinished estates that are not categorised as category three or category four and, accordingly, do not qualify for exemption from the charge.  The process by which those housing estates can now be categorised as unfinished is not published and is not clear to the public.  If a member of the public contacts the local authority and manages to get through the layers of bureaucracy to someone who might know, he or she will be told there is some type of a process.  For example, one estate in my constituency, Ceol na hAbhann in Caherconlish, is obviously unfinished, even to my non-construction eye, but it is not categorised as unfinished.  People in such estates are looking at the schedule of unfinished estates as it is published on the Internet but cannot make any sense of it.  We need to have an obvious rationale as to what basis estates are declared unfinished.The fundamental problem with the household charge is the lack of real or meaningful exemptions from payment.  I know the Minister has cited waivers for those in voluntary housing schemes and local authority rented houses.  Old age pensioners who live on the State pension alone should have also been exempted from the payment.  In the past people have been granted a discretionary a medical card because they were suffering from all sorts of complications and were highly dependent on medication.  However, those who formerly would have been granted a medical card have more recently been means-tested by an agency of the State.  If an individual is deemed eligible for a medical card, it is obvious that he or she has a difficulty in paying the household charge.Many younger couples who paid excessive stamp duty at the height of the boom are now facing mortgage arrears.  Approximately 90,000 mortgage holders are in arrears of 90 days or more.  Many of these households are living in unfinished housing estates.  It is unfair to expect them to pay the €100 charge.  A similar argument can be made in respect of those in negative equity.It will be argued that the household charge was part of the deal with the troika, but I sat down with its representatives during the period when Opposition Members were allowed to do so.  We were not afforded an opportunity to meet troika delegations during their last two visits.  The Government suddenly sent a signal to the troika that it should not meet Opposition Members, which is not good for politics.  In our last meeting with the troika we drew its attention to the unfairness of the household charge and were told it was a matter for the Government to prioritise.  It did not have to be introduced this year.  The Government can introduce whatever measures it likes from a menu of items, provided the bottom line figure is met.  I do not accept its argument that the household charge was part of the memorandum of understanding.  It had an array of options from which to choose.I will finish where I started, with the people ringing my local radio station in Limerick.  What is happening in Limerick is repeated in other parts of the country.  Where do the people of Limerick city and county stand now that 45% of households have not registered because the vast majority are simply unable to pay?  The Irish League of Credit Unions has found in a survey that people have been put to the pin of their collar.  Will the 45% of Limerick people who encounter difficulty in paying the household charge be hauled before the courts?When one introduces a charge or tax, one must recognise inability to pay and the need for fairness and equity.  The Government should have heeded Fianna Fáil's proposals for reasonable exemptions and waivers for old age pensioners, the unemployed, those in receipt of social welfare payments, medical card holders and those in negative equity or with mortgage arrears.  We recognise that certain people can afford to pay the household charge, but others are unable to pay and working people in middle Ireland are being squeezed.  The Revenue Commissioners are to be mandated to pursue these same individuals through the PAYE system.  We need a fundamental debate on the bloc of people who are working and paying for everything.  We cannot continue along our current path in the absence of growth in the economy.  The household charge, as it stands, is unjust and unfairly applied across the country.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The United Left Alliance supports the Bill and will vote in favour of it tomorrow evening.  The tabling of the Bill by Sinn Féin gives us an opportunity to debate the issues arising from the household and water taxes.  That is all it does, however, because it will be voted down by the combined forces of Fine Gael and the Labour Party which shamelessly continue to pursue their savage and unjust austerity policies and their ruinous approach of putting the gambling debts of speculators and bankers on the shoulders of the working class.  The fact that the Bill will be defeated raises the question of how ordinary people who are not prepared to accept this new imposition as part of the bailing out of European financial markets and who represent a majority in society can impose their will on the Government.  How can this household tax be defeated, if not by a vote in the Dáil?  The answer is that it can only be defeated by the mass opposition of ordinary people, expressed through the mass boycott being observed by a majority of households.The boycott of the home tax and the campaign of mass opposition which is active in every county and uses tactics of peaceful civil disobedience reflect the opinion of the majority.  That is why it is regrettable that Deputy Stanley in presenting the Bill referred to the campaign against the household and water taxes, its spokespeople and the Deputies who supported the boycott as engaging in cheap or easy populism.  He claims such an approach is irresponsible because we will be unable to pay any of the fines boycotting households risk incurring.  I am afraid that is entirely the wrong approach to take.  It behoves us to tell the truth that only an active boycott campaign can defeat the tax; otherwise we will be depending on votes in the Dáil.  Householders have made the decision to come together in solidarity to organise the boycott.  This has been expressed by the tens of thousands who attended mass meetings up and down the country and the fact that, leaving aside those who own multiple houses, the majority of households have refused to register.  This is the biggest campaign of civil disobedience in the State since small farmers organised a boycott of land annuities in the 1920s.  Those discredited payments where made to former absentee landlords who were not unlike the bondholders and speculators of today who reside in far flung lands while laying their debts on the shoulders of the people.  Sinn Féin's leadership should be supporting the many activists in its own ranks who actively support the boycott.The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government again threatened compliant taxpayers.  He scandalously threatened the imposition of huge fines, including one of €2,500 for failure to pay a household tax of €100.  What threats have been used against the bankers, speculators and bondholders who crashed the economy?  It is disgraceful for the Government to threaten those who are the tax paying backbone of the country with persecution.  This tax is a precursor to the so-called property tax which in reality will be a home tax rather than a wealth tax.  A report in theSunday Business Post that Revenue might be given powers to deduct the property tax from wages blows out of the water the Government’s fiction that the property or home tax will not be a tax on work.  If the Government persists in dragging decent people through the courts, it will face a bitter and widespread war of people power.  It should drop this tax forthwith in the interests of justice.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	361	While the current economic environment presents a significant challenge for the health system generally in delivering services, mental health services are being treated as a priority in so far as we can.  In that regard, consideration was given to the mental health sector in Budget 2012 through a special allocation of €35m for mental health which was in line with the Programme for Government commitments.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to enhance both General Adult and Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams, improve access to psychological therapies in primary care and implement suicide prevention strategies.  The provision of this special allocation, compared to other sectors of health, recognises that mental health services are provided to vulnerable groups.
I fully accept that the impact of any reductions in mental health services must be minimised while ensuring that the needs of service users remains the highest priority. Notwithstanding the difficult financial environment, this Government is determined to do everything possible to protect services, to respond to priority needs and to support ongoing reform of the public health services within the resources available for health.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	362	As the Deputy is aware this country is facing a great economic challenge. In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. In terms of service delivery, we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us. This means we need to focus on how beds are used, on the throughput of patients, on reducing length of stay to international norms and on having as many procedures as possible carried out as day cases rather than inpatient work, thus maximising also the efficient usage of operating theatre facilities.In relation to Cavan General Hospital the hospital has informed me that it has opted to control its budget by reducing scheduled routine theatre activity to alternate weeks.  It is important to note that all patients requiring emergency and urgent surgical/gynae procedures will continue to have these procedures performed as normal.  I have been advised that there has been a robust consultative process and communication plan with all Consultants, Clinical Directors, staff, service users and the public in relation to these planned service changes. This process commenced in Quarter one well in advance of the change. The process was also discussed within the mechanism established as part the Public Service Agreement.In relation to Cavan General Hospital I can confirm that it is performing well,  maintaining the 12 month waiting time target and making significant progress on achieving the new 9 month target, the child 20 week target and the 13 week GI endoscopy target.  Waiting list data for the hospital at the end March showed that 78% of patients were on the list for under 3 months, 16% between 3-6 months and the remaining 6% for over 6 months.  The evidence to date shows that Cavan General Hospital has maintained a very good activity rate.  The hospital looks set to achieve all of the targets that have been set by the SDU.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I can confirm that I have been approached by numerous companies with a view to funding the provision of primary care centres in Ireland.  It is my Department's policy to work with all interested parties to facilitate the provision of primary care infrastructure which delivers value for money.  There are always more construction projects than can be funded from the Exchequer's capital health care allocation.  The primary care infrastructure model offers a good fit for private sector finance.  The infrastructure development, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary health care and represents a tangible re-focussing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.  The Exchequer will continue to fund the delivery of Primary Care Centres in deprived urban areas, small rural towns and isolated areas.The Programme for Government sets out our commitment to ensuring a better and more efficient health system, a single-tier health service that will deliver equal access to health care based on need not income.  The key objective of the Primary Care Strategy is to develop services in the community which will give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other health care disciplines.  In a developed primary care system, up to 95 per cent of people's day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  These enable multi-disciplinary services to be delivered on a single site, provide a single point of access for users, and encourage closer coordination between health providers.  I will continue to explore and examine innovative solutions to the provision of the necessary primary care infrastructure.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I am strongly committed to protecting the principle of community rating in the private health insurance market. Community rating means that everybody is charged the same premium for a particular plan, irrespective of age, gender and state of health. Community rating needs a robust system of risk equalisation. Otherwise insurers will have a strong incentive to avoid older customers and retain only healthy customers who are less likely to make claims. The Interim Risk Equalisation Scheme was introduced in 2009 to provide direct support to community rating. In order to keep down the cost of health insurance for older people, I was pleased to significantly increase the age-related income tax credit under the Interim Scheme for insured persons aged 60 years and over, from 1 January 2012.In December 2011, the Government agreed to introduce a new Risk Equalisation Scheme with effect from 1 January 2013 which will replace the present Interim Scheme. The new scheme will allow for a greater number of risk factors than the Interim Scheme, including a measure of health status. The Heads of a Bill to give effect to the new Scheme are being finalised and, subject to Government approval, a Bill will be published as soon as possible so that the necessary legislation is enacted to give effect to the Scheme from 1 January 2013.My Department has no specific information about the extent to which private medicine is replacing the public sector, if at all, in the context of the provision of services. I can, however, provide information on the numbers of persons currently holding private health insurance. There has been a decrease in the numbers with private health insurance, by just 46,000 in the five year period from end-March 2007 to end-March 2012.  This is a very modest decline in private health insurance coverage, at just over 2% of the overall market. Some 2.139 million, or 46.6% of the population, is still covered by private health insurance. Even in the current difficult financial climate, the vast majority of consumers holding private health insurance are choosing to retain some level of health insurance cover rather than allowing policies to lapse completely.I have set out available information requested by the Deputy concerning the total number of hospital beds in the public sector in a table for circulation.The Deputy also refers to bed costs in the public sector in comparison with those in the private sector. When individuals elect to be treated privately, they agree to meet the costs of the consultant's fees, which are a private contractual matter between the consultant and the patient, as well as the hospital's maintenance costs.  Whilst it is not the role of the Minister for Health to determine costs associated with the provision of care in private facilities which are covered by any private health insurer, I have made it very clear to the Company with the largest share of the market (VHI) that they should increase their efforts to drive down the cost of health care and procedures. Each private health insurance provider has the right to determine which private health care providers and facilities they will cover, subject to providing a minimum level of cover determined by regulation. It is a matter for each insurer to negotiate and enter contracts with the private hospitals concerned, which in turn will be a determining factor in the maintenance cost per bed-day. However, a significant proportion of private patients who are provided with treatment by a public hospital are not currently charged for the services because of current rules on bed designation. It is intended to introduce new arrangements to allow public hospitals to raise charges in respect of all private patients in public hospitals, in keeping with the long-standing policy of moving towards recovering the full economic cost of providing treatment to private patients in public hospitals.I have also set out available information on the applicable charging rates for inpatient and daycare services for public and private patients in the table for circulation.With regard to cost of health insurance premiums generally, I would strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs. Where customers wish to switch products, the relevant health insurance legislation ensures that switching is as easy and seamless as possible for customers.The following table sets out the position in relation to the number of beds in the public hospital system:In-Patient BedsDay Beds/PlacesPublicPrivateNon designatedTotalPublicPrivateNon designatedTotalTotals 20079,0342,24984012,1231,245222781,545Totals 20088,6962,25189911,6781,2992172211,737Totals 20098,4272,20390811,5381,3192252281,772Totals 20108,0842,19088511,1591,3752232591,857Funding and Charging of Public PatientsInpatient and Daycase Services: Public patients who are admitted as an inpatient or daycase patient are liable for a statutory charge of €75 per day capped at a maximum of €750 in any period of twelve consecutive months.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	365	In 2000 the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in the USA raised concerns in relation to Poly Implant Prosthese (PIP)saline breast implants.  Although produced by the same manufacturer, the Poly Implant Prosthese (PIP) silicone gel implants, which were recalled in March 2010, are a separate product to the saline breast implants which were of concern to the FDA in 2000.  In 2000 my Department was the competent authority for medical devices in Ireland.  From the records available in my Department and in the Irish Medicines Board, there is no record of my Department receiving, at that time, any notification regarding the FDA action, to which the Deputy refers. There is, however, a reference to receipt of an alert from the UK regulatory authority in January 2001 concerning PIP hydrogel implant products, which are the same product as the saline breast implant withdrawn by the FDA in the USA in 2000.  I am informed that, at the time, it was the practice in my Department to fax copies of these product safety alerts to hospitals on a regular basis.  In October 2001 the IMB became the competent authority for medical devices.  The IMB has been actively involved in the exchange of vigilance information between EU Member States since October 2001 and the exchange of vigilance information between global medical device regulators since 2004.  In addition, the IMB has a memorandum of understanding with the FDA regarding regulatory issues since 2005.In Europe medical devices are regulated under 3 EU Directives that specify the requirements which must be met before any device can be placed on the market.  A medical device must obtain a CE mark from an independent Notified Body before it can be placed on the market in any EU Member State.  The PIP silicone breast implants were manufactured in France and certified by a Notified Body in Germany. This certification allowed the product to be freely placed on the Irish market.The IMB is responsible for post market surveillance and vigilance of medical devices. Market recall of the PIP silicone breast implants was initiated in Ireland by the IMB in March 2010 following receipt of notification from the French medical devices regulatory authority.  The recall followed an inspection of the PIP implant manufacturing site in France which identified unauthorised silicone gel being used in the manufacture of the product.  Since March 2010 the IMB engaged with the treating clinics and the recipients of the PIP breast implants to provide up-to-date information regarding the situation.  My Department has also been engaging with the clinics and recipients to ensure that follow up care meets the appropriate professional standards.  The international scientific research undertaken since 2010 has found no increased medical risks associated with this implant.The EU Commission is currently reviewing the regulatory framework for medical devices and expects to publish proposals for a revision of the legislation in September 2012. I expect my Department, with support from the IMB, to play a key role in the negotiations of this legislation during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the EU in 2013.  As the new legislation will take a number of years to come into effect, the EU Commission has prepared a plan designed to address some of the weaknesses identified in the EU medical devices regulatory system.  My Department and the IMB are fully committed to the implementation of this plan.

I have moved quickly to address one of the key recommendations, the establishment of a committee to oversee the implementation of the report. The oversight committee, which I announced on 11 June, will be chaired by Dr Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer. Confirmation of some members is awaited and I will announce the membership when that is received.Overall, HIQA's report makes recommendations about unscheduled care, scheduled care, and board governance. Many of the recommendations are in line with the Government's stated policy intention to reform scheduled and unscheduled access to acute services through:(i) clinical standards and performance targets;(ii) rigorous performance management of access, quality and budgets; and(iii)  proper accountability through the establishment of hospital groups and, eventually, hospital trusts.Many of the changes required are already underway or planned. The hospital's board and management team have fully accepted the report and its outcomes and recommendations. The staff of the hospital have a hugely important role in responding to the challenges ahead in order to allow Tallaght Hospital to achieve its potential.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	367	A special allocation of €35m for mental health was provided in Budget 2012 in line with commitments in the Programme for Government.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to enhance both General Adult and Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams, improve access to psychological therapies in primary care and implement suicide prevention strategies.It is planned that 414 staff will be recruited to the mental health service to deliver on these objectives.  In order to establish this figure, a detailed gap analysis of the present composition of 185 Community Teams had to be undertaken.  The exact staffing requirement including the discipline, grade and number relating to each team in all of the four main regions was identified as quickly as possible after the HSE National Service Plan was approved by the Minister.  HSE approvals have already issued to three of the four Regional Directors of Operations for the filling of posts in their areas.  One further approval is expected to issue in the near future.  The process of recruitment commences immediately on approval.  It is proposed that the new professionals will be drawn from existing National Recruitment Service panels where available and new competitions will be established for the remaining posts.  Appointments to these posts are expected to commence in the coming weeks and the majority of them should be filled over the summer months.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	368	The introduction of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,A Fair Deal,in October 2009 brought about a fundamental change in the way in which long-term nursing home care is funded and, consequently, the way in which nursing homes are funded.  In the past, public nursing homes/community geriatric hospitals would have been allocated a lump sum annually by the HSE. However, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme provides financial support to the individuals that need long-term nursing home care, not to the facilities providing the care. The scheme is designed to ensure that money follows the patients, regardless of whether they choose public, private or voluntary nursing homes, and to ensure that these facilities are not being funded for empty beds.Funding arrangements in relation to other services which may be provided in public nursing homes/community geriatric hospitals, e.g. short-term care for respite, rehabilitation, convalescence etc, remain unaffected by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  When the Scheme was introduced, a commitment was made to review its operation after three years. The reason for allowing this period to elapse is to ensure that trends and statistics will be available in order to inform the work.  The Terms of Reference for the review are: Taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation—1. To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,2. To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices,3. Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services, and4. To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.A call for submissions to inform the review was placed in national newspapers on the 14th June. The closing date for receipt of submissions is the 16th July. Thereafter, the Department of Health will be seeking tenders through the public procurement process for the carrying out of the review. This process takes approximately 4 months. It is anticipated that the review itself will take approximately three months to complete. It is expected that the review will commence in the last quarter of this year and be completed in early 2013.As the Scheme is statutory based, the implementation of any recommendations arising from the review may require significant amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I wish to advise the Deputy that there is no embargo on the reopening of closed beds.  I believe we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us. This means we need to focus on how beds are used, on the throughput of patients, on reducing length of stay to international norms and on having as many procedures as possible carried out as day cases rather than inpatient work.The work of the Special Delivery Unit, together with implementation of the Clinical Care Programmes in the HSE, will help to improve the efficiency of our hospitals, allowing us to treat as many patients as possible within budget. I believe that pursuing efficiencies through these means will be a far more productive approach than debating the number of beds open or closed at any one time.  In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. The emphasis in 2012 will continue to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter lengths of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery.  In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it provides safe, effective and efficient care to the maximum number of patients.Throughout 2012 hospitals will open and close beds on various wards in order to deliver the planned level of activity. These beds may be closed for a number of reasons, including cost containment, infection control and refurbishment. It is not possible at this time to determine what beds in which wards will be closed and what length of time they will be closed for. The decision to open and close beds is made at hospital management level and approved by the Regional Director of Operations.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I want to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely and appropriately in smaller, local hospitals. On this basis, the organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the ongoing development of the HSE Clinical Programmes.  The Framework for the future development of smaller hospitals has been drafted by a joint HSE/Departmental group.  Consultation with all stakeholders, including patients and public representatives, will be an integral part of the process of implementing the framework for smaller hospitals.This framework will demonstrate clearly that the future of smaller hospitals is secure. It will set out what services can and should be delivered safely by these hospitals in the interest of better outcomes for patients.   I am currently examining the Framework in the context of the overall reorganisation of the health services.   That includes the development of hospital groups.  The changes that will and must take place will have a considerable impact on how our hospital services are aligned.  As Minister for Health I am eager to initiate improvements to our hospital system, however due consideration must be given to the Framework to ensure that when implemented it will optimise the significant resources smaller hospitals have to offer.  It is my intention to publish the Framework when this process has been completed.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The HSE National Service Plan 2012 outlines, as required in legislation, the type and volume of services to be provided this year in return for the resources made available by the Oireachtas. The Plan acknowledges that there will be an inevitable and unavoidable reduction in services this year because of the scale of the financial and staffing challenge facing the health service. However, it also outlines the various actions that will be taken to mitigate as far as possible the impact which the budget and staff cuts would otherwise have on services. In framing the Plan, the HSE was asked to avoid across the board cuts in budgets and to ensure that reductions in budgets should not lead to a corresponding reduction in services. This is in line with the objectives of the Government's health reform programme to prioritise our services in a way that supports those in greatest need.In the case of disability services, the Plan provides for a 3.7% reduction in budgets but makes it clear that there is scope for achieving efficiencies of 2% or more through measures such as consolidation and rationalisation of back office costs. All providers will be expected to achieve some efficiency savings but the level of savings required will vary depending on the profile of the service provider, efficiency savings achieved to date and the scope for further savings.   Some reductions in day services, residential and respite services will be unavoidable even with such efficiencies. The aim will be to tailor such reductions to minimise the impact on service users and families as much as possible.The parameters applying to disability services in the Service Plan were informed by strong representations from organisations representing people with disabilities. The HSE and my Department recognise the valuable contribution disability organisations make to the provision of services to adults and children with disabilities, and acknowledge the significant savings and other efficiencies that service providers have made in general since 2008. Given the challenges service providers are experiencing, I recognise that the maintaining of service levels within available resources will require significant levels of cooperation, change, flexibility and creativity on the part of all stakeholders. HSE Disability Managers are currently engaging with service providers in line with the Service Plan requirements to achieve the necessary efficiencies in 2012
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I propose to take Questions Nos. 126, 136 and 157 together.Professor Oonagh Walsh, independent researcher from University College Cork was commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health to draft a report in relation to the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.  This draft report is the first stage of a two-stage process in relation to this research on the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland. This first stage is an independent academic research report, which is based on an analysis of published medical reports and research. The draft report contains information about how frequently symphysiotomy was carried out in Ireland and compares rates with other countries. The second stage in the research, which is now underway, is a consultation process on the draft report involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have undergone symphysiotomy.The final report, which will take full account of the consultation outcomes and include recommendations, will be presented to me for consideration of any actions that may be required to address the issues concerned.  The researcher expects to complete the final report in the Autumn. I then intend to publish the report after it is presented to me, subject to the usual legal considerations but I do not anticipate any significant difficulties in that regard.  I do not wish to express any views on the draft report which is going to consultation to preserve the independence of the research process and to allow the women in particular to provide their views in the consultation concentrating solely on the research report and without being possibly deflected from that process by any statements from me.  I remain determined to bring this matter to a conclusion for all women concerned as soon as possible.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The Government has recently approved the drafting of legislation to abolish the Board of the Health Service Executive and to provide for a Directorate to be the new governing body for the HSE in place of the Board.  The intention is that the Bill will be drafted as a matter of urgency so that it can be considered by the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  In tandem with the proposed new legal structures, new administrative structures will be put in place within the HSE which will reflect the need for a greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services and greater transparency about funding, service delivery and accountability.  The new arrangements will include a separate Directorate for Mental Health.  Consideration is currently being given to how best to give effect to the new administrative structures, including the selection and appointment of new directors at national level.  It is not intended to appoint directors until this process is complete.The Deputy will appreciate that the current economic environment presents a significant challenge for the health system generally in delivering services.  However, mental health is being treated as a priority in so far as we can.  Total funding for mental health in 2012 is in the region of €707 million.  Like all other care areas, efficiency and other savings were required in 2012 from the Mental Health Service.  However, in Budget 2012, a special allocation of €35m for mental health was announced in line with the Programme for Government commitments.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children's mental health services which will ensure, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.   This is very much in keeping with the policy set out in aVision for Change.    Some of the funding will also be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and response to self-harm presentations and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.The HSE National Service Plan, which has been approved by the Minister for Health, sets out the type and volume of service the HSE will provide directly, or through a range of funded agencies, during 2012.  The Plan which was prepared in the context of the challenges faced by the health services this year in terms of reduced staffing levels, and a reduced budget, combined with increasing demand for services will be the subject of continuous review.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	374	Section 11 of the General Medical Services (GMS) GP Capitation Contract, which was introduced in 1989, provides that the medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the Health Service Executive, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  General Practitioners (GPs) who hold General Medical Services (GMS) contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders for services covered under the GMS contract.  In circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary to either:(a)  assist in the process of diagnosing a patient; or(b)  monitor a diagnosed condition;the GP may not charge the patient if they are eligible for free GMS services.At my request, the HSE has written to all GMS GPs reminding them of their obligations under their contract in respect of services such as phlebotomy and advised them that charges should not be applied for such services.  The HSE is encouraging eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services to seek a refund from the GP in question.  Alternatively, they may wish to follow up with the HSE and the matter will be fully investigated.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE's Consumer Affairs Service.It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to phlebotomy services and other such services will be considered as part of the new contract.

The processing of benefits in some cases can be very complex .  Where delays have been experienced, or where a retired staff member has requested to be paid some monies, the HSE has made interim part-payments.  This is in order to minimise financial hardship.  This part-payment is made while the retired employee's full career service and pensionable earnings are being verified.  The HSE administer payment of pensions and lump sums to retiring staff in accordance with the terms of their superannuation scheme.  There is no provision in the superannuation scheme for the payment of interest on lump sumps, as referred to by the Deputy.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	376	The HSE March 2012 Report showed that a total of 158,850 patients are waiting less than 12 months for a first time outpatient attendance. A further 45,959 patients are waiting over 12 months. It is likely that these are an underestimate of those waiting as not all hospitals are currently reporting outpatient waiting time data to the HSE.  The issue of Outpatient waiting lists was essentially an untended problem. The scale of the problem was unmeasured and consequently no special action was taken to deal with it. This Government intends to change that. I have instructed the Special Delivery Unit to give priority to devising methods for dealing with the issue of the Outpatient waiting lists.Work has already commenced on the systematic and automatic collection of waiting time data, at an individual patient level in a standardised format from all hospitals providing an Outpatient service. This will be the first time that such detailed data will be available at a national level from all hospitals. The collation and analysis of Outpatient waiting time data will reveal how many patients are waiting by region, by hospital, by specialty and by Consultant. The SDU and NTPF are aiming to publish outpatient waiting time data in the near future.The next step will be to then set a maximum waiting time target for a first Outpatient appointment. Hospitals will be held responsible and accountable for ensuring that patients are seen in Outpatients within this maximum waiting time. The SDU and the National Treatment Purchase Fund will assist hospitals in targeting their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen, assessed and appropriately treated.   In parallel with reducing the numbers of those waiting longest, the SDU will also commence work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of Outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen by the right health professional at the right time.The goal is to improve access by implementing an Out Patient Service Performance Improvement Programme that will underpin a radical transformation of how Out Patient services are delivered in Ireland.

The Chief Medical Officer has met with and continues to engage with the clinics to ensure that best practice and patient support is paramount in the service provided to concerned recipients of these implants.The provision of an improved care package by the treating clinic referenced by the Deputies continues to be the subject of intense discussions between my officials and the provider concerned and the CMO continues to liaise with the provider in this regard.  The provider has committed to rolling out a care package which would include face to face consultations with a surgeon and follow on care if required and my Department has welcomed and encouraged such a work programme.  My Department will continue to support all parties in advancing acceptable and appropriate provision of care but the resolution of the issues arising has to be between provider and client and an appropriate solution found between the parties.The Department's website and the website of the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) continue to provide regular updates and information on the ongoing EU and international scientific investigation of PIP implants.  The advice of both my Department and the IMB has remained constant and readily available to all interested parties, i.e.:there is no evidence of increased risk of cancer for women with this brand of implant;the risk of rupture is within expected norms and routine explantation is not recommended;anyone with a concern about their breast implants should discuss the matter with their GP or surgeon.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I propose to take Questions Nos. 133, 569 and 592 together.In the health service, agency staff have traditionally been used to meet a short-term service need or where some flexibility in staffing a service is required. In 2011, although the HSE had negotiated new agency contracts which involve lower unit costs, the use of agency staff accounted for approximately €177 million. This was accounted for in part by the usage of agency staffing to cover longer-term staffing needs. When locum staff, who are health service employees, are added, the total amounts to over €200 million.The HSE's National Service Plan 2012 commits to significantly lowering the volume of agency usage across all staff functions, with a target reduction of up to 50% in 2012. The Plan also notes that the transposition into Irish law of the Temporary Agency Work Directive will increase the unit cost of agency staffing.   Agency staff are the employees of the agencies concerned and as such the number of individuals engaged in such work is not reported.Agency Costs2008200920102011€000€000€000€000Clinical68,65567,176109,389125,443Non Clinical16,29415,09422,68217,453Other Client / Patient Services32,11226,06121,30633,674Total117,061108,331153,377176,570National Treatment Purchase Fund expenditure on agency staffing was €5,234 was 2008.

While I was disappointed at that decision, I am not in a position to intervene in the commercial decisions of the Vhi or any other health insurer.  I have raised the issue with the Chairperson and CEO of the Vhi in the context of competition and will continue to monitor Vhi's approach to such decisions.Deputy Kelleher may be aware that his matter is now the subject of legal proceedings issued against the Vhi by the liquidator appointed to the operators of the Mahon facility.  An order to provide security for the costs of this legal action was issued by the High Court on 12 June as the Court is not satisfied that a prima facie case has been made out as to the existence of a causal connection between the refusal of the Vhi to approve the facility at Mahon and the claimed loss resulting from its cessation of operations.

Healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists etc employed by such clinics are required to be registered with their relevant professional regulatory body.  Much of the legislation governing healthcare professionals has been extensively updated and amended in recent years with the publication of a number of relevant Acts including The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, The Medical Practitioners Act 2007, The Pharmacy Act 2007 and The Nurses and Midwives Act 2011.  In addition, my Department is in the process of preparing legislation to make it mandatory for all medical practitioners engaged in clinical practice to have adequate clinical indemnity insurance.The Madden Commission on Patient Safety identified cosmetic surgery as one of the priority areas that should be addressed by a new system of licensing.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the Licensing of Health Facilities Bill which will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health service providers.  The legislative proposals are being prepared broadly in line with recommendations made by the Madden Commission  and are designed to improve patient safety by ensuring that healthcare providers do not operate below core standards which are applied in a consistent and systematic way.  The intention is to have a proportionate system which has the confidence of the public.  Standards and other requirements will be enforceable through inspection and imposition of sanctions as necessary.  Licensing will be targeted at areas which are not currently subject to regulation.

In the meantime I am making arrangements to put better information in place for people who are planning to undergo cosmetic surgery in Ireland.

The aim of the Review was to consider all the possible options for the earliest possible delivery of a new children's hospital. The Group has now presented its report, which I intend to consider carefully before bringing to Government.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I believe we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us. This means we need to focus on how beds are used, on the throughput of patients, on reducing length of stay to international norms and on having as many procedures as possible carried out as day cases rather than inpatient work.  The work of the Special Delivery Unit, together with implementation of the Clinical Care Programmes in the HSE, will help to improve the efficiency of our hospitals, allowing us to treat as many patients as possible within budget. I believe that pursuing efficiencies through these means will be a far more productive approach than debating the number of beds open or closed at any one time.In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. The emphasis in 2012 will continue to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter lengths of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery.  In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it provides safe, effective and efficient care to the maximum number of patients.Throughout 2012 hospitals will open and close beds on various wards in order to deliver the planned level of activity. These beds may be closed for a number of reasons, including cost containment, infection control and refurbishment. It is not possible at this time to determine what beds in which wards will be closed and what length of time they will be closed for. The decision to open and close beds is made at hospital management level and approved by the Regional Director of Operations.In relation to the Deputys question on waiting times the Government fully accepts that waiting times for patients awaiting an elective surgical procedure are too long. One of my first priorities as Minister for Health was to set a maximum waiting time target of 12 months to be achieved by all hospitals by the end of 2011. I can confirm that 95% of hospitals achieved this target.  The immediate challenge for 2012 was to maintain the 12 month maximum waiting time target for in patient and day case procedures and then to continually improve and move to a 9 month maximum waiting time target by the end of 2012.The latest available figures from the end of April 2012 show that:99% of patients   were given a scheduled treatment date within 12 months.94% of patients   were given a scheduled treatment date within 9 months.78% of patients   were given a scheduled treatment date within 6 months.These figures demonstrate that progress is being made in relation to reducing the maximum waiting times for patients awaiting an inpatient or daycase procedure and our health service is on target to ensure that no patient has to wait more than 9 months for surgery.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to focus on waiting lists and that when the 9 month target has been achieved later in 2012, the SDU will focus on reducing that target even further.

To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,2. To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices,3. Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services, and4. To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.A call for submissions to inform the review was placed in national newspapers on the 14th June. The closing date for receipt of submissions is the 16th July. Thereafter, the Department of Health will be seeking tenders through the public procurement process for the carrying out of the review. This process takes approximately 4 months. It is anticipated that the review itself will take approximately three months to complete. It is expected that the review will commence in the last quarter of this year and be completed in early 2013.  As the Scheme is statutory based, the implementation of any recommendations arising from the review may require significant amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.

In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it.  In terms of service delivery, we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	389	The Health Service Executive announced on 3 May that from that date Ipilimumab (trade name Yervoy), the new drug for patients with progressive melanoma, was being made available.  The decision was the culmination of a comprehensive technology review process within the National Cancer Control Programme which included the drug company submission, a clinical practice guideline from medical oncologists and a pharmacoeconomic analysis by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  A subsequent written notice was issued by the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) on 15 May to all hospital CEOs, medical oncologists and also hospital chief pharmacists that Ipilimumab was now available and providing additional information re patient eligibility.  The letter also provided an interim means for hospitals to register patients for the drug.  To the end of last week, 5 registrations had been received.On 8 June, the NCCP wrote to the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Scheme (PCRS), confirming that the PCRS was implementing this new system whereby hospitals administering Ipilimumab should register the patient and the diagnosis with PCRS and submit billings to PCRS as the first drug to be administered under this new national oncology drugs demand led scheme, whereby money will follow the patient in a national process which captures eligibility information and utilisation.  The final steps in the reimbursement process will be communicated to hospital CEOs in the next 2 weeks.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I propose to take Questions Nos. 146, 659 and 677 together.My Department has primary responsibility for advising me on issues relating to national policy development and review, while the HSE has responsibility for the delivery of health and personal social services.  In line with the Programme for Government commitments, a series of legislative changes are planned to bring about radical reform of the health services which will see the introduction of Universal Health Insurance.On 29 May, the Government approved the drafting of legislation to abolish the Board of the HSE and to provide for a Directorate to be the new governing body for the HSE in place of the Board.  The intention is that the Bill will be drafted as a matter of urgency so that it can be considered by the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  In tandem with the proposed new governance structures, new administrative structures will be put in place in the HSE, to reflect the need for a greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services and greater transparency about funding, service delivery and accountability.The health reform programme is a complex and major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing.  Detailed consideration must be given to the optimal structures for delivery of different services and to the critical inter-relationships between services as well as best practice in health care reform.  These new governance and administrative arrangements represent important first steps in the process of delivering the reform agenda contained in the Programme for Government.  The next steps, which will include measures to facilitate clearer and better integrated delivery and funding arrangements, are under consideration at present.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I can confirm that my Department has not had discussions with the Data Protection Commissioner regarding insurance companies accessing the files of patients.  Health insurers, in common with all other organisations and persons in the public and private sectors who collect, use, have access to or disclose personal data (which includes any medical information relating to living identifiable individuals) are obliged to comply fully with the Data Protection Acts.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The most recent data on total expenditure on health in Ireland, which includes both public and private, refers to 2010 and is compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  This indicates total expenditure of €14,334 million of which €9,964 million relates to public expenditure and €4,370 million to private expenditure.  The latter figure includes expenditure on private health insurance (€1,817 million) and out-of pocket expenses (€2,489 million).  Further breakdown on types of private health expenditure are not routinely available from the CSO.In the interpretation of these figures it should be noted that the OECD data differs from the Revised Estimates figures for funding of the health group of Votes.  The principal reason for this is that, to enable international comparability, the OECD excludes spending on a range of matters such as personal social services.  It includes a much smaller amount related to spending by the Department of Social Protection on medical benefits.  The Revised Estimates for the Public Services show expenditure for the health group of Votes in 2010 of €15,178 million.

Government policy is support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible. This is realised through a range of community based services such as Home Help, Home Care Packages, Meals-on-Wheels or Day/Respite Care.While the HSE Service Plan 2012 involves a reduction of around 3.5% in mainstream Home Help hours nationally, from just over 11m hours in 2011 to 10.7m hours this year, the corresponding reduction proposed in the actual number of people receiving Home Help drops by just under 2% or, in other words, from some 51,000 recipients last year to 50,000 in 2012. This reflects various recent operational improvements by the HSE, including an increased focus towards more personalised care at individual level.  In addition, the current HSE Service Plan maintains Home Care Packages for this year at 2011 levels. This enhanced care option usually contains a significant Home Help element. This emphasis in the Plan indicates a strong commitment to Government policy, in the light of evolving resources and competing demands.

The Expert Body has concluded that the report is not reliable. The Expert Body's Appraisal and an Executive Summary of the Appraisal are available on the Expert Body's website,www.fluoridesandhealth.ie.  I understand that the report has been circulated to some national and local authorities in Ireland, some of whom have communicated with my Department regarding its content. My Department has received no communication from health authorities outside the jurisdiction regarding the report.Fundamentally the Expert Body maintains that there continues to be overwhelming evidence that water fluoridation significantly benefits dental health and through this, benefits overall health. The Expert Body is satisfied having studied current peer reviewed scientific evidence worldwide that water fluoridation causes no ill effects to the health of adults or children. There are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	397	Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care.  While reiterating this Government's commitment to the future public provision of residential care for older people, we must also recognise that the HSE is facing challenges in respect of all services in 2012.  In the case of Community Nursing Units these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.  In this regard the HSE is carrying out a viability review of all its long stay nursing homes. When complete, this will give a clear outline and profile of each of the public long stay units including their status on meeting Health Information and Quality Authority standards.

In making decisions on health spending for 2013, I will be examining a range of options very carefully, and will have available to me a range of expertise, both within and outside my own Department.  I will take full account of the situation as it emerges during 2012.  My main concern is patient care, and all of the decisions taken by the Government in relation to health spending will be strongly informed by this key consideration.  I believe that we can and must deliver a quality service to patients within the resources available, and I will continue to pursue this objective in respect of 2013.

It set out 10 priority recommendations and many of these are already being taken forward. Areas of ongoing collaboration include — child protection, cancer research, health promotion, suicide prevention, radiotherapy services, paediatric congenital cardiac surgery and a range of initiatives under the Interreg IVA funding initiative.  The Study was published on the websites of the Irish Department of Health and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland in December 2011.At a departmental level co-operation between the two jurisdictions is active and ongoing.  "Transforming Your Care: a Review of Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland" also recommends co-operation on a number of key issues. My officials are liaising with their counterparts in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland on how to progress these issues.  I am committed to working together with my Northern colleagues on issues of common concern and benefit. This is of particular relevance in the current time when both jurisdictions are implementing change and pushing forward health reform.

The QNHS identifies people as disabled if they indicate that they have one or more of a list of long-standing illnesses or difficulties. On this basis the estimated number of disabled people aged 15 years or over in the State in the first quarter of 2012 was 409,400 of whom 70,900 or 17.3% were in employment. It is not possible to reliably split this employment between the public and private sectors using information from the QNHS.The National Disability Survey (NDS) in 2006 was specifically designed to collect more detailed information regarding the status of disabled persons. The definition applied in this survey was different to that used in the QNHS and, as such, estimates cannot be directly compared. There were an estimated 15,100 disabled adults in private households employed in the private sector in 2006 based on the definitions used for the NDS. This refers to adults whose disability limited or affected them before the age of 65.  Results from the Census of Population for 2011 covering disability will be published on 28th June 2012. These results will be based on the same measurement of disability as applied in the QNHS.

Since coming into office we have made a number of improvements to the system for making such appointments, including:Departments, on their websites, inviting expressions of interest in vacancies on the boards under their aegis, with the invitations indicating the skills being sought; andthose proposed for appointment as Chairpersons being required to make themselves available to the relevant Oireachtas Committee to discuss the approach they propose to take to their role as Chairperson and their views about the future contribution of the body in question.I have noted the issues mentioned in the Institute of Directors' survey.  However, the new arrangements introduced by the Government have significantly improved transparency in the making appointments to State Boards compared with the making of appointments in previous years.As regards the appointment of qualified Irish diaspora, the only Boards under my Department's aegis are the National Economic and Social Development Office, National Economic and Social Council and the National Statistics Board.  The arrangements for making appointments to these are set down in the relevant legislation (the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 and the Statistics Act 1993).   Members of the Government are aware of the offer made by the diaspora and I am sure they will take this into consideration when making appointments to the State Boards under their Departments' aegis.

This policy highlights Ireland's commitment to upholding the application of international humanitarian law and to the internationally-recognised humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.In keeping with the Humanitarian Relief Policy, Ireland has responded in a timely and effective manner over the past three years to large scale emergencies in Haiti, Pakistan, the Horn of Africa and more recently the Sahel Region.  In addition, Ireland also pays particular attention to so-called protracted and "forgotten emergencies" — or those situations where the crisis continues but no longer commands the attention of the world's media.  Such countries include Sudan, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Zimbabwe and Yemen.Irish Aid's humanitarian funding is distributed through three groups of established partners: UN Agencies, the Red Cross Movement and NGOs (both Irish and other international NGOs).  Efforts are ongoing to strengthen all of these partnerships, in recognition of the vital contribution that each group makes to effective emergency response globally.   The balance of funding between these different categories of partners shifts depending on changing needs and priorities and an objective assessment of which agency is most competent to respond to a given crisis situation.  Criteria for decision making are context specific depending on the nature of the crisis and the response required.These funding arrangements are complemented by a more operational response capability through Ireland's Rapid Response Initiative.  This includes the pre-positioning and transportation of humanitarian supplies to disaster areas as appropriate and a register of highly-skilled individuals, for deployment at short notice to assist in an emergency relief effort.  The following table provides a breakdown of funding provided to Irish NGOs, other NGOs, the Rapid Response Initiative and multilateral agencies over the 2010 to 2012 period.2010 €2011 €2012 to date €% of total%UN/Multilateral Agencies29,813,19630,784,51311,132,20351.3Red Cross Movement10,125,00013,275,000100,00016.8Irish NGOs13,982,92713,073,9704,727,22022.8Other NGOs248,516400,0000.5Rapid Response Corps1,642,2111,830,367470,2622.8Stockpiles2,347,0783,250,0002,500,0005.8Total€58,158,928€62,613,850.00€18,929,685100While major progress has been made in improving the international response to crises, much attention is now focused on disaster prevention and preparedness as a complement to relief.  Ireland is in the forefront of these efforts.  It is estimated that every €7 spent on responding to natural disasters could be offset by €1 spent on preparedness and early warning.  Increasingly, Ireland's strategy is to ensure that all of our aid — both long term development funding as well as humanitarian assistance — is targeted towards the poorest and most vulnerable populations in order to strengthen their resilience and build their capacity to respond to the inevitable pressures which result from climatic and other shocks.Since the publication of the Humanitarian Relief Policy in 2009, a number of important innovations have been introduced to Irish Aid funding mechanisms in order to increase our investment in the prevention of disasters.  For example, Irish Aid has pre-positioned funding with a number of humanitarian NGOs such as Concern, Goal and Trócaire (through the Humanitarian Programme Plan and the Emergency Response Fund) which encourages our NGO partners to anticipate predictable emergencies in their areas of operation, and both invest in resilience support activities as well as gearing up for early response.  Through the Irish Aid Rapid Response Initiative, Ireland can immediately deploy highly-skilled personnel and emergency supplies to a disaster zone within hours of a crisis in order to prevent a major loss of life.  Through these mechanisms, Irish Aid is in a position to support partners to prevent a major loss of life in those first critically important days of a disaster situation.Irish Aid has also established a dedicated budget line called the Emergency Preparedness, Post-Emergency and Recovery Assistance (EPPR) Budget within the overall humanitarian budget (an average of €7 million per year).  This supports pilots and innovative work being undertaken by Irish Aid partners in reducing risk and building local capacity to respond to disasters.  We also continue to encourage our NGO partners to include investment in disaster risk reduction as part of their long term development work.Internationally the 2005 Hyogo Framework for Action, to which Ireland is a signatory, provides the global blueprint for disaster risk reduction.  In support of the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action, Ireland provides funding to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery to help developing countries reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards and adapt to climate change.  In addition, Ireland is an active member of the EU Disaster Risk Reduction steering group established at expert level to oversee the implementation of the EU strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction.Finally, and most importantly, through our ongoing long term development programmes, Ireland systematically invests in the prevention of disasters and strengthening the resilience of poor people and communities to manage risks and mitigate disasters.  Social Protection and the provision of cash transfers are increasingly used as a development tool to enhance the capacity of poor people to cope with poverty, and equip them to better manage risks and shocks.  These types of interventions are a core element of Irish Aid development programmes particularly in countries such as Malawi, Vietnam, Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Ethiopia.  These programmes, I believe, place Irish Aid at the leading edge in relation to working towards reducing and mitigating the effects of disasters.

It is recognised internationally for its effectiveness, and for its concentration on some of the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.Cooperation with development Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) represents a very important element of the Government's aid programme, administered by Irish Aid.  The programme channels a higher proportion of overall assistance through the non-governmental sector than most other international donors, reflecting the strong support of the Irish people for the work of NGOs and missionaries.  Funding for NGOs is provided through a range of funding schemes covering long term development, emergency and recovery assistance and development education.Nineteen NGOs were recently approved for four-year programme grants for their long term development work.  For 2012, this represents a cumulative budget of €65 million.  This NGO funding is strongly focused on the achievement of development results through high quality programmes that make a real and sustainable impact on the reduction of poverty and hunger.  In order to achieve quality programmes, Irish Aid allows each NGO to spend up to 6% of the grant on strengthening organisational capacity, monitoring the success of interventions and documenting good practice.In general, NGOs use this capacity development support to strengthen their governance, management, quality and technical oversight capacity as well as improving their financial management and systems for tracking results.  Irish Aid monitors progress in the strengthening of internal organisational capacity closely during the programme cycle through regular field monitoring visits to programme partners, annual narrative and financial reporting against agreed objectives and budgets, end of programme evaluations and ongoing reviews of compliance.The Government is firmly committed to targeting our aid on the fight against extreme poverty and hunger among the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Our NGO partners will continue to play a crucial role as we work to achieve the maximum benefit from Ireland's development co-operation programme and its contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

The willingness of the Government to invite Pope Benedict to Ireland has been made very clear by our Ambassador to the Holy See in the course of his meetings with Vatican officials.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	416	My visit to West Africa between the 1st and the 8th   of June 2012 provided me with an invaluable opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the considerable challenges facing Sierra Leone and Liberia and to see first-hand the contribution being made by Ireland through Irish Aid to both countries.  The visit also included a short stop-over in Accra Ghana to view the UN Humanitarian Depot, and dispatch an essential life-saving shipment of Irish Aid stocks and supplies for refugees affected by the ongoing crisis in the Sahel.Both Sierra Leone and Liberia have worked to consolidate peace since their inter-connected civil wars ended a little over a decade ago.  The conflicts in both countries led to immense destruction and loss of life, and left a challenging legacy for the fledgling democratic institutions which are being now being developed there.  In Sierra Leone, the war, which was funded and fuelled in no small part by Charles Taylor, the former Liberian President (who is currently indicted for war crimes), resulted in the death of over 50,000 people.  In Liberia, the civil war which ended in 2003 claimed over 250,000 lives and displaced over 1 million people as well as devastating the country's social, political and physical infrastructure.  It is praiseworthy however that despite this painful past, both countries have enjoyed a sustained period of peace and security for the past decade and Ireland has played its part in assisting this peaceful transition.  During my trip, I met with a large number of Sierra Leoneans and Liberians who expressed hope and optimism for the future.  People are moving forward and do not want to return to conflict.Sierra Leone and Liberia remain however among the poorest countries in the world, ranked 180 and 182 respectively of 187 countries on the 2011 UN Human Development Index.  The average Liberian has a life expectancy of 57 years, has less than four years of schooling and lives on less than $1.25 a day.  Five out of every 100 Liberian women will die from giving birth.  While the malnutrition situation has improved significantly since 2006, chronic malnutrition remains among the highest in the world at almost 42%.  Life expectancy in Sierra Leone is 48 years, and 53% of the population of 6 million live below the absolute poverty line with maternal and under-five child mortality rates among the highest in the world.  Ireland's development engagement in both countries seeks to specifically target these difficult development challenges.Ireland's programme in Sierra Leone is primarily focused on addressing the issues of nutrition and food security.  I saw the benefits of this support first hand when I visited an Agricultural Business Centre while in the northern town of Makeni where I met with successful smallholder farmers who can now add value to their crops and successfully sell at market.  During my visit to St. Joseph's School for the Hearing Impaired also in Makeni, I had the opportunity to see a school-feeding programme supported by Ireland, which ensures that school-age children are provided with at least one nutritious meal per day.  In Makeni, I also visited a Caritas supported programme which provides counselling and vocational training to former child soldiers.  While there, I announced funding of €50,000 to Caritas, for its critical work in supporting those affected by conflict to build new lives and livelihoods.In Liberia, a key focus of Irish effort is on strengthening the country's health systems and basic primary health care services.  Irish and other development partner support has enabled a 24% expansion in the network of public health facilities and a doubling of the number of facilities providing the Basic Package of Health Services free of charge to all citizens.  I visited an urban health facility in Monrovia, where I was able to see how Ireland's support has helped to significantly increase access to basic health and to strengthen health systems for the poorest and most vulnerable communities.  While there, I announced further funding of €4 million euro to the Health Sector which will build on the important results achieved to date.Ireland also provides support to the Liberia National Police.  In Monrovia, I paid a visit to the National Police Training Academy in Monrovia to see how Ireland's support has contributed to the police force's capacity to maintain peace and provide security for the citizens of Liberia.  I also met with the Deputy Commissioner of an Garda Síochána who was in Liberia at the time leading a review of Ireland's support to the Liberia National Police.I took part in a number of high level political meetings during his visit, including with President Ernest Koroma of Sierra Leone and Vice President Joseph Boakai of Liberia (as well as several key Government Ministers).  These discussions provided an opportunity to learn more about the challenges and progress being made by both countries in fostering economic growth and development, improving social service delivery and consolidating the democratic process.  I took the opportunity to inform the Ministers from both countries about Ireland's strategy for deeper engagement with Africa, launched in 2011.  I explained that this approach aims to place a greater emphasis on private sector investment and trade as an engine for sustainable development and I invited my West African counterparts to engage with us more fully on this agenda.Ireland's support to Sierra Leone and Liberia demonstrates our commitment to working in fragile environments and supporting the recovery efforts and successful transition of countries emerging from conflict.  Given the vulnerability of these fragile environments, my visit to West Africa has re-affirmed my view that it is imperative that Ireland provides supports to governments of countries in transition to enable them to assume responsibility for the arduous journey towards long term peace and development.  I am furthermore convinced that Ireland can do more to assist Sierra Leone and Liberia not only in terms of aid, but also in terms of fostering trade and investment by Irish businesses.

In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis.  There are also 94 Honorary Consuls located in 54 locations around the world which assist primarily with consular functions on behalf of my Department.Our Missions abroad are actively involved in representing and advancing Government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic and cultural promotion; providing frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and managing programmes, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.  Our Embassy network works very closely with the State Agencies which have a remit for the promotion of Irish trade, tourism and inward investment — Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and IDA Ireland — and other relevant Departments in assisting Irish producers to find and access new markets.The scale and presence of the Irish diplomatic network is a matter that is kept under ongoing review in the light of changing circumstances and needs.  Given the current budgetary situation, and recognising the role that our diplomatic network is playing in Ireland's economic recovery, any further adjustments to our diplomatic network will continue to be strategically focused.  While any reduction in the number of Embassies in Dublin is to be regretted, it is a matter for each State to make decisions on where it deploys its diplomatic network. Likewise, for Ireland, we will continue to make our own decisions on where we have a Mission on the basis of an assessment of what best serves the interests of the State and our people.

The salaries of diplomats and other staff temporarily posted abroad are subject to Irish income tax and other statutory deductions in the same way as any Irish based civil servant.  I have no information to suggest that the relationship between the pay scales of Irish diplomats and their EU and OSCE counterparts is any different than that of any other area of the Irish public service.

Of these, 25,000 are applications received through the Passport Express service which attracts a ten day guaranteed turnaround.  The other 10,000 are a mixture of urgent counter applications, postal applications, applications from Northern Ireland and applications from our missions around the world.  I am pleased to confirm that all correctly completed applications submitted through the Passport Express service, used by the vast majority of passport applicants within the State, are being processed within the ten day guarantee.   Emergency passports are issued only in circumstances where the Passport Service is satisfied, on the basis of the application and supporting evidence, that:the proposed journey is related to the death or serious injury or illness abroad of a close relative or a medical emergency relating to the applicant him/herself; andthe presence of the applicant at the foreign location in connection with such an unexpected event is necessary or highly desirable; andthe need to travel has arisen at short notice.The Passport Service advises that citizens check the validity of their passports and submit for renewal through the Passport Express service where a guaranteed ten day turnaround will be provided.

In its most recent resolution, adopted on 14 June 2012, the committee expressed its regret that, despite widespread international support for negotiation between the two governments, implementation of General Assembly resolutions on the question had not yet started.  The governments were requested to consolidate the current process of dialogue and cooperation through resumed negotiations to find a peaceful solution to the dispute relating to the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), in line with resolutions 2065 (XX) and 3160 (XXVIII), among others.   I would encourage both countries to resume their negotiations in the interest of pursuing a peaceful resolution of their differences on this matter.

The supply of electricity is liable to VAT at the 13.5% reduced rate, as specified in paragraph 17 of Schedule 3 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  It is possible for Ireland to apply the 13.5% reduced rate to electricity under Title VIII of the EU VAT Directive.   The supply of telecommunication services, however, is liable to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.  The VAT Directive provides that the standard VAT rate must be applied to these services and as such it is not possible for Ireland to apply the 13.5% reduced rate to them.

However, I have been informed by the Central Bank that while the company concerned was not authorised or licensed by the  Bank, and therefore its clients  were not eligible to a compensation scheme/deposit protection scheme, the Central Bank has worked with the National Consumer Agency, regulatory and industry bodies to provide assistance to customers affected.The Central Bank advises that it has undertaken a review of firms in the State who appeared to offer consumers debt advice and/or debt management type services. As a result of the review, some firms are engaging with the Central Bank and putting in place client safeguards while they seek authorisation and a number of other firms have opted to wind down their business. The Central Bank has also informed me that, while it cannot comment on an individual case, it can confirm that it continues to engage with a number of such firms and, in some instances, further action may arise from these investigations.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	427	There are a number of reasons why, under existing policies, early withdrawals of pension savings are not permitted, the principal one being that pension schemes and plans (and the associated tax reliefs) are designed as long term savings vehicles based on the principle that the savings will be "locked away" until retirement. Otherwise, there would be little reason to treat pension savings more favourably from a tax point of view than other general savings.   A number of proposals have been made that individuals should be allowed access to their pension savings prior to retirement. Various rationales have been advanced to justify these proposals including that such access would allow those individuals to pay down mortgage and other debt and would otherwise provide a boost to economic activity.This is not a simple matter. During 2011, at the request of the Government's Economic Management Council (EMC), an Ad-hoc group was established under the chairmanship of the Department of Social Protection to consider the idea of allowing people to access their pension savings before pension age in order to assist them in paying down debt. The ad-hoc group presented a detailed report to the EMC in September 2011.   The conclusions of the Ad-hoc Group report were that:There is no evidence that, in general, the group likely to be most affected by mortgage debt (or other debt) has access to sufficient pension savings to make a difference to their situation.The legislative and administrative implications for such a scheme would be extremely complex and would appear excessive given the overall impact.Longer term difficulties whereby people are not making adequate provision for their retirement would be exacerbated, with potential for increased demands on the State.Individuals cashing in their pension savings now would get poor value in current circumstances which they would struggle to replace in the future.The "Keane Group" on mortgage arrears did not dispute these findings and early access to pension savings did not feature among the recommendations of that Group.  A more general scheme of early access to pension savings would present significant problems in terms of the proper targeting of the use of accessed funds and controls over potential abuse.The tax treatment of pension savings for which I have responsibility is only one aspect of the broad policy of encouraging people to provide for an adequate income in retirement beyond the basic State pension. This policy area is the responsibility of my colleague, Ms Joan Burton TD, Minister for Social Protection, who I know is also aware of the proposals being made for early access to pension savings. The OECD is currently carrying out an independent review of long term pension policy in Ireland on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection. I have been advised, in response to a request from me in this matter, that the terms of reference of the independent review are such as to facilitate consideration of the issue of early access to pension savings and I would expect that the OECD review would deal with this issue.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 to 194, inclusive, together.The Deputy will recall that when the matter of the €3.6 bn statistical error was discussed in the Dáil on 2nd November of last year, I indicated that an external review of systems in the Department of Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Central Statistics Office would be undertaken.  It was envisaged that this external review would be separate, but related, to a review of the issue to be conducted internally by the Department of Finance.  Given the urgency of this investigation, combined with the specialised nature of the matters to be covered by the review, the Department did not publicly advertise by tender.  Instead, as provided under the 2004National Procurement Guidelines — Competitive Process, the direct invitation to tender   approach was used where an invitation is made directly to suppliers deemed appropriately qualified for a particular project.As provided under this approach, contact was made with a number of individuals who were deemed to have the necessary expertise to conduct the work covered by the Terms of Reference on an urgent basis.  It was not possible to secure quotations from these individuals apart from the person contacted in Deloitte who indicated that their preference would be to undertake the work on foot of a contract with the firm.  Deloitte submitted an initial estimate for the work at a fee of €135,050 (excluding expenses and VAT) which was subsequently reduced through negotiations to €50,000, excluding expenses and VAT, provided that expenses cannot exceed 10% (€5,000) of the cost quoted for the work which constituted a fixed price paid on completion.Deloitte undertook the work in accordance with Terms of Reference which are set out below.  I understand that separate oral instructions were not given to Deloitte when they were awarded the contract.  I am informed that because the engagement with Deloitte was not a ‘time and rates' contract, but rather a fixed fee arrangement irrespective of how long the work took to complete, the question of an hourly rate does not arise.The final cost of the work undertaken by Deloitte comes to €61,552.77 which consists of the agreed fixed fee of €50,000 plus miscellaneous expenses of €42.90 giving a total net fee of €50,042.90 which comes to €61,552.77 with the addition of 23% VAT of €11,509.87.   The invoice for this work is currently in the process of being paid by my Department.Terms of Reference for External Reviewreview the respective roles of the Department of Finance, the CSO and the NTMA in the compilation of the General Government Debt figures;review the inter-action between all three organisations, including communications;drawing on the findings of the Internal Review, this process should summarise the reasons for the error with regard to processes, systems, staffing, and control issues; (Individual personal performance is excluded from scope), andmaking recommendations, if any, to (for example):improve the inter-action between the three organisations, including the development of a communications protocol for all three organisations;clarify and, if appropriate, reallocate the responsibilities for the compilation and reporting of the General Government Debt;restructure the systems and work flows/responsibilities within the relevant areas of each of the three organisations;identify system wide issues in this regard for more general applicability; andrecommend appropriate checks and balances to enable mistakes to be  picked up in the system.

The BES was replaced by the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII), which came into effect on 25 November 2011.The EII is available in respect of investments in most small and medium-sized trading companies. Certain exclusions do apply, however, and a trade of dealing in, or developing, land is specifically excluded from the qualifying trades for EII. This exclusion applies irrespective of whether an employment grant has been approved in respect of the project.  However, a company that carries on a trade which is not an excluded trade may use funds raised under EII to construct a building or structure to be used for the purposes of that non-excluded trade. For example, a company carrying on a manufacturing trade may use funds raised under EII for the construction of a new factory to be used by it for that trade.

Employment data are presented in net terms and information on gross flows into and out of employment is not available, making it difficult to assess the number of jobs created by any policy initiative.So leaving aside the fact that quantifying the impact is difficult, I am confident that the measures introduced by the Government in May, such as reducing the rate of VAT in the high value added tourism sector, are playing an important role in both creating and sustaining employment.  My Department has been monitoring retail prices in affected sectors to evaluate the effectiveness of the reduced VAT rates.  Its analysis which is based on data provided by the CSO has demonstrated high levels of pass-through of the VAT reductions to consumer prices.Finally, I want to reiterate that addressing the difficulties in the labour market remains the Governments biggest challenge and, accordingly, Government is giving its highest priority to job protection and job creation.

The annual percentage rate (APR) allowable under each moneylending licence is also available on the website.  While there is no maximum rate of interest set out in legislation, under section 93(10)(g) of the Consumer Credit Act, the Central Bank may refuse to grant a moneylender’s licence if, in the opinion of the Bank, the cost of the credit sought by the moneylender is excessive or any of the terms or conditions attaching to it are unfair.The Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders, published in 2009, affords certain protections to client of moneylenders. Under the Code, a moneylender must, prior to entering into an agreement with a client:disclose all the fees, costs and interest charged in a clear manner andindicate prominently the high-cost nature of the loan on all loan documentation where the APR is 23% or higher. This disclosure must take the following form: "Warning: This is a high-cost loan.”

The origin of all goods imported into the EU must be declared to customs at the point of entry to the European Union. Where preference is being claimed under the terms of an international accord, such as the EU-Israel Association Agreement, this must be declared and appropriate documentary proofs of origin must be made available to customs.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that across the EU, customs authorities regularly examine this documentation either at import or as part of their post-clearance risk based audit programmes.  Where doubt arises, the origin of the goods is verified through contact with the customs authorities in the country of origin.  The procedures followed by Revenue's Customs Service are similar to those operated throughout the entire EU.  To date, these checks have not identified any instance where preferential treatment was being claimed inappropriately.

This is typically achieved through agreeing a course of action with the debtor referred to as a consensual arrangement.  Prior to reaching a consensual arrangement with debtors cases are managed based on their individual circumstances with a view to achieving a maximum return to the taxpayer which may include providing the debtor with temporary support so as to give NAMA an opportunity to assess the scope for reaching long-term agreements with them.  Very often that involves meeting their short-term liabilities so that they can remain in business.In reaching a consensual arrangement with a debtor  all creditor claims, both secured and unsecured are assessed on a case by case basis. Once the overall consensual arrangement has been agreed with the debtor the day to day implementation of that arrangement is managed directly by the debtor including the daily interaction with unsecured creditors.  In cases where the process does not lead to a consensual arrangement with a debtor, enforcement is initiated. In those circumstances, an insolvency practitioner appointed by NAMA is required only to realise the value of NAMA's fixed or floating charges over assets. Understandably, he is not under any obligation to unsecured creditors. In an insolvency situation the ultimate outcome for all creditors will depend on the nature and ranking of their charges.

The first stage of the competition process invited expressions of interest outlining the concepts/approach by the applicants of the nature, medium and format through which the memorial is to be delivered. Thirty two expressions of interest were examined by the jury for the competition, from which six competitors were shortlisted to proceed to Stage 2 of the competition.  Those shortlisted were required to submit their detailed and specific proposals for each stage of the design, planning and realisation of the memorial with detailed costings and mechanisms for realisation.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	446	Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. My Department has published the staffing arrangements at post primary level for the coming school year, 2012/13. The relevant Post Primary circular is 0009/2012 which is available on my Department's website. At post primary level schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level schools in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.  The teacher allocation process at post-primary level is largely completed at this stage and all schools would have been notified accordingly.  The final staffing position for all schools at post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeal Board will have been considered.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 214 together.I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which was established as a result of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004, is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for co-ordinating special needs education provision at local level and arranging for the delivery of special educational services.  It is the role of SENOs to process applications from schools for special educational needs supports, within my Department's criteria, and to determine the quantum of educational resources to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs.The NCSE has advised that all SENOs hold a minimum qualification of a third level primary degree.  Appropriately qualified professionals from a variety of agencies, including my Department's National Educational Psychological Service and private practice, provide reports and recommendations on children with special educational needs to SENOs who take into account the needs set out in such reports, along with other relevant factors such as the resources available to the school, to identify supports which may be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs.  SNAs, once allocated to schools, are a school-based resource. The allocation of SNAs, while allocated on the basis of an assessed need of an individual child, are allocated to the school and should be deployed with discretion by the school in a manner which bests meets the support and care requirements of the children.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I wish to inform the Deputy that the correspondence to which he refers has been considered.  It is important to note that the school referred to by the Deputy did not have DEIS status as it was not selected for inclusion in DEIS following from the identification process in 2005.  Second-level schools were selected for DEIS by reference to centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. The identification process was in line with international best practice and had regard to, and employed, the existing and most appropriate data sources available.An appeal by this school to the independent review body in 2006 confirmed that the level of disadvantage did not warrant the school's inclusion in the DEIS programme.  It should also be noted that none of the existing schools in the country, which were unsuccessful in the initial identification and subsequent review processes, were ever admitted to the DEIS programme.  A key priority for my Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. That challenge is significant given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure. This also limits the capacity for any additionality in the DEIS programme including the selection of further schools.As announced in the 2012 Budget, five scholarship schemes for higher education, namely the Easter Week 1916 Commemoration Scholarship Scheme, An Scéim Scoláireachtaí Triú Leibhéal do Scoláirí ón nGaeltacht, An Scéim Scoláireachtaí Gaeilge Triú Leibhéal (Neamh Theoranta), An Scéim Scolaireachtaí Triú Leibhéal (Trí Ghaeilge: Teoranta) and the Donogh O'Malley Scholarship Scheme, will be replaced with a new single scheme of bursaries based both on merit and on financial need.  These earlier scholarships, with one exception, were awarded without the application of any socio-economic criteria.  The new bursaries, on the other hand, are designed specifically to target students attending DEIS schools in disadvantaged areas and also indicating a level of personal or family disadvantage by virtue of having qualified for a medical card. The bursary will be an extra support and incentive to recognise high achievement for students who are from disadvantaged families and attending DEIS schools.This change has been made in order to make the best use of the limited funds we have available for bursaries so as to focus on the best performing students in the cohort of those who are most in need of financial help.  It is envisaged that some 60 students will receive a bursary this September. This number will rise over each of the next three years, with over 350 students a year benefiting by 2015.  These changes will not impact on those who already hold scholarships under the existing schemes.The principal financial support made available by my Department to facilitate access to third level education continues to be the means-tested student grant. Other financial measures to support broader access and participation include the provision of the special rate of maintenance grant for students from welfare-dependent families and the availability of the Student Assistance Fund at college level to assist students in particular financial difficulties. From the 2012/13 year onwards, grants will be centrally administered by a single grant awarding authority Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI — a division of the City of Dublin VEC) which will administer the Student Grant Scheme on behalf of my Department.  A new online-only grant applications system has been introduced for the academic year 2012/13.

The Stage 2(b) submission (Detailed Design) was approved by my Department's Planning and Building Unit on 10th January 2012.  Due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements it has not been possible to advance all school building projects concurrently.Schools which have not been included in five year construction programme, but which were announced for initial inclusion in the building programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in future years.  The project referred to by the Deputy was not included in the five year construction programme announced in March. As such the project cannot be progressed to tender and construction at this time.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	450	Department Circular 11/95 states that a full school day at primary level comprises a period of not less than five hours and forty minutes.  Circular 11/95 and the Rules for National Schools also provide that pupils in infant classes may have a school day that is one hour shorter than the length of the normal school day, (i.e. 5 hours and forty minutes). It is a matter for the Board of Management of a particular school to decide whether this concession should be applied in the case of its school. If pupils in infant classes are being given a shorter day, their parents should be notified accordingly and invited to collect them at time of dismissal.It is acknowledged that particular circumstances may arise whereby the implementation of the shorter day for pupils in infant classes may cause issues for some parents. Where this arises, my Department would encourage school authorities to engage with parents locally with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable resolution.  As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENO) for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available onwww.ncse.ie.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.Firstly I wish to clarify the distinction between the role of the SNA and that of the teacher. SNAs and teachers have separate yet complementary roles. The class teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in his/her class, including any pupil with a special educational need. In this task, the teacher may be supported by a learning support teacher and/or resource teacher. SNAs are allocated to schools to enable them to support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs.  All schools had been advised to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012 and schools will be notified shortly by their local SENO of their SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available onwww.ncse.ie.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	455	A redundancy application in respect of the person referred to by the Deputy was received by my Department on 9th November 2011.  The application will be reached for processing within the next fortnight.  The person will then be advised of the position regarding the redundancy payment by an official of my Department.  When a redundancy application is being processed the applicant's payroll file is also checked.  This is to verify that the person did not have any underpayment or overpayment of salary during the course of their service as an SNA.To comply with audit requirements all payments must be verified by a second official before issue. The Department's payrolls, due to their size, close for processing ten days in advance of the date of issue of the payment.  Accordingly, there is a time lag between the initial processing of the application and the date the person receives the payment.Every effort is being made, within the resources available, to ensure that Special Needs Assistants that have been made redundant have their claims processed as quickly as possible. Extra resources are assigned to the Redundancy Unit as and when they are available.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in the context of the employment control framework, it is only possible to reassign limited additional staffing resources from within the existing staff cohort of the Department to deal with redundancy payments whilst at the same time ensuring that other priority functions such as the payment of salaries to teachers and Special Needs Assistants on a fortnightly basis are performed.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	456	In 1995 the class A rate of PRSI was extended to many categories of public service employment to which modified rate (class D in the case of teachers) PRSI had previously applied.  All teachers appointed for the first time after the 6th April 1995 pay class A rate PRSI. Teachers appointed prior to the 6th April 1995 who after that date resigned or retired from their teaching posts and who subsequently obtained new appointments also pay class A rate PRSI.  Teachers appointed prior to the 6th April 1995 who took a period of approved leave of absence such as a career break since that date continue to pay Class D rate of PRSI on resumption of duty.Eligible Part Time (EPT) teachers appointed prior to 1995, paid class A rate PRSI as their service was not pensionable and they continued to pay class A rate PRSI after 1995 until the 31st August 1996.  On the 1st September, 1996, pensionability for EPTs was introduced. This was done retrospectively, from 1998 following   acceptance of the PCW (Programme for Competitiveness and Work).  Substitute service was non pensionable and such teachers paid class A rate PRSI. Ongoing pensionability was only introduced from 2001.  This service, by its nature, is interrupted service. Teachers employed as substitutes continue to pay class A rate PRSI.Temporary Whole Time Teachers in service prior to 1996 paid class A rate PRSI contributions where they were not  members of the pension scheme. Where they subsequently joined the pension scheme and had remained in continuous service from a date prior to the 6th April 1995 their PRSI Class was changed to Class D.The Deputy will appreciate that the determination of the PRSI class of a teacher since 1995 has been a complex matter.  Due to the complexities of the employment capacities and the admission of certain part-time teachers to the pension scheme, a small number of teachers were incorrectly classified.  When a case is identified, which tends to be at the time of retirement the error is then rectified. Where a teacher has been classified as Class A PRSI instead of Class D, it results in an overpayment of PRSI contributions and an underpayment of Pension contributions.  Since becoming aware of this difficulty, my Department has been working with the Department of Social Protection to resolve these cases.  A protocol is being agreed to ensure that teachers are not disadvantaged.

The school authority has indicated that the existing school site is restricted and cannot accommodate this development. I understand that the school purchased a green field site a number of years ago for school development purposes. It is open to the school authority to consider constructing this development on the green field site. The school authority should advise my Department of its intentions relating to the Department's offer.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.Any bullying issues concerning an employee of a school are a matter for the Board of Management of the school concerned and as Minister I have no role in relation to such matters. I can confirm that the Board of Management of the school to which the Deputy refers in June 2011 suspended the principal of the school having considered a report of an investigation into alleged bullying. The Board informed the Department that the suspension with pay was pending a disciplinary hearing under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998. The Board requested the Department as payroll agent for the Board to continue the payment of salary until the necessary investigations were carried out and the matter was brought to a conclusion.The person who was suspended claimed his suspension was disproportionate and unlawful and secured leave from the High Court to take Judicial Review proceedings.  A stay was placed on a meeting that the Board had arranged for 20 September 2011 under the disciplinary procedure.  Earlier this year and prior to the hearing of the Judicial Review case, discussions took place between the legal representatives of the school and the person concerned. In the context of these discussions the litigation, by agreement of the parties, did not proceed, the person concerned wrote to the Board vacating his position with effect from 31 August 2012 and the disciplinary proceedings that had been initated by the Board of that school have been terminated.In the context of these discussions the Department arranged for the person concerned to be assigned as a teacher to the Co. Kildare VEC scheme where he has been assigned to carry out principal duties for the remainder of the current school year and for the 2012/13 school year arising from a vacancy in a principal post.  In light of his assignment to the VEC his position with the school in County Laois was vacated with effect from 1 June 2012 when he transferred to the VEC payroll. In relation to the vacancy concerned the Department had separetely indicated to the VEC that the filling of the vacancy through permanent recruitment should not apply pending the completion of an analysis of how the future education needs of the area would be planned for and met.   My Department is satisfied that the assignment of the person concerned, which did not require an interview process, ensured an efficient deployment of resources by Kildare VEC.

This application was refused as the scope of works for which funding was sought was outside the terms of the scheme. This decision has been the subject of two appeals and the school authority have been informed that the project remained outside the scope of the scheme.

The awarding authorities were best positioned to interpret the application of the distance criterion in the context of local circumstances.The Student Grant Scheme and the Student Support Regulations for the 2012/13 academic year were published by my Department last week to coincide with the introduction of the single grant awarding authority, Student Universal Support Ireland or SUSI, and the new central online application system going live. Article 27(3)(a) of the 2012 Scheme provides that the distance criterion will be measured in line with agreed guidelines.  My Department is liaising with SUSI in regard to these guidelines.

I understand that a decision was made not to continue to operate this course for the forthcoming academic year.  The person referred to by the Deputy was employed by the VEC on a non-casual part-time teacher basis for the 2011/2012 academic year to deliver this course.  All such teacher posts automatically end at the end of the academic year.

These changes will be applied equitably on a national basis.  Bus Éireann will be communicating directly with families who already avail of school transport services and with families who have applied for the first time. Existing eligible children will retain their school transport eligibility for the duration of their post primary education cycle provided there are no changes to their current circumstances.  The new eligibility criteria will only apply to those pupils who are newly entering a post primary school in the 2012/13 school year.  I have already set out the rationale underpinning the policy position for the Deputy and other local representatives and cannot make any exceptions to the policy; it is not feasible for me to meet with individual groups of parents to discuss these changes.

There is no contractual relationship between my Department and the main contractor, sub-contractor or suppliers involved in this project. However, I can confirm that all monies due to be paid to the VEC in respect of this particular project have been paid.  A school building project is a complex arrangement of contractual relationships between the client, the main contractor, specialist sub-contractors, domestic sub-contractors, suppliers of materials, suppliers of plant etc.  In general all sub-contractors employed on school building projects are employed directly by the Main Contractor or indirectly by the Main Contractor through other sub-contractors. It is a matter for all sub-contractors to agree terms and conditions and a schedule of payments with the Main Contractor as their direct employer.

Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils.  A supervision grant is provided by my Department to 1-teacher schools to assist them supervise pupils during the morning and lunch-time breaks in the school day.  My Department has recently published updated "Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools". These procedures are based on the recently published "Children First — National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011" and apply to all primary and post-primary schools, irrespective of size.The new procedures incorporate significant improvements to the previous school guidelines and are intended to better ensure consistent and uniform implementation of Children First across all schools. The improvements include a new template child protection policy, a requirement that all primary schools fully implement the Stay Safe programme and also put in place improved oversight arrangements at Board of Management level.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule for the 2012-2013 school year is available on my Department's website.  The staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. As part of the new staffing arrangements my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small primary schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure. Such schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal to the Staffing Appeals Board. All appeals submitted to the Primary Staffing Appeal Board were considered in accordance with the published appeals criteria that is set out in my Department's Staffing Circular 0007/2012. This was done at its meeting on 18th and 19th April. The appeal by the school was unsuccessful on the basis that the school did not meet the published appeal criteria. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

There are four band ratings, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest. Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or new sports hall.  An explanation of the band rating system is available on my Department's website onwww.education.ie.  A copy is set out below for the Deputy’s ease of reference.
Amended Criteria for Prioritising Large Scale Projects (Primary and Post Primary)
BackgroundThe 2004 School Building Programme indicated that a review of the criteria for prioritising large-scale projects would be undertaken in consultation with the Education Partners early in 2004. The review was necessary to ensure that the criteria have the optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of primary and post primary schools.The amended criteria will be applied to all projects that are not proceeding to tender and site as part of the 2004 School Building Programme. These projects will be detailed in the Multi Annual Programme currently being prepared.Band 1Band 1 subdivides into four sub divisions or sub sets 1.1; 1.2; 1.3 and 1.4.Criteria applicable to a Band 1.1 projectServing a rapidly developing area whereeither there is no existing school or where existing provision is unable to meet the demand for places.Definition of a rapidly developing area:A rapidly developing area is located in a large urban centre or within commuting distance of a large urban centre.The area has experienced major and significant demographic change in the past ten years.All available information indicates that the process of sustained development is set to continue with a corresponding major and significant impact on the demographics of the area.There is clear evidence of substantial pressure for pupil places in all schools serving the area.No school in the area is operating below capacity.No school is accommodating a sizeable or significant number of pupils from outside of its catchment area.Criteria applicable to a Band 1.2 projectThe provision of specialist accommodation urgently required for children with special needs such as autism, speech and language impairment, severe and profound intellectual impairment, etc.Criteria applicable to a Band 1.3 projectAddressing the needs of schools that are structurally unsound.Criteria applicable to a Band 1.4 projectProviding accommodation post rationalisation.Band 2Band 2 subdivides into six sub divisions or subsets 2.1; 2.2; 2.3; 2.4; 2.5 and 2.6.Criteria applicable to a Band 2.1 projectA Band 2.1 project should reflect theentirety of the following criteria.There is a deficit of mainstream accommodation. The deficit constitutes a substantial and significant proportion of the school's overall accommodation needs.A technical evaluation of a school building indicates that an extensive refurbishment of existing accommodation is required. The refurbishment cannot be rectified by the application of an improved and / or comprehensive maintenance programme.The necessary remedial works cannot be addressed either through the Summer Works Scheme in any one year or incrementally over a number of years.There is clear evidence that the day-to-day functionality of the school is impaired or will become seriously impaired unless urgent remedial action is taken promptly.Determining a deficit of mainstream accommodationA deficit of mainstream accommodation shall be computed by firstly determining the overall accommodation needs of the school relative to its curricular options and/or its projected long-term enrolment. The quality, extent and adequacy of existing accommodation, including temporary accommodation (whether rented or otherwise) will then be assessed. Where existing accommodation is determined to be inappropriate to the school's long term needs, it will be reckoned for the purposes of determining the deficit of mainstream accommodation. Additionally, as a general guiding principle, reliance on temporary accommodation as a reasonable solution to a school's long-term accommodation needs is not a sustainable position.Definition of extensive refurbishmentAs a general principle, the definition suggested is not intended to be prescriptive, when it is necessary to address all or a majority of the following elements of a school an extensive refurbishment applies.Upgrade of the mechanical system.Upgrade of the electrical system.Extensive roof repairs.Improvements to the structures or fabric of a building, i.e. spalling concrete, etc.Window replacements.Interior door replacement including the installation of fire doors.Replacement of ceilings.Replacement of floor.Criteria applicable to a Band 2.2 projectThere is a deficit of mainstream accommodation.  The deficit constitutes a substantial and significant proportion of the school's overall accommodation needs. The condition of the existing accommodation is adequate.Criteria applicable to a Band 2.3 projectA technical evaluation of a school building indicates that an extensive refurbishment of existing accommodation is required. The refurbishment cannot be rectified by the application of an improved and / or comprehensive maintenance programme.The necessary remedial works cannot be addressed either through the Summer Works Scheme in any one year or incrementally over a number of years.There is clear evidence that the day-to-day functionality of the school is impaired or will become seriously impaired unless urgent remedial action is taken promptly.Criteria applicable to a Band 2.4 projectThere is a deficit of mainstream accommodation. The deficit does not represent a substantial or significant proportion of the school's overall accommodation needs.A technical evaluation of a school building indicates that a refurbishment is required the nature and extent of which is not as extensive or critical as applies in Band 2.1 or Band 2.3. The refurbishment cannot be rectified by the application of an improved and / or comprehensive maintenance programme.The necessary remedial works cannot be addressed either through the Summer Works Scheme in one year or incrementally over a number of years.Criteria applicable to a Band 2.5 projectThere is a deficit of mainstream accommodation. The deficit does not represent a substantial or significant proportion of the school's overall accommodation needs. The condition of the existing accommodation at the school is adequate.Criteria applicable to a Band 2.6 projectA technical evaluation of a school building indicates that a refurbishment is required the nature and extent of which is less extensive and less critical than applies in Band 2.3.The refurbishment cannot be rectified by the application of an improved and / or comprehensive maintenance programme.The necessary remedial works cannot be addressed either through the Summer Works Scheme in one year or incrementally over a number of years.Band 3Band 3 subdivides into five sub divisions or subsets 3.1; 3.2; 3.3; 3.4; and 3.5.Criteria applicable to a Band 3.1 projectWhile there is no deficit of mainstream accommodation at the school, there is a deficit of ancillary accommodation required to support delivery of special education, i.e. learning supports.Some improvements works are necessary but not urgent.The necessary improvement works cannot be addressed either through the Summer Works Scheme in one year or incrementally over a number of years and/or through the application of an improved or comprehensive maintenance programme.Key definitionAncillary accommodation is accommodation other than mainstream classrooms or specialist rooms in post primary schools required for the teaching of specialist subjects.Criteria applicable to a Band 3.2 projectWhile there is no deficit of mainstream accommodation at the school, there is a deficit of ancillary accommodation required to support delivery of special education i.e. learning supports.No improvements works are required.Criteria applicable to a Band 3.3 projectWhile there is no deficit of mainstream accommodation at the school, there is a deficit of ancillary accommodation other than ancillary accommodation required to support delivery of special education (learning supports).Some improvements works are necessary but not urgent.The necessary improvement works cannot be addressed either through the Summer Works Scheme in one year or incrementally over a number of years and/or through the application of an improved or comprehensive maintenance programme.Criteria applicable to a Band 3.4 projectWhile there is no deficit of mainstream accommodation at the school, there is a deficit of ancillary accommodation other than ancillary accommodation required to support delivery of special education (learning supports).No improvements works are necessary.Criteria applicable to a Band 3.5 projectThere is no deficit of accommodation at the school.Improvements works are necessary but not urgent. Day to day functionality is not impaired.The necessary improvements works cannot be addressed either through the Summer Works Scheme in one year or incrementally over a number of years and/or through the application of an improved or comprehensive maintenance programme.Band 4Band 4 projects are desirable but not urgent or essential.Selecting within BandsWhen it is necessary to select projects from within the same band, as a general principle projects will be selected on the basis of enrolment stability; projects that have been the longest period in the planning process and the most cost effective solution.BandSub CategoryDetails11.1New schools or extension in developing areas11.2Accommodation for special needs students11.3School that are structurally unsound11.4Rationalisation projects

Every person on the Register holds a recognised qualification in the relevant subject area.  The Teaching Council's criteria for registering teachers on the basis of post-primary subjects are as follows.Generally, an applicant must hold a suitable degree or equivalent award with recognised post-primary subject(s) taken as major component(s). The duration of such a degree programme must be at least three years of full-time study or equivalent, and the degree should be provided by a nationally-recognised university or similar third level college. Standard higher education arrangements for accreditation and recognition of such degree programmes apply.In relation to content relevant to post-primary subjects, while the criteria may vary slightly from subject to subject, broadly speaking applicants must provide officially certified evidence of:Study of the subject as a major subject in the degree extending over at least three years and of the order of 30% at a minimum of that period.Details of the degree course content to show that the knowledge and understanding required to teach the subject to the highest level in post-primary education has been acquired.Explicit details of standards achieved in degree studies in the subject with at least an overall Pass result in the examinations.Further details on the requirements are available onwww.teachingcouncil.ie.

The continuation of existing superannuation entitlements for staff transferring to the QQAAI from one of the dissolved bodies (the NQAI, HETAC, and FETAC) is specifically provided for in Section 22 (subsections 8, 9 and 10) of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.All schools had been advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012 and schools will be notified shortly by their local SENO of their resource teaching and SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and, in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available onwww.ncse.ie.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	478	A key requirement for all recognised schools in the Free Education Scheme is that the school does not operate a charge, in whatever form, that is in effect a mandatory fee and that is contrary to the principle of not charging fees which distinguishes schools in the Free Education Scheme from those recognised post-primary schools that have elected to charge fees.  Certain charges may, however, be legitimately requested from pupils such as:Payment for school books or photocopied material provided by the school where the charge is reasonable and simply reflects the true costs concerned;Charges for meals and refreshments provided pupils are not required to purchase same and can bring their own refreshments to school (e.g. lunchbox); orServices and activities provided by the school in excess of that included in the general school programme, provided the pupil can elect to avail of such services (e.g. supervised after-school study, school tours, or visits to theatres or sporting events).While the above is not exhaustive, the key requirement is that a school does not operate a charge, in whatever form, that is in effect a mandatory fee. Voluntary contributions may be sought from parents, provided it is made clear to parents that there is no compulsion to pay and that a child's place in the school or continued enrolment is not dependant on a willingness to make a contribution.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	479	The Deputy should note the following in relation to non-commercial state agencies under the aegis of my Department.  In March 2012 the Irish Research Council was established. This new Council is a merger of the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) and the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET). This has resulted in a saving of €100,000 in salary costs.Since September 2011, the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) is within the remit of Dublin West Education Centre alongside the Department's largest support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST).  In June 2011, the functions of the National Educational Welfare Board transferred to the newly established office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The Deputy will be aware that there are a number of major structural reform projects that are being progressed in the Education sector. These are:1) The establishment of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland which involves the merger of the National Qualifications Authority, FETAC and HETAC. These amalgamating bodies have already made major savings in preparation for amalgamation. The purpose of the agency is in making awards in further and higher education, administering the National Framework of Qualifications and quality assuring education and training providers. The amount expected to be saved by the merger is in the region of €1 million annually.2) The amalgamation of 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs) / establishment of 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs). The ETBs will take over the work of VECs and will have an expanded role in the delivery of further education and training across the country.  The new bodies will be better positioned to establish shared services and to provide support services to schools not just within the VEC sector but to primary schools and other second level schools in their areas. They can contribute significantly to driving in particular an agenda of encouraging aggregated procurement of supplies and services. Departmental estimates suggest that by 2016 following full implementation, savings of the order of €3.2million can be made annually.3) The establishment of SOLAS, the new agency to reform, co-ordinate and fund further education and training programmes including developing a seamless interaction with the National Employment and Entitlement Service (NEES) on activation measures.4) A single awarding authority for student grants. City of Dublin VEC will operate as the new single student grant awarding authority to replace the existing 66 grant awarding bodies. Implementation of the new arrangements is being phased in from 2012/13 academic year.5) It is also proposed to dissolve the Education Finance Board on the establishment of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund. The purpose of this agency is to pay education grants to former residents and their relatives from the €12.7m provided by the religious congregations pursuant to the 2002 Indemnity Agreement. The recently published Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill 2012 provides for the dissolution of the EFB and the transfer of its functions in relation to the remaining moneys available to the new Residential Institutions Statutory Fund.6) The consolidation of Higher Education provision under the Strategy for Higher Education to 2030.

In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet future demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The five year programme announced on 12 March last is focused on meeting those demographic needs.  In the context, therefore, of the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential school accommodation to meet this demographic demand, it is not possible to indicate at this point when building projects for the schools in question can be provided.

The well-tried methodology in place to deal with issues that arise in the course of the examination process is the development of the marking scheme by the Chief Examiner and his college of examiners in light of the circumstances of that year's examinations.  All observations received in relation to any subject are reviewed by the relevant Chief Examiner in the context of preparing the marking scheme for that subject.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule for the 2012-2013 school year, Circular 0007/2012 is available on my Department's website. The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal which was considered at the April meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. The appeal by this school was unsuccessful on the basis that the school did not meet the published appeal criteria. The Board of Management of the school has been notified accordingly.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

Bus Éireann which operates the school transport schemes, on behalf of my Department, is responsible for the negotiation and awarding of school transport contracts to private operators.  In this regard, Bus Éireann has advised that an extensive procurement exercise was conducted in summer 2011. This exercise invited applications from operators of large, medium, small buses and taxis who were interested in undertaking, on a contractual basis, the operation of school transport services throughout Ireland.Advertisements were placed on the etenders website, the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), and in the Local and National Newspapers. A similar exercise is underway for the 2012/13 school year.  It may interest the Deputy to note that some 85% of the vehicles used to provide services under the School Transport Scheme, equivalent to over 3,300 vehicles, are provided by private operators under contract to Bus Éireann.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	490	The recent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General confirms that over €8 million in unauthorised payments were made to senior university staff over the period June 2005 to February 2011. This is completely unacceptable behaviour and represents a failure in governance in our universities and is a serious breach of public pay policy. These unauthorised payments have been ceased in all cases.  While these overpayments happened on the previous Government's watch, we are determined to ensure they cannot happen again. It is my intention, as part of the National Strategy implementation process, to strengthen legislation and put more robust accountability processes in place for the sector.The HEA, acting in consultation with my Department and the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, is making arrangements with each university covering the use of an amount of their funding equivalent in each case to the amount of overpayments.  These arrangements will be directed towards improving student services and specific new innovations in front line services. It is an imperative that any action taken does not impact on students, especially at a time when resources are particularly limited.It is also important to note that my Department has sought and received unequivocal commitments from each university that in future it will adhere to the provisions of the Universities Act. In the context of annual reporting arrangements provided for in the Code of Governance of Irish Universities each University is required to submit a statement to the HEA affirming that Government policy on pay is being complied with.

#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	494	As part of the Jobs Initiative in 2011 the following details were announced by my Department at the time: 16,000 training and education places and €40 million in funding for building works for schools.The Department of Education and Skills was to provide 15,900 education and training places across a spectrum of programmes:6,000 places in the FÁS Specific Skills Training programme.5,900 places in the Higher Education Springboard programme.3,000 places in the Back to Education Initiative programme.1,000 places in Post Leaving Cert Courses.These additional places were funded through the redeployment of some financial resources within the Department and an additional €8.3 million from the Exchequer. The aim of this provision was to enable more unemployed people to up-skill and re-skill so they can effectively compete for jobs in the labour market.On the capital side, €40 million was made available through the Jobs Initiative to fund 374 primary and post primary school building projects. These funds allowed schools to carry out small and medium scale building works such as special needs access, toilet facilities, roof works and window replacements. The investment was expected to create 2,400 direct and 480 indirect much needed jobs in the construction sector. I have asked officials in my Department to look at the other issues raised in the question and I will revert to the Deputy as soon as possible.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I am aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for local enterprises. Current guidelines (Circular 10/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts. Circular 10/10 was developed in 2010 by a cabinet committee which was tasked with considering issues that face SMEs in the public procurement market. The cabinet committee recommendations that formed the basis for the circular were consistent with EU commissioned research, entitledEvaluation of SMEs’ Access to Public Procurement Markets in the EU   (2010).Circular 10/10 sets out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of €25,000 or more to be advertised on thewww.etenders.gov.ie website;less use of "restrictive" tendering procedures and greater use of "open" tendering;ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.The reason why the threshold for advertising onwww.etenders.ie   (the national public procurement web portal) was reduced from €50,000 to €25,000 was to make such contracts more accessible to SMEs. This initiative is consistent with national public procurement policy which is aimed at ensuring that all public sector purchasing is carried out in a manner that is transparent and secures optimal value for money for the taxpayer. The Deputy will appreciate that advertising such contracts facilitates SMEs in accessing public procurement opportunities whilst also ensuring that each public body secures work, goods and services that are value for money.Facilitating SMEs to access public procurement opportunities is an ongoing priority for Government. The National Procurement Service (NPS) recently established a Working Group on Small and Medium Enterprises to respond to public procurement issues arising for SMEs. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association. The Working Group will develop measures to highlight the scope that contracting authorities have under circular 10/10 to encourage SME participation in public procurement processes.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	496	The gross accrued liability for public service occupational pensions is estimated at €116bn as of December 2009. This estimate is set out in the Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General published in 2010. This figure was arrived at on the basis of a detailed actuarial valuation of public service pension schemes carried out by consultants employed by the C&AG in the light of the pension terms and conditions then prevailing.  Since 2008 the Finance Accounts, published annually by the Department of Finance, also show the gross accrued liability figure.  I would add that the term public sector is usually taken to comprise all those who are employed, both directly and indirectly, by a public body. The public service is, broadly speaking, the public sector less the commercial semi-state bodies.This accrued liability figure of €116bn is a single monetary amount representing the present value of all expected future superannuation payments to current staff and their spouses in respect of service to date, plus the full liability for all future payments to current pensioners (including preserved pensioners) and to their spouses. The large size of the figure is due to the fact that it represents a projection of aggregate pension payments that will be spread over 70 or more years into the future.The estimate of the accrued liability should not be confused with the actual cash funding that will be required in the future. This latter, measure of public service pension costs is the actual annual gross outgoing on public service pensions which comprises the Exchequer Pensions Bill and certain other public service pension outlays, principally local government pensions. In 2011 the Exchequer Pensions Bill was estimated to have been €2.8bn, or 2.2% of GNP.It is important to point out that a new Single Public Service Pension Scheme Bill, to apply to all public service staff, is currently before the Oireachtas, and it is intended that the new scheme will be implemented this year.  The new Scheme will provide for pension to be based on career average earnings, as opposed to the current system of pension based on final salary.  This and other features of the Scheme will eventually deliver a saving of a third in the Exchequer Public Service pension bill.  Once these new arrangements come into force consideration will be given to carrying out the large scale actuarial exercise that would be necessary to update the accrued liability figure.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	497	The Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011, outlines the Government's programme of public service reforms and improvements which are designed to deliver on the commitments made in the Programme for Government.  The radical streamlining of 48 state bodies, a key element of the Plan, includes the merger of the Commission on Public Service Appointments into the Office of the Ombudsman, which falls under the remit of my Department.  This merger is completed on an administrative basis and will be included in the new FOI Amendment Bill which the Government intends to introduce later this year.As the merger is completed on an administrative basis, the potential savings from the measure would have been taken into account in the overall consideration of the 2012 Revised Estimates for the CPSA and the Office of the Ombudsman and was reflected in their respective allocations.  Regarding the personnel numbers involved, the merger has lead to efficiencies through flexibility in the deployment of staff and the amalgamation of back office functions.  The total numbers for both bodies is included in the table.  It must be borne in the mind that the overall reduction in numbers may be due to a number of factors, including retirements, as well as the rationalisation measure.On the wider issue of savings, I would make the point that while these reform measures will deliver savings to the taxpayer, the real benefits lie in the simplification of the administrative landscape, thereby ensuring greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and more transparent lines of responsibility of public servants.  In addition to the specific rationalisation measures detailed in the Public Service Reform Plan, there is also the broader issue of fiscal consolidation that is required to bring the General Government deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015, as the Government is committed to doing.  This level of consolidation requires all areas of government, including state bodies, regardless of whether they are highlighted for rationalisation or not, to reduce in scale.Dec-09Dec-10Dec-11Mar-12Total:97959593

The water management protocols operated by these two bodies for the major storage areas in the Shannon system are kept under regular review. I understand that the ESB prepares a water level forecast based on the 5 day rainfall forecast from Met Éireann, and that these forecasts are shared with all local authorities contiguous to the Shannon catchment and with other primary stakeholders.The assessment and management of flood risk on the River Shannon and all the national river catchments is being addressed through the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, which is scheduled to continue until the end of 2015 and will meet the requirements of the EU Floods Directive.  Consultants were appointed to undertake the Shannon CFRAM study in January 2011. The objectives of the Study, which involves Advisory and Progress Groups containing Local Authority representatives, are to identify and examine, in detail, the causes of flooding throughout the Shannon catchment and produce an integrated plan of specific measures to address the significant flood risk factors in a pro-active and comprehensive way. Its output will be a flood risk management plan that will take into account economic, social and environmental factors.Specific updates on the Shannon CFRAM Study are available onhttp://shannoncframstudy.ie/.  Public open days were held in Athlone on 27th and 28th April 2012 as part of a consultative process designed to seek local views on what should be considered when examining solutions for managing flood risk in the future.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	501	As the Deputy is aware, while my Department is responsible for the overall sanctioning of ICT expenditure in the public service, the responsibility for day to day operations rests with each Department and State Agency. Consequently, the decision on what particular office productivity software to deploy and its specific costs are matters for each Department and Agency, subject to the normal sanctioning arrangements.  Advice issued by my Department requires such decisions to be made on the basis of functionality, available support, overall lifetime value for money, compatibility with the existing environment, compliance with applicable standards, and other considerations.Naturally, the form that such an analysis takes will very much depend on the size and complexity of the deployment; one would probably employ a very different methodology and level of formality in deciding on the appropriate software for a small agency as opposed to a large central Department with thousands of staff.   However, in every case the purchasing decision will involve a procurement exercise. Where the analysis for a particular public body concludes that the Microsoft Office suite is suitable, that body can avail of the lowest possible price for this software by using a public service pricing agreement that has been negotiated by my Department with Microsoft.My Department currently provides IT services to the Department of Finance on a shared service basis. In the two Departments we are currently examining whether to migrate from a much older office productivity system to an updated version of the same. This decision will be based on the criteria mentioned above. As part of our evaluation we have rolled out updated software to a limited number of units. The total cost to date of this deployment is €18,199 (VAT inclusive). The estimated on-going cost is zero.On the broader issue of open source software policy, it remains the position of my Department that the appropriate basis for making decisions about software is through robust analysis, open procurement and compliance with underlying open standards, rather than mandating the use of a particular software licence.  However, my officials are always happy to hear the views of open source proponents as to how an explicit open source policy might drive further cost savings.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	502	As I have previously stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question number 28316/12, the general policy with regard to the re-engagement of retired public servants is that staff should not be retained beyond retirement age and any re-engagement should be kept as limited as possible and should be for a very restricted period.  In any big organisation situations can arise where a particular issue requires a short-term specialist input in order to complete a task. In many instances the most appropriate and cost-effective way of solving a short-term problem is to bring in someone who has worked in the area, understands the background and can hit the ground running.The Strategic Workforce Planning Groups in each sector, including my own Department, are currently ensuring that sectoral employers develop plans to deal on an ongoing basis with the operational and strategic consequences arising from the reductions in public service staffing numbers including, inter alia, the lose of corporate memory and experience.  Clearly, the issue of the re-engagement of retired public servants falls within the broad remit of Workforce Planning and an absolute prohibition may not be appropriate in all cases.  Furthermore, I understand that in the vast majority of cases these re-hires are very short-term and project specific and the expense of any more formal selection process which would generally take longer than the time needed to solve the actual problem, as well as using up more staff time away from actual service delivery could not be justified.

This new scheme is being legislated for by way of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011, which is a major wide-ranging and complex piece of legislation.  The new scheme will apply to all future new entrants in all areas of the public service including the civil service, education sector, health sector, local authorities, Garda, Defence Forces, regulatory sector, non-commercial State bodies, Oireachtas and the judiciary.  The Deputy may wish to note that I am taking this Bill giving effect to the Single Scheme at Committee Stage on 21 June. Thereafter I am committed to pressing forward with the Bill so that the new scheme can become law as soon as possible.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21646	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	504	In 2010, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (and IMPACT acting on behalf of their airline pilot members in Ryanair) submitted a complaint to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Labour Organisation that Ireland was not in conformity with the provisions of ILO Convention No. 98 — Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949.The complaint involved allegations of anti-union discrimination and the refusal to engage in good faith collective bargaining on the part of Ryanair, as well as the failure of labour legislation to provide adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and promote collective bargaining.  The ICTU complaint arises as a result of the 2007 Supreme Court decision in the Ryanair case.  The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association considered the submissions during the March session of the ILO Governing Body. The Committee's findings were1) As the information available to the ILO Committee is insufficient to determine whether the alleged offer by Ryanair of conditional benefits to employees provided that the company would not be required to enter into a collective bargaining relationship with the union, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the protection available against anti-union discrimination would adequately cover such acts, including through a thorough review of the protective measures with the social partners concerned.2) The Committee requests the Government to carry out an independent inquiry without delay into the alleged acts of employer interference in order to establish the facts of this specific case and, if necessary, to take the necessary measures to ensure full respects of the principles of freedom of association.3) Noting the commitment on collective bargaining in the Programme for Government, the Committee invites the Government, in full consultation with the social partners, to review the existing framework and consider any appropriate measures, including legislative, so as to ensure respect for the freedom of association and collective bargaining principles set out in its conclusions, including through the review of the mechanisms available with a view to promoting machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers' and workers' organisations for the determination of terms and conditions of employment.I welcome the fact that the ILO report did not find Ireland to be in breach of its obligations under ILO Conventions in respect of collective bargaining rights.  Neither did the ILO find that a resolution of the difficulties arising over the Ryanair judgement would require the introduction of a legal regime of mandatory trade union recognition.The ILO's formal request for the Government's response to the Committees' findings was received on 25 May. The preparation of a formal response to the recommendations made to the Government is currently receiving attention.  As regards the ILO recommendation concerning a review of the existing framework on collective bargaining, the ILO Committee's Report acknowledges that the Government is committed in its Programme for Government to reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights.Delivery on the Government commitment to find a solution to the difficulties that emerged as a result of the Ryanair Supreme Court judgement will require consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework as put in place under the Industrial Relations Acts of 2001 and 2004 and the consequences of the litigation that has arisen in the course of the operation of these Acts.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21646	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The Department has recently developed two new websites —www.enterprise.gov.ie and www.businessregulation.ie.  The former, www.enterprise.gov.ie, will replace the Department’s existing website which has remained substantially unchanged for over ten years. Infrastructure, including a content management system, is shared between the two websites. The latter, www.businessregulation.ie, brings together in one site information on regulation for over 30 Government bodies and, building on the architecture and design work of www.enterprise.gov.ie, was developed in response to a problem identified by business. Work on the websites and a new associated content management system is still under way so the final cost of development is not yet to hand. Based on work carried out to date and the estimated effort of work on hand, the final cost of the two websites is estimated to be approx €83,000.Work carried out included initial design scoping and detailed design, wireframe design and layout, design, development and coding of html and style sheets for page templates, design, development and testing of code to integrate to application programming interfaces of all feed content systems, functionality testing, delivery and deployment of the CMS and developed systems on production servers, security review and hardening of servers and deployment of firewalls, integration of search functionality, and training of staff in the use of the content management system.  The site is hosted in Ireland.  The new website will, over time, replace the existing Departmental website which has remained substantially unchanged for over ten years.Design and development work is being carried out following an open tendering process in a very competitive market.  The work being undertaken includes the delivery of a new web content management system which gives the Department a modern and flexible tool for managing web content and opens up options for consolidating existing diverse website platforms.  This incremental approach minimises risk and optimises the use of constrained personnel resources.  The new website platform presents a much more sophisticated tool than the existing website to draw data from the Department's diverse Offices and Agencies in real time to provide a holistic view of the enterprise agenda.  As a first step in maximising the value of the new web content management system, the new platform is also being used to host the newwww.businessregulation.ie website which delivers guidance and support for businesses in understanding the regulations which apply to them.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21646	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	507	IDA Ireland is an autonomous agency whose statutory obligation is the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions. One of the targets in IDA Ireland's strategy document ‘Horizon 2020’ is the creation of 63,000 new jobs in Ireland in IDA supported companies and a further 42,000 jobs in the wider economy over the period 2010-2014, with 50% of these investments to be based in locations outside of Dublin and Cork.  2011 was a very successful year for IDA Ireland with the creation of 13,000 new FDI jobs. In accordance with the Government’s Action Plan for Jobs, I have asked IDA Ireland to target another 144 new FDI investment projects in 2012, which will create 12,500 new jobs with an associated 8,750 in the wider economy, giving a total impact of 21,250 this year.There are 16 IDA Ireland client companies in Co Meath employing approximately 1,300 people.  IDA Ireland has indicated to me that as Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure, coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  Ireland has only one such Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area.  In order to achieve regional economic development, IDA Ireland prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass, i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills infrastructure, companies, business services etc., and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  In addition, IDA Ireland promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts and in response to specific client requirements. It must be remembered, however, that in all cases, it is the investor who decides where to locate.With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway Economic Region has a positive impact on other Gateway Economic Regions and surrounding areas.  A relevant example of this is the recent announcement by PayPal who will create c. 1,000 new jobs over the next 4 years in Dundalk.  This investment will have a positive economic impact directly and indirectly, not only in the North East Economic Region, but also in the East Economic Region, of which Meath is a part.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14440	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	508	The recently announced New Frontiers Programme replaces the Enterprise Platform Programme and aims to raise the number of business start-ups and to increase the pipeline of HPSUs and other sustainable businesses. This new programme forms part of one of the action points set out in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.  New Frontiers is a national programme delivered in 9 regional locations by 13 Institutes of Technology. As participation in the programme is not predicated on the location of the participant's business Enterprise Ireland does not, therefore, collect data on a county by county basis.The programme is currently being phased in across the country. Ten institutes have commenced/completed Phase 1 of the Programme with over 300 participants taking part in this 6-8 week introductory course. The first interviews for Phase 2 began in mid-May and four institutes have completed the recruitment process with 48 places offered on the 6 month courses taking place in their incubation centres.  Eight Institutes of Technology (IoTs) have partnered to form four collaborative programmes to deliver the New Frontiers Programme while individual programmes are also being offered from a number of IoTs as follows:Collaborative ProgrammesIndividual ProgrammesIT Carlow/Waterford ITDublin ITLimerick IT/IT TraleeDundalk IT (partnered with CIT)IT Tallaght/IT BlanchardstownCork IT (partnered with DkIT)IT Sligo/Letterkenny ITGalway-Mayo IT (partnered with AIT)Athlone IT (partnered with GMIT)
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21646	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The Finance Act 2011 introduced the Employment Investment Incentive (EII) in replacement of the old Business Expansion (BES) Scheme.  The new Scheme has significantly increased the amount of investment a company can receive under the Scheme and also increased the number of SMEs who can receive investment under the Scheme.  Under the old BES Scheme, only companies in the manufacturing, internationally traded services and tourism sectors were eligible.  This widening of the criteria also means Enterprise Ireland as no further role in certifying projects under the Employment Investment Incentive (EII) Scheme as certification is now a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.However, the following trading activities were specifically cited in the legislation as not being eligible for investment under the Scheme:Adventures or concerns in the nature of trade;Dealing in commodities or futures in shares, securities or other financial assets;Financing activities;Professional service companies;Dealing in or developing land;Forestry;Operating or managing hotels, guest houses, self-catering accommodation or comparable establishments or managing property used as a hotel, guest house, self-catering accommodation or comparable establishment;Operating or managing nursing homes or residential care homes or managing  property used as a nursing home or residential care home;Operations carried on in the coal industry or in the steel and shipbuilding sectors;The production of a film.The development of land is specifically cited as not being an activity eligible for investment under the Employment Investment Incentive Scheme.  Such a company would also not fall under the legislative remit of Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21646	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I propose to take Questions Nos. 281 and 282 together.Details of the number of IDA sponsored site visits by potential investors to each county in each of the years 2006 to the end of May 2012 are set out in the following tabular statement.  I am informed by IDA Ireland that the Agency does not maintain records in such a way that would enable it to provide an instant cross reference of locations visited by individual companies.As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  Ireland has only one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area.  In order to achieve regional economic development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass, i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc., and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  In addition, IDA Ireland promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts and in response to specific client requirements.With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, a foreign direct investment (FDI) project secured for one Gateway Economic Region has a positive impact on other Gateway Economic Regions and surrounding areas.  A relevant example of this is the recent announcement by PayPal who will create c. 1,000 new jobs over the next 4 years in Dundalk. This investment will have a positive economic impact directly and indirectly (job creation and expenditure), not only in the North East Economic Region, but also in other Economic Regions such as the East Economic Region and the Midlands Economic Region.The provision of flexible and cost effective property and infrastructural solutions has also been a key aspect in developing differentiating regional value propositions and attracting FDI into Gateway Economic Regions.  In marketing potential locations for a site visit to clients, IDA Ireland has to be credible and competitive in its approach, in the face of stiff international competition for mobile FDI, i.e. locations must meet the criteria of the client company in respect of skills, labour, site and/or buildings, infrastructure, etc. Typically, a company is shown three or four locations within a Gateway Economic Region that can meet its requirements and, in certain cases, other locations are visited on an opportunistic basis. In selecting locations to market to client companies, IDA Ireland endeavours to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses.  Whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the client company.County2006200720082009201020112012 end MayCarlow6711320Cavan4110301Clare33297156Cork16274129442717Donegal9333420Dublin9091929019715085Galway20151422413510Kerry2343220Kildare0111230Kilkenny0212002Laois5661020Leitrim0000000Limerick2435918384012Longford0210000Louth4724232825266Mayo3431101Meath2032020Monaghan1000010Offaly14116711Roscommon0100000Sligo56251233Tipperary0001110Waterford129128111112Westmeath1618181422155Wexford0100100Wicklow0022531

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21646	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	512	In the context of the Government's Programme of Public Sector Reform including rationalisation of the number of State Agencies and Bodies, there are a number of Bodies under the aegis of my Department that are scheduled to be reviewed under that Programme.  Details of the current status of the Bodies under review, including the staff and financial savings anticipated, are set out in the following table.Name of Body/ OrganisationCurrent StatusSavings/Reduction in NumbersCompetition Authority and National Consumer AgencyAs both agencies were established under statute, it is necessary to give effect to the newly merged body by way of primary legislation.  Government approved the draft Heads of a Bill in July 2011 and these were sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.Initial set-up costs will be incurred.No savings in whole-time-equivalent (WTE) numbers.Labour CourtNational Employment Rights AuthorityLabour Relations CommissionEmployment Appeals TribunalEquality TribunalIn July 2011, the intention to streamline the work of five bodies currently dealing with employment disputes in the workplace into a two-tier structure was announced. Four of the existing bodies — the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court — are currently within the remit of the Department. One — the Equality Tribunal — is currently within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.In terms of building the new two tier-model a number of important priority actions that were identified have been successfully delivered, including the development of a:
Single Contact PortalA new single contact portal called “Workplace Relations Customer Services” is fully operational since the beginning of 2012 and provides a single point of entry into the system for employment rights and industrial relations information.The total annual cost of the State’s Workplace Relations Services amounted to some €20m in 2010. It is expected that significant savings, in terms of both reductions in staff numbers and increased efficiency and productivity, will be generated by the end of 2013 by which time the majority of the Workplace Relations Reform Programme will have been implemented. Work has commenced on identifying and capturing on-going pay and non-pay savings and it is expected that definitive information in this regard will be available in Qtr 3 of 2012.Single Complaint FormA Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints was launched on the 4th of January 2012 replacing 30 forms previously in use.
Workplace Relations WebsiteThe new workplace relations websitewww.workplacerelations.ie went live on 4th January 2012.  This website brings together, in one place, information on all aspects of employment rights and industrial relations.
Early Resolution ServiceDelivery of a pilot Early Resolution Service has commenced.  This service will assist parties to a dispute to resolve the issue themselves with the assistance of a Case Resolution Officer.LegislationWork has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new structure. This will see the number of bodies reduced from the current five to two.BlueprintA blueprint document was launched on 5th April setting out a clear path for the delivery of the remainder of the Reform Programme.County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs)Government has approved the establishment of a new “one-stop-shop” micro-enterprise support structure through the dissolution of the existing CEBs and the formation of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). An implementation Working Group has been set up under the auspices of the Department to progress the matter and a first meeting of the Group has been held. In conjunction with this, the Department is seeking formal advice from the Office of the AG regarding appropriate legislation.It is to be expected that over time there will be Current savings resulting from the removal of costs associated with the individual Company status of each CEB, use of shared services, reduced rental costs associated with the relocation of some offices, etc. However initial direct savings will be modest as it could take some years to realise these savings due to existing leasing arrangements, etc.ForfásAn Implementation Group has been established to progress a proposal for the integration of Forfás with the Department.Amalgamation will improve efficiencies/ synergies between the Department and Forfás, but will not lead to immediate financial savings.  Potential initial costs of amalgamation (e.g. ensuring compatibility of IT systems, etc.) need to be explored by the Implementation Group.Amalgamation of Forfás with DJEI will facilitate improvements in the use of existing resources — the objective is not driven by achieving reductions in WTEs.  In any event, the scope for further reduction is severely limited following departure of staff of retirement age in February.Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN)The EGFSN reports to both the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is supported by Forfás. Discussions on the future role of the EGFSN are progressing and the issue will be finalised by end June 2012.Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (ASCTI)The role of the ASCTI is being reviewed in the context of the amalgamation of Forfás into the Department and appropriate arrangements for supporting the Research Prioritisation Exercise.National Competitiveness Council (NCC)The position of the NCC has been reviewed and the view is that the NCC should continue as an independent body, but with a renewed mandate that will produce improved outputs. Proposals for the renewed mandate to the NCC will be presented shortly.There would be no notable financial savings to be achieved by the abolition of the NCC.  The Council will continue to be supported by the Department / Forfás.Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the GovernmentThe contract of the current Chief Scientific Adviser will expire on 31st August 2012. The future of the Office will be determined at that point.Shannon DevelopmentWith the Minister for Transport and Sport an announcement on the formation of a Steering Group and two taskforces to oversee proposals regarding the restructuring of Shannon Airport and Shannon Development was made recently. The Steering Group will report back to cabinet by year end. As part of its work, the Group will also address issues relating to the re-alignment of tourism functions in the region currently carried out by Shannon Development.Companies Registration Office and the Office of the Registrar of Friendly SocietiesWorking Group established and a draft Report is due by the end of June 2012.

This restructuring will include:The creation of a small and micro business Division within Enterprise Ireland with a new and enhanced focus on the wider small business sector, andThe establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a "one-stop-shop" for small businesses within Local Authorities.As agreed by Government, the CEBs will be dissolved in their current legal format and their functions, assets and liabilities transferred to Enterprise Ireland (EI). EI is being mandated to work with the Local Authorities to develop benchmarks for service delivery and enterprise supports as well as appropriate structures and delivery models for the LEOs. In this regard, a detailed formal Service Level Agreement (SLA) will be put in place between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities which will set out how the new enterprise support model will operate in practice. The existing staff of the CEBs will be an integral part of the new arrangements.There is a lot of detailed work to be done to effect these changes. An Implementation Working Group has been set up under the auspices of my Department to progress the matter and a first meeting of the Group has been held.

There is a requirement for these accounts to give a "true and fair view" of the financial position and performance of the company.  Accounting rules such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the EU are required to be used in the preparation of the consolidated accounts of companies admitted to trading on a regulated market, in order to give a true and fair view.  IFRS standards are set by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) an independent standard-making body. It is the function of external auditors to express their opinion as to whether these accounts provide a true and fair view.In the wake of the financial crisis, perceived shortcomings were identified as regards an accounting standard relating to the fair valuation of financial assets, and these were addressed in a new standard. Issues also arose in relation to loan loss-recognition, and these are being examined by the IASB, with the intention of revising this standard.  As regards the functions of external auditors, EU Commission proposals in the aftermath of the financial crisis to improve audit quality are currently being considered at Council Working Group level in Brussels.In addition, my Department is currently finalising logistical aspects of the practical implementation of a Quality Assurance provision in respect of the audit of Public Interest Entities, based on the EU Commission Recommendation in the matter. This will entail direct inspections of relevant audit firms' files by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. This will require primary legislation, and it is my intention to bring proposals to Government on this matter shortly.

New work permit applications can only be considered where it is established that the position has been advertised with FÁS/EURES for a period of 8 weeks and that this advertisement has been flagged as a work permit vacancy and advertised for at least six days in both local and national newspapers.  Finally, it also appeared from the information provided that the applicant was already working for the company without having a valid employment permit and that the company had no other employees.  The applicant was notified of this decision in writing and of their right to appeal this decision within 21 days. No such appeal was received in the Employment Permits Section.

All catering occupations, with the exception of Chefs, are currently ineligible for new employment permits for non-EEA nationals.The Employment Permits Section consider applications in respect of fully trained Head Chefs on a case by case basis for ethnic restaurants, this policy does not apply to take-aways. In line with current policy, new work permit applications can only be considered where it is established that the position has been advertised with FÁS/EURES for a period of 8 weeks and that this advertisement has been flagged as a work permit vacancy and advertised for at least six days in both local and national newspapers.  New Employment Permit applications are normally only considered where it is established that a minimum salary of €30,000 per annum is on offer based on a 39 hour week. This helps ensure that jobs are available to Irish and EU citizens and other EEA nationals in the first instance.The Immigration Regime for Full Time Non-EEA Students, which includes "Third Level Graduate" is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  Full details of both of these Schemes can be found on the Department of Justice and Equality website. I understand the New Immigration Regime for Full Time Non-EEA Students which has been in operation since 1 January 2011 has commitments to a separate evaluation of the student work concession under the auspices of the Interdepartmental Committee on Student Immigration which is chaired by the Department of Justice. Work on this review is currently ongoing.  Finally the focus of Government policy in all sectors including the culinary industry is to ensure that labour shortages can be met from training and up-skilling people already in our labour market.

The catchment area of these offices, particularly near the border of counties, may include addresses in neighbouring counties (e.g. Meath), and as such those signing on at a Local Office in Louth may not be resident in the county. A detailed breakdown of this number by Profession and Local Office is contained in the attached tabular statement.There are two major elements to the Government's response to the unemployment crisis in Louth and elsewhere. These are theAction Plan for Jobs to create employment and the Pathways to Work Policy   aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of job vacancies are filled by people from the live register. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and his Department are primarily responsible for employment creation and for the Action Plan for Jobs, while the Pathways to Work initiative is primarily a matter for my Department.There are five strands in the Pathways to Work policy:More regular and on-going engagement with the unemployed.  The new National Employment and Entitlement Service will provide an integrated and more personalised service to unemployed people, with more regular and intensive engagement through the use profiling tools and case management systems.Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities. Over 85,000 places will be provided in training and education.Incentivising the take-up of opportunities. This will ensure that work pays by reviewing policies and schemes to ensure they are not seen as disincentives to taking up employment.Incentivising employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed. This involves rebuilding relations with and gaining the trust of employers both at local national levels. This also involves giving employers incentives such as the PRSI exemption scheme to employ people from the live register.Reforming institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed.   The establishment of the NEES and the integration of the FÁS Employment Services and the Community Welfare Services into the Department are key element of this institutional restructuring. The establishment of SOLAS, the rationalisation of the VECs and the establishment of the new education and Training boards (ETBs) are also part of this structural reform.I am confident that these two sets of initiatives will lead to a reduction in unemployment in Louth and elsewhere.ProfessionArdeeDroghedaDundalkAssociate Professional and Technical Occupations57187220Clerical and Secretarial Occupations179820729Craft and Related Occupations9922,1271,549Managers and Administrators42378263Other Occupations195728788Personal and Protective Service Occupations200931867Person has no Occupation8189224Plant and Machine Operatives3571,4751,082Professional Occupations96356395Sales Occupations218837867Total2,3448,0286,984
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	525	It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 297, 314, 315 and 349 together.The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of sick absence for an initial period of illness, is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area; the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund; the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism.  A range of complex issues need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme. These include the extent of coverage; the duration of payment; the rate of payment; compensation mechanisms for employers where appropriate; and how to ensure that a scheme of statutory sick pay would be enforced and policed.The impact of introducing a statutory sick pay scheme would be contingent on how all of these issues are addressed and how such a scheme would ultimately be structured.  I am acutely conscious of the pressures facing employers and in particular, the smaller and medium-sized enterprises. A preliminary analysis based on estimates of absenteeism in the private sector indicates that if a sick pay scheme with a duration of four weeks were to be introduced, it would add about €1 per week per employee to the costs of employment.    In the event that a scheme were to be introduced, the Social Insurance Fund would continue to provide supports for extended periods of illness.I hosted a consultative seminar on the feasibility and implications of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay in February 2012.  This seminar was attended by a broad range of key stakeholders and afforded an opportunity to discuss the complex issues involved.  A report of that seminar was published on the Department's website today and provides the basis for further consultations with key stakeholders.  The analysis of the potential impact will continue to be developed and refined as the consultations with key stakeholders, including other relevant Government Departments, progresses.

Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  Following the submission of additional evidence the Appeals Officer has agreed to review the case.  The person concerned will be contacted when the review of her appeal has been finalised.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	531	I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, based on figures for the first quarter of 2012, the average waiting time for appeals dealt with by summary decisions was  22.4 weeks and 40.9 weeks  for those that required an oral hearing.  The comparable times for 2011 were 25 weeks and 52.5 weeks.These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial nature, the processing of appeals takes time even at the best of times and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department appointed 12 additional Appeals Officers in 2010 and 2011. In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This brought the total number of Appeals Officers to 39.  The Office also improved its business processes and IT support.  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs and processing times for dealing with appeals.

Social welfare fraud undermines public confidence in the entire system as well as being unfair to other recipients of social welfare payments, taxpayers and businesses run on a legitimate basis.  My Department is very conscious of its obligation to protect public money and is determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and dealt with effectively when detected. Fraud detection measures have increased and improved significantly over the last number of years and will continue to be reviewed to prioritise resources at achieving results.While I note the contents of the letter associated with the Deputy's Question, outsourcing of the investigation function is not envisaged at the moment. Investigators in the Department work closely with Revenue staff in the Joint Investigation Unit, with NERA, the Gardaí and other compliance and enforcement agencies in the context of preventing welfare fraud.  An investigator from my Department will be following up the details contained in the letter referred to.The Department's control policy aims to minimise fraud and abuse of the social welfare system. As part of this policy, the Department accepts reports of possible fraud offered by members of the public in relation to the Department's schemes. All reports are followed up and are dealt with in confidence.   Members of the public are asked to provide as much detail about the case they are reporting as possible and, they can do so anonymously.  Reports can be made as follows:By email:www.welfare.ie

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	536	At the end of May 2012 there were 7,007 Invalidity Pension (IP) claims registered and pending decision. Average time to award is currently 37 weeks, this includes the time taken to decide EU and bilateral cases which have a significantly longer processing time.  Since the introduction of the two year expiration of illness benefit there has been a significant increase in the number of IP claims received in the Department. A high percentage of these applicants are not suitable for the invalidity pension scheme as they are not considered to be permanently incapable of work.The processing time for individual Invalidity pension claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the qualifying criteria. In addition, factors outside the Department's control can have an impact, for example, insufficient information received from claimants at time of application and delays in claimants furnishing the information requested.This Department is continually reviewing its processes in an effort to improve processing times and customer service. Many improvements have already been introduced in IP section. These improvements include the introduction of a new IT platform under the Department's service delivery model project which has led to further efficiencies in processing which resulted in an increase in the number of claims processed. Most claims are now desk assessed by medical assessors to determine medical suitability.  Additional staff has been assigned to the IP area to help to reduce the backlog and waiting time. Overtime has been made available and is utilised on a judicious basis.From June 2012 further changes have been introduced to assist with claim processing, a business process improvement project was carried out and a plan is now in place. Some staff have been reallocated from other duties to focus on claim processing, a phone bank has been introduced, many processes have been streamlined in an effort to improve processing times. Despite these improvements it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlog are reduced to an acceptable level.  Customers waiting on a decision on their IP claim, who have urgent income support needs, can apply for the means tested supplementary welfare allowance (SWA).
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	537	The habitual residence condition applies to social assistance payments and to Child Benefit.  The determination of a person's habitual residence is made in accordance five factors which are set out in legislation, as follows:(a) the length and continuity of residence in Ireland or in any other particular country;(b) the length and purpose of any absence from Ireland;(c) the nature and pattern of employment;(d) the person's main centre of interest, and(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.These five factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law.EU rules prevent discrimination on Nationality grounds in relation to social security, so it is not possible to exempt a particular category of Irish citizens (such as returning emigrants) from the HRC (either in general or for carers allowance) without extending the same treatment to all EU Nationals.  However, the guidelines regarding determination of habitual residence address the issue of returning emigrants very specifically.  The Guidelines state: "A person who had previously been habitually resident in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his/her long-term residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually resident immediately on his/her return to the State."In determining the main centre of interest in the case of returning emigrants, deciding officers take account of:purpose of return, e.g. expiry of foreign residence permitthe applicant's stated intentionsverified arrangements which have been made in regard to returning on a long-term basis, e.g. transfer of financial accounts and any other assets, termination of residence based entitlements in the other country, or assistance from Safe Home or a similar programme to enable Irish emigrants to return permanentlylength and continuity of the previous residence in the Statethe record of employment or self employment in another State andwhether s/he has maintained links with the previous residence and can be regarded as resuming his/her previous residence rather than starting a new period of residence.This is generally sufficient to enable the deciding officer to determine whether their present circumstances in Ireland indicate a temporary visit or habitual residence.The Deputy should be aware that the number of applications for carer's allowance refused on grounds of habitual residency is small.  For 2012 (to date), only 5 Irish Nationals have been refused Carers on HRC grounds.  In 2011, 13,888 applications for carer's allowance were processed.  Of these, 223 were refused on the basis of habitual residency, of which 42 were Irish nationals.  This means that, in 2011, approximately 1.6% of all applications were refused on habitual residency grounds.  Any applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision and/or appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.

In the interests of fairness and equity applications are processed, as far as possible, in order of the date on which they were received in the Department. The average time to process a claim for carer's allowance, which includes an assessment of the means, medical evidence, residency and full-time care aspects, is approximately 28 weeks at present. There are currently approximately 8,830 new applications registered and awaiting a decision and approximately 330 new applications are received each week.A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme. This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  Full deployment for carer's allowance will be achieved by mid-June but it will be a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.In addition to the deployment of new systems, the Department is allocating additional resources in the form of overtime working and temporary staff to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  Once full deployment of the new systems is complete, it is planned to undertake a full review of processes in the area with a view to further streamlining and improving service to customers including reducing the backlog and the waiting time for a decision on a new claim.  In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on an application, he/she may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance.

Public and civil servants who had been in employment before 6 April 1995 and continued to be so employed without a break in service were insured at the modified rate of PRSI contribution, Class D, whereas new entrants paid PRSI Class A.Following on from the 6 April 1995 changes the Department of Education and Skills applied the incorrect rate of PRSI in certain situations.  This resulted in an overpayment of PRSI contributions and an underpayment of pension contributions in respect of the teachers concerned.  This Department dealt with individual cases as they arose over a number of years. Subsequently, the  group affected was identified and consultation took place between officials from this Department and the Department of Education and Skills which clarified the correct PRSI class and steps were taken to rectify these records.  Officials from this Department and the Department of Education and Skills are in on-going discussions to agree a satisfactory solution in this matter.

Compensation is based on the worker's length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of €600 per week.  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to their employees is then entitled to a rebate from the State.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).The Insolvency Payments scheme operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 and is designed to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  Such entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, and payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001.  The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001 provide that, if an employee has been in continuous service with the same employer for at least thirteen weeks, the employee is entitled to a minimum period of notice if the employer terminates the contract of employment.  The period of notice varies according to the length of service.  The Acts, which are under the aegis of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, do not prevent an employee from accepting payment in lieu of notice.Under Redundancy Payments legislation, an eligible employee must receive at least two weeks' notice.  This two-week notice period can overlap with the minimum notice period provided for under the Minimum Notice legislation.  The Minimum Notice legislation provides a means of redress for an employee who believes he/she has not received his/her entitlements, whereby the employee can make a claim for compensation to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.The State provides various mechanisms, including the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court, through which alleged breaches of employment rights may be pursued by an employee.  These bodies are independent in the performance of their duties.  While these bodies are available to deal with any complaint received, it is strictly a matter for an employee as to whether any such complaint should be pursued.  To date no applications under the redundancy payments scheme or the insolvency payments scheme have been received in respect of the former employees of the nursing home concerned.  If there are outstanding payments of PAYE and/or PRSI due to the State in respect of the nursing home concerned the Office of the Revenue Commissioners will pursue those monies through the appropriate channels.

The Scheme provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels.  It aims to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience by providing them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.The Scheme has made significant progress to-date.  Currently, over 7,682 internships have commenced to date with 4,880 internships in place as at 7th June 2012 and over 1,900 opportunities presently advertised onwww.jobbridge.ie.  In this context, it should be noted that the Scheme is open to companies in all sectors including private, public, voluntary and community.  In line with the eligibility criteria, a host organisation participating in JobBridge must be in a position to provide a substantial commitment to their intern so as to ensure the provision of a quality internship.  To this end, a clear set of rules have been developed to protect the intern and safeguard JobBridge from potential abuse.The total number of internship places an organisation can offer at any one time is set out in the table below:Number of Full Time Employees*Number of Internships1-10 employees1 internship place11-20 employees2 internship places21-30 employees3 internship places30 + employees20% of the workforce to a maximum of 200 internships whichever is the smaller*employed for 30 hours or more per week (i.e. on payroll and subject to tax and PRSI)The Deputy should note that local branch offices of national organisations e.g. large retail outlets will not be regarded as an individual host organisation for the purpose of JobBridge (effective from 10th October 2011).  The maximum number of interns a host organisation can have on the Scheme at any point in time is 200, irrespective of the number of local branches they have.  Further information for potential host organisations is available on the JobBridge websitewww.jobbridge.ie.In August 2011, these criteria were amended to include the participation of sole traders within the JobBridge scheme provided they have a minimum of 1 full-time employee (employed for 30 hours or more per week and subject to tax and PRSI).  My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge Scheme including its eligibility criteria, both for host organisations and interns, on an on-going basis.

Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, a key objective of our labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register as close to the labour market as possible and to prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will help to ensure that individuals availing of activation measures such as JobBridge will, while retaining their unemployment payments and a top-up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.For these reasons, eligibility for JobBridge is targeted at those in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Benefit, One Parent Family Payment, Disability Allowance or signing for credits for 78 days of the last 6 months.  Time spent on certain Government sponsored training may also be taken into account when calculating eligibility.  Overall, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources at those in one of the above categories as to increase their chances of leaving the Live Register, thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.  My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme on an on-going basis.

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are approximately 93,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement, with €436m provided in 2012.New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These new limits were set after an analysis of the most up-to-date market data available.  Consultation with officers responsible for administering the scheme was undertaken as part of the review process, including officers from the Department's central rents unit which administers rent supplement for a significant portion of the Dublin region.  Consultation with local officers in the Dublin North East area was not undertaken.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst, at the same time, ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.

The general practice is that rent supplement is not paid where the rent is above the relevant limit.  However, rent supplement may be paid in cases where the rent is above the relevant limit in the following circumstances:Where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances (in particular, for example, a person with a disability in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons whose housing needs cannot be met within the standard terms of the rent supplement scheme, etc.);Where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.  "Sufficient income" in this context means the relevant basic supplementary welfare allowance rate less the prescribed minimum contribution to rent; and/orWhere the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short period.  For this purpose, a guideline period of no longer than 6 to 8 weeks is suggested but where there are exceptional circumstances, an extension up to a total of 12 weeks may be allowed.Statistics are not available on the exact number of cases where rent supplement was paid in excess of the maximum rent limit since January 2012.

These are the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Citizens Information Board and the Pensions Board.  In addition, the office of the Pensions Ombudsman comes under the remit of the Department but it does not have a Board.  No body under the aegis of my Department has been merged or abolished since the formation of the Government.The integration of the regulatory functions of the Pensions Board with the Financial Regulator and the merging of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman are the subject of a critical review under the Public Service Reform Programme.  This review will include identifying any potential savings arising from such an amalgamation.  In that regard, I have recently commissioned the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to review Ireland's pension arrangements.As the OECD is also currently reviewing the direction of pension policy, including governance structures and will act as an independent expert to the critical review I expect the Critical Review Group to report to me within a similar time frame as the OECD Review Group.  The Critical Review Group is due to have its first meeting in July 2012 and I expect to receive a report from both by year end.  Following receipt of these reports, decisions in relation to the reforms as set out above will be taken.

The amount of diet supplement payable in individual cases is calculated by assessing one-third (single people) or one-sixth (couples) of the applicant's weekly income against the cost of the relevant diet.  The last study into the cost of specialised diets was carried out in 2007.  Accordingly, when diet supplement payments for qualifying individuals are being calculated the social welfare rates for 2007 are used.

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 93,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided €436m in 2012.Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the Local Authorities.  However, accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards. In consultation with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, S.I. No. 572 of 2006 and Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 introduced the condition that allows the Department's officers administering supplementary welfare allowance to decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority of the non-compliance with standards.Where such a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant, it is recommended that the designated officer would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.  This approach supports the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in their aim to promote further improvement in private rented accommodation standards.

The Report of the Group, which recommends a scheme for the legal recognition of transgender persons, was approved by the Government on 12 July 2011, and was subsequently published on 14 July 2011.  Since then, my Department has been working on developing draft Heads of a Bill.  The Department has sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the issue of transgender persons who are already married or who have civil partnership status.  The advice that is received from the Office of the Attorney General will inform the drafting of the Heads of the Bill.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	613	Jobseeker's Allowance is a means tested social assistance scheme operated by my Department.  For means test purposes, account is taken of the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse/partner including the earnings of the spouse.  Where a spouse/partner has earnings from employment, earnings less PRSI contributions, pension contributions and trade union subscriptions are assessed as means.  Mortgage payments are not deducted from earnings for means assessment purposes. However, a person who is claiming Jobseeker's Allowance may also apply for mortgage interest supplement. That scheme is designed to help those who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayment schedule where their means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The scheme provides a short-term "safety net" to ensure that people with mortgage interest commitments do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment.The mortgage interest supplement scheme is being modernised this month in order to ensure that the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process operated by the lenders functions alongside State supports, such as the mortgage interest supplement scheme, and that the forbearance arrangements implicit in the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process are reflected in the eligibility criteria for the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  There are two categories of individuals who will be affected by this change:New claims whose difficulty is resolved within the first 12 months, e.g. if they return to work. These individuals will no longer qualify for mortgage interest supplement, andCustomers who will no longer qualify for a payment until they have availed of 12 months of an alternative payment arrangement from their lender.Any further changes to the arrangements outlined above would have to be considered in the context of the on-going review of all Government expenditure.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	615	The Department has been responsible for the domiciliary care allowance scheme (DCA) since  April 2009.  As there were no agreed national medical guidelines for the scheme while it was administered by the Health Service Executive, an Expert Medical Group was established, in advance of the transfer of functions, to examine this issue and to draw up standardised medical guidelines.  The Group considered that the most appropriate way for the Department to conduct assessments for medical eligibility was by assessing evidence submitted by the claimant, rather than by way of individual examination by the Department's Medical Assessors (MAs) as they are not involved in the on-going treatment of the child.The DCA application process is the same for children with autism as for those with any other disability and involves the completion of a claim form which includes details of the medical condition of the child and the level of care and attention that the child needs to deal with normal day to day activity.  The process involves the submission of a detailed statement by the parent or guardian of the child, a detailed statement by the child's General Practitioner as well as any other relevant evidence from qualified experts who have examined the child.  This evidence is assessed by the MAs who have received special training and are qualified and experienced medical professionals who meet regularly to ensure best practice and consistency of approach.As the Deputy may be aware, I recently announced that a review of the DCA scheme will be undertaken over the coming months.  I expect to make announcements shortly in relation to the terms of reference and other arrangements for the review.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	616	At the outset I would like to confirm that the rate band changes, which will come into effect from September 2012, will not affect existing customers.  There is an important context to the proposed changes to State pension provision.  Firstly, there is the fiscal context. Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, you will appreciate that savings have to be found in the social welfare system.The change to State Pension rate bands means that pension payments made, will reflect PRSI payments made over a working life. Currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only €4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable.  From September 2012, a lower pension will be payable to new applicants for State pension who have a yearly average of less than 48 PRSI contributions which better relates to their PRSI record. This measure introduces additional rates bands for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) to more fairly reflect the proportionality of attachment to the workforce by the claimant.The maximum rate will remain unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year will also remain unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension but it should be noted that while expectations may need to be adjusted, a rate of pension will still be payable.  I have included, for information, the new rate bands below.  Claimants with an income need, may, following a means test, qualify for a State pension (non-contributory).   The maximum rate of the (State pension non-contributory) is €219.00 per weekThis change to rate bands which I am introducing in September 2012, moves somewhat closer to a ‘total contribution approach' where those who pay more, benefit more.  The ‘total contributions approach' to State pension will be adopted to replace the current averaging system.  The current proposed date for its introduction is 2020.   Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.Secondly, there is also an important long-term policy context for the proposed changes to State pension as the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.All information relating to the changes that I have outlined here is also available on my Department's website.Yearly average contributionsPersonal Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged under 66 yearsRate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged over 66 yearsRate per week48 or over€230.30€153.50€206.3020-47€225.80€153.50€206.3015-19€172.70€115.10€154.7010-14€115.20€76.80€103.20Yearly average contributionsPersonal Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged under 66 yearsRate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged over 66 yearsRate per week48 or over€230.30€153.50€206.3040-47€225.80€146.00€196.0030-39€207.00€139.00€186.0020-29€196.00€130.00€175.0015-19€150.00€100.00€134.0010-14€92.00€61.00€83.00Yearly average contributionsPersonal Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged under 66 yearsRate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged over 66 yearsRate per week48 or over€230.30€153.50€206.3024-47€225.80€153.50€206.30Yearly average contributionsPersonal Rateper weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged under 66 years Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged over 66 years Rate per week48 or over€230.30€153.50€206.3040-47€225.80€146.00€196.0030-39€207.00€139.00€186.0024-29€196.00€130.00€175.00

Because of resource implications, the State is only ever in a position to acquire, maintain and conserve a relatively small number of heritage properties and monuments.

There are no proposals to acquire any such properties at present.

Details of this allocation are published in Appendix 1 of the annual Revised Estimates Volume and I understand that a total provision of €220m is being made available in 2012.Three subheads in my Department's Vote are partially funded from this National Lottery allocation, including Subhead A9 — An Chomhairle Ealaíon, for which €63.241 million (comprising both Lottery and Exchequer funding) is being allocated this year. Allocations to the Arts Council in the years 2007 to 2010 are set out in the Revised Estimates Volumes (REV) for each of those years.  Under section 8 of the National Lottery Act 1986, the proceeds of the National Lottery are paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer and therefore National Lottery funding is one of the constituents of Exchequer funding.  The apportionment of National Lottery funding to various lines of voted expenditure is the responsibility of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform.

I am informed that Waterways Ireland has agreed in principle with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to its designation of the Royal Canal towpath as a cycle route. Furthermore, Waterways Ireland is working with a number of local authorities in developing cycle routes along various stretches of towpath and is supporting the current application by Westmeath County Council to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for further development of the cycle route in its functional area.I am advised by Waterways Ireland that the Royal Canal towpath upgrading works between Kennan Bridge, Porterstown, and Callaghan Bridge, Clonsilla, are being carried out as financial and human resources permit. Preliminary works commenced in October 2010 in compliance with the Wildlife Acts, which only permit the carrying out of hedge cutting and tree maintenance works between 1st September and the end of February the following year. It is expected that the upgrading works, which are being carried out directly by Waterways Ireland, will be completed by December 2012.  There are no specific costs estimated for this project, which is being undertaken as part of Waterways Ireland's day-to-day maintenance operations.

Under Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Acts, inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures in relation to those structures.  Planning authorities are also given powers to ensure that the structures are protected. This includes powers to serve notice to carry out protective works, and obligations in relation to how development proposals are considered. The appropriate authority in this case is Dublin City Council.My Department also has some limited funding for structures at risk.  In 2011, I awarded a grant of €80,587 from this funding stream to Dublin City Council to assist with urgent repair and conservation works on Aldborough House and am satisfied that the assistance offered has made a significant contribution to conserving the architectural heritage value of this protected structure.  Applications for this funding are made by local authorities to my Department and the deadline for applications in 2012 has passed.  No further application was made under the fund in 2012 in respect to Aldborough House.

While the Centenary commemorative programme commenced earlier this year, the arrangements for the continuing decade are still at an early stage of development.  I am working with the British Government and the Executive in Northern Ireland in this regard. I very much appreciate the interest and support of British Ministers and officeholders from Northern Ireland for the programme and their participation in several recent commemorative events.At the centre of the programme for the Decade of Centenaries, there will be a comprehensive commemoration of the Easter Rising with attention to both the background and consequences.  The detention of prisoners is an important part of the story of the Rising and an account of their experience at Frongoch and elsewhere would be appropriate in the commemorative programme.  As the general arrangements for commemoration of the Rising in 2016 are still under development, I would not seek to anticipate the particular arrangements for the prisoners or any other element of the programme.I very much appreciate the interest reflected in this enquiry and would extend an invitation to the Deputy and any other persons to contact me with the contributions or suggestions they would offer towards the developing programme.

Faoi Bhille na Gaeltachta 2012 atá foilsithe inniu, tabharfar feidhm reachtúil don phróiseas pleanála teanga faoina mbeidh plean teanga á ullmhú ag leibhéal an phobail do 19 limistéir pleanála teanga faoi leith sa Ghaeltacht. Bunaíodh na ceantair seo cuid mhaith ar na limistéir pleanála a bhí ag Údarás na Gaeltachta, ag cur san áireamh cúrsaí teanga, cúrsaí tíreolaíochta, struchtúir pobail agus dlús daonra. Beidh plean teanga le réiteach ag gach ceann de na limistéir seo in imeacht ama. Tá sé i gceist gon-aontóidh na pobail sna limistéir éagsúla pleananna teanga le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta agus go gcuirfear faoi bhráid mo Roinnse iad le measúnú a dhéanamh orthu. Nuair a bheidh siad faofa, tabharfar tréimhse ama don phobal chun iad a chur i bhfeidhm. Ar ndóigh, déanfaidh mo Roinnse athbhreithniú ar chur i bhfeidhm na bpleananna go tréimhsiúil.Faoi láthair, tá Údarás na Gaeltachta ag maoiniú eagraíochtaí pobalbhunaithe éagsúla sa Ghaeltacht, ar nós comharchumainn agus comhlachtaí forbartha.  Táthar aontaithe go mbeidh príomheagraíocht cinnireachta amháin i ngach limistéar pleanála teanga chun an próiseas pleanála teanga a stiúradh agus go mbeidh na heagraíochtaí eile sa limistéar pleanála teanga céanna ag feidhmiú faoin bpríomheagraíocht sin, mar a bhaineann sé leis an bpleanáil teanga.  Ós rud é go bhfuil na heagraíochtaí seo maoinithe ag an Údarás, is faoin Údarás a bheidh sé na céimeanna cuí a thógáil i gcomhar leis na heagraíochtaí féin chun an cur chuige seo a fhorbairt agus a fheidhmiú.Ar ndóigh, tá sé tábhachtach freisin nach mbeidh an próiseas pleanála teanga seo teoranta do na ceantair a bhfuil stádas reachtúil Gaeltachta acu faoi láthair. Dá bhrí sin, tabharfar stádas reachtúil faoi Bhille na Gaeltachta 2012 do Líonraí Gaeilge agus do Bhailte Seirbhíse Gaeltachta. Faoin mBille, tá sé i gceist go mbeidh na pobail sna ceantair seo ag aontú pleananna teanga le Foras na Gaeilge agus le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, de réir mar is cuí, agus go gcuirfear na pleananna sin faoi bhráid mo Roinnse le measúnú a dhéanamh orthu.Ní miste a rá go bhfuil fócasghrúpa ar a bhfuil ionadaithe ó eagraíochtaí pobalbhunaithe i gCluain Dolcáin, Ceatharlach agus Inis bunaithe ag mo Roinnse, i gcomhar le Foras na Gaeilge, chun tarraingt ar an saineolas atá ag na pobail sin maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ina gcuid ceantair féin. Anuas air sin, tionóladh seisiúin eolais agus cruinnithe idir oifigigh mo Roinne agus eagraíochtaí éagsúla le bliain anuas ar mhaithe leis na heagraíochtaí sin a choinneáil ar an eolas maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na Straitéise. I measc na n-eagraíochtaí seo, bhí Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Glór na nGael, an Foras Pátrúnachta, Gaelscoileanna agus an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeilge agus Gaelscolaíochta.

A number of amalgamations, mergers and critical reviews of bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group are currently being progressed, as required under the Reform Plan. Details of these are reflected in the Plan, which can be accessed on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform —www.per.gov.ie.As the Deputy will also be aware, the priorities set out in the Programme for Government for the rationalisation of State agencies provide that such rationalisation must be cost effective and lead to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible at this stage to outline projected savings for each body to be rationalised.  However, the implications arising are currently being examined within my Department with a view to identifying savings, as well as opportunities for efficiencies and more effective service delivery.  My Department expects to submit proposals in this regard to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by the end of June 2012.

The project requires two principal components to be addressed.  The first is the legal necessity to change the relevant legislation to permit publication of the Census before the expiry of the statutory 100 year period, while respecting certain rights. The second is the technical process whereby the material can be converted from the paper records to a searchable electronic database in a cost-effective fashion.  Legal advice has been obtained in relation to the legislative changes and consultation with relevant bodies is in progress. Possible technical approaches are also currently being considered, as are their resource implications. My Department is working to progress these matters.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	631	Broadband services under the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) are available since October 2010 from "3", the NBS service provider, in all of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.  In keeping with State Aid clearance for the Scheme, the broadband service contracted under the NBS is an affordable, scalable product.  The NBS mobile wireless service currently offers minimum speeds of 1.6Mbps download and 1.2Mbps upload subject to a maximum contention ratio.  The NBS satellite service is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, as in the case of the person to whom the Deputy refers above.  At present the minimum speeds are 1Mbps download and 128kbps upload.  Both products are due to be upgraded in the next few months without any increase in the monthly charge.With regard to the NBS service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on 3, with financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  The NBS contract provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.My Department liaises very closely with 3 to ensure that any issues relating to service performance, which are brought to its attention are addressed as quickly as possible.  In the case of the person referred to by the Deputy, my officials had already, on receipt of earlier representations on his behalf, been in contact with 3 to assist in resolving his service difficulties.  Likewise, my officials have been in direct contact with the customer in the matter.  3 is currently working on improving aspects of the overall satellite service provision and have confirmed that this customer will be reimbursed for the service deterioration experienced by him.  My officials will remain in contact with the customer until such time as his service issues are successfully resolved, in accordance with the requirements of the Scheme.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	632	RTÉ provides full digital reception through its SAORVIEW (98%) and SAORSAT (100%) networks.  This is the first time in the history of TV that Ireland has a national TV network covering 100% of the population.  RTÉ has built, owns and controls the digital TV network and is also responsible for the coverage and operation of that network.  In accordance with Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, the development of the RTÉ network is an operational matter for RTÉ and not one in which I, as Minister, have a function.I have, however, had enquiries made on your behalf.  I understand from RTÉ that the analogue network covers 98% of the population, the SAORVIEW network will provide 98% population coverage and SAORSAT provides 100% coverage.  SAORSAT is a new ‘free-to-air' satellite service unique to Ireland which ensures the RTÉ TV services are available to the remaining 2% of the population.  RTÉ is not obliged to provide a satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.  Further information on SAORSAT is available onwww.saorview.ie and also www.rtenl.ie.Work has been ongoing across the country to prepare the transmission sites for the move from analogue to digital terrestrial television.  However, it is virtually impossible to cover 100% of the population by terrestrial means.  Reasons for this include local topography, for example.  RTÉNL is continuing to work on developing more detailed information on areas where coverage issues have been identified and my Department will continue to liaise with RTÉNL to ensure that such information is made available at a local level.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	633	Ireland's telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the Commission for Communications Regulation's (ComReg) website atwww.callcosts.ie.The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  In the case of one such intervention, namely the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), services are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, 3, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in each of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.  That includes 112 EDs in County Mayo, which are listed in Appendix I.The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  This Scheme, which is being rolled out this year, is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas who wish to avail of such services.My Department has received 49 eligible applications from County Mayo.  The details of applicants have been passed to the commercial operators participating in the Scheme.  The names of these companies and the area where they operate can be found on the following link:list of companies.  It is expected that a significant number of applicants will be served by commercial operators as part of this phase of the Scheme, which concludes at the end of July. Should any applicants remain un-served after this phase, a service will be procured by my Department and the target is to have this rolled out by the end of this year.The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.  With basic broadband services available throughout Ireland, the challenge now is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  This Government accepts that the widespread availability of such speeds is required to deliver future economic and social development.Following the recent publication of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), and a short public consultation on its findings and recommendations, I will be bringing proposals for a National Broadband Plan to Government shortly with a view to agreeing a comprehensive set of policy actions to underpin the provision of high speed broadband services on a national basis.Electoral DivisionsADDERGOOLEED 157002AGHAGOWER NORTHED 157003AGHAGOWER SOUTHED 157004AGHAMOREED 157005AILLEMOREED 157006AN GEATA MOR THEASED 157007AN GEATA MOR THUAIDHED 157008ARDNAREE NORTHED 157010ATTYMASS EASTED 157012ATTYMASS WESTED 157013BALLINCHALLAED 157019BALLYCASTLEED 157022BALLYCROY NORTHED 157023BALLYCROY SOUTHED 157024BALLYNAGORAHERED 157028BALLYOVEYED 157029BALLYSAKEERYED 157030BANGORED 157031BARROOSKYED 157032BEKANED 157033BELDERGMOREED 157034BELMULLETED 157036BOHOLAED 157037BRACKLOONED 157038BUNAVEELAED 157040BUNDORRAGHAED 157041BURRISCARRAED 157043CALLOWED 157044CAPPAGHDUFFED 157045CARAUNED 157046CARROWMOREED 157047CLARE ISLANDED 157050CLOGHERED 157052CLOGHERED 157053CLOGHERMOREED 157054CLOONMOREED 157056COOLNAHAED 157058COONARDED 157059CORRAUN ACHILLED 157060COURSEED 157061CROAGHMOYLEED 157062CROAGHPATRICKED 157063CROSSMOLINA SOUTHED 157066CUILDOOED 157067CULNACLEHAED 157068DALGANED 157069DEELED 157070DERRYED 157071DERRYLOUGHANED 157072DOOCASTLEED 157073DOOEGAED 157074DRUMMINED 157075ERRIFFED 157077FORTLANDED 157078GARRYMOREED 157079GLENAMOYED 157080GLENCASTLEED 157081GLENCOED 157082GLENHESTED 157083GOOLAMOREED 157084HOLLYMOUNTED 157085HOUNDSWOODED 157086ISLANDEADYED 157087KILBEAGHED 157088KILCOMMONED 157090KILFIAN EASTED 157091KILFIAN SOUTHED 157092KILFIAN WESTED 157093KILGARVANED 157094KILGEEVERED 157095KILKELLYED 157096KILLALAED 157097KILLAVALLYED 157098KILLEDANED 157099KILMACLASSERED 157100KILMAINEED 157101KILMEENAED 157102KILSALLAGHED 157104KILVINEED 157106KNAPPAGHED 157107KNOCK SOUTHED 157109KNOCKADAFFED 157110KNOCKNALOWERED 157111LACKAN NORTHED 157112LACKAN SOUTHED 157113LETTERBRICKED 157114MAYOED 157118MEELICKED 157119MOUNT FALCONED 157120MUINGNABOED 157121MUINGSED 157122MURNEENED 157123NEALEED 157124NEWBROOKED 157125NEWPORT EASTED 157126NEWPORT WESTED 157127OWENBRINED 157128OWENNADORNAUNED 157129PORTROYALED 157131RATHHILLED 157132RATHOMAED 157133ROSLEEED 157134SALLYMOUNTED 157135SHESKINED 157136SHRULEED 157137SLIEVEMAHANAGHED 157138SONNAGHED 157140SRAHMOREED 157142TAGHEENED 157145TAWNYNAGRYED 157146TOOCANANAGHED 157147TUMGESHED 157149
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	634	Ireland has a 2020 target for the share of renewable energy in all of energy consumption across the electricity, heat and transport sectors. This is 16% as set out in the Renewable Energy Directive.  Our intention is to meet this through around 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heat which together total 16% overall.  Ireland has been increasing the number of windfarms significantly in recent times. There is currently approximately 1600MW of wind connected to the system.The Gate 3 system developed by the Commission for Energy Regulation which involves grid connection offers of 3900MW to renewable generation, the bulk of which have been made to wind generators, along with Grid 25 and its implementation plans being rolled out by EirGrid, are the processes in place that underpin the expansion of wind electricity in line with the achievement of having 40% of our electricity consumption from renewable resources by 2020.The Renewable Energy Directive provides for co-operation mechanisms between countries where Inter-Governmental agreements between countries can be put in place to facilitate renewable trade. As set out in the Renewable Energy Strategy published in late May, this is an area on which exploratory work is underway, including under the auspices of the British Irish Council. I am meeting Minister Hendry, my British counterpart later this week to discuss these matters further. It is important to ensure that any inter-governmental agreement entered into delivers economic benefits to the Irish state.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	635	At the beginning of May I launched the report of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT) containing proposals to assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government to have widespread customer access to high-speed broadband available across Ireland.  The Taskforce, which I chaired, comprised the CEOs of all the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.In launching the report I also commenced a public consultation to allow all other interested parties to comment on the document and to offer any additional or alternative proposals.  The public consultation closed in early June and more than 50 responses were received.  My Department is currently considering the responses received and related matters.  Building on the work of the Taskforce and the responses received, it is my intention to bring proposals for a National Broadband Plan to Government shortly with a view to agreeing a comprehensive set of policy actions to underpin the provision of high speed services on a national basis.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	636	The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the Better Energy Programme.  Exchequer funding of €76.146 million has been allocated to the Better Energy Programme in 2012, which is projected to deliver 524GWh in energy savings.  The Better Energy Homes scheme provides financial assistance to householders who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying BER.Since the scheme commenced in March 2009 the SEAI has disbursed over €137.5 million in grants and supported the installation of over 319,000 measures in 126,761 homes.  From the start of the year through to 31 May 2012 the scheme has disbursed over €18.5 million in grants and supported the installation of 45,814 measures in 16,489 homes.  SEAI informs me that there has been a significant decrease in the number of new applications to the scheme, to date in 2012.   The SEAI has prepared an analysis that suggests that there are a number of factors that have impacted upon the level of new applications including milder weather, reduced capital available to homeowners and potentially the reduction in grants.In relation to the reduction in some grant levels, it should be noted that grant applications have decreased across all measures, not just those where the grant support was reduced.  It is also worth noting that applications for Better Energy: Warmer Homes, a free scheme, have decreased along a similar trend over the same period.  I recently approved a reallocation within the Better Energy budget on foot of these trends and have increased the budget for Better Energy: Warmer Homes and Better Energy Workplaces.  This will increase the energy savings achievable from the current allocation, while also providing energy efficiency upgrades to more low-income homes.

I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.The CER, in 2006, approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers.Under the CER's policy framework, Bord Gáis Networks, and latterly Gaslink carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  Under Phase 1 of the review, a total of seventeen towns, including Tuam, were identified as being suitable for connection to the gas network.  The connection of Tuam to the natural gas network is subject to achieving sufficient gas demand in the town.  In relation to Tuam, the CER has been informed that there is the potential for a number of large customers to utilise natural gas in the short to medium term.  I understood that the CER is to make a decision on the matter in the coming weeks in light of updated information from Bord Gáis Networks.

The current allocation in 2010 to the various Boards and Cooperatives was €25.3m while the current allocation in 2012 for Inland Fisheries Ireland was €24.7m. Employment in Inland Fisheries Ireland is currently 326 compared to 399 before the various bodies were abolished.  My Department is currently reviewing the rationalisation proposals for Agencies under its aegis as set out in the Public Service Reform Plan with the objective of addressing them within the required timeframe set out in the Plan.

There has been no change in the matter since then.  As noted at that time the Better Energy Homes programme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and provides grants to homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes through insulation and heating upgrades.  Better Energy Homes is demand-led and open to all homeowners of dwellings built, completed and occupied before 2006.  Homes built from 2006 onwards are legally required to have been constructed to the standards set in the 2003 Building Regulations.  It would not be cost-effective for the taxpayer to provide a financial incentive to homeowners seeking to upgrade their property as the resulting energy savings would be minimal for properties which should be in legal compliance with the Building Regulation Standards.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	641	The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) under the Communications Regulation Act 2002 as amended.  In accordance with its statutory functions, ComReg consulted extensively on its proposals for the release of spectrum rights of use in 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz frequency bands.ComReg received considerable interest in this consultation process which has resulted in the decision document for the award of a number of individual rights of use in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz radio spectrum bands (ComReg Document 12/25 and Decision 04/12 published on 16 March 2012).  ComReg's Information Memorandum for this award process details the processes and procedures ComReg is employing to implement its substantive decisions (ComReg Document 12/52 published on 25 May 2012).The reasons, analysis and other material relied upon by ComReg in support of its decisions on the minimum coverage and roll-out requirements are set out in section 5.5 of Document 12/25.  Amongst other things, ComReg considered that actual coverage levels are expected to exceed this 70% population obligation by a considerable margin, given the competitive nature of the market and the limited risk of roll-back of coverage from the existing levels.  It should be noted that the four existing mobile operators have achieved coverage levels exceeding those set out in their respective licences.  For example, for 3G services, Vodafone's coverage covers 90% of the population, 5% more than its obligation.  Hutchison 3G, better known as "3", covers 96% of the population, 11% more than its obligation.  O2 also covers 90.5% of the population, which is also more than its obligation.ComReg also notes that coverage continues to be an important competitive differentiator.  Any deterioration in coverage by any one network would undermine that network's attractiveness to its existing and potential customers.  The importance of maintaining the existing levels of mobile telephony and mobile broadband coverage has been raised with ComReg by my officials.  While the outcome of the forthcoming multi-band spectrum release process can not be anticipated I understand that ComReg are not anticipating any reduction in coverage as a result of the process.  It is also important to note that ComReg's coverage proposals are designed to facilitate the possible entry of new operators in a manner that would ensure that "cherry picking" of high-density urban areas would not occur.

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) estimated that the additional €30m supported the creation and retention of an extra 2,000 jobs for the duration of 2011 on top of 3,800 jobs supported by the previous allocation.  SEAI also estimate that the additional allocation will ultimately result in total energy savings worth €200m over their lifetime.

My Department provides capital funding for a range of measures to improve the quality and standard of older local authority housing stock, including large-scale regeneration projects, estate-wide remedial works, a retrofitting measure to improve energy efficiency and funding for extensions and adaptation to meet the needs of tenants with a disability, etc.In March, I allocated some €3 million to Donegal County Council under my Department's Social Housing Investment Programme. This included an allocation of €545,000 in respect of works to improve the energy efficiency of older housing stock and €154,022 in respect of necessary adaptations or extensions. All of the available funding under the 2012 Remedial Works Programme was allocated towards meeting contractual commitments on projects approved under the 2009-2012 programme. As there was no such commitment in respect of projects in Donegal, no provision was made for remedial works under the Council's housing allocation for 2012.  I intend to review the operation of the Social Housing Improvement Works Programme, including the remedial works measure, with a view to possible changes aimed at improving the effectiveness of the various measures.

The main aims of the programme are to support the diversification of the rural economy and improve the quality of life in rural areas.  There are 35 Local Action Groups contracted, on my Department's behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding. Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations.  Mainstream activities of a sporting organisation are not eligible for funding under the RDP and the programme does not support operating costs such as salaries. In this context funding for the employment of a Games Promotion Officer for Beann Eadair GAA is not eligible under the LEADER element of the RDP.

Housing maintenance programmes are funded directly by local authorities from their own resources, including from rental income and receipts from the disposal of properties and sales of houses to tenants.Under my Department's Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock, including   the regeneration of large social housing estates and flat complexes, estate wide remedial works schemes, a retrofitting measure to improve the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses and funding for extensions and adaptations to meet the needs of tenants with a disability, etc. Given the constraints on capital budgets for new stock, my Department has in recent years placed a greater emphasis on local authority social housing improvement works programmes and on the early return of vacant units to productive use.This year I allocated some €145 million to local authorities in respect of measures aimed at improving the social housing stock. €90 million of this is being provided in respect of the National Regeneration Programme for the social, economic and physical regeneration of disadvantaged social housing estates in Dublin, Limerick and Cork and in a number of regional towns around the country.€27 million is being provided in respect of some 45 estate-wide remedial works schemes in 26 local authorities with a further €10 million earmarked for extensions and adaptations to properties across all authorities. A total of €18 million is being provided for improving the quality and energy efficiency of older housing stock. Beginning in 2011, my Department required local authorities to focus the energy retrofitting programme on bringing vacant stock back into productive use. The 2012 programme will build on the achievements of 2011 when more than 2,600 vacant units were refurbished and made available for re-letting. While local authorities may undertake work on tenanted properties, there is a continuing focus on making vacant properties available for re-letting as quickly as possible. Grants of up to €15,000 per house are generally available for improving the fabric of the house with a further grant of up to €3,000 where additional essential works are needed. Over the course of 2010 and 2011 a total of 4,492 houses were improved.I intend to review the operation of the Social Housing Improvement Works Programme, including the remedial works and retrofitting measures, with a view to possible changes aimed at improving the effectiveness of the various measures.

My Department currently supports an ambitious programme of regeneration projects which seek to address the causes of disadvantage in communities and large social housing estates through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.  This year, my Department is providing funding of over €40 million to regeneration projects in Dublin city, some €15 million of which is earmarked for projects which were previously included in the City Council's Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme, including Saint Teresa's Gardens.Dublin City Council set up a multi-disciplinary Special Housing Taskforce to examine all options for the furure regeneration of all the estates included in the former PPP programme. My Department is working closely with the Council to advance the proposals which have emerged following consultation and discussions with the Regeneration Boards for the relevant projects.A draft schematic regeneration proposal was developed by the Council, in consultation with the Regeneration Board, for Saint Teresa's Gardens and submitted to my Department in March 2012. This document explores a number of options for the redevelopment of the area. My Department is currently liaising with the Council to further develop these proposals for incorporation into an overall masterplan for the physical, social and economic regeneration of the area. In advance of the completion of a detailed masterplan, my Department approved a programme of social inclusion initiatives for Saint Teresa's Gardens to commence this year.It is now a matter for the City Council, in consultation with the Regeneration Board, to complete the master-planning process and so submit a comprehensive proposal, to include projected multi-annual funding requirements, for the future regeneration of Saint Teresa's Gardens. At that point, I will be happy to engage with the Regeneration Board and the City Council to discuss arrangements for the future funding and implementation of the necessary measures to deliver on the objectives of the masterplan.

In addition, details of Traveller-specific units of accommodation completed from 2002 to 2010 are included in the annual reports of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC), copies of which are also available on my Department’s website and in the Oireachtas Library.  The NTACC report for 2011 is not yet available.My Department does not hold real-time information on the number of households on local authorities' waiting list.  However, a statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities.  The most recent assessment took place in 2011 and details, including information in respect of Travellers, can also be viewed on my Department's website.The current round of Traveller accommodation programmes will run until 2013 and local authorities were requested to carry out a mid-term review of their programmes by 31 December 2011.  The Government remains committed to the provision of Traveller accommodation and significant progress has been made in recent years.  In 1999, prior to the first Traveller Accommodation Programme, the Annual Count of Traveller families estimated that there were a total of 4,790 Traveller families in the State.  Of these 4,790 families, some 1,207 (25.2%) were living on unauthorised sites.  The 2011 Annual Count has shown that despite a large increase in the number of Traveller families to 9,535, the numbers of families on unauthorised sites had fallen to 327 (3.43%).

However, my Department understands that, as a preventative measure, the Department of Education and Skills carried out a risk assessment in the greater Dublin area last year to see if any schools are affected by problems with pyrite.  Of the schools examined, three were identified as showing signs of pyrite damage and that Department is working closely with the three schools involved to deal with the issues.My Department has a limited remit for public buildings and has no knowledge of problems of pyrite in such buildings.  I understand that the independent Pyrite Panel, which I set up in September 2011 and which is due to submit its report to me in the next few weeks, has undertaken some analysis of the extent of the pyrite problem in private housing.  As previously indicated, I intend to publish the report as quickly as possible after receiving and reviewing it.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	652	I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 to 440, inclusive, together.The purpose of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill is to amend existing dormant accounts legislation by providing for the dissolution of the Dormant Accounts Board and to make appropriate arrangements for the transfer of the Board's functions to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Bill, as presented, and without further amendment, will result in those changes.  The objectives underpinning disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund will remain unchanged, namely to assist persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged, educationally disadvantaged or who have a disability.  The intention has always been to ensure that there is a broad and balanced range of potential beneficiaries from dormant accounts disbursements.  I believe that this should continue into the future.Whilst applying the provisions of the dormant accounts legislation to credit union accounts, as recommended by the Dormant Accounts Board, would increase the amount available in the Fund, Government Departments and agencies still have to source monies for dormant accounts programmes and measures from their Exchequer allocations, in the same way as with any other funding programmes.  As such, creating a potential new source of dormant accounts funding would serve little practical purpose at this time.  In the circumstances, my Department has not discussed the Board's proposals with the Commission on Credit Unions.  However, this is a matter I am prepared to keep under review, particularly in the context of any improvement to the budgetary situation.In the interim, I have asked my Department to publish a copy of the briefing document on this matter on my Department's website, in the Dormant Accounts area folder, as I understand that, due to technical difficulties, the Board's own website is not operational.

In October 2011, Fingal County Council identified nine potential land parcels in the northern part of the greater Dublin area within which a proposed regional waste water treatment plant could potentially be located, along with a marine outfall and an orbital drainage system.These nine land parcels were then assessed as potential locations in which to site the regional waste water treatment plant.  The routes for the orbital drainage system and the marine outfall pipe locations were also assessed.  Of these nine land parcels, three sites have now been identified by the Council as emerging preferred site options.  I understand that the Clonshaugh site is one of these three sites.  An eight week non-statutory public consultation period to assess these sites commenced on Monday, 14 May 2012, and runs until 6 July 2012.  As part of this process, four open days are being arranged by the Council where the public can meet with the project team to discuss the report.A final preferred option will only be chosen by the Council when this consultation process is completed.  The preferred site option will then have to undergo statutory planning processes and I do not propose to prejudice those processes by commenting on the Clonshaugh option at this time.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	656	The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.Under section 5(1) of the Act, the owner of a residential property, who on a liability date, is liable to pay a household charge to a relevant local authority, or who is entitled to a waiver from payment of a household charge under section 4(4), must make and provide to the relevant local authority a declaration stating that he or she is so liable or so entitled, as the case may be.  Under section 5(2) of the Act, the declaration must, in the case of a person who is liable to pay a household charge, be accompanied by payment of the household charge in respect of the property concerned.The Act further provides for offences where a person contravenes these statutory requirements.  In addition, late payment penalties apply where payment is not made by 31 March, 2012 and household charges and late payment penalties are a charge against the property which will have to be discharged in the event of the sale or transfer of the property concerned.Section 12 of the Act places collection of the charge under the care and management of local authorities.  It is therefore a matter for each individual local authority to utilise the provisions of the legislation, including data sharing with the Electricity Supply Board, Private Residential Tenancies Board, Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, in the context of any undeclared properties that may be identified.The legislation empowers local authorities to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for an offence under the Act and local authorities will pursue those who may have a liability and initiate court proceedings where it is considered appropriate.

The legislation does not specify the type of security required.However, guidance issued to planning authorities stresses that, in the case of residential development, planning conditions must require the giving of sufficient security prior to commencement of development, and that the authorities must ensure that they are in a position to draw down the security in cases where a developer fails to satisfactorily complete a residential development, or a phase of a development, within the specified period.Section 35 of the Planning and Development Acts allows a local authority to refuse planning permission to an individual where a previous permission has not been complied with.

In the period following the making of the Polling Day Order, it is a matter for the returning officer to consider the need for advance polling on islands.  The returning officer is empowered to take the poll on an island on any day during the 5 day period before polling day and is required to give public notice in any polling district concerned.My Department has suggested, in guidance that issues to returning officers when elections and referendums are being held, that the statutory provisions permitting advance polling on islands should not be used as a matter of course.  They should only be used where the returning officer is of the opinion that weather or transport difficulties warrant it.  While electoral law is kept under review, I have no proposals to amend the law that facilitates advance polling on islands.On postal voting, it is open to people registered to vote on islands who, because of their occupation service or employment, are unlikely to be in a position to go in person to vote on polling day to apply to their registration authority for inclusion in the postal voters list or the supplement to that list.  I am aware, however, that in certain limited circumstances the short time frame available for making an application for inclusion in the supplement to the postal voters list could give rise to difficulties for island voters.  I will give consideration to how arrangements in relation to inclusion in the supplement to the postal voters lists can be improved in the context of the next suitable electoral amendment Bill.

The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property which is situated in the State to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance.  Application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the courts.The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 is premised on a universal liability for residential property in respect of the charge, but exempts certain buildings and owners from this liability, the most important exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence.Section 2 of the Act provides that residential property means a building that is situated in the State and that is occupied, or suitable for occupation, as a separate dwelling, whether or not the occupier shares, or would be entitled to share, in connection therewith, any accommodation, amenity or facility with any other person, and includes a house, maisonette, flat or apartment (including the form of accommodation commonly known as a bedsit).  The household charge is payable in respect of each unit of accommodation that is occupied, or suitable for occupation, as a separate dwelling.

Progress, in the context of the legal "winding up" process, is currently ongoing.In the context of the delivery of Axes 3 and 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme in Irish language areas for the remainder of the programme period, my Department requested expressions of interest to deliver the programme in these areas in March 2012.  The submissions received are being examined with a view to determining the competent bodies to deliver the RDP going forward in all Gaeltacht areas including the Gaeltacht areas of North Mayo.  I envisage this process will be completed shortly.Local Action Groups in contiguous geographical areas have been engaged to implement an interim system to facilitate grant payment to projects that were at an advanced stage of development.  Many of these project files have now been sent to the relevant Local Action Groups who are contacting the promoters directly to facilitate payment going forward.  Such payments are still subject to the rules and regulations that govern the RDP and it is the responsibility of the relevant Local Action Group to ensure that all payments are fully compliant before they are issued.  Neither my Department nor individual Local Action Groups are in a position to establish an emergency fund; however both my Department and each relevant Local Action Group is working towards issuing these payments as soon as possible.

However, my Department has been working very closely with the Department of Health to address the overall housing needs of people with disabilities and, in particular, in the context of the development of the Government's National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability, 2011-2016, which was jointly published by both Departments in October 2011.The Strategy, which sets out a framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities through mainstream housing policy, will be supported by an Implementation Framework which is expected to be published by end June 2012.  The Implementation Framework will address, inter alia, the needs of people with physical disabilities, including through proposals in relation to lifetime housing policy, the accessibility needs of wheelchair users and supports for physical adaptations to make housing accessible.  The Framework will be subject to a robust monitoring regime and I will ensure that the specific housing and related support needs of thalidomide survivors are kept under review in this regard.

The units being advanced through NAMA will in general be provided through the Social Housing Leasing Initiative under the standard terms and conditions that apply.To date over 2,000 units have been examined with a view to determining their suitability for social housing having regard to local demand, the nature of the accommodation and sustainable community principles.  Of the original number, 697 have been deemed unsuitable by housing authorities and a further 344 have been withdrawn, usually by property owners as circumstances have changed.  At present demand has been confirmed for over 1,000 available units and these are currently being processed.  Discussion and negotiation has commenced in respect of nearly 700 properties involving approved housing bodies, local authorities, the property owners, financial institutions, receivers and other relevant parties.

In these cases, de-tenanting will generally be necessary in order to facilitate the demolition and reconstruction phases of projects.Funding is provided by my Department to support a range of permanent and temporary housing options for affected tenants, including the purchase of houses and apartments, the upgrading of existing vacant housing units to provide interim accommodation or the short-term leasing of properties under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.It is the responsibility of the relevant local authority to draw up, in consultation with tenants and the local community, a detailed regeneration masterplan for the area in question. De-tenanting and relocation strategies are an integral part of the masterplan and should set out, inter alia, how the physical regeneration plan will be implemented and how tenants will be accommodated during the demolition and construction phases of the project.  De-tenanting and relocation implementation plans are project-specific and compiled in consultation with relevant stakeholders including tenants and the local community. In considering projects for funding approval, my Department is mindful of the need to ensure that de-tenanting strategies are appropriate and well-managed and that, as far as possible, households are not further disadvantaged through unsatisfactory implementation of agreed strategies.

The five-year term of office of the Limerick Regeneration Agencies ended on 14 June with responsibility for the management and administration of the regeneration programme transferring to the new Limerick Office for Regeneration.  The focus in 2012 is on transitioning from the planning, preparatory relocation and demolition works within estates to construction of new houses and apartments and the refurbishment of existing homes.Some 33 housing units are nearing completion at Clíona Park.  Contracts have been agreed and construction will shortly commence on 29 new units at Vises Court and 35 units at Southill.  It is intended to acquire 10 almost-completed units and 10 sites at Wallers Well.  Planning permission is awaited in respect of around 80 new housing units at Lord Edward Street.  Once planning approval is secured, it is intended to commence the tender process as quickly as possible with a view to having a contract in place by end 2012.  Small infill developments are being progressed through the planning stages for new houses at a number of locations around Kings Island.

The Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board are already merged, in an operational sense, with a common board, pending the establishment of the merged body — the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) — on a statutory basis.  The LGMA will also take on the residual functions from An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, which will be dissolved.The Fire Services Council's term of office expired on 30 June, 2009. The work of the Council was absorbed into the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management within the Department.The Limerick Regeneration Agencies will be dissolved and their functions taken over by the new Office for Regeneration which has been established in Limerick City.  The Regeneration Office has initially been set up with administrative support from Limerick City Council but will report directly to the Manager Designate of the new Limerick Unitary Authority once appointed.The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (HSCA) has been established and is operating on an administrative basis. It rationalises the functions of the National Building Agency (NBA), the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) and the Centre for Housing Research (CHR).  The AHP and the CHR have been closed down and the NBA ceased operating in June 2011.Comhar (Sustainable Development Council) was discontinued at the end of 2011 and its sustainable development role has been integrated into the work of the National Economic and Social Council (NESC).The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2011 proposes to amend existing dormant accounts legislation so as to dissolve the Dormant Accounts Board and transfer the statutory functions of the Board to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It has passed all stages in the Seanad and is currently at Report and Final Stage in the Dáil and is scheduled for early July 2012.The operations of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) will be wound up over the next eighteen months. Under its recently appointed new Board, this transitional period will allow the Authority to progress elements of on-going work and to make the necessary preparations for the migration to new arrangements, to be decided by the Government.At the end of March 2012, the total staff number employed by State agencies under my Department's aegis was 782.9 whole time equivalents (WTE), a reduction of 168 WTE (18%) as compared to 951 at end 2008.  The payroll savings associated with these staff reductions are estimated to be of the order of €9.74m.The LGMA is financed by way of a levy on local authorities which reduced from €13.9m in 2008 to €11.4m in 2011, a reduction of €2.5m (18%).  The new library unit in the LGMA, to replace An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, will operate with five staff while An Chomhairle had an original staff complement of eighteen.  The dissolution of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna could provide a once-off windfall to the State through the disposal of their Dublin city-centre headquarter buildings.The NBA headquarters was sold in March 2012 for €2.84 million.

Consideration was given, as part of  review of this Programme in 2011, to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme, in line with the  original priorities set out for the Programme for this cycle of investment.  As a result of this review, a proposal for works under the Ennis Town Water Augmentation Scheme and the Newmarket-on-Fergus Water Supply Scheme were added to the programme in 2011, as a contract to start and a scheme to advance through  planning respectively during the programme period.  The Programme now includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of almost €42 million in County Clare during the period of the Programme.The Programme prioritises projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Clare County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time.The Broadford and Carrigaholt Sewerage Schemes were not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.  While Clare County Council submitted a proposal to have the Carrigaholt Sewerage Scheme included in the current programme, as part of the review process in 2011,  there had been no change in circumstances since 2009 such as to alter the priority attached to the scheme.  Consequently it has not been possible to include Carrigaholt Sewerage Scheme in the current Programme.

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/ or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.

In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have exhibited admirable forbearance over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central bank's first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, will present borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. It should be noted that local authorities had been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines will standardise the approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure to this area and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.It is expected that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve to simultaneously resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers.  It is anticipated that this updated guidance will issue within the coming weeks.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	685	The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences. The charge is set at €200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  As of 18 June 2012, 185,031 accounts have been registered for the charge for 2011 in respect of 328,802 properties.  The charge on non-principal private residences is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability.  It is the responsibility of local authorities to pursue cases of non-compliance.

I have no function in the operational matters of the PRTB which is an independent statutory body established under the Residential Tenancies Act.  The PRTB publishes tenancy registrations statistics in its Annual Reports which are available on its websitewww.prtb.ie and the most recent report relates to 2010. Copies of the PRTB Annual Reports are also available in the Oireachtas library. The website also contains the published register of tenancies maintained by the PRTB.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	687	I propose to take Questions Nos. 487 and 488 together.Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 provides for a statutory target, currently set at 3%, for the employment of people with disabilities in the public sector. Part 5 also provides a framework for monitoring the employment target in all public bodies by committees under the aegis of relevant Ministers of the Government. Under the Act, public bodies are required by 31 March each year to submit reports to monitoring committees on their compliance with the target; the monitoring committees are required to report on such compliance by 30 June each year to the relevant Minister and the National Disability Authority (NDA).  The Department of Finance is responsible for monitoring the target in relation to all Government Departments and public bodies whose staff are civil servants. In the case of other public bodies the target is monitored by the parent Department.The NDA has the overall monitoring and reporting role under the Act.  The most recent NDA Report, published in 2011 and based on 2010 data, indicates that the requirement to report was fulfilled by all public bodies; all Government Departments exceeded the 3% target; and the proportion of staff with disabilities reported across the public service as a whole was 2.7%. The total number of people employed in the public service who disclosed a disability was 5,748.  Reports on compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 on the employment of people with disabilities in the public sector for 2006 to 2010 inclusive can be found on the NDA website,www.nda.ie.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	688	The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers through the policy of direct provision.  For the most part, this represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation and certain other services on a full board basis. I am satisfied that the level of service and support provided to asylum seekers by the State through the direct provision structure caters for all needs. The direct provision system is an effective and cost efficient way to ensure that the State can meet its obligations towards asylum seekers. A Value For Money study published in May 2010 on the direct provision system found that while the system is expensive, the alternative system for accommodating asylum seekers via the private rented sector with welfare payments would be close to twice as expensive. In view of the very substantial additional expenditure that would be incurred in moving to an alternative system, I have no plans at present to change the current system.My priority is to reform the asylum determination process to deal more speedily with asylum and protection claims thereby reducing the length of time asylum seekers spend in direct provision accommodation centres. As previously outlined to the House, I intend to re-introduce the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010 later this year which will comprehensively reform and simplify the current refugee status determination process by the introduction of a single procedure system.I have no plans to institute a system of granting leave to remain along the lines suggested by the Deputy. I should point out that at EU level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008, made specific commitments "to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons".   While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among the Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would grant leave to remain to a group of migrants without first examining the merits of each individual case.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	689	I propose to take Questions Nos. 490 and 491 together.The Deputy may know applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) both of which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality on whether such status should be granted.  The number of asylum seekers with cases pending in the asylum process at 31 May, 2012 was eight hundred. Sixty six of these cases, which are currently at appeal stage, have been in the asylum process for five years or more.The Deputy might wish to know that the median processing time for asylum decisions in 2012 is 8 months. Clearly, some cases do take longer to complete, with delays arising for medical reasons or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.  For the sake of completeness, I should also state that failed asylum seekers enter what is commonly referred to as the "leave to remain" process, where applications for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) are examined.  This process is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	690	I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that in the period 2008 to 2011, approximately 92,000 naturalisation applications were received of which some 56,000 were deemed to be valid. So far this year, 7,800 valid applications have been received. The number of applications approved for the years in question and in 2012 to date was approximately 42,400 with 7,900* being refused over the same period.   The number of applications currently being processed to decision stage is 18,000.The steps I initiated to deal with the backlog of citizenship applications which stood at 22,000 when the Government came into office are proving very successful. I have made decisions on almost on almost 28,000 applications since March 2011, including more than 13,800 so far this year. The backlog has been substantially dealt with and it is expected that significant inroads will be made with the remaining cases by year end. From this month on the generality of new applications being received will be processed within six months.The Deputy will also be aware that in June 2011 I introduced formal citizenship ceremonies for the first time since the foundation of the State. The ceremonies which are being met with universal approval allow candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion. To date, 51 such ceremonies have been held at which almost 15,000 candidates have become Irish citizens under the new procedures.*It should be noted that 4,000 of the applications refused relate to 2009. These applications, which did not meet the statutory criteria, had been lodged by one section of the migrant community on the basis of inaccurate and misleading information circulated within their community regarding their entitlement to Irish citizenship. In the normal course, the refusal rate when compared to the valid application rate is of the order of between 1% and 10%.

Accordingly, it is for that Office to decide on the future of these properties and I do not have a role in relation to the matter.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	692	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 422 for written answer on 13 March last.  At this point, I am not in a position to pre-empt the findings of the Inter-Departmental Committee.  However, the Government will decide what further action is appropriate when it has received and considered their report.Reply to Parliamentary Question No.422 for written answer on 13 March, 2012The Deputy will be aware that the Government  considered the circumstances of women and girls who resided in the Laundries at its meeting on 14 June, 2011.  As a first step, the Government decided that it was essential to fully establish the true facts and circumstances relating to the Magdalen Laundries and a number of actions were agreed.  This included the setting up of an Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries, to clarify any State interaction, and to produce a narrative detailing such interaction.  The Committee, under the independent chairmanship of Senator Martin McAleese, is making good progress and their final report is expected mid year.  I welcome the progress that is being made and, in particular, I am pleased to tell the House that the Committee is continuing to  receive full co-operation from all concerned including the religious orders and representative groups of women who were formerly resident in the laundries.In addition Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, Equality, Mental Health and Older People, Kathleen Lynch T.D. and I met with the religious congregations and the groups representing former residents of the Magdalene Institutions to discuss a number of issues.  One of these was the question of facilitating a restorative and reconciliation process between individuals who had been in such institutions and the religious congregation responsible for the running of the institution.  I am conscious of the need to progress matters as quickly as possible.  However, it is also important to emphasise that we are in a process which is seeking to fully establish the facts and it is still too early at this stage to predict what the outcomes might be.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I can inform the Deputy that the Property Services Regulatory Authority was formally established on 3 April 2012 pursuant to the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011.  The Authority consists of a Chairperson and ten ordinary members.  The primary purpose of the Authority is to set and enforce standards in the provision of property services by auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents and to provide redress mechanisms for consumers of those services.  The Authority will also have statutory responsibility for the publication of residential property sales prices and the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database.One of the main statutory functions of the Property Services Regulatory Authority is the licensing of property service providers, i.e. auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents.  It will take over the licensing of auctioneers and letting agents from the District Court and the Revenue Commissioners and also licence for the first time, property management agents, with effect from 6 July, 2012.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	696	Applications for transfer to an alternate facility within the prison estate are received primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons.  The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a request.  As a guiding principle, the Irish Prison Service attempts to place prisoners in the location nearest to their family home.  This principle is of course subject to appropriate security considerations, operational and legislative requirements.  Factors taken into account include length of sentence, nature of offence, medical needs, drug dependency, conflict with other prisoners, behaviour while in custody, the age of the prisoner, previous criminal record, engagement with the various services and of course available spaces.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	701	The Deputy will be aware that, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service and I have no role in the matter.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics.  In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that statistics are not maintained on the number of learner drivers summoned in respect of a second offence of driving unaccompanied as there is no separate charge of that nature under the legislation.Road traffic legislation, which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, provides that a learner driver must be accompanied at all times and the offence is for a learner driver to drive a vehicle while unaccompanied by a holder of a full licence.  The penalty which can be imposed under the Road Traffic Acts is tiered depending on whether it is a first offence or second or third subsequent offence.  Information regarding whether there were previous offences would be conveyed to the court by the Gardaí and the court is, subject only to the constitution and the law, independent in matters of sentencing.The Deputy may recall that I provided statistics, as set out below, in relation to learner drivers driving unaccompanied by a qualified driver in response to his question on 15 May 2012.YearSummonsedConvictedAverage fineMaximum Fine20092,751446€150.38No20103,447718€156.41No20113,150854€149.70No
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	702	Prior to enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, bodies representing the mixed trading sector proposed implementation of a voluntary code of practice with an independent audit and oversight mechanism as an alternative to section 9 of the Act.  Such a code was subsequently drawn up and agreed between the mixed trading sector and the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  A new body — Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland Ltd (RRAI) — was established by the mixed trading sector to oversee implementation and Mr. Padraic White was appointed as its independent Chairperson.  On receipt of Mr. White's third Compliance Report on the RRAI Code in October last, I launched a public consultation process inviting views on the Report and, more generally, on the voluntary approach to implementing structural separation of alcohol products in such premises.Arising from the consultation process, I am not in favour of retaining the voluntary RRAI Code.  The choice, therefore, lies between implementation of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 or implementation of a statutory code of practice under section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for my proposals in relation to future arrangements for the display and sale of alcohol products in mixed trading outlets in the coming weeks.The position regarding section 16 of the 2008 Act is that draft regulations to restrict certain alcohol promotions have been drawn up but have not been made to date pending agreement on a joint North/South approach to restricting such promotions.  During discussions earlier this year with the Minister for Social Development in Northern Ireland, Nelson McCausland, MLA, we reached agreement on the need to develop a joint North/South approach to restricting such promotions and on the desirability of having the necessary arrangements in place by the end of this year.

The data sought is currently being collated by An Garda Síochána and all available information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is to hand.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I am aware of reports in the media that, in the context of the reform of defamation law in the UK, the Secretary of State for Justice is considering the introduction of measures to require the operators of websites to respond effectively to claims by persons that they had been defamed by postings on websites.  The law on defamation in this State was comprehensively reformed in the Defamation Act 2009.  There is no distinction should defamation occur on-line, in print or broadcast.  In a legal action, a website host would be required to divulge details of a subscriber. I am not of the view that amendments to the law are required, but I will keep the matter under review.  I should also point out that where harassment might occur in an on-line context, that such behaviour is a criminal offence and subject to be dealt with under Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.I should mention that the E Commerce Directive (Council Directive (EC) 2000/31), which comes within the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, sets down a number of provisions regarding the duties and obligations of website providers, including to remove potentially defamatory material when notified.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	705	The visa applications referred to by the Deputy were received in the Visa Office, Dublin on the 18 April 2012.  Following full consideration it was the decision of the visa officer not to grant the visas sought for a range of reasons.  Evidence provided in relation to finances was deemed insufficient or incomplete.  No evidence of finances or income was supplied.  Insufficient documentation was submitted in support of the application.  The visa officer noted that the applicant had not provided evidence of travel medical insurance, copy of her marriage cert, evidence of other family members in her home country, e.g. copy of birth certs of other children, copy of Family Registration Certificate, no evidence of utility bill.  Further the applicant had not provided evidence of previous travel history to State.The applicant's obligations to return to home country were not shown — e.g. no social, economic or professional ties in her home country were shown.  The visa officer was also of the opinion that the applicant may branch into the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK, that the applicant may overstay following proposed visit and may work illegally in the State.  The application was also refused as the potential cost of the trip was high in comparison to the applicant's means, and given that no compelling reasons for the trip have been displayed, the visa officer was not satisfied of her intentions to leave the State following her visit.  Also, no clear link to the applicant's reference in Ireland had been shown.It is open to the persons concerned to appeal the decision of the Visa Officer within two months of the date of refusal, in this case before the 11th August, 2012.  Where doing so they should be in a position to address the above referred to concerns of the Visa Office, Dublin.  Guidelines on the appeals process can be found on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).Queries in relation to general immigration matters may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	706	There is no record in my Department of any submission or representation from this organisation along the lines outlined in the Deputy's question.  The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for over 19,000 organisations in Ireland who are registered with the Gardaí for this purpose and which employ/engage persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum period of time to complete. The current average processing time at the GCVU is 3 weeks approximately.  This is, in my view, within acceptable limits.  Seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can, however, result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of these processing times, and the possible need for additional information to be provided in some cases, in their recruitment and selection processes.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the organisation referred to in the Deputy's question is registered with the GCVU for the purpose of vetting in respect of employees/volunteers.In relation to the question of transferability of a vetting disclosure, the position is that Garda vetting certificates are issued to specified registered organisations in respect of a particular post or employment in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  The Garda Vetting certificate is non-transferable.  It is important to emphasise that it is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  As non-transferability protects against the risk of fraud or forgery of such certificates and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting system, there are no plans to amend current procedures.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I wish to inform the Deputy that given their very nature the organisations referred to, unlike my Department's agencies, do not come under the remit of my Department.  Consequently, my Department does not keep and I am unable to provide the information requested by the Deputy.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	708	In developing proposals for a Family Law Bill to meet the commitment in the Programme for Government to modernise and reform aspects of family law, my Department is reviewing the operation of thein camera rule in family law cases.  Interested parties will be consulted in the matter. In relation to the Bill generally, proposals are being advanced as quickly as possible, subject to the disposal of other priorities.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	709	The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and I have no function in that matter.  This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	710	The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal.  On 10 June 2012, there were 5,120 persons being accommodated in 37 centres across the State.  Details of the numbers accommodated on a centre-by-centre basis  in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are provided in the monthly statistical reports which can be found on the RIA website atwww.ria.gov.ie.In relation to the costs, RIA's Annual Reports for the years 2007 to 2011 inclusive are published to the RIA website.  These reports include details of spending for those years, showing total payments for contracts in respect of State owned, commercial and self-catering centres; for transport costs; for utility costs in State-owned centres; and for miscellaneous payments.  As explained in replies to previous Dáil Questions, it is not in the interest of the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are known to the public or to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with RIA.  Therefore, details of current contract rates are not provided.  The policy is that the updating of the table of contracts will take place only at the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously, e.g. at the end of January, 2012 the records are updated to end of December 2009.   This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner.  For the information of the Deputy I should point out that a Value For Money study published in May 2010 on the direct provision system found that while the system is expensive the alternative system for accommodating asylum seekers via the private rented sector with welfare payments would be close to twice as expensive.In relation to any commercially owned asylum accommodation centre ‘being in' the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), this is not relevant to RIA.  In fulfilling its general accommodation responsibilities, RIA does not own, lease or rent premises from commercial contractors.  Rather, it ‘contracts-in' a comprehensive range of services and facilities, which include accommodation, housekeeping etc., for a fixed sum over the period of the contract.  It is a condition of the contract with RIA that the contractor has good title to the centre but this does not specify either owning, or renting or leasing the building concerned.  The finance mechanism, loans or otherwise, used by the contractor for the provision of the service to RIA is a matter solely for the contractor.In relation to the general issue of whether NAMA can divulge details of property that it may hold as security or where an enforcement action has been taken by NAMA on that property, these issues are addressed on its website —www.nama.ie.

The key objective of the station closures is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure specific cash savings.  In this context the Commissioner has concluded that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the frontline if these particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  There are no plans to review those decisions.

Their asylum applications were considered by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both bodies concluded that the persons concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as refugees.Arising from the refusal of their respective asylum applications, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned and his family were notified, by  letters, that the then Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against them.  In addition, they were notified of their respective entitlements to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.The persons concerned submitted applications for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of these applications has been completed, the persons concerned will be notified in writing of the outcomes.  In the event that the applications for Subsidiary Protection are refused, the position in the State of the persons concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before final decisions are made.  Once decisions have been made, these decisions and the consequences of the decisions will be conveyed in writing to the persons concerned.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.

Any proposals for the closure of Garda stations or the altering of Regional or Divisional boundaries must be set out in the plan. The Policing Plan for 2013 has not yet been prepared and therefore it is not possible to say at this stage what it may contain although I expect that it will contain measures to address the ongoing issue of rationalisation of the Garda station network.

This is a very lengthy and complex Bill from a legal standpoint, with proposed provisions which do not currently exist in Irish law. While it was hoped that the Bill would be published by 30 April, work on its development is still proceeding in the context of the many submissions received on the Bill which include, the report of the Joint Oireachtas Justice Committee received in early March following their completion of hearings on the Bill.I can assure the Deputy that the Bill remains a legislative priority for the Government and the revised time frame for publication of the Bill is now the end of June with the strong intention to commence Second stage in the Dáil prior to the Summer recess to facilitate early passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas in the Autumn session.

Copies of each year's annual report are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.In the report for 2011, for example, which was published last week, this analysis gives details of the "allegation location", this being the physical place where the interaction giving rise to the allegation occurred, including Garda stations (and this is further broken down to distinguish between persons in Garda custody and persons in Garda stations who are not in custody).  The 2011 report shows that 22% of allegations arose from Garda custody, and a further 6% from Garda stations where the person concerned was not in custody.The analysis also details the different types of complaint under a number of headings, such as abuse of authority, neglect of duty, discourtesy and so on.  However, I understand that the precise statistical breakdown sought by the Deputy, cross-referencing specific types of complaint with specific Garda stations, is not readily available from the Ombudsman Commission's database (and is not available in respect of the previous Garda Complaints Board).

That legislation, which was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed into law on 19th December 2011, provided for the application of decreases in pay, which had already been applied to other public sector employees, to serving members of the judiciary.  Those changes came into effect from 1 January 2012.

In any event the Deputy will have an opportunity to raise this matter during the debate on the Bill when it comes before the House in the very near future.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	720	I propose to take Questions Nos. 522 and 523 together.Recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) is ongoing but limited due to resource constraints. The current budgetary provision provides for approximately 30,000 paid training mandays. In 2011 and 2012, I sanctioned paid training mandays to include support for the training of new recruits to the RDF. This was sufficient to train approximately 400 recruits during 2011 and 2012. The military authorities manage recruitment in this context. The numbers actually enlisted in any one year may not reflect the numbers of recruits trained in that year. In 2011 there were a total of 267 reservists enlisted and up to the end of May 2012 there have been a total of 85 enlistments to the RDF.In October 2011 I agreed to sanction limited promotions within the RDF to bring the current strength in all ranks to 70% of the established strength in each rank as provided for in Defence Force Regulations CS 4. In the case of promotions from Private to Corporal, the sanction provided that promotions could be made which brought the strength to 60% of the established strength as provided for in Defence Force Regulations CS 4. I also indicated that any ranks where the strength was at or above 70% (or 60% in the case of Corporal Rank) would not be considered for promotion. In considering the issue of promotions for the RDF I was mindful of the fact that a Value for Money Review of the Reserve is ongoing. Additionally I had to have regard to the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which was underway at the time and which placed a requirement on Government Departments to identify opportunities for savings across all aspects of business. The position agreed by me in October last remains in place.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	721	There were on average twenty one members of the public visiting the Archives per week in 2011. The Archive also received on average sixty phone calls and thirty five letters and emails per week in 2011. Following the launch of the websitewww.militaryarchives.ie in December 2011 the average number of emails has more than doubled while there has been a 30-40% increase in phone calls. The average number of visitors per week has also increased to twenty seven.  In addition to the use by the public there are on average 35 written queries per week from military personnel.    It is expected that the coming twelve months will see a further increase in the workload of the Archive staff as 2013 marks the 100th anniversary of the Irish Volunteers.  The current workload also includes the transfer and cataloguing of collections from various military sources along with answering queries from the public and military users. Members of the public may arrange access to the archives by a system of prior appointment. This is necessary due to limitations on available space. In order to make an appointment, interested members of the public should contact the Officer-in-Charge, Military Archives, Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines, Dublin 6 at telephone number (01) 8046457. These contact details are also available on the Defence Forces website atwww.militaryarchives.ie.The Visitor Centre which is located in Cathal Brugha Barracks was opened in May 2011. The Centre is dedicated to the memory of Francis Sheehy Skeffington, Thomas Dickson and Patrick McIntyre, newspaper editors and pacifists, who were arrested by the British Forces and executed without trial in the guardroom exercise yard on April 26th 1916.  The Centre is currently open to the public on Tuesday and Thursday. In relation to opening hours at both the Archives and the Visitor Centre, it is felt that week end opening could not be facilitated without compromising the quality of service currently being offered.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	722	A Value for Money Review (VFM) of the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing and the recommendations arising from this review will inform future plans for the Reserve.  The Steering Committee met most recently on the 6th   June last, and drafting of the Review is continuing.  I have asked the Steering Committee to progress the Review as quickly as possible and I anticipate its completion by the end of September.  Training in the Reserve is both paid and unpaid.  Paid training is provided for both existing members and new recruits.  The number of new recruits that can be attested is linked to the level of funding available for paid training.There have been significant reductions in Defence funding over recent years and paid mandays for members of the Reserve reduced from approximately 60,000 mandays in 2009 to 30,000 mandays in 2010.  This level of paid training has been retained despite further reductions in the Defence Vote in 2011 and 2012. These 30,000 paid mandays can provide training for existing members of the Reserve and support training for approximately 400 recruits during 2012.  Further recruitment will be informed by recommendations arising from the Value for Money Review and the prioritisation of resources.

Whilst these aircraft are primarily used for the MATS, from time to time they are also assigned a range of military and other taskings including Air Ambulance missions, humanitarian operations and support for Search and Rescue, Mountain Rescue and Pollution Control operations. Whilst usage details in relation to the MATS are provided, for operational and security reasons details regarding military use of Air Corps aircraft are generally not disclosed.  I can, however, confirm that training flights are undertaken on all Air Corps aircraft from time to time.   Details of the flight hours undertaken in providing Ministerial air transport for 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 are set out in the tabular statement:YearTotal MATS Flying hours2007544.002008744.172009499.602010361.742011210.92The Learjet 45 has the capacity to carry 7 passengers and is tasked with short and medium haul missions to the UK and Europe. The Gulfstream IV, has the capacity to carry 14 passengers and can be tasked with long haul missions to destinations such as the United States, Africa and the Middle East, as well as to European destinations.  The number of passengers varies on each individual mission flown. Also, the Beechcraft was used as a backup aircraft for short and medium haul MATS flights until the aircraft was taken out of service in early 2009.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	724	The Price Waterhouse Review of the Defence Forces was completed in 1994. It set out a range of options for the organisation of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) at differing strength levels.  This did not include an option for a Permanent Defence Force strength of 9,500 personnel.    Following the Price Waterhouse Review and the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan (1996), a three brigade structure was introduced for the Army within a reduced PDF strength ceiling of approximately 11,500. A three brigade structure was retained when the strength ceiling of the PDF was further reduced to 10,500 as part of the White Paper on Defence (2000).Arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, the Government reduced the strength ceiling of the PDF to 9,500 personnel. In response to this reduced strength ceiling, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces, both permanent and reserve. A three Brigade structure is no longer viable within a strength ceiling of 9,500 and the number of Army Brigades will be reduced from three to two.  This re-organisation will ensure that, within the strength level of 9,500 PDF personnel, the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force is prioritised.  A reduction in the number of Army Brigades will bolster the availability of operational personnel by reducing the numbers of military personnel assigned to administrative and support functions.I tasked the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence to bring forward detailed proposals for my consideration.  I am relying on this work to inform decisions regarding the re-organisation, not the 1994 Price Waterhouse Review.  The Representative Associations and other relevant stakeholders will be consulted on matters that fall within their remit when this work is complete.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	726	The bodies under the aegis of my Department are the Army Pensions Board, the Civil Defence Board and the Board of Coiste an Asgard.    In July 2011, the Government approved a proposal to begin drafting legislation to transfer the functions of the Civil Defence Board back into the Department of Defence. The Heads of the Civil Defence (Repeal) Bill were subsequently agreed by Government and the Bill is currently being drafted.If enacted, the Bill will repeal the Civil Defence Act, 2002, dissolve the Civil Defence Board and transfer its functions, property rights, liabilities and other responsibilities to the Department of Defence. Such changes will not have any impact on Civil Defence operations nationally and Civil Defence will continue to operate from Roscrea as a Branch of the Department. The transfer of the functions of the Civil Defence Board back into the Department of Defence is expected to realise savings in running costs of approximately €60,000 per annum.Coiste an Asgard was the company set up to manage the National Sail Training Scheme. In September 2008, the company's sail training vessel ‘Asgard II' sank in the Bay of Biscay. In December 2009, the previous Government announced that the National Sail Training Scheme was to be discontinued and the funding for 2010 was cancelled. Up to and including 2009, the company had been receiving funding from the National Lottery of approximately €800,000 per annum.The Company has been inactive since and there are no crew or staff left on the payroll. The winding-up process is well advanced and it is anticipated that the company will be in a position to close by the end of this year, following a final audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There are no plans to merge or abolish the Army Pensions Board.

From the remove of 2012 it is very hard to imagine the difficult decisions that people made when they consciously decided to leave Ireland to fight with the allied forces during the course of World War II. Despite the level of anti-British feeling that without doubt existed, over the period of World War II an estimated 60,000 individually motivated citizens from the 26 counties left these shores to serve as volunteers in the British Armed Forces. The value and importance of the contribution of these individuals to the Allied victory is without doubt.  The apology that I made last week on behalf of the Government, was specifically related to the manner in which those members of the Defence Forces, who deserted to fight on the Allied side during World War II, were treated after the War by the State.In relation to wider commemoration, the National Day of Commemoration, which is held annually, honours all those Irishmen and Irishwomen who died in past wars or on service with the United Nations. The ceremony is attended by the President, the Taoiseach and representatives of the Government; members of Dáil and Seanad Éireann; the Council of State; the Diplomatic Corps; the Judiciary; Relatives of the 1916 Leaders and Northern Ireland Representatives; the next-of-kin of those who died in past wars or on UN service and a wide cross-section of the community including ex-servicemen's organizations are also invited to attend. Since 2011, in addition to the main ceremony, a further six events are held in the regions. I am not aware of nor have I any plans for further commemorative events in this regard.

Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check of all applications, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue. This process is under way with a view to commencing payments shortly. In the event of any queries arising from these checks my Department will be in direct contact with the person named.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	729	It is not proposed to limit the height of trees in legislation.  All afforestation projects must obtain the prior approval of this Department.  Before any afforestation project is granted approval, the Department undertakes an assessment of the project, examining both the suitability of the site to grow trees and any environmental issues.  If a proposed afforestation project is located on land that is suitable for growing trees, and if the planting of trees is unlikely to have an adverse effect on the environment or landscape, the application will normally be granted approval.  A number of standard conditions apply to all afforestation projects approved by this Department.  In the case of a plantation that is close to existing housing, an exclusion zone of 60 metres would apply from the dwelling within which no trees may be planted.  The purpose of this is to minimise the impact of the forest on the dwelling and to ensure adequate light.Forests should be planned and managed in a way which enhances the landscape and to this end the Department operates within guidelines the purpose of which is to minimise the impact of forestry on the landscape.  These measures are included in the Forestry and the Landscape Guidelines which outline best practice in forest design.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	731	As indicated in my previous reply to the Deputy the application referred to is in respect of a site located within Drumcliff Bay which is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive (Natura 2000 site).All applications in ‘Natura' areas are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of ‘Natura' areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications is being dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.The timeframe for reaching a determination in respect of applications will vary depending on location, species, scale and intensity of production, culture method, potential visual impact, access route and frequency of access to sites, other activities in the area etc. This does not include consideration of any submissions or observations raised during the public consultation period. In addition, the designated status of the site as an SAC/SPA represents a further element of complexity which must be addressed to ensure compliance with relevant national and EU legislation.Addressing the issue of aquaculture licensing in Natura 2000 areas is a key priority for my Department and you can be assured that every effort is being made to expedite the determination of this aquaculture licence application having regard to all the complexities involved.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	732	There has been a significant improvement in the Bovine TB situation over the past decade and eradication now appears to be a genuinely practicable proposition over the coming years.  The number of reactors has declined from 40,000 to 18,500 during the period 2000 to 2011. This is the lowest recorded since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950's and improves on the record low achieved in 2010.In view of the improvement in the overall TB situation and with a view to progressing towards eradication, my Department implemented a number of enhancements to current TB controls earlier this year. I want to emphasise that the changes are, firstly, based on research which demonstrates that there are increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals and, secondly, that they are designed to protect clear herds from buying in high risk animals. These changes were explained to all of the farm organisations on a number of occasions prior to their introduction. The position on each of the changes is as follows.Follow-up on overdue testingUnder the EU Trade Directive 64/432, all herds are required to be tested for bovine TB every 12 months (Annual Round test). However a significant percentage of annual round tests take place outside of the 12 months period. In addition, many of the other tests, such as reactor re-tests and special check tests, also take place after the due date. Under the new policy, where a TB test is deemed to be overdue the herd concerned will, within a short period of time, be automatically restricted until such time as the test is completed and clear. I should explain that herdowners are given plenty of advance warning of the due date for testing. In addition, herdowners who, having genuine reasons, negotiate a delay (up to one month) with the DVO prior to the overdue date will not have any penalties applied. Furthermore, herdowners who postpone their tests with the permission of the DVO will be permitted to buy in animals for a limited period of up to one month pending completion of the test.Contiguous herdsHerds which are contiguous to the farm fragment linked to a high risk breakdown are put on a contiguous test programme. However, there is normally an interval of several weeks following a herd breakdown before a contiguous herd is identified and tested. Previously during this interval, farmers were free to trade their animals and therefore there was a risk of spreading TB from the sale of such animals to clear herds. Statistics available to my Department show that animals in herds which are contiguous to high risk breakdowns are 3 times more likely to have TB infected animals than "normal" herds, indicating that the risk of TB spreading from herds which are contiguous to high risk breakdowns is very significant.As a result, my Department has amended the controls on the movement of cattle from contiguous herds such that herds which have not had a full herd test within the previous 4 months will be prevented from selling cattle on the open market pending a full clear herd test. However, such herds are permitted to move cattle direct to slaughter and to buy-in cattle for up to one month pending completion of the test is completed. I should point out that the new controls only apply to herds which are identified as relevant to a high risk breakdown following an epidemiological investigation.I want to emphasise that the only change to the contiguous testing arrangements is that these herds will be temporarily trade restricted pending a test and that they will be immediately de-restricted once they have passed a TB herd test. I believe that the restriction on contiguous herds pending a test should have a very limited effect on trade in cattle. In effect, it is only those herds in which TB is disclosed that will be restricted for any significant period of time.Inconclusive reactorsUnder EU Trade Directive 64/432/EEC, an animal which has shown an inconclusive reactor result to the TB test can be traded normally if it passes a subsequent TB test. However, recent research carried out by UCD on behalf of the Department found that standard inconclusive reactors which passed the re-test and moved out of the herd, subsequent to passing the test, were 12 times more likely to be TB positive at the subsequent test/slaughter compared to all other animals in the herd. The same increased risk did not apply to the non-inconclusive animals that moved out of the same herds at the same time. On the basis of the findings from this research, my Department has decided that a standard inconclusive reactor will be prevented from moving from the herd of disclosure for the duration of its lifetime, except to slaughter or, in exceptional cases, to a feedlot, from where it must go, within a reasonable timeframe, direct to slaughter.While I am very pleased with the improvement in the incidence of TB, my Department subjects the TB eradication programme to on-going review with a view to ensuring that there is a robust testing regime in place. The prevention of the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds is an important factor both in achieving the goal of eradication and in continuing to secure funding from the EU.  My Department will continue to review and make changes to various elements of the programme as deemed necessary in light of experience.

This process initially involves informal contact at official level, following which a formal written submission is made. On receipt of the submission, the Commission invites the views of the various relevant Directorates, who each must assess the proposals insofar as their specific remits are concerned.The purpose of the changes announced to the 2012 Terms and Conditions of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is to achieve the required savings, prompted by the budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme being reduced to from €220 million to €190 million. However, in order to make these savings, it is proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria, rather than simply apply an across-the-board cut, by reducing the maximum payable area, or reducing the rates of aid payable, or both.Choosing to opt for the technical adjustments ensures that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows:To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community;To maintain the countryside;To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.Insofar as publicity surrounding the changes to the 2012 Scheme is concerned, I can confirm that:individual copies of the Terms and Conditions booklets governing the 2012 DAS Scheme were posted to all those who benefited under the 2011 Scheme;my Department published a comprehensive advertisement in the agricultural press, in late April, detailing the changes to the 2012 Scheme.The specific changes introduced under the 2012 Scheme, as previously announced, are as follows:Requirement to have met a stocking density of 0.3 lu/ha in 2011In the first instance, an applicant is required to have met a stocking density in 2011, for three consecutive months, of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare.  However, specific provision is being made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure, such as a Commonage Framework De-stocking Plans, Rural Environmental Protection Schemes (REPS) or Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.  The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.Minimum Stocking Density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare in 2012While the minimum stocking density remains at 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare, the retention period is increased to six months. In addition, the stocking density is calculated over the twelve months of the scheme-year.Again, there will be a continued recognition of farmers, who will not meet the minimum stocking requirement due to the impact of agri-environment measures, including the NPWS Review, which has established stocking densities for all commonages, Rural Environmental Protection Schemes (REPS) and Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).Differential Rate of AidWith the intention of favourably targeting those farmers who are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, it is proposed that farmers, whose holdings consists of land situated both in Disadvantaged Areas and non-Disadvantaged Areas are in a better positioned from a farming viewpoint than those farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas. Therefore, it is proposed that where some of an applicant's land declared is Disadvantaged land and his or her main holding is in a non disadvantaged area, a digressive rate of aid under the Scheme will be payable. This digressive payment does not affect applicants whose main holding is in a disadvantaged area. This proposal is regarded as fair in that the greater proportion of Less Favoured Areas land in the holding, the greater the level of payment.Exclusion of non-breeding horsesWhile horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy. Equine breeding enterprises are defined as follows: an applicant must, in the first instance, be an equine (horse/donkey) breeder and have bred a foal, from a mare registered as on the applicant's holding in 2011, in either 2009, 2010 or 2011, which was registered in a Stud Book approved by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with pedigree recorded (sire and dam).Furthermore, the premises of all who meet this criteria must be registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in accordance with S.I. No. 8 of 2012, Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Registration of Horse Premises) Order 2012.Where these criteria are met, the following equines will then be eligible for inclusion in the stocking density calculation for the 2012 Scheme:All equines aged one year to five years, (aged using 1 January), registered in the name of the applicant and maintained on his/her holding;Breeding mares, registered as having been on the applicant's holding in 2011, that have bred an appropriately registered foal in 2009 or 2010 or 2011.Distance from main holdingWhere the applicant's main holding/residence is situated in a non-DAS area, land situated more than 80 kilometres from an applicant's main holding is not eligible under the 2012 Scheme.

While the details of individual lease holders are confidential I can confirm that the terms of the various leases range from 21 years to 100 years with twenty leases having a standard 35 year term. In 2001 four sites in Claremont Industrial Estate as well a premises on the East Pier were advertised for competitive tender and were offered for lease to the highest bidders. It is intended to hold a tender competition for the lease at the earliest opportunity.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	735	A licence was issued to Howth Fish Sales Ltd. in 1994 to operate the Auction Hall at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre following an application invited by newspaper advertisement.  The most recent valid licence expired in 2004 and there is currently no formal licence or lease agreement in place on the Howth Auction Hall.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	736	Howth is one of 6 Fishery Harbour Centres operated by the State each of whose primary purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.  There has been significant capital investment in the Fishery Harbour Centres and the State is fully committed to maximising the return on its investment, both in terms of providing enhanced facilities and, where possible, job creation.  For that reason, all income generated by the Fishery Harbour Centres goes back into a ring-fenced Fishery Harbour Centres Fund which is used exclusively for the operating and management costs of the Fishery Harbours.In parallel with fishing-related enhancements, there have been a number of developments at the Fishery Harbours in recent years that underpin their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism, as well as other maritime enterprises.  These developments will naturally add value in terms of job creation.  The State is always prepared to encourage and facilitate any developments within the Fishery Harbours that are compatible with their primary function of supporting the fishing industry. In that context, I welcome any proposals in Howth or elsewhere which can create jobs or promote maritime enterprise.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	737	Under the Fishery Harbour Centres Act of 1968, charges for the use of services and facilities at all of the State's six Fishery Harbour Centres, including Howth, are set out by way of a Rates and Charges Order.  The Rates and Charges Order currently in place dates from 2003.  In the context of the ongoing development work at the Fishery Harbour Centres, and taking account of their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism as well as for fishing-related activities, my Department undertook an extensive review of the current Rates and Charges Order, and published a draft new Rates and Charges Order in March last.  A 21-day period for public consultations closed on Friday 20th April and a total of 87 submissions were made by stakeholders, including a number of marine tourism interests.  Since then, all of the submissions received have been examined very closely by my Department and I expect to be in a position to finalise the new Rates and Charges Order very shortly.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	738	The evidence showing interference with the TB test has been provided to the herdowner in question in the context of a court hearing in February 2011 and, more recently, through the release of documentation under the FOI.  It should also be noted that Article 7 of the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions ) Order, 1989  clearly lays the responsibility on the owner or person in charge to prevent interference with the TB test. In particular, Article 7(2) obliges the owner or person in charge of an animal to take such care of an animal as to ensure that any substance cannot be introduced into the body of an animal for the purpose of affecting the accuracy of the test.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	739	The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st November 2010 and full payment totalling €209.33 issued in respect of 2010.  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.  Payment in respect of the 2011 Scheme year is subject to a similar administrative checking process which includes verification of capital investment through checks on receipts.  These checks have been successfully completed and payment in respect of 2011 will issue shortly to the person named.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	740	The person named has been a participant in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS 4) since June 2008 and has received payment for the first four years of the scheme, the latest payment having issued in December 2011. This payment was reduced to €5,679.29 following a penalty deduction of €3,223.57 as a result of breaches of the scheme which were discovered at inspection.The farm of the person named includes a number of important beehive huts and has been designated a Natural Heritage Area by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). Measure 7 of REPS 4 requires that a 20 metre buffer strip must be provided around features of historical and archaeological interest and that no ground disturbance or building is allowed within that strip. During an inspection visit in Autumn 2011, it was found that the person named had constructed a green house within the 20 metre buffer strip. As the person named had not followed the correct procedure of contacting the NPWS for permission to carry out such works, had not consulted with his REPS planner or informed the Department that such works were proposed, the Department's inspector advised the person named that a penalty would be imposed.The person named was advised that he could appeal this decision and an appeal has been submitted to my Department. The appeal is being examined and an early response will issue in writing to the person named.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	741	There were no State agencies abolished or merged since the formation of this government, however, the Government decided that three bodies under the aegis of my Department should be reviewed.1. National Milk Agency — to consider abolishing or merging with Bord Bia.2. Irish Marine Development Office — to consider subsuming functions into the Marine Institute.3. Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) — to consider subsuming certain functions into this Department.  (The marketing functions of BIM had been transferred to Bord Bia prior to the period in question).These reviews are to be finalised by the end of June 2012.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	742	Applications for aquaculture licences are assessed under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act which provide for extensive consultation with stakeholders, including Inland Fisheries Ireland, and also a period of general public consultation.  Licence decisions in each case are made following detailed advice from my Department's scientific and technical advisers.  My scientific and technical advisers, based on current scientific knowledge and best practice, do not recommend any blanket prohibition such as that envisaged in the Deputy's question.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The person named has been informed in writing that he was approved for participation in the 2011 Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) with effect from 1st September 2011.  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check of all applications, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.  The terms and conditions of the scheme provide that actions are not allowed on rented land. The administrative checks which were carried out on the application of the person named indicated that two actions which were proposed were to be carried out on rented land.  Accordingly, my Department contacted the person named and informed him that these particular actions were ineligible. The application will now be further processed and payment will issue at the earliest opportunity once all further validations and checks have been successfully completed.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	744	Applicants under the Single Payment Scheme are required,inter alia, to declare one eligible hectare for each SPS payment entitlement held; in declaring such land, applicants are required to indicate whether the land is Owned, Rented or Leased. Where the same land parcel is claimed by more than one applicant, on the basis that the land is being leased/rented or a similar type transaction, the landowner will be required to make a formal declaration, in a format to be determined by my Department, as to the usage of the land in question. Essentially, the landowner will simply be asked to provide factual information in such cases.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	745	Being particularly mindful of the importance of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, from an economic perspective, contributing as it does to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic, I chose to adopt a focused approach when faced with implementing the decisions contained in the 2012 Budget. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the purpose of the changes is to achieve the required savings, prompted by the budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme being reduced to from €220 million to €190 million.However, in order to make these savings, it is proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria, rather than simply apply an across-the-board cut, by reducing the maximum payable area, or reducing the rates of aid payable, or both.

The application has been selected to proceed to the approval stage and the required pre-approval checks should be completed shortly to allow the approval to issue. Under the terms and condition of the scheme, work may not commence on the investment items concerned until written approval has been issued by my Department.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	750	I propose to take Questions Nos. 553 and 554 together.As the Deputy is aware, my Department is currently developing an overarching Children and Young People's Policy Framework for 2012-2017. This new Policy Framework will, in the first instance, provide the basis for more detailed strategies including an Early Years Strategy and a new Youth Policy Framework. It is envisaged that the ensuing Youth Policy Framework will be finalised in 2013.The members of the International Expert Reference Group and the National Youth Work Advisory Committee Task Group who are assisting my Department in developing the Youth Policy Framework are listed below:International Expert Reference Group:Dr. John Bamber, Principal Fellow-Community Development, Centre for Effective Services (Chair),Dr. Maurice Devlin, Senior Lecturer in Applied Social Studies, NUI, Maynooth,Mr. John McCormick, Former Director of Youth Work Services, Youth Council for Northern Ireland,Professor Danny Perkins, Professor of Family and Youth Resiliency and Policy, Pennsylvania State University,Mr. Bernard Davies, Youth Work expert/activist, UK,Ms Paula Mayock, Senior Researcher, Children's Research Centre, TCD,Ms Justine Horgan, Senior Researcher, National Advisory Committee on Drugs  Ms Catherine Hazlett, Department of Children and Youth Affairs,Mr. Conor Rowley, Department of Children and Youth Affairs,Ms Doreen Burke, Department of Children and Youth Affairs,National Youth Work Advisory Committee Task Group:Ms Mary Cunningham, Director, National Youth Council of Ireland,Mr. Eddie D'Arcy, Director of Youth Services, Catholic Youth Care,Ms Orlaith Mc Bride, Former Director of National Association for Youth Drama,Mr. Michael Barron, Director, BeLonG To Youth Service,Ms Carol Hanney, Dun Laoghaire VEC,Mr. Conor Rowley, Department of Children and Youth Affairs (Chair),Ms Doreen Burke, Department of Children and Youth Affairs.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	751	I propose to take Questions Nos. 555 and 562 together.Belarus has ratified the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.  However, adoptions between Ireland and Belarus cannot take place due to compatibility issues between the laws of Ireland and Belarus.  This arises because the Belarussian requirement for legislative underpinning of post placement reporting would not be compatible with Constitutional provisions here.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	752	The maximum grant available was €50,000 (including VAT).  The aim of the funding is to provide support to childcare settings to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work, or to purchase equipment.  The successful applications were those that represented the most complete, coherent, precise and compelling cases for funding.  The investment has been directed, to the greatest extent possible, to addressing the most urgent works, and supporting the quality of services making the greatest impact for disadvantaged children and communities.  All applicants were notified by Pobal of the outcome and the Pobal website provides a facility for unsuccessful applicants to request by call-back, information to assist them in understanding the reasons for the outcome of their applications.My Department also provides funding to support three childcare programmes — the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme — which provide a range of supports to both employed and unemployed parents of pre-school children and also after school care for children older than 6 years.I understand that this group is already participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   To meet the additional costs of the increased number of children eligible for this programme and to provide for savings identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure process, to which all Government departments were subject, it will be necessary to make some changes to the capitation payments in the school year commencing in September 2012.    A reduction of €2 per week will be made to the capitation rates paid to providers from September 2012.  However, to give some flexibility to childcare services to manage this modest reduction, the staff to child ratios and the space ratios for the pre-school element of childcare services only, will be increased in September 2012.   The staff to child ratio will increase from a ratio of 1: 10 to a ratio of 1: 11. To allow for the implementation of these new ratios it is proposed that a new space/area requirement of 1.818 square metres per child will be applied.  The Water Closet/Wash Hand Basin ratios will also change in line with the adult/child ratios.The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme enables community-based childcare services to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, disadvantage and low income are determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, parents with middle incomes may also benefit from subvention.    Childcare services wishing to enter this programme can only be considered if they are replacing an existing participating service which is opting out of the programme, and when they are in a position to provide for the needs of the parents using the service that they are replacing.The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme was introduced in September 2010 and provides funding to participating childcare services in return for the provision of childcare places to qualifying FÁS and Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) trainees and students.  Both community and commercial childcare providers are eligible to apply for entry to this programme.In relation to funding for CE workers, I understand from information supplied to me by the Department of Social Protection, that the budget for CE placements in childcare related positions is ring fenced specifically for that purpose.  Furthermore, I have been informed that there are no plans to reduce the number of childcare related CE participants nor to reduce the related amount of ring fenced funding.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	753	I propose to take Questions Nos. 557 to 560, inclusive, and 564 together.The 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) were established in 2001 to advance the provision of childcare facilities in their local areas.  They comprise local representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, social partners, childcare providers and parents.  The role of the CCCs was expanded under the National Childcare Investment Programme to enable greater flexibility and responsiveness to local needs, and they had a key role in the development of local childcare infrastructure, quality standards, training and information.  More recently, CCCs have been increasingly dedicated to locally managing administrative processes associated with the national childcare programmes (the Community Childcare Subvention programme, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support programme).  They also support the performance and sustainability of services in their respective areas.  Each CCC receives funding from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs is €11.3m.In relation to funding provided nationally by the HSE to support City and County Childcare Committees, the HSE has advised that there has been no decision to withdraw this funding.  However, I understand that at a local level funding has been reduced or ceased in some areas due to the implementation of cost containment measures.  The HSE has however confirmed that it will endeavour to support the CCCs wherever possible.  The HSE has confirmed that funding totalling €87,678 was provided to Donegal County Childcare Committee in 2011 and  €83,631 was provided in 2012.In relation to Childminding Advisory Officer posts, the HSE has advised that a reduced level of funding has impacted on this post in many areas.  No decision has been made in relation to the funding of the Childminding Advisory Officer post in Donegal CCC for 2013 and the HSE is engaged in an ongoing process with Donegal CCC in relation to the range of services to be commissioned next year.  The HSE considers the role of the childminder as pivotal to the provision of early years services and will provide support wherever possible.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	754	I would like to assure the Deputy that early years services are already familiar with the national practice guidelines of Síolta and Aistear.   Pobal carry out an annual survey, the Annual Beneficiary Questionnaire, to capture information about childcare facilities funded under the National Childcare Investment Programme.  For the 2010 survey, Pobal added a number of questions to assess levels of awareness of and engagement with these initiatives.The results show a very high level of awareness among services of both Aistear and Síolta, with well over 90% of respondents stating awareness of each of them, while more than four out of every five respondents have attended a Síolta information session.  My Department is working with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations to determine how quality improvement in the early years sector can continue to be supported.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I would like to inform the Deputy that the position in respect of my Department is that four agencies are currently funded by the Exchequer through my Department's Vote.  These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Ombudsman for Children.  The Deputy might note that following enactment of the Child Care Amendment Act 2011, which was guided through its final stages in the Oireachtas in July 2011 by myself, the Children's Act Advisory Board was subsequently dissolved by means of the commencement by the Minister of Health of Part 6 of the Child Care Amendment Act 2011.  Prior to this, the Board had an annual allocation in the region of €700,000.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	756	The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which is implemented by my Department, provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments and working parents who may also qualify.For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, parents with middle incomes may also benefit from subvention.At present, my Department does not operate any other scheme to specifically assist working parents, who do not qualify for support under the CCS programme, with the cost of childcare.  However this matter will be kept under review, in particular, in the context of future budgetary discussions.  My Department also implements the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.

I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that given the operational remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which encompasses a wide range of policy and service activity that is focussed on improving the lives of children and young people, my Department has not directly engaged in the preparation of a report accounting for the ways in which the sums of money raised from the Jobs Initiative has been spent to date.

The development of primary care centres, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary care and represents a tangible re-focussing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.Wicklow town and Greystones are two locations where the Health Service Executive proposes to deliver primary care centres through leasing arrangements with the private sector.  Although the Executive has signed agreements with developers to lease part of each the development once completed, the Executive as a third party is not involved in the day to day project management.  As regards Wicklow town, some progress had been made since your last question.  The HSE understands that negotiations including due diligence on funding are underway.  The developer has already obtained planning permission approval.   I acknowledge the work that all parties, including GPs, have contributed to the progress on this centre to date.   At this stage it is still too soon to say when construction will begin or when the facility will open.The Executive has been recently informed by the developer that construction on the Greystones primary care centre will begin in September 2012. Some site enabling works are required in the interim.  The Executive's best estimate for opening the facility is early 2014.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	782	I believe we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us.  This means we need to focus on how beds are used, on the throughput of patients, on reducing length of stay to international norms and on having as many procedures as possible carried out as day cases rather than inpatient work.  The work of the Special Delivery Unit, together with implementation of the Clinical Care Programmes in the HSE, will help to improve the efficiency of our hospitals, allowing us to treat as many patients as possible within budget.  I believe that pursuing efficiencies through these means will be a far more productive approach than debating the number of beds open or closed at any one time.In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. The emphasis in 2012 will continue to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter lengths of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery.  In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it provides safe, effective and efficient care to the maximum number of patients.Throughout 2012 hospitals will open and close beds on various wards in order to deliver the planned level of activity. These beds may be closed for a number of reasons, including cost containment, infection control and refurbishment. It is not possible at this time to determine what beds in which wards will be closed and what length of time they will be closed for. The decision to open and close beds is made at hospital management level and approved by the Regional Director of Operations.  The Deputy can contact the BIU at pmu@hse.ie and request a copy at any time.  With respect to the detailed information sought by the Deputy I have asked the HSE to collate this information and reply to the Deputy directly.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	790	In relation to the Deputy's question on waiting times the Government fully accepts that waiting times for patients awaiting an elective surgical procedure are too long. One of my first priorities as Minister for Health was to set a maximum waiting time target of 12 months to be achieved by all hospitals by the end of 2011. I can confirm that 95% of hospitals achieved this target.The immediate challenge for 2012 was to maintain the 12 month maximum waiting time target for in patient and day case procedures and then to continually improve and move to a 9 month maximum waiting time target by the end of 2012.  The latest available figures from the end of April 2012 show that 99% of patients   were given a scheduled treatment date within 12 months; 94% of patients were given a scheduled treatment date within 9 months; 78% of patients were given a scheduled treatment date within 6 months.These figures demonstrate that progress is being made in relation to reducing the maximum waiting times for patients awaiting an inpatient or daycase procedure and our health service is on target to ensure that no patient has to wait more than 9 months for surgery.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to focus on waiting lists and that when the 9 month target has been achieved later in 2012, the SDU will focus on reducing that target even further.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	791	The HSE March 2012 Report showed that a total of 158,850 patients are waiting less than 12 months for a first time outpatient attendance. A further 45,959 patients are waiting over 12 months. It is likely that these are an underestimate of those waiting as not all hospitals are currently reporting outpatient waiting time data to the HSE.  The issue of Outpatient waiting lists was essentially an untended problem. The scale of the problem was unmeasured and consequently no special action was taken to deal with it. This Government intends to change that. I have instructed the Special Delivery Unit to give priority to devising methods for dealing with the issue of the Outpatient waiting lists.Work has already commenced on the systematic and automatic collection of waiting time data, at an individual patient level in a standardised format from all hospitals providing an Outpatient service. This will be the first time that such detailed data will be available at a national level from all hospitals. The collation and analysis of Outpatient waiting time data will reveal how many patients are waiting by region, by hospital, by specialty and by Consultant. The SDU and NTPF are aiming to publish outpatient waiting time data in the near future.The next step will be to then set a maximum waiting time target for a first Outpatient appointment. Hospitals will be held responsible and accountable for ensuring that patients are seen in Outpatients within this maximum waiting time. The SDU and the National Treatment Purchase Fund will assist hospitals in targeting their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen, assessed and appropriately treated.   In parallel with reducing the numbers of those waiting longest, the SDU will also commence work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of Outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen by the right health professional at the right time.  The goal is to improve access by implementing an Outpatient Service Performance Improvement Programme that will underpin a radical transformation of how Outpatient services are delivered in Ireland.

While a number of customer service and communication issues remain to be addressed, the HSE has been making good progress in eliminating the backlog and preventing further backlogs occurring.  A backlog of 58,000 applications from last year has been completely cleared.  The HSE receives up to 50,000 applications per month and over 90% of complete applications are processed within 15 days.The HSE has introduced a number of changes in recent months to the administration of the medical card application system.  These include increased staffing levels in the centralised processing service and in respect of medical card appeals; improvements to how medical card renewals are assessed and the frequency by which they are assessed; increased flexibility for GPs to add certain categories of patients to their GMS list; the fast-tracking of backlogged cases, and cases where documentation has been misfiled.   A review of medical card processing has been undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers which contains a number of recommendations that the HSE is considering.  I continue to monitor the situation and meet with the HSE on a regular basis to address any issues which may arise in respect of medical cards.

The first step in this process is to identify the needs of each individual.  The Department is currently working with the Health Service Executive (HSE) and members of one of the representative groups, the ITSS, to develop an appropriate assessment process.  The ITA is unwilling to engage with me in this process.  The ITSS has recently written to the HSE regarding the extent and scope of the assessment process.Some major issues raised by the ITSS, including an independent agency, housing, heating and transport are unfortunately outside my Department's remit.  I have written to the ITSS requesting them, in good faith, to continue to engage with the HSE in developing a health care assessment process.  This would include appointment and training of a multidisciplinary team and a multidisciplinary health evaluation that would identify and document the health needs/issues of survivors.  It would also include plans to address agreed health care needs/issues.  The process and its outcome will provide information which will assist us in addressing the future health care needs of Irish survivors of thalidomide.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	797	Wisdom Services is a voluntary body operated by the Daughters of Wisdom and provides services for people with a disability in the North Western region.  It supports over 200 service users with 111 on campus, 75 in the community and 20 day attendees.  I was very disappointed to learn that the Daughters of Wisdom, who operate Wisdom Services, have advised the HSE that they intend to withdraw from the provision of services on behalf of the HSE.  The HSE have been working with Wisdom Services for some time to address their financial concerns and identify opportunities for efficiencies and savings, through potential new combinations of service delivery in the north-west area. Wisdom Services has a cost containment plan for 2012, which has had some success but, despite detailed engagement by the HSE with their management, I regret that Wisdom Services has now decided to withdraw from service provision.I would like to reassure the families of the children and adults of people with disabilities that their current level of service will continue to be provided.  I am requesting the HSE to work with Wisdom Services to ensure continuity of service for all clients while a transition process is being put in place.  I understand that Wisdom Services have written to families of service users and to staff, to reassure them of their co-operation in this process.  I would like to thank Wisdom Services for their dedication and commitment to providing services to children and adults in the North West since 1955.  The HSE will now commence a detailed assessment of all aspects of Wisdom Service operations in order to arrive at a mutually agreed resolution on the continuation of services to the clients of Wisdom Services, and in particular to ensure that the service users will continue to receive the care and support they require.  I understand that early discussions are planned with the management of Wisdom Services.Wisdom Services were allocated €15.5 million by HSE in 2012 and has been funded consistently over the years.  In addition, Wisdom Services were the beneficiaries of 38% of all intellectual disability development monies from this HSE area in the period 2006 to 2011, along with additional capital funding in this period.  This compared favourably with the percentage of ID clients from this area covered by their services.  Accordingly, I do not accept that this service has been under-funded, allowing for the necessary reductions that have been applied evenly to all service providers in the last 2-3 years.  I would like to thank Wisdom Services for their work in providing services to children and adults over the years and I would urge all involved to work closely to ensure that the needs of service users and their families are given priority.

A medical device cannot be marketed in any country across Europe without carrying a CE mark.  A CE mark is obtained from an independent Notified Body.  A CE mark is applied for by the manufacturer and once the mark is awarded the device is recognised as having met the relevant regulatory requirements throughout the EU and should perform as intended.Since October 2001 the Irish Medicines Board has been the competent authority for medical devices in Ireland.  As the competent authority the Irish Medicines Board monitors the products that have been placed on the market and are in use.  Neither my Department nor the IMB was aware of articles referred to by the Deputy.  Market recall of the PIP silicone breast implants was initiated in Ireland by the Irish Medicines Board in March 2010 following receipt of a notification under the EU vigilance system from the French medical devices regulatory authority (AFSSAPS). At that time the IMB had no reported incidents relating to the PIP breast implant.  No concerns about the performance of the PIP silicone gel filled devices had been highlighted or communicated via the EU vigilance system prior to March 2010.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	801	A recall of the Poly Implant Prosthese (PIP) Breast Implants was initiated in Ireland on 30th March 2010 by the Irish Medicines Board following notification from the French medical device regulatory authority (AFSSAPS) that they had suspended the manufacture, marketing, distribution and export of the PIP products.   This action followed an inspection of the PIP manufacturing plant where it was found that most implants manufactured since 2001 were filled with an unauthorised silicone gel which differed in composition from the originally approved medical grade silicone, which had been approved in line with the CE mark. This fraudulent activity has resulted in criminal proceedings against the manufacturer.Issues relating to the contractual relationship between a private healthcare provider and the patient are outside of my remit.  The private clinics and their patients must work together to arrive at a solution.  The Chief Medical Officer in my Department has met and is engaging with the treating clinics with a view to ensuring that an appropriate professional service is provided to the affected women.Officials of my Department are working on the Licensing of Health Facilities Bill which will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health service providers.  It is expected that outline proposals for the new system of licensing should be finalised by year end.  In the meantime I am making arrangements to put in place better information for people who are planning to undergo cosmetic surgery in Ireland.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	802	Part 11 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 (No. 25 of 2007) provides that it is the duty of medical practitioners to maintain their professional competence on an ongoing basis.  This part of the Act was commenced by the Minister for Health in May 2010.  Requirements for the professional competence schemes were put in place by the Medical Council in May 2011 and it has been mandatory for all medical practitioners to participate in a professional competence scheme in line with their individual practice since that time.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	803	I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of referrals from GPs by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase procedures.  The next priority for the SDU is access to diagnostics. This programme of work has commenced in terms of access to GI endoscopy and will later in 2012 examine access to radiology services.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

The Strategy will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.  It will set out a common framework for the development of operational plans by a number of Government Departments which will clearly set out each Department's objectives relating to older people.  Mechanisms designed to monitor the implementation of measures contained in operational plans will also be included in the Strategy.  However, I do not envisage that the Strategy will propose new service developments.  Rather it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.A considerable amount of preparatory work has already been completed.  The drafting of the Strategy will proceed within the Department within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  At this stage I envisage the Strategy will be completed and published in the last quarter of this year within these constraints.

On this basis, the organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the ongoing development of the HSE Clinical Programmes.  The Framework for the future development of smaller hospitals has been drafted by a joint HSE/Departmental group.  Consultation with all stakeholders, including patients and public representatives, will be an integral part of the process of implementing the framework for smaller hospitals.  This framework will demonstrate clearly that the future of smaller hospitals is secure. It will set out what services can and should be delivered safely by these hospitals in the interest of better outcomes for patients.I am currently examining the Framework in the context of the overall reorganisation of the health services.  That includes the development of hospital groups.  The changes that will and must take place will have a considerable impact on how our hospital services are aligned.  As Minister for Health I am eager to initiate improvements to our hospital system, however due consideration must be given to the Framework to ensure that when implemented it will optimise the significant resources smaller hospitals have to offer.

Accordingly I have stated in the Register that I have a quarter share interest in a property in Tipperary which houses the Green Hills Nursing Home. The nursing home business itself is run by a separate company in which I have no involvement. As has been frequently reported in the media already, the issue of the ownership of the wider property was the subject of a court case which ended in agreement earlier this year. My interest in the property has been transferred into a blind trust and it is the intention for that interest to be divested as soon as is practicable.

As Minister for Health I am eager to initiate improvements to our hospital system, however due consideration must be given to the Framework to ensure that when implemented it will optimise the significant resources smaller hospitals have to offer.  It is my intention to publish the Framework when this process has been completed.In relation to the Deputy's question on Portlaoise Hospital, the current configuration of the hospital is unlike the configuration that applies to smaller hospitals. For example the Portlaoise Hospital provides paediatric services. Portlaoise provides orthopaedic services. Smaller Hospitals are categorised as Level Two hospitals. Portlaoise is not in the same category as a level two hospital.It is important to note too that this Government is moving to establish hospitals into groups. This process involves a detailed analysis of the inter-dependencies between hospitals in the various regions. I have recently appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a process tasked with providing clear recommendations on the establishment of groups nationwide. This process will be of major importance into the future in successfully, efficiently and safely providing services to our citizens through the wide range of hospitals — large and small — that we are fortunate to have. That process will also allow for the development of a greater balance between larger and smaller hospitals and as I have said on many occasions — that rebalancing will involve the movement of services in both directions.Certain services will move from smaller hospitals to larger hospitals, while other services that can be more effectively provided in smaller hospitals will be moved out of the larger hospitals. This phenomenon can already been seen in the Galway Roscommon Group of Hospitals where, since the opening of the Urgent Care Centre in Roscommon Hospital, many other services have been freshly located in the hospital. A recent example has been the transfer of Sleep Apnoea services from GUH to Roscommon.

The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	827	Under the General Medical Services (GMS) contract, a general practitioner (GP) is expected to provide his/her patients who hold medical cards or GP visit cards with all proper and necessary treatment of a kind generally undertaken by a GP.  The contract between the HSE and GPs under the GMS Scheme stipulates that fees are not paid to GPs by the HSE in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences".Consultation fees charged by general practitioners to private patients and to GMS patients outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.  I should add that General Practitioners who hold GMS contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders in respect of routine treatment.

Cost containment plans are in place for hospitals and community services to bring their spending profiles in line with their allocations, as no additional funding is available for this year.  There are limited financial resources available to the SDU and the NTPF, to assist individual hospitals with specific measures to achieve these targets.The Programme for Government has a commitment to reforming hospital funding and to introducing a more transparent and efficient ‘money follows the patient' system. Work is continuing on the development of this, as part of the Universal Health Insurance System.  The central element of the health reform programme is the establishment of hospital trusts as an important stepping stone towards the introduction of universal health insurance. I have already announced that hospital groups will be formed on a non statutory basis ahead of the formation of Independent Hospital Trusts. Letterkenny  Hospital will be part of this process. Last week, I announced the appointment of Professor John R. Higgins to work with the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) in the role of Chair of a Strategic Board to assist the Department of Health in the design and establishment of Hospital Groups. As Chair, he will have a key role in progressing the creation of Hospital Groups initially and, ultimately, Independent Hospital Trusts.The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive the optimum service reforms. Performance improvement must be at the heart of the national reform programme: the creation of hospital groups and trusts is integral to a stronger and more systematic process of performance management for hospitals.  I have forwarded the queries on Letterkenny  Hospital and on the in-patient costs  to the HSE, which will respond directly to the Deputy in relation to those particular queries.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	840	The Health and Social Care Professionals Council, established in 2007 and the 12 registration boards being established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (the Act), will be responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  The object of the Council is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants of the following 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act: clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.These 12 professions were designated in the Act which is being implemented on a phased basis, and currently 2 registration boards have been established.  These are the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board.  It is hoped that the remaining 10 registration boards will be established by end 2014.  When a registration board is appointed it will work towards the opening of a statutory register for that profession.While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance, to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include, on the basis of specific criteria, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, as appropriate. Section 4 of the Act  provides a definition of a health and social care profession and also sets out the criteria governing the subsequent addition of any further professions into the regulatory system at a later date, including:(a) The extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge;(b) The extent to which the profession has established itself, including whether there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession's practitioners;(c) The existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed entry qualifications;(d) The profession's commitment to continuous professional development;(e) The degree of risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public from incompetent, unethical or impaired practice of the profession;(f) Any other factors that the Minister for Health considers relevant.While Creative Arts Therapists may work at present in a variety of healthcare and educational settings in Ireland, the profession is not subject to statutory registration and it is not a formally recognised grade within the publicly-funded health sector.  Any consideration of a system of statutory registration for Creative Arts Therapists would only be considered in relation to the criteria outlined above.However, the priority at present for this Department is to develop statutory registration for the 12 professions specified in the Act in the first instance. The extension under the Act of statutory registration arrangements for other health and social care professionals will be considered after the initial designated 12 professional grades have been fully dealt with.

These new guidelines were developed in response to Irish national nutrition surveys which showed that all age groups in the population are consuming too many foods from the top shelf of the food pyramid which are high in fat, sugar and salt. Focusing specifically on reducing top shelf food and drinks is the Department of Health's key eating message. Alcohol is now also included on the top shelf as it provides calories.  The Department of Health's guidelines is the main resource to be provided to the consumer and is complemented by the FSAI resource for circulation to health professionals or catering professionals.  The FSAI guidelines contain additional detail regarding different age groups, however are consistent with the Department's recommended intake on carbohydrates and other nutrients. Portion sizes and advice on calories are also key elements in both sets of guidelines. Technical seminars are currently being organised for healthcare and catering professionals regarding the implementation of these guidelines.

My Department is currently examining how authorised cannabis-based medicinal products for patients suffering from Multiple Sclerosis may be legally prescribed by medical practitioners and used by patients for the treatment of MS in Ireland.  In that respect, Department officials have been engaging with experts to identify how best to legally describe authorised cannabis-based medicinal products while maintaining existing controls on cannabis and cannabis substances.  While the legislative amendments required can be made by means of statutory instrument, the legal issues are complex and it is not possible at this stage to set out a time frame.

This is to ensure that when a service funded by the HSE becomes aware that a child is either witnessing or experiencing domestic violence then a referral must be made, and that the child's rights are of paramount consideration.  The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which was published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect.  It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation.  The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First and the Heads of the Bill have been prepared and submitted to the Committee for Health and Children for their consideration.Experience in other countries indicates that guidance to those responsible for reporting, and effective screening of all reports are important in designing an effective filtering system which deploys resources appropriately based upon child protection criteria.  In this regard, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will be developing  ‘Guidance for Reporting of Abuse' which will deal with issues such as definitions, thresholds and appropriate channels for the reporting of abuse.  Since its introduction in 1999, significant resources have been put in place to support the implementation of Children First and in the case of the HSE and An Garda Síochána, Children First has formed an integral part of their existing operations and practices.  The HSE has provided training, information and advice on the implementation of Children First throughout the sector.In addition to the existing structures in place to support Children First, significant additional resources have been provided to the HSE over the past three years to increase the number of social workers in the child welfare and protection area.  The recruitment of these additional social workers was included in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan, as was the commitment to place Children First on a statutory basis.  This additional resource will be of particular assistance to the HSE in driving forward the process of implementation of Children First.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	847	I propose to take Questions Nos. 675 and 676 together.The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is the statutory body responsible for the registration and inspection of all designated centres for older people, including public, voluntary and private nursing homes. Details of all currently registered nursing homes, including the maximum number of residents who can be accommodated can be found on the HIQA website,www.hiqa.ie.  The HSE has advised the Department that between January and May this year 296 public residential care beds have closed.  While the Department monitors information in relation to the overall number of nursing home beds registered in each sector the Department does not have a mechanism for identifying the number of beds opened or closed in the private sector for the same period.The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was introduced in October 2009.  The Scheme ensures that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable and that people are cared for the in most appropriate settings. Anyone who is assessed as requiring long-term nursing home care can avail of the scheme, regardless of age. However, nursing home care must be appropriate to meet the individual's care needs.Under the Scheme, applicants are required to undergo a comprehensive and  multi-disciplinary care needs assessment in order to establish their need for long term residential care services — as outlined in Section 7 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act, 2009.  This assessment is carried out by healthcare professionals and considers whether a person can be supported to continue to live at home or whether long-term nursing home care is more appropriate.A fundamental principle enshrined in the legislation underpinning the Scheme is that of patient choice. Once a person receives approval for financial support, they can choose to enter any nursing home that is participating in the scheme in any part of the country, subject to the nursing home having an available bed and being able to cater for the person's particular needs. This applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes alike.The HSE is currently piloting a Single Assessment Tool. e introduction of a single assessment tool will assist the HSE to further key strategic objectives,  i.e. meet needs in the most appropriate setting; enhance quality and efficiency; promote value for money; facilitate access to long-term residential care or a home care package; and enable older people to remain at home for as long as possible.Since 1 July 2009 all nursing homes, public and private, must comply with the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, and must meet theNational Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.  The regulatory regime is designed to ensure that residents receive quality long-term residential care.

I believe that pursuing efficiencies through these means will be a far more productive approach than debating the number of beds open or closed at any one time.Many of the Special Delivery Unit's initiatives to date have been targeted at the patients remaining in acute beds post medical discharge and these have involved increased access to home supports and transitional care.  A specific project aimed at improving the quality of care delivery to the frail older person is being finalised and a group will be set up to oversee implementation of this national initiative.  The aim of the project is to support the frail older person at home, create direct access pathways in the acute setting, rehabilitation and transitional care settings.In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. The emphasis in 2012 will continue to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter lengths of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery.  In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it provides safe, effective and efficient care to the maximum number of patients.  As the specific issue raised by the Deputy is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

The aim of the Review was to consider all the possible options for the earliest possible delivery of a new children's hospital. The terms of reference of the Group were as follows:To inform itself about the planning considerations and processes affecting this project.To consider the different options which now exist for progressing the construction of a national children's hospital having regard to –Government policy on the delivery of health services, including accessibility and paediatric services in particular and best clinical practice considerations,(b) the cost and value for money considerations of the different options,(c) the likely timelines associated with the different options,(d) the implementation risks associated with the different options.To advise him, in the light of these considerations, on the appropriate next steps to take with a view to ensuring that a national paediatric hospital can be constructed with minimal delay.To report to the Minister within 56 days of the first meeting of the group.The Group received a large number of submissions and met a wide range of stakeholder and representative groups during its deliberations. The Group has now presented its report, which I intend to consider carefully before bringing to Government.

My Department and the HSE are considering a range of initiatives to cater for the 2013 intern intake and beyond.  In response to concerns about the large numbers of qualified Irish doctors travelling abroad, the career structure for doctors and the recent difficulties in filling non consultant hospital doctor posts in Irish hospitals, I decided to develop a proposal for the creation of a new entry level consultant post.  The creation of the new grade of doctor is a key component of the health reform programme.  A broad outline of the proposed new grade was provided, in the first instance, to the Forum of Irish Postgraduate Medical Training Bodies for consideration.  It is envisaged that wider consultation with key stakeholders would then take place.

At the end of 2011, 95% of all hospitals achieved the maximum waiting time target of 12 months. The target for 2012 is in the first instance for all hospitals to maintain these achievements and then to successfully achieve a 9 month maximum waiting time target. Targeting the longest waiters is the fairest and most equitable approach to treating patients. This is already reflected in the reduction in the percentage of those waiting more 12 months.

The Directive will be transposed by means of a Statutory Instrument under the European Communities Act, 1972 and not primary legislation.  The Directive sets out a common framework on quality and safety standards for organs intended for transplantation and applies to donation, procurement, testing, characterisation, transport and transplantation of organs. The text of the EU Directive in its draft form was examined by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Scrutiny on 27 January 2009.The Department of Health has established a steering group comprising officials from the Irish Medicines Board, which will be the competent authority under the Regulations transposing the Directive, and the HSE's National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office.   A national workshop aimed at hospitals and voluntary agencies was held on 24 April to discuss the Directive and its implications for the organ procurement and transplantation system.  Information from this workshop and other relevant documents are on my Department's website.A draft Statutory Instrument has recently been sent to drafting counsel for consideration.  My officials would be happy to provide the Joint Committee on Health and Children with a copy of the draft Statutory Instrument following its consideration by drafting counsel.  The Regulations to transpose the Directive cannot regulate for issues over and above those prescribed in the Directive.  This is a matter for primary legislation.My Department is currently advancing legislative proposals for the Human Tissue Bill.  A public consultation was carried out previously on a draft general scheme of the Bill and the proposals are being revised following on from this public consultation and in line with legal advice.    I expect to bring the legislative proposals to Government later this year, seeking the formal drafting of the Bill.  This Bill will put in place a legal framework in relation to the donation of organs and tissue by living and deceased persons.  The transposition of EU Directive 2010/53/EU is not on the health agenda for the meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) which I am attending later this week.

The Government decided, shortly after coming into office last year, to direct the Road Safety Authority (RSA) to take charge of a new centralised driver licensing system.  This system will offer greater efficiency for the customer and greater value for money for the taxpayer.One of the benefits of the centralised system will be a more robust process of identity confirmation in line with the Government's Standard Authentication Framework Environment (SAFE 2).  In the outgoing system, individuals must get a hard copy photo ID and have it endorsed, typically by a member of An Garda Síochána, before submitting it with their driving licence application.  The new system will involve the individual producing proof of identity and having their photo captured digitally as part of the application process.  I do not accept that use of hard copy photos whose standards might vary greatly would be superior to using digital technology to a set standard.

As part of the recently completed 2012 roads classification review, many national roads within the M50 were re-classified to regional road status. This was to reflect their changed role in the overall road network. However, the resultant change in classification does not necessarily imply cost savings with state and public funding still being required for the continuing up keep of the roads concerned.The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants as provided (via the National Roads Authority) by my Department.  The overall level of funding available for allocation to road authorities for maintenance and rehabilitation works on public roads is determined as part of the annual budgetary process.

I would like also to take the opportunity to congratulate the Kilkee and Doolin Coast Guard Unit volunteers on their work on the same day in locating a missing child in Lahinch.

Over €143 million is being provided in the Tourism Services budget of my Department to support tourism in 2012 across a range of activities including overseas and domestic marketing, investment in tourism product and vital business supports to develop tourism across Ireland.To further support the sector, the Government introduced the Jobs Initiative in 2011 and the Action Plan for Jobs 2012. The VAT reduction on a range of labour-intensive tourism services from 13.5% to 9% introduced from 1 July 2011 has significantly enhanced the competitiveness of our tourism product.  Following discussions with the Minister for Finance, I was glad to obtain his assurance that the lower rate of VAT will be maintained throughout 2013 so that businesses, tour operators and customers alike can continue with their planning for the 2013 season with the assurance that the 9% rate will apply.  The Visa Waiver Scheme is encouraging visitors from emerging markets to add Ireland to a trip to the UK. The Government has also significantly reduced the cost of employing people by halving employers' PRSI for those on modest wages.Next year, 2013, is the year of The Gathering, during which we hope to bring an extra 325,000 visitors to Ireland. The necessary structures to deliver The Gathering have been put in place. The initiative was launched overseas as part of the St. Patrick's Day festivities and a major domestic launch was held in Dublin Castle on Friday 11 May. The first of a series of Gathering Community meetings throughout the country to promote participation in the event took place in Roscommon on Wednesday 6 June.  I remain confident about our prospects for 2012. Despite continuing economic uncertainty in many markets, there are plenty of reasons to expect a good tourism performance this year. The tourism industry is already reporting positive signs in terms of enquiries and bookings for the peak season.

Before doing so they are required to consult with An Garda Síochána and to advertise the proposed measures so that interested parties may make submissions regarding them.  In the case of national roads they must also receive the consent of the National Roads Authority.  The 1994 Act leaves open the option of placing ramps on routes which have a bus service.Section 38(6) of the 1994 Act allows for the publication of Guidelines in relation to traffic calming.  Such guidelines were included in the Traffic Management Guidelines of 2003.  The Guidelines recognise that installing ramps on routes with bus services is now an option, and make suggestions as to appropriate arrangements based on experience in other jurisdictions.  The Road Traffic (Bollards and Ramps) Regulations 1988 (S.I. No. 32 of 1988), which were amended by the Road Traffic (Bollards and Ramps) (Amendment) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 291 of 1988), specified that ramps were not to be provided on a road on which an omnibus service operates.  In light of the provisions of the 1994 Act and the Guidelines that issued, these Regulations are in the process of being revoked.

This revised investment framework is a critical element of the Government strategy for achieving fiscal stability.  Overall spending on transport capital will fall by 40% from €1.5 billion in 2011 to €0.8 billion in 2016 and the priority over the next five years will be to restore and maintain existing transport infrastructure.In view of the significant reduction in funding over the period to 2016, it has been necessary to defer some major projects including the M20, Metro North and the DART Underground. It is also the case that, within the allocations now available, the transport agencies under my aegis will have to prioritise certain projects and defer others.  The position in relation to projects that cannot go ahead in the short to medium term will be reviewed in the context of the next Capital Review Programme, commencing in 2015.

Fáilte Ireland operates the tourism capital investment programme, which provides support for the development, by third parties in the public or private sector, of certain categories of visitor attractions, visitor activities, and tourism infrastructure.  However, I am informed that the operational guidelines for this programme specifically state that the purchase of land or buildings is not eligible for funding.  The operational guidelines are the basis on which the Programme received approval from the European Commission under state aids rules.The management of the tourism capital investment programme is an operational matter for Fáilte Ireland.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	891	EU Directive 2009/40/EC requires that cars undergo a roadworthiness test when they are four years old and every two years thereafter.  Member States are also allowed to test more frequently and an annual NCT for cars ten years and older commenced with effect from 1 June 2011.  In accordance with the directive, under the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 567 of 2009), the test due date is calculated by reference to the date of first registration of the vehicle.I understand from the Road Safety Authority that factors such as non-use or failure to have a vehicle tested at the appropriate time, by either a current or previous owner, are immaterial in relation to determining test due dates. Where an NCT inspection does not take place on the original test due date, the NCT certificate is valid from the date of the test to the next test due date.  This can result in a certificate of less than one or two years duration, depending on when the car was presented for a test.  Currently, no provision exists to permit an extension of the period covered by a NCT certificate beyond the next test due date.As the Deputy will be aware, there is already a process in place for declaring cars off the road.  However, the current system is retrospective and open to abuse.  The introduction of a statutory pre-declaration will remove the potential for abuse of the system, by requiring cars to be declared off the road in advance of those cars being taken off the road.  This will mean that we will have confidence that cars which are declared off the road are actually off the road. As NCT testing is based on the testing of vehicles on their suitability for their usage on the public roads, it makes sense that the testing cycle would reflect their usage on the public roads.In light of this upcoming change in process, I have asked my officials to engage with the European Commission to allow an exemption for cars which are pre-declared to be off the road subsequent to the expiry of their NCT certificate and therefore temporarily withdrawn from service on public roads from the requirement that testing is on the anniversary of the registration date of the car.  Of course, underlining all this is that it is a road safety imperative that all vehicles are adequately maintained and fit for use on a public road and that there is public confidence in the testing system.

As far as the cost of obtaining a driving licence is concerned, there is no fee chargeable for those renewing their licence over the age of 70.  There are sound and internationally recognised reasons for requiring regular eye and medical tests for older drivers, as has been the practice in this jurisdiction since 1964.  As deterioration due to ageing can have detrimental effects on driving skills, it is generally recognised in Ireland, the EU and elsewhere that it is prudent to require medical certification of fitness to drive on a periodic basis for older drivers.

I have forwarded a copy of your question to the NTA for information.  Notwithstanding the NTA's statutory responsibilities, the Government recognises there is a need for the CIÉ companies to respond to the challenge of reduced PSO subvention funding, reduced fares income arising from reductions in passenger numbers and increased costs, such as fuel costs, which are outside their control.  As a general principle, it is my belief that efficiencies in operational costs should, in the first instance, be examined over fare increases and service reductions.While a recovery in passenger numbers could increase company revenues, all concerned in my Department and the NTA must focus on identifying key public transport priorities in our cities and across the country.  In turn, the PSO public transport service providers will have to achieve greater efficiency and cost effectiveness in the years ahead based on a realistic assessment of the scope and level of contracted services.  It is important to note that due to the financial constraints that the State is operating under, the level of the PSO subvention has been reduced in each of the past four years.  As outlined in the Comprehensive  Expenditure Report 2012-14 the funds available to support of scheduled public obligation services will be further reduced in 2013 and 2014.

It is illegal under the Tourist Traffic Acts for parks which are not registered to describe themselves as caravan parks or camping parks or a number of further protected titles.  To qualify for registration, parks must consist of 20 or more pitches and must comply and be operated in accordance with all the statutory requirements of local and other authorities including planning, health and safety, water supply, sewage disposal and fire precautions.  Only when parks meet these and the other minimum requirements set by Fáilte Ireland can they be registered as Caravan and Camping parks.However, it is not illegal under tourism legislation for a facility to operate once it does not describe itself using one of the protected titles and Fáilte Ireland has no statutory role in monitoring such facilities.  These facilities may in some cases be operating in contravention of other statutory requirements, e.g. planning, health and safety, fire, etc. In that regard, such potential breaches should be taken up with the appropriate authority, e.g. the relevant Local Authority with regard to possible breaches of planning regulations.  As registration of such parks is an operational matter for Fáilte Ireland, I have referred the Deputy's question to them for further information and direct reply.  If you do not hear from the agency within ten working days, please contact my private office.
