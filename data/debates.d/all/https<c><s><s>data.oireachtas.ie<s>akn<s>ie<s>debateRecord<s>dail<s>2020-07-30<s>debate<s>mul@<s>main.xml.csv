I am pleased, as Minister of State with responsibility for trade promotion, digital and company regulation, to present the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 for the consideration of the House following its successful passage through the Seanad. The Bill will provide for the first phase of measures intended to mitigate the impact Covid-19 has had on the normal operation of business in Ireland. Before proceeding with a summary of the detailed provisions, I would first like to offer some background and context to the Bill. As Deputies may be aware, a number of issues in the area of company law have come to the fore in light of the pandemic. From the onset of Covid-19, business closures my Department received a significant number of representations, including proposed amendments to the Companies Act intended to support companies as they respond to both the operational and economic challenges of the crisis. Similar issues have arisen with regard to industrial and provident societies, which are mostly co-operatives. Real, practical issues were raised in respect of the ability to hold annual general meetings, AGMs, in light of the public health guidelines on social distancing. AGMs are an important forum for members to approve the accounts, appoint auditors and hold the directors accountable for the affairs of the companies and co-operatives. In addition, general meetings need to be held if a company or co-operative is commencing a range of activities, for example, a merger or members' voluntary winding-up. The issue of AGMs has already been the subject of litigation. A company recently found itself before the court where a shareholder brought proceedings to challenge the intention to hold an AGM with restricted access. Concerns were also raised with regard business solvency. In terms of these concerns, I am sure the Deputies will have had the experience in their constituencies of businesses which were thriving and full of customers only a short time are now struggling to balance the books and keep money in their tills. Given that there are approximately 240,000 companies and 950 industrial and provident societies registered in Ireland, even if only a percentage encounter such difficulties, that provides clear evidence that a change is needed to ensure they can continue to comply with their obligations under the legislation and measures to alleviate the strain on their finances are required.My Department, in conjunction with the company law review group, CLRG, a statutory advisory body charged with advising the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on company law, has worked to find practical solutions to these issues as a matter of urgency. Efforts were focused on matters which could be concluded within a short timeframe and, as such, this Bill deals only with those items which were required immediately and capable of being progressed quickly. Extensive consultation took place with the CLRG, the membership of which is broad and represents key stakeholders in this area such as the Irish SME Association, IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners, insolvency practitioners, legal practitioners, academics and the Department. The group is uniquely well positioned to give a balanced view on the need for this legislation. In addition, my Department has consulted the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, which is one of the co-operative umbrella organisations. I will now turn to the provisions of the Bill. The main provisions can be broadly summarised as follows: to provide that the measures will be operative for an interim period up until 31 December 2020, with potential for extension; regulation-making power in respect of extending the interim period and amending the operational detail of virtual meetings; general meetings for companies and for industrial and provident societies, which are mainly co-operatives, may be held virtually; creditors' meetings may be held virtually; documents which are required to be executed under seal may now be executed in counterpart; increase the amount at which a statutory demand can be issued from €10,000 singularly or €20,000 aggregate to €50,000; and extension of the examinership process to a total of 150 days in exceptional circumstances and subject to court approval. Part 1 deals with preliminary and general provisions. It contains standard provisions, such as those relating to the Short Title and commencement. Sections 3 and 4 deal with the interim period. The interim period refers to the limited period during which the provisions of the Bill will be operational. This timeframe can be extended by Government order and different provisions may be extended by different times. The latter is important because it gives us the flexibility to respond to the changing nature of the crisis and its effect on companies. Section 5 makes a small but practical amendment to the Companies Act in the context of the sealing of documents. Under the Companies Act, there are a number of documents which must be executed under seal. This means they must have the company’s official seal affixed to the document and the document must be signed by the company director and secretary. As more and more people are working from home this has created situations where the signatories and seal are in separate locations. Now, documents may be signed and sealed on separate pages which will be counted as one single document for the purpose of the Act. This will reduce the administrative burden on companies. Sections 6 to 11 make provision for general meetings, including AGMs, to be held wholly by electronic means during the interim period. Such meetings may now be held by electronic means using online platforms such as Zoom or Webex or allowing people to dial in. Companies must guarantee the security of the platform used for the meeting as far as is reasonably possible. Provision is made for the details which must be included in the notice of a general meeting held by electronic means. Such notice must include details of how an attendee can access the platform used for the meeting, as well as any measures put in place by the company for security purposes. For example, some companies may provide attendees with personal identification numbers which they must enter to access the meeting. Further consequential amendments are made to the Companies Act to ensure those who participate in electronic meetings will be counted as part of the quorum. Companies will be afforded flexibility to reschedule meetings should this be deemed necessary by the directors in order to comply with public health advice from the Government. There may be smaller companies which can hold physical meetings and comply with social distancing guidelines. This provision is designed with them in mind should they schedule such a meeting and subsequently, further restrictions are announced. New provision is made for the withdrawal or amendment of dividend resolutions. Where a company has previously proposed to pay a dividend to shareholders but the impact of Covid-19 on the company’s finances makes this untenable, directors may withdraw or amend the dividend resolution. This will ensure that directors are empowered to make decisions for the long-term financial stability of the company. Finally, provision is also made for AGMs to be deferred until 31 December 2020. This is in line with measures taken at EU level as per Article 2 of Council Regulation 2020/699 on temporary measures concerning the general meetings of European Companies and of European Co-operative Societies adopted on 25 May 2020. Section 12 and 13 amend section 520 and 534 of the Companies Act and provide for an increase of 50 days to examinership, bringing the total period to 150 days. This is an important amendment intended to give companies additional breathing space to restructure, trade through the crisis and preserve employment. Section 15 amends section 570 of the Companies Act, which sets out the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts. Normally, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts when it has failed to pay debts of €10,000 in respect of a single creditor or €20,000 in the aggregate within 21 days of a statutory demand being delivered. It is at this point the company may be wound up by the court. Section 15 increases the threshold at which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts to €50,000 for one or more creditors. This amendment is intended to prevent companies which were previously viable from being would up for relatively low levels of debt. Sections 15 to 24, inclusive, deal with creditors' meetings under the Companies Act. Parts 9, 10 and 11 of the that Act provide for several circumstances in which these meetings must occur.For example, examiners and liquidators are appointed to call meetings of creditors at various stages in the respective processes. This Bill will allow such meetings to take place by electronic means for the duration of the interim period in line with what is provided in respect of general meetings. There are a number of consequential amendments made to sections which specifically reference creditors' meetings to include a reference to creditors' meetings held by means of electronic communications. Section 25 makes an amendment to section 1103 of the Companies Act, which provides for additional notice provisions required for general meetings of publicly traded companies. It includes additional information which must be provided should that meeting be held by electronic communications such as access details for the electronic platform. Section 26 makes a minor amendment to section 1106 of the Companies Act by replacing the words "provide for" with the word "guarantee" at section 4(a)(i).

The Minister of State will know that we were not happy previously when the Tánaiste did not attend. Today, again, he is not in attendance. This is a pattern. On the previous occasion on which I spoke on this, I stated that I sincerely hoped it was not a pattern. One would not need a microscope to figure out that there is a pattern here. It is disrespectful. I do not mean this disrespectfully to the Minister of State, who is here, but I would ask that he convey to his senior ministerial colleague our dissatisfaction that, once again, he has not seen fit to turn up to discuss his own legislation. We were asked to waive pre-legislative scrutiny in respect of this Bill, a request to which we acceded. There is clearly no desire on our part to delay or anything else. However, it has to be recorded once again that we are discussing legislation and the Tánaiste is not here. Sinn Féin broadly welcomes the Bill, the purpose of which is to address operational issues in respect of compliance that arise under the Companies Act 2014 and the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 2018 as a result of the Covid-19 public health emergency. These changes include providing for the ability to hold meetings, such as AGMs, by means of video technology, for the use of electronic communications in general during the interim period, increasing the debt threshold at which a company can be wound up and extending the examinership period. Those elements of the Bill which deal with instances in which companies and small businesses struggle with debt are to be welcomed. I suggest to the Minister of State that they be examined for permanent insertion into the legislation. This is something I would be interested in pursuing and I sincerely hope I will have an opportunity to discuss it further with the Minister of State. There is severe pressure on businesses' cash flow and the threshold at which they are deemed unable to pay their debts for the purpose of being wound up by the courts is extremely low in normal times, at €10,000. It is imperative that this threshold be increased during these extraordinary times. Some organisations, such as ISME, have been proposing changes to administrative insolvency whereby matters can be discussed between parties to achieve a resolution without going down the examinership route. As we move through the Covid crisis, organisations such as those representing SMEs and microbusinesses should be brought into the fold by the Department. They have a lot to offer on how we can help businesses get through this difficult period. They do not have all the answers and I certainly do not always agree with their perspective, most especially on the issue of workers' rights. That said, they can bring a unique perspective and they do need to be listened to. The Bill seeks to support as many businesses as possible with changes to the debt threshold at which a business can be wound up, thus helping them trade through the crisis, supporting their economic recovery and helping to preserve employment. However, as I have said previously, the preservation of employment cannot just be for its own sake. They have to be decent jobs that are worth having and that can help people to pay the bills. They should not be jobs that require long-term support from the State. Increasing the period of examinership by 50 days provides a similar support and will allow businesses additional breathing space within which to formulate restructuring plans. I would add, however, that much more needs to be done. Many SMEs, microbusinesses and small family concerns looked on at the July stimulus and were disappointed at what was announced, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of workers in the hospitality and accommodation sectors who were gravely disappointed by the Government's offering. Businesses were waiting weeks for the stimulus package and now that it has been announced, many are calling it a lost opportunity. Businesses are struggling to get back up and running. They have been calling out for liquidity injections through grants. Instead of a comprehensive and funded grant scheme, businesses are instead being asked to take on more debt through loans, which they say they cannot do. The July stimulus package involves a 4:1 debt-to-grant ratio. This flies in the face of what the Government has been advocating in Europe. The Taoiseach spent a full weekend preaching about the need for grants in Brussels, but when he comes home he talks only about debt. Businesses were calling out for an economic life buoy and, let us be honest, the Government has thrown them an anchor. The provisions in the Bill around the ability to hold meetings such as AGMs through video technology and for the use of electronic communications in general during the interim period will help to streamline proceedings for those businesses and are also necessary from health and safety perspective. These changes are welcome. They will make business operation much easier but will also offer proactive health and safety precautions for directors and board members. The speed with which the legislation is being rushed through to protect the health and safety of company directors and board members is, however, in stark contrast to the failure of the State to legislate to protect ordinary workers on the shop floor or the hospital ward or in the meat factory. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has been to the fore in campaigning for a simple change by way of regulation, not even legislation, to make workplace outbreaks of Covid-19 notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA. At the stroke of a pen in an office in Government Buildings, workers could have had additional protections for their health and safety. The former Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, refused to do this and the Tánaiste is now also refusing to make this change. Instances of Covid-19 in workplaces such as meat plants were rife during the lockdown period and many workers were put in danger because of the rapid development of clusters. Was there any emergency legislation rushed through for these workers? Not a single thing was done for their health and safety. Maybe if they wore suits and ties to work and carried briefcases there might have been a little more concern, but these people wear Snickers work wear and overalls. They are ordinary people. They just do not really get onto the Government's radar very often. The simple change that we and ICTU requested is that Covid-19 be designated as a notifiable illness in the meaning of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which essentially means that if one contracts Covid-19 in the course of one's work it is classified as an occupational injury. I would have thought that would be fairly plain. If one contracts an injury, disease or virus as a result of one's work, then it is an occupational injury. However, the Government seems reluctant to acknowledge that. It is our hope that the necessary regulations will be amended. That said, we are not pessimists but optimists with experience. We have legislation we will table if that becomes necessary. I want to refer briefly to the ESRI report which shows that workers such as carers, meat plant employees, taxi drivers, security guards, cleaners and migrant workers are most at risk of severe adverse outcomes from Covid-19. I call on the Government to work with the representative bodies and trade unions to ensure that policies and strategies are put in place to proactively protect the health, safety and welfare of workers in work and not just company directors. The ESRI report also highlights the hypocrisy of the Government when it comes to how different categories of worker from different sectors have been treated. They can see that. They look in here and see what is going on. There are only 67 Health and Safety Authority inspectors available to carry out inspections of the return to work safety protocol. This protocol was designed to support employers and protect workers as they return to work. It was developed following a high-level dialogue involving the ICTU and employer representatives. It has really good information and safety recommendations. The HSA was tasked with carrying out return to work safety protocol inspections but it only has 67 inspectors, as I found out from a ministerial response to a parliamentary question. This situation is farcical. It makes a mockery of the protocol and puts workers and their health at risk. We need to get real about workers' rights during Covid-19. We need to protect the worker in the supermarket or meat factory just as much as the company director in the International Financial Services Centre. The Bill is welcome. Aspects of it will make significant changes that will be good in the context of protecting public health and businesses during this crisis. However, it is only the tip of the iceberg in the context of what must be done to protect workers and support businesses. While I have the opportunity in the context of this Bill, I wish to make reference to the company that runs the Houses, namely, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. Last night, the commission met for the first time. There were eight nominees to it between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party. I doubt anyone in this establishment, particularly the women, will be surprised or shocked in any way, but I regret to inform the House that the four parties did not nominate a solitary woman. What message does that send out from this institution? The message Sinn Féin sends out is that we have no difficulty nominating women to such positions, given that I was nominated by my party and its leader. On the one hand, the Oireachtas is telling corporate bodies that they need to be mindful of diversity and inclusion and, on the other, it is a case of jobs for the boys and more of the same. We have to lead by example. We cannot stand here and talk about equality only to fail to back that up. There was not one woman from those four parties. They had eight nominees between them, but they could not find even one woman whom they could nominate to the company that runs the Oireachtas. Will the Minister of State go to his parliamentary party and his Government partners and see if they can do better and try harder?

It appears to those of us in opposition that it is beneath him to address matters pertaining to his Department in the Oireachtas. It is approximately two weeks since he took a swipe at the Labour Party's proposal to introduce legislation in reference to the High Court decision on sectoral employment orders. He dismissed it as virtue signalling. I have been waiting for an opportunity on the floor of the House to take him to task for that remark. We have had two sessions of Private Members' business on the broad theme of employment rights, one tabled by the Social Democrats and another in the form of a motion relating to the Debenhams workers from Solidarity-People Before Profit. We have also had the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill. Despite all of those debates, I am still waiting for an opportunity to engage with the Tánaiste. There are themes that other political parties in the Dáil and I want to return to under the broad umbrella of the economy, employment rights and company legislation, but if the Tánaiste is not present for at least part of those debates, he will not hear those messages or be influenced by them. That is not in any way a reflection on the entire team in his Department, and I respect the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, very much, but it undermines what we are trying to achieve when the Tánaiste does not seem to be minded to address issues raised in the House and pertaining to him. We have studied this Bill and proposed no amendments to it because we view it as timely and necessary. I note the level of consultation that the Department has had with various stakeholders in order to ensure that the legislation is robust, is necessary and can operate effectively. However, I will make a point about how the economy and business will change in light of remote working, online meetings, etc. There is a growing assumption that the manner in which businesses operated remotely or how meetings took place remotely over the course of the pandemic was 100% positive. Although it was positive to see a reduction in traffic and the amount of time workers spent commuting and it was positive that people could spend more time at home, what happened was not universally positive. In some circumstances-----

If, however, a company decides that a worker can in all circumstances work remotely and connect remotely to the workplace, that is something which will need to be regulated heavily by the Government and via legislation. There may be overcrowded housing, the workers may be young or may not necessarily have access to the appropriate materials or IT equipment. In addition, workers may not be able to connect remotely or may be uncomfortable doing so. We need strong regulation and oversight of this issue because, as the Minister of State knows, the market has no conscience. Therefore, how companies operate their interactions will need to be heavily regulated if the workplace is to be radically different in future. We appreciate the motivation behind the Bill, but, like Deputy O'Reilly, we hope that other areas of company law, oversight and employment legislation will be dealt with as speedily. We are still awaiting a Government response to the Duffy Cahill report on issues surrounding Clerys, Debenhams and HMV, matters that were referenced recently during Private Member's business. It is this sort of speed that makes the public realise what the Government's priority is. While we have no issue with the speed with which this Bill is being dealt, if every legislative measure governing employment law and workers' rights was dealt with as speedily, there would be a sense across all sectors of society that the Government was even-handed and would respond to the needs of employers and employees equally. Some of us would rather it if the Government spent more time listening to the concerns of employees than employers, but if the speed was seen to be even-handed across the spectrum, there would not be the sense of alienation from the political system and legislation that governs the way people work. There is a sense that if one is a captain of industry or a company director, one's access to the Cabinet, the decision makers and those who prioritise legislation is swifter, whereas if one is a shop steward or trade union representative, one's access is not as swift and one cannot get what is necessary done. The Duffy Cahill report was published in 2017, but here we are in 2020 and the issues it covered are still surfacing. To summarise, it is important that the Minister of State convey to the Tánaiste our disappointment regarding his failure to attend. A number of issues have arisen in recent weeks but the latter has not been present. If he does not hear the messages from this Chamber, he will not react positively to them. We welcome the Bill and have not tabled amendments to it, but we must be careful about how the sector is regulated in future so that we do not fall into an assumption that all elements of remote working are positive. We must be mindful of unreasonable burdens being placed on workers, in particular young ones, in terms of how they interact with the labour force. My third point relates to the swift way in which this legislation is being dealt with versus long delays in addressing issues concerning amoral actions of businesses in overriding workers' rights.We will not be tabling any amendments and will be supporting the Bill but I hope the Minister of State will take the comments of the Labour Party on board and relay them to the senior Minister.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	9	In the midst of the pandemic we all have to change our behaviour with public health in mind. The relaxation of rules within the Companies Act is necessary and appropriate. The provisions of the Bill appear to be in line with what the Secretary General of the Department, Dr. Orlaigh Quinn, suggested would be needed in her statement to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response. The term she used then was “practical workarounds” which is an apt description for what is being presented today. I am quite sure the drafters of the primary Act had no reason to suspect that in a few short years we would find ourselves in a situation where the basic norms, like an organisation’s ability to hold an annual general meeting, AGM, in person would be called into question. Indeed, I understand the situation has already given rise to a legal action in the case of a company that attempted to restrict the attendance of its shareholders to its AGM. With this in mind there is a clear need for the provisions, such as sections 6 to 11, inclusive, which allow general meetings such as AGMs to be held wholly by electronic means during the interim period. It is very important with electronic means that there is no attempt to exclude and this is an issue that has been spoken about already. Equally, section 5 of the Bill will amend the legislation surrounding the execution of documents under seal by allowing signatories to sign and seal separate pages which will then be considered a single document. The practical benefits from measures like these for the day-to-day administration of certain companies are definitely clear. However, I would be lying if I did not say that I was concerned by the modesty of what has been brought forward here today. While the provisions of this Bill are fine in and of themselves, I worry that they represent a larger paralysis in the response to the pandemic. It is an unfortunate fact that there are many aspects of our day-to-day lives which we took for granted and are simply no longer viable for the foreseeable future. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am struggling with some noise here in the Chamber. Can I ask for some quiet-----
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	10	My apologies, Deputy, it is my fault as I should have stopped it. Can we have a little quiet, please? This is difficult as the noise is not coming my way but is going the direction of the speakers.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	11	It is the way the sound carries in the Chamber. This is undoubtedly a challenging thing to accept but as lawmakers our primary focus should not be to slavishly attempt to keep things as close as possible to how they functioned before the pandemic. Instead, we need to look at how things can best be structured in our laws and legal system to respond to our new reality. This would require a root and branch approach as to how the primary Act should function during the pandemic. Looking at the legislation we are discussing today I am not convinced that this has been fully considered. There are around 240,000 companies registered in Ireland and even if only a small percentage of these find themselves insolvent during this crisis we could find thousands of companies struggling to navigate the terms of the primary Act. This Act, we should remember, is a key foundation document of our company law and amendments to it, or indeed a failure to make necessary changes in a timely manner, have the potential to make a significant impact both positive and negative on the functioning of companies in crisis. I note that during the debate on the Bill on Second Stage in the Seanad the Minister of State attempted to justify the limited scope on the basis that efforts were focused on matters which could be concluded within a shorter timeframe. As such, this Bill deals only with those items which were required immediately and which are capable of being progressed quickly. This viewpoint is clearly evident in what we have been presented with today but in a time of crisis something so arbitrary as to when it is decided to vote the Dáil into recess is not an excuse to put things on the long finger. I would have hoped that this would have given the Minister of State and his Department a stronger impetus to immediately move to address other issues which fall within his remit. Unfortunately, the opposite appears to be true.  This was highly evident in the Government’s amendment to a motion to support the Debenhams workers last week. Instead of committing to concrete actions this Government reaffirmed that its intention to review the Companies Act 2014 at some point with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property, with the result that the trading business, including the jobs, goes into insolvency and the assets are taken out of the original business.  The same kind of thing happened with examinership in respect of CityJet, for example. Our examinership system has preferred the parent company in the Cayman Islands, which will be protected by Irish law. The problem is that the very high-skilled Irish jobs will cease to exist here and will exist in one of the Nordic countries, although I cannot remember exactly which one. Essentially, our company law is protecting a company in the Cayman Islands at the expensive of jobs here. There are very big issues that need to be dealt with. I am deeply concerned that we may be on the cusp of a significant insolvency crisis and as a result we may see an upswing in these sorts of predatory practices which gave rise to the Duffy Cahill report in the first place. It is not acceptable that a Department at the forefront of an economic response to the pandemic is content to be rearranging the deck chairs while we barrel towards an iceberg. We need more than housekeeping and promises of further reviews. This opportunity, for example, could have been used to introduce a range of new legislation which has been in the Department for years, or a larger scale amendment to this piece of legislation. Just last week we saw issues with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement laid bare in its action in the High Court, all the while the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill remains in limbo. Alternatively, a much simpler piece of legislation could have been introduced to address the deficiencies in the Companies Act with regard to section 599 which allows, in appropriate circumstances, the court to make an order that any company that is or has been related to the company being wound up shall pay to the liquidator of that company an amount equivalent to the whole or part of all or any of the debts provable in that winding up. I was reminded of this section when the Minister of State referred to it in quoting the Duffy Cahill report in his speech on the Debenhams workers motion last week. He stated that the report found that the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 that are already available do not appear to be in need of amendment but more in need of use. He did not, however, include the sentences that followed that passage which stated: It is striking that many of the provisions of the Companies Act which may be of assistance are not frequently invoked (such as section 608) or are not invoked at all (such as section 599). The reason for this appears to relate to the costs and risks associated with such applications, rather than the formulation of the provisions themselves. For this reason, one of our proposals includes conferring power on the Minister, as creditor of an insolvent employer (having paid the employee claims through the Social Insurance Fund), to delegate the taking of statutory applications to a liquidator and to provide funding to the liquidator for that purpose. I argue that this would have been a fine opportunity to do just that and confer such powers on the Minister.If a legal remedy cannot effectively be utilised with the frequency with which it is intended, it is not fit for purpose. This is a point from the CLRG with which I disagree. The approach was to examine whether the section has the power to fulfil its purpose solely in a legal sense, whereas this House should instead focus on the effectiveness and impact. I see my time has expired but there will probably be an opportunity on Committee Stage to make some further contributions.

The Government has said it is important and addresses a real gap in legislation to deal with technical issues concerning the impact of Covid-19 on companies legislation. That is all well and good and I congratulate the Government on moving quickly to address this gap and dealing promptly with the difficulties facing companies during the Covid-19 pandemic. I also congratulate the Government on all the efforts made over the past few months with much difficult legislation, some of which was over 100 pages long and very complex. This proves that where there is a political will, there is a legislative way. I submitted a very short amendment to this Bill that has been ruled out of order. A similar short amendment was submitted by Sinn Féin, borrowed from a Sinn Féin Bill languishing in a legislative graveyard since the end of the previous Dáil. It is not a complex amendment but it would have made a very real difference to many thousands of workers and their families. Workers in this country face a tsunami of redundancy in the coming months and thousands will be hit by insolvency and lay-offs. The amendment sought to give those workers some added protection and place workers ahead of debtors and creditors in an insolvency. However, such an act seems to be irrelevant to this House. It is five years since the Clerys workers were victims of greed and a mugging by corporate thugs and four years since the publication of the Duffy Cahill report. That report did not explicitly recommend the reordering of preferential creditors but it covered in detail one measure that might give some comfort to workers facing a crisis like this in their lives. It recommended that workers should be put ahead of other creditors in other employment legislation. What have the Houses of the Oireachtas done with this since? Zilch, or absolutely nothing. Nada has been done for the workers. There is no intention from Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to put the interests of workers ahead of the interests of companies. Stripped of rhetoric, it is very clear those parties do not really give a damn. Debenhams workers have been on strike for more than 110 days now, victims of a tactical insolvency. As one of those workers put it, this is a contrived situation. They are collateral damage in a war between a consortium of debtors, including our own Bank of Ireland, and immensely rich stakeholders. Assets, stocks and figures on balance sheets have been moved around like pieces on a chessboard while workers' lives and the lives of their families are being seriously damaged. These workers have given decades of service, helping to make millions of euro of profit for these companies and shareholders. This is not a political priority for this Government, as it was not for the previous Government. Not in this Bill or any other legislation will workers in positions of contrived insolvency qualify as emergency cases. We fully support these workers and we know they will not go away and will continue their fight. We know that fight will be seen and their actions will make a difference for our workers. If we had an Oireachtas that cared about workers, their families and their lives, the amendment would have been allowed and we could discuss it in detail. It is a simple measure that could have helped to deal with those workers.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	16	It is the final day of this Dáil session before the summer recess and we are discussing changes to the Companies Act, which is clearly a top priority for the Minister and the Government. I do not have any issue with these changes being put through the House quickly but they stand in stark contrast to the foot-dragging in changes that must be made to legislation to protect worker interests, including interests in positions of company liquidation. It is long overdue for legislation to be passed through the House to make workers priority creditors, top of the list and first in the pecking order in cases of company liquidation. Such legislation should ban businesses from using tactical insolvency by putting all the losses into one side of a company that has been split, shutting it down and keeping the assets in other ways for the company. The Clerys case indicated that change was required and five years on, Debenhams workers also need those changes. What do we have from the Government? Nothing. Even this Act, which deals with matters arising because of the Covid-19 pandemic, could have included a proposal banning the types of liquidation I describe during cases of lockdown but such a provision is absent. The programme for Government indicates there will be a review of these matters but the Duffy Cahill report has already been done. Its recommendations could and should have been speedily implemented before this summer recess. When will we see legislation arising from the report put before this Dáil? The Minister of State met representatives of the Debenhams workers' union last Wednesday and undertook at the meeting to explore the possibility of improving the package currently on the table, which is the bare minimum statutory redundancy. We are eight days on from the meeting and I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could report to the House, for the benefit of those workers, on what progress, if any, he has made on this front over the course of the past week. There has been much activity in Debenhams shops in the past 24 hours and overnight. For example, personnel from KPMG and others went into the shop in Limerick at 3 a.m. There are many indications that stock will be moved. The Minister of State should be very clear that these workers are determined and their resolve is very strong. Bank holiday weekend or none, no stock will be removed from those shops until there is a just settlement of four weeks of pay per year of service, at a minimum, for those workers.

It would be very unfortunate if we made a decision on it without any debate. I think it would be wrong to proceed with the proposal in question. It was agreed between the Government and Sinn Féin representatives at the committee dealing with Dáil reform and saw dissent at that meeting from me and Deputies Catherine Murphy and Thomas Pringle. This proposal would marginalise all groups from the Opposition other Sinn Féin and the Labour Party. It changes the speaking order on Second Stage of a Bill in a very important way. It means that between every Opposition slot after the Labour Party, there is an extra slot for the Government and Sinn Féin. Currently, before Solidarity and People Before Profit Members speak on Second Stage of a Bill, there is a slot for each of the Government, Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and the Social Democrats. With this proposal, before we get to speak, the Government will have had four bites of the cherry in four different speaking slots. Sinn Féin would also get four, which is why, so far, the party has agreed with the proposal. By the time it gets to the Independent groups, the Government and Sinn Féin will have had seven speaking slots. That is before an organised point of view within this Dáil gets a chance to put forward its position. This is not a question of speaking time, as we have no problem with the Government and Sinn Féin getting as much speaking time as they need, but of the order in which speakers can contribute and of the Opposition not being marginalised. I appeal to the Government and Sinn Féin to withdraw the proposal and not push it today. With this Bill we have a missed opportunity to do something for the Debenhams workers. Five years, one month and two weeks ago, the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, stated the shutdown of Clerys was unethical and immoral.He said it spoke to "a lack of any respect for workers".

I hope we have many useful exchanges during the course of this Dáil. A briefing was organised yesterday, so to some extent events may have overtaken my question, but not all my concerns were addressed. There is still significant concern that the calculations model will be affected by a school having had low results in the past or by its disadvantaged background. Even gender appears to be a factor. We do not know what the model is. It has not been published. I have asked the Minister to publish it. She has not done so. I have asked the steering group to publish it. I believe it should be published because students deserve to know how grades are being calculated.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	20	The purpose of the calculated grades system is to arrive at the grade each student would have achieved if the leaving certificate examinations had taken place as normal. Students' expected performance in a subject and level is combined with information about how students in a school have fared in the subject in recent years in line with national performance standards over time and with their performance in the junior certificate. Using a range of different but complementary sources of data will provide the most accurate and fair set of results possible. No single pattern of expected results will determine the calculated grades on its own. The model will combine the range of patterns to generate the grades in a way which is as reasonable, fair and accurate to students as possible. The design of the calculated grades model was informed by advice from a technical working group comprising experts drawn from the State Examinations Commission, the inspectorate of my Department, the Educational Research Centre and international external experts. While these data sets do include certain demographic information, this demographic information is not being used as part of the process of generating the calculated grades through the standardisation process. However, to make sure that the standardisation process is doing what it is supposed to do, a separate and additional process of validation is being carried out. Validation serves to ensure that the statistical standardisation process presents results that are fair, equitable and in line with previous outcomes to the greatest extent possible. It also serves to check whether the model is resulting in any particular group being advantaged or disadvantaged relative to previous years. The use of demographic characteristics, including gender and the socioeconomic status of the school, was inherent in the technical working group's design of the calculated grades model. Not to run these checks would run the risk of not being able to tell whether the standardisation process is working to ensure that the leaving certificate results of 2020 are properly comparable with leaving certificate results in any other year. My Department has published a short guide to data collection, national standardisation and quality assurance which provides further details about the workings of the calculated grades model. This is available online.

I have had concerns about calculated grades in the past. I recognise the difficult situation and I had numerous conversations with the Minister's predecessor on what should happen next. I have particular concerns around school profiling. My concern is that young adults applying for their place in university will not get it and students who might not fail the leaving certificate otherwise will do so. We have been assured that these statistics will not be used, that they are only there to kick the tyres of the system, as it were, and check that it is working. However, the first document the Department produced stated that grades will be adjusted taking things like demographics and gender into account. All subsequent documents repeated this. It is quite reasonable that people are concerned, especially when the model has not been published. I have requested its publication so it can be subject to public scrutiny and we can all understand how the different inputs will affect an individual leaving certificate student or class. They deserve to know. There must be transparency here.

I must reiterate that all possible checks and balances have been put in place to ensure that the calculated grades model is a fair and equitable system. The 2020 leaving certificate will have the same high quality and integrity as the 2019 leaving certificate and indeed that of 2021 and other future years. While these data sets include certain demographic information, it is not being used as part of the process of generating the calculated grades through the standardisation process. However, to make sure that the standardisation process is doing what it is supposed to do, a completely separate process, referred to as validation, is being carried out.

If the model fails the validation and does not produce the result we expect from a particular demographic or gender, there will have to be adjustments. Grades will either have to go down or go up. That has real implications for students. It really is not good enough. The Minister has not answered my primary question. There is a model. It deserves to be subject to public scrutiny. Why will the Minister not publish the statistical model? It is complex and technical, but there are many people in the public sphere who could take a view on it and inform the public discourse on whether it is fair. We can all think of examples of exceptional students within classes with weak results, or exceptional classes that might have bucked the trend. They were depending on their ability to perform in exams. That is gone now. How can they have any confidence that this model can guarantee fairness? I recently came across a class where there had never been a grade higher than a C in agricultural science. There were five A1 grades in the class's leaving certificate results. There is no junior certificate in agricultural science. How could junior certificate results have told us that class would perform so well? We must have confidence. Will the Minister publish the model so we can all scrutinise it?

The point was not really addressed by either Minister during the debate. What is the Department doing about this, beyond the minor works and adjustment grant? Has it carried out an audit of schools with a disproportionate lack of space for which additional classrooms will need to be built or hired?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	27	As the Deputy is aware, yesterday I announced the roadmap for the full return to school, along with more than €370 million in funding to support primary and post-primary schools as they prepare for reopening. It is recognised that in preparing for full reopening schools may require some reconfiguration works to ensure that all available space, including class space, is used to maximise physical distancing safely. Adaption works may include, but are not limited to, reconfiguration of classroom space, repurposing rooms to provide additional space, adapting storage facilities, purchasing furniture, altering desk layouts and adapting toilet areas. As each school setting is different, a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate. Individual schools are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfiguration works. As part of the package of supports, additional teachers are being provided to support the reopening of primary schools in order to provide enhanced substitution and eliminate the need to mix classes when a teacher is absent. Supply panels are being established nationwide. These will be monitored in terms of the number of teachers and the location of each panel. Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils, which is at its historically lowest level. In terms of operating in this school year, schools will be required to look at maximising all available physical space, particularly to accommodate larger classes. Examples of class layouts have been provided to support schools. The minor works grant is being provided to assist schools if they need to reconfigure classrooms or undertake other work. Schools will also be required to look at how classes are organised in terms of sizes, and this may require some reorganisation of class groupings. My Department absolutely will work with any school that needs extra support when other options are not feasible, and this may involve additional teachers or extra accommodation in some cases.
#DonnchadhOLaoghaire	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-party	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-dob	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	28	As a brief aside, I was just outside with the parents, staff and board of management of Firhouse Educate Together. An illustration of the situation we have found ourselves in over many years is the fact that there has been demographic growth but the Department has been too slow in planning for a new school building. Consequently, that school is being forced to move all the way to Citywest, a choice that is not sustainable for many parents. People are concerned about the sustainability of the school. I ask the Minister to examine the position of that particular school. I take note of the final part of the Minister's answer that additional teachers and space will be provided. I would like her to tell me more about that. There is scope for reconfiguration within many schools. Cabinets can be moved and rooms being used for different purposes can be reconfigured but other schools cannot do the miracle of the loaves and fishes. The space simply is not available. In Christian Brothers schools from the 1950s and 1960s, the corridors are extremely narrow and the buildings are tight. They are nowhere near 60 sq. m or even 80 sq. m. It is clear that additional physical space will be required in some schools. Is there an audit or will there be an audit to establish the schools that urgently need not just reconfiguring but additional space?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	29	Again, I confirm that substantial resources are going into schools to facilitate schools doing what needs to be done on the ground. I include in that, as we have already outlined, the €75 million that has been made available through the minor works grant. That funding is significant and substantial. In the first instance, it is a doubling of the minor works grant funding to primary schools and it is a similar but new strand of funding for second-level schools. There is great potential for schools to reconfigure and re-examine. For example, there are opportunities to declutter within the classroom. There are opportunities to look at additional space within the campus of the school and to look outside of that, where necessary. I accept that where there are exceptional cases all schools are invited to engage with the Department. There is a helpline for schools to allow them to flag individual needs within their schools. The resources and the supports are available. Everything that needs to be done will be done to ensure that schools can maximise their space and that there is every opportunity and expectation, which I know can be realised, that there will be a full and safe reopening of schools at the end of August or in early September.

Not every school can convert a room or make extra space within a classroom. The grant will deal with issues such as hot water also, and that is welcome, but it will not satisfy every need. I believe the Minister knows that. For schools in that position, the undertaking they will have to make in the next few weeks is so enormous that we cannot simply refer to local solutions and so on. There is a need for local solutions but far too often the issue is the response of the Department of Education and Skills. There is an element of throw the ball in and leave the board of management and the school at it. Space will need to be found. Buildings will need to be found. Temporary accommodation will need to be put in and it does not appear that the Department knows the location of that. An audit needs to be done very quickly. I will give the Minister an example of a school in my constituency, which was built in 1961. Two thirds of the classrooms are under 50 sq. m and approximately one third of them are under 40 sq. m. Some of them are only 18 sq. m, 20 sq. m and 25 sq. m. Schools like that do not have a clue how they will manage this requirement. My final point is that there is a programme for Government commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio. We put down a motion on that on Tuesday night and the Minister has hardly commented on it. We are in the middle of a pandemic that has underlined the danger in having oversized classrooms. Does the Minister intend to tackle pupil-teacher ratios in this budget? Does she intend to reduce oversized classes? That needs to happen for social distancing and safety but for educational reasons also.

Budget 2018 provided for a further point improvement to the staffing schedule so that teachers are allocated on a general average of one teacher for every 26 pupils, with effect since September 2018. This is the lowest pupil-teacher ratio ever at primary school. I am very conscious of the staffing schedule and the need to prioritise teacher allocations in primary schools given their vital role in communities across the country. I am looking at how best to make further progress in reducing the primary school teacher-pupil ratio in the context of the programme for Government implementation. I will continue to look at that in the context of the budget as we move forward.

Primary and secondary schools throughout the country will have to employ extra cleaning staff due to the imminent reopening of schools.

The range of supports being made available to schools includes additional financial supports to provide for additional staffing, management supports, enhanced cleaning, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment, PPE, costs under the Covid-19 response plans. A Covid-19-specific capitation payment will be used as the mechanism to support the implementation of enhanced cleaning regimes in schools, with close to an additional €53 million for this purpose.  This will be provided on a sliding scale in line with pupil enrolments as at 30 September 2019, with €63 per mainstream pupil at primary level and €40 per pupil and post-primary level. Arrangements have also been made for a drawdown framework to be established to enable schools to purchase hand sanitisers and other PPE supplies for use in the school and classroom from pre-approved suppliers. The procurement process for this framework has already commenced, and it is intended that these materials will be available in early August. The funding for these materials will be provided in the form of a grant which will issue in instalments, the first of which will issue from mid-August to cover the period to December 2020. Enhanced Covid-19 rates are payable in respect of students attending special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools to assist with the extra costs associated with the cleaning of classrooms operating in specialist provision.

Like every other Deputy, I have been inundated with calls in recent weeks from schools - in Belgooly, Bandon, Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Castletownbere, Kilcrohane, Schull and Ballydehob, to name but a few in west Cork - and not just with regard to this issue. In fairness, the Minister has provided clarity with regard to many of those schools, and I will ask more questions later this evening on the private school sector. I am aware of the difficulty schools face in getting funds, having been on a board of management for years. It is sad and disappointing to see parents' associations and boards of management fundraising to fill the oil tanks and pay the secretaries and the cleaning staff. In this situation with Covid-19, they cannot be short-changed in terms of getting their schools up to a standard of cleanliness. I hope the budget the Minister has outlined will be enough to allow these schools to carry out this work without asking boards of management and parents' associations to fundraise.

I appreciate the pressures on schools and parents. Every effort is being made to ensure substantial funding is put in place to ensure no additional burden is placed on the school or on parents. There is a budget of €53 million for cleaning and all that involves, which is a substantial package of funding. We have also put in place further aid to ensure schools will be in a position to employ extra personnel in the month of August to help them to do the work that needs to be done on the ground. A further €4.3 million is being made available for that. It is a substantial resource and I have every confidence it will be well drawn down and well utilised by the schools.

Will the Minister clarify this?

The roadmap is inclusive of all schools whether urban or rural. I come from a constituency that marries both so I am greatly conscious that the packages are made available on an urban and rural basis. A key innovation, perhaps more to the benefit of rural schools is the additional one day which will be given to teaching principals which is something of which they are richly deserving, and takes cognisance of the burden placed on them by the administrative work they need to do. A suite of measures has been put in place to the benefit of both urban and rural schools and for the benefit, most especially, of the children and young people that we serve in the education sector, irrespective of whether they are urban or rural.

One of the biggest is school transport. Some 120,000 children are carried every year by school transport programmes. Among any of the operators I have spoken to there is very little clarity and they have had very little communication on how that will be delivered. There is additional money but it seems to be for reconfiguration and hygiene, there does not seem to be anything in relation to capacity. Will the same number of children as a last year be carried on school transport this year? Can the Minister make that commitment?

In the 2019-2020 school year more than 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million km at a cost of over €219 million in 2019. Earlier this week I announced a comprehensive plan detailing a package of measures and resources to be provided to facilitate schools in reopening. I also published a detailed roadmap for the full return to school. This roadmap set outs how schools will reopen for all students from the end of August. It has been developed in line with public health advice issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, the Roadmap for Society and Business, and follows comprehensive and intensive engagement with all relevant stakeholders, including Bus Éireann, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority on the logistical considerations that arise in planning for the operation of school transport services for the reopening of our schools. School transport scheme services operated by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department will fully operate as normal, in line with public health advice, when schools reopen for the 2020-2021 school year with the appropriate hygiene and other measures in place. In line with normal practice, all children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who complete the application and payment process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated, such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. All school transport services are reviewed over the summer months. Arising from this, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year.  The option to make payment for transport for the 2020-2021 school year is now available. Given the exceptional circumstances I have asked Bus Éireann to extend the closing date for payment to 4 August 2020. Families wishing to avail of transport for the 2020-2021 year are advised to make payment by this date.

He was speaking about whether he thought any additional capacity could be found and he expressed some scepticism. He is a stakeholder and I would hope that any engagement would have included unions such as the NBRU. He, like most of us, would have anticipated additional capacity. It would seem obvious, so many of us were left scratching our heads when the only thing in the roadmap published on Monday was money for hygiene and reconfiguration. That does not seem to be living in the real world. The deadline has been moved, and that is welcome, but 4 August is not very far away. Most parents and schools feel in the dark here. I ask the Minister directly, having asked her before and she did not answer, whether the school transport scheme will carry the same number of children or will parents and families be seeking refunds from Bus Éireann in late August and September. Will 120,000 children be carried?

The plans that are in place for school transport are absolutely based on the public health advice available. It has recommended that children are regarded as a single cohort, will be given designated seats on the bus to and from school, they will sit with a sibling or class member, and €11.3 million in funding will be available to ensure that hand sanitiser, PPE for the bus driver, the intensive clean that must be done after children have vacated the bus, will all be covered. The provision for the buses to operate as normal is on the basis of the public health advice recommendation and availability. It is operating, as all the roadmap is operating, on the public health advice that is given and provided.

The Minister mentioned everyone who applies, but what if for any reason the capacity must be reduced. The providers, Bus Éireann, taxis and various companies, will have their own considerations. I asked the Minister this question which is what parents want to know. Of course they want to know about safety, where they will be sitting and so on, and the Minister has told us some of that detail, but that is all they know. What I want to know is whether all those children will have a place this September. Those concessionary places are important too. For many families they are the make or break provision, not some frivolous or trivial issue. I ask the direct question again: how many children will avail of school transport this September? Will 120,000 children avail of it this September? It is a very clear, simple question. I have asked it twice, but the Minister has not answered it. Will the Minister answer it please?

All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who complete the application and payment process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated. Such seats, as the Deputy is aware, are referred to as concessionary seats. That is a very clear answer - all children who are eligible.

I seek further detail on this commitment, including when will this be established, its terms of reference and the timescale for its sittings.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	47	I am particularly pleased to see the inclusion of a citizens' assembly on the future of education in the programme for Government. Experience internationally and here at home of citizens' assemblies as exercises in deliberative democracy have been extremely positive. Ireland is considered a leader in the use of deliberative democracy processes, having convened three in recent years, namely the Convention on the Constitution 2012 to 2014, the Citizens’ Assembly 2016 to 2018 and the ongoing Citizens' Assembly on gender equality which commenced in 2019. The first two exercises led to referendums being held on four issues, namely, reducing the age threshold for presidential candidates, marriage equality, removal of the offence of blasphemy and the eighth amendment. Typically, citizens' assemblies have been established by individual Oireachtas resolutions which have set out their terms of reference. I understand that initial proposals to hold a citizens' assembly on education have been informed by proposals from the Burren College of Art, which called for the assembly to examine issues such as how to properly position post-primary education for the 21st century and how to encourage greater creativity, student agency and resilience. My three-year strategy and annual implementation plan will incorporate priority actions from the programme for Government, including the citizens' assembly on the future of education. I aim to publish this strategy later this year.

Our nervousness is that when a conservative Department meets a conservative Minister, the possibility of a radical overhaul of our education system may be affected. Such an overhaul could lead to having equality at the centre of the system and addressing its constitutional underpinning, which ensures that we do not really have a State education system. We will not necessarily have the opportunity to deal with that in a radical way. I was hoping that the proposed citizens' assembly could deal with the constitutional underpinning of the education system. In her response, the Minister did not give a timeline as to when the citizens' assembly will meet. I ask again what is the Minister's ambition for its establishment, sitting and terms of reference? I am sure she has an opinion on the matter.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	49	I come from a strong education background and I believe strongly in educational equality and inclusiveness. I am a fan of the Citizens' Assembly and I will be hugely supportive of a citizens' assembly on the future of education because I believe in the democracy that it will represent. The terms of reference for the education citizens' assembly will be set out in the Oireachtas resolution establishing it. This will be informed by the views of all the relevant partners. That is fair and as it should be. Based on previous assemblies, the citizens' assembly on the future of education could be wide ranging, including constitutional issues, or it could focus on very specific areas of interest. Consultation informing the Oireachtas resolution could also consider whether the focus of the assembly should cover learning from cradle to grave or the primary and post-primary sectors. The other citizens' assemblies have considered constitutional provisions in relevant areas and a similar approach could be adopted for an education assembly. Other sources for topics could include the range of education-related commitments in the programme for Government, many of which are likely to generate considerable public interest and could benefit from debate in a citizens' assembly forum. It is worth noting that any such discussion in an assembly will complement rather than replace existing and extensive partner engagement fora in the sector. These include the work of the inspectorate and listening to the views of pupils, the primary education forum, industrial relations engagement mechanisms and our work with partners in responding to the pandemic.

My problem is in predicting our engagement with the Minister. Over the next period when we raise something that could radically overhaul the education system or bring in legislation that could enhance equality provisions within education, her go-to answer could very easily be that we will deal with the matter in the citizens' assembly. What I need from her is a commitment on when she wants the citizens' assembly to be established. Even if she could name a year, I would appreciate it. The last thing I or any Deputy wants to do is have a policy, motion or Bill before the House and for the Minister to pick up a script saying the citizens' assembly is the best place to deal with it. I ask the Minister to give me a year by which she hopes the citizens' assembly will have started its deliberation.

I share that enthusiasm because of the Citizens' Assembly's democratic and inclusive nature. At this point, four weeks into the job, I intend to formulate a three-year strategy and annual implementation plan which will incorporate priority actions from the programme for Government. This will include at its centre the citizens' assembly on the future of education. I will publish the details of that before the end of the year.

This is a problem that predates Covid and the plan to reopen schools in September. I welcome the recent announcement the Minister made regarding 1,080 additional teachers for post-primary schools. Will she provide the House with details on how these posts will be made available to schools?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	53	My Department is working with education partners on measures to address anticipated teacher supply pressures arising from additional posts in the system and to meet the demand for teachers to fill short-term substitutable vacancies. I reiterate that the additional posts coming into the system are very positive news for the education sector. The Covid-19 environment is impacting on the willingness of teachers to travel and work abroad and we are hearing from post-primary schools that there are some improvements in supply this year as a result. In 2019-20, there were 2,800 teachers on part-time contracts and 1,300 job-sharing. My Department is also working with the Teaching Council to raise awareness of teacher supply in post-primary schools, focusing on teachers who are currently registered but not actively working in schools. The higher education institutions are working on more flexible arrangements for student teacher placement in post-primary schools also. This will facilitate student teachers to be available to their school for substitution and supervision while on placement. Student teachers will be paid for any hours worked outside their required placement hours. The Teaching Council is also working to allow teachers who qualified abroad to register and complete their induction programme here in Ireland for the coming school year. This move alone could see up to 200 additional newly qualified teachers becoming available to the system at post-primary level.

Lack of sufficient qualified teachers and staff instability threaten students' ability to learn and reduce teachers' effectiveness. Teacher shortages at post-primary level need to be tackled in the context of growing student numbers. Every year as principals scramble to fill posts for the following September, we hear of shortages in particular subject areas. A Teachers Union of Ireland survey has found that subjects like home economics, French, mathematics, Spanish and the sciences are particularly affected. Does the Minister envisage that the additional 1,080 posts which have been announced will go some way to addressing this problem?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	55	I believe the additional posts that have been announced will be a substantial benefit to the post-primary sector. We are very confident of the various pools that are available from which to draw those additional teachers, including the 1,300 who are currently job-sharing. For the first time, we will lift the bar on the number of hours teachers can work in terms of job-sharing. For the 2,800 teachers who are on part-time contracts, those hours can be extended. We also have the pool of students who are returning home and those who may choose not to go abroad.There are substantial avenues for us to find the resources. Following engagement with the Higher Education Authority, new initial teacher education, ITE, undergraduate programmes in a number of priority subject areas were put in place by higher education institutions for September 2019. Programmes included maths, modern foreign languages and Irish. More new undergraduate ITE programmes are planned for commencement this September. They will include Irish, modern foreign languages, mathematics and computer science. All of this will be of assistance.

It is welcome that induction training is to be provided to school staff ahead of reopening. Where that training is due to take place and in schools where teachers have just started in new posts, there is likely to be a period where they will have to adjust or acclimatise to their new settings. While the training is welcome, does the design of the training take into account the potential for those taking part to be newly hired staff, given the situation with Covid-19?

It has to do with the hiring of teachers who may be asked to work in different schools. This also affects other workers. Surely the one Garda vetting process should do. Under the regulations as they stand, someone must be vetted two or three times if he or she will be working in two or three different schools. Surely it makes sense to vet someone just once and give him or her a ticket or card like any operator. That should be sufficient to allow a teacher to go to two, three or four different schools if that case arises. Perhaps the Minister might consider this suggestion. It would save a great deal of time. It takes two to three weeks to vet someone. If a person needs to be vetted a number of times, it will clog up the system and take extra time unnecessarily.

Regarding the induction of new teachers, Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan will be aware that the training facility is for the whole school community, including teachers who are already working in a school environment and new teachers who will come on stream. I am conscious that, under normal circumstances, new teachers coming on stream must be particularly nurtured. The Deputy will be aware that there is always a designated teacher to ensure that. Equally, a lead response worker in terms of Covid-19 will be appointed to each school. This will be a further support, not just for the overall school body, but where key issues are identified for the new teachers who are coming on stream. Schools work as a team and in a collaborative manner, and I have every confidence that this is how it will work in future. Regarding vetting, I am aware that there may be issues with the turnaround times for vetting. However, many teachers in the system are already vetted. Should there be a requirement for new vetting, we have discussed with the Garda National Vetting Bureau having an extremely quick vetting process for same, but most people in the education sector have already been vetted.

Has every support that the Department and its officials can provide been provided? Can we get an assurance that the Department has responded to every request for additional resources and space that the schools have made recently and previously? Be it down to a difficulty or unwillingness on the part of the school or a lack of communication or failure in administration on the part of the Department, the parent of a child with additional needs does not care. Nor does the child. They need the school place.

I agree with her that we cannot tolerate a child with special needs not being treated equal to every other child in terms of a right to access education. I am determined to rectify such problems. The Deputy will know that 20% of the Department's Vote, or €1.9 billion, goes towards special education in recognition of the work that needs to be done in that area. There is a process for the 39 schools. I am in a position to speak about the process generally but not the minutiae of the particular schools themselves. That is a statutory function and I have my own statutory role. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has had extensive engagement with patron bodies and the schools on securing places for children with special needs. There is still a small shortfall, with us needing to sort out approximately 43 special class places. We have instigated a process under section 37A of the Education Act, which is something that is only done where all reasonable efforts have failed. We did this on 26 June when letters were sent to the 39 schools to determine whether each had the capacity to provide a special class. The legislation was used for the first time in 2019 and a special school was set up in Dublin 15 as well as six special classes. There is a perennial dearth of places for children with special needs. I am determined to stamp that out and bring a targeted action plan to this issue. We must look after our most vulnerable, those being, children with special needs.

I wish her every success in that work and it is fantastic that she is in that seat. I wish to raise a linked matter with the Minister for discussion with her colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. The greatest issue that will face the education sector is that of children who have not received a timely disability assessment under the Disability Act to determine whether they have additional needs, communication needs or sensory processing disorders. We have seen concerning figures from the HSE. Will the Minister take this matter up with her colleague as soon as may be? Parents always know if there is something not quite right in the development of their children in terms to their connections, reaching particular milestones or meeting certain guidelines. That is evident from the reactions of consultants in Crumlin, Temple Street and elsewhere, who always trust and respond to the parents' instinct. However, parents need help. They cannot do it alone. They need professional supports as much to get structures in place for their children as to have what they are seeing in how their children are doing verified by objective third-party views. This matter is coming down the line for the Minister, be it today or later. Children who are not getting timely assessments are not getting the services they need in a timely manner, which will impact them throughout their lives. I urge the Minister and her colleagues to take this issue up with the Minister for Health and the HSE as a matter of urgency.

On 8 May 2020 it was announced that the leaving certificate examinations were to be postponed and that calculated grades would be provided as an option for leaving certificate students for 2020. At that time, it was also announced that the grades would be finalised and issued for each student as close as possible to the traditional date of issue of the leaving certificate results. At no time was a definitive date for release of the 2020 calculated grades announced. The date of 7 September is the earliest possible release date given the rigorous and robust quality assurance checks required to ensure the process is executed with equity and fairness to all students and to ensure that the 2020 results enjoy the same status as those of previous years. The results will be available in time for round 1 offers from CAO and UCAS for colleges and universities in Ireland and UK. I have written to every European minister with responsibility for higher education and asked for Irish students to be accommodated. I have received assurances from the Dutch authorities that their higher education institutions are being advised to accommodate the entry of Irish students in September in view of the conditions caused by Covid-19. The recent announcement that the results would issue on 7 September has been portrayed perhaps as a delay but it is the additional three weeks that are required. More than 450,000 individual grades have to be prepared and subject to checks and balances as part of the national standardisation process. It is of vital importance that the process is given sufficient time to execute to the highest standards and to rigorous and robust quality assurance so that the results provided in 2020 enjoy the same status and value as the leaving certificates of previous and indeed those to come. The standardisation process is overseen by a national standardisation group. The group comprises representatives from the calculated grades executive office and the inspectorate, both from my Department; the Educational Research Centre and the State Examinations Commission. The group meets regularly to analyse and review the most recent iteration of the model and to discuss the outcomes and review how best to proceed in adjusting the model and also to work through the validation process. The Educational Research Centre has also been engaged to provide a data quality assurance and verification service on the data processing and standardisation processes.

What is the real reason for this? Is it that if one postpones the dissemination of the results, one postpones the sitting of leaving certificate 2020 for those who want to sit it? If one postpones the sitting of the leaving certificate 2020, one kills the chance for those students sitting the exam and using those results to get into college for the year 2020-2021. Instead they will use calculated grades to get into college for the year 2020-2021 and all of the other calculated grades do not need to be recalculated, which potentially saves the Department from a hell of a lot of lawsuits. Is that the real reason for this three-week delay, and it is a delay in the distribution of leaving certificate results this year?

The only agenda and objective here is that students will benefit and have confidence in the mechanism that has been used to provide the calculated grades. The additional time is necessary to ensure that the integrity and high quality is maintained so that the leaving certificate class of 2020 can stand with absolute confidence with the leaving certificate class of 2019 and the classes of 2021, 2022, or 2023 as we go forward. It is for the benefit of the students and the integrity of the exam that the additional three weeks is required.

The Taoiseach informed me yesterday that the syllabus will not be changed and that exams will go ahead but that the students will be offered more choices in order to reflect and take into account the fact that those students have lost much face-to-face teacher time this year. The students are interested in hearing that but want to know what is the extent of the changes and the scope of the choices that they are going to be given. When is that information going to be given to the students? The Taoiseach also said there would be maximum consultation with next year’s leaving certificate students and he wanted to ensure they were happy with the changes that were made. If they are not happy with the changes that are being proposed, will the Minister give a guarantee that they will be reviewed and changes will be made to take into account their wishes on the issue?

I have clarified it previously but there is no harm doing so again because it is very important to the students and the parents of the class of 2021. As the Taoiseach correctly said the curriculum will have to stand because at leaving certificate level there is no one mechanism for teachers to teach a particular aspect of the curriculum. They have the freedom to choose at any stage where they will begin within the curriculum. Acknowledging that point, the curriculum will continue but there will be the widest possible choice within the assessment of that curriculum. Therefore, for example, if there are six poets to be studied rather than just four appearing on the paper, all six will appear in the paper, or whatever mechanism is required to ensure there is the fullest and maximum opportunity for students to answer that paper. The Deputy will be aware that the entire process of the school reopening map has been one born of extensive engagement and consultation with the widest range of partners, including the voice of students and their representatives and their parents.

This major building work is included in my Department’s construction programme which is being delivered under the national development plan. The project is currently at stage 1 of architectural planning which entails preliminary design of site and location suitability and initial sketch scheme. A review in 2019 of the demand for post-primary provision in the area resulted in an increase in the schedule of accommodation to cater for up to 1,300 pupils. My Department met with the school and the increase was accepted by the school. Initially, it had been anticipated that this project would be delivered in the form of an extension and refurbishment. However, through ongoing engagement with the school, its board of management and trustees, the option of a new build is currently being explored by my Department. The design team has been instructed to provide an initial sketch scheme for a 1,300-pupil school and submit it to my Department for review. The design team is currently finalising its report for presentation to the school and the Department.  Upon review, my Department will then be in contact with the board of management with regard to the further progression of the project.

This is an issue upon which I and my colleague, Deputy Patricia Ryan, who also covers that area, receive many representations from parents. If one looks at that school, it has come from the amalgamation of Scoil Mhuire and the Christian Brothers school in the late 1990s and it opened in August 2001. St. John’s vocational school joined it at that stage, so it is an amalgamation of three schools. There are many prefabs in the school. Portarlington is a commuter town which has grown and the school currently only has a capacity for 750 students. There is serious overcrowding which has caused many problems and this is a very difficult operation to carry out. There is an enrolment of more than 1,003 at the moment. It is good to hear the Minister mention that the figure of 1,300 is being considered as being required. It is disappointing to hear that it is stuck at stage 1 within the school building programme which is very early stages as the Minister and I know.

I should point out that the Department has made interim accommodation available, initially in November 2018 and then in February 2019, to take account of the growing school population. The approved provision comprises two science laboratories, a woodwork room, a prep room and four general classrooms. There is acknowledgement that there is a requirement for a school to accommodate 1,300 pupils and I confirm again that the design team has been instructed to provide an initial sketch scheme for that. It is being submitted to the Department for review. I assure the Deputy we will continue to work on that as a priority.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	75	I thank the Minister for the reply. It is good that it has been accepted that a school population of 1,300 must be catered for. I accept that interim accommodation has been provided but it is very cramped. There are problems in how the school must operate, and even before the onset of Covid-19, it had to operate a one-way system. Covid-19 has brought new pressure and the Minister announced a capital programme for internal works in schools. The Minister should try to prioritise this school within the national development plan and school building programme. It is on the commuter line and Portarlington is a commuter town taking in a large area of east Offaly and north-west Laois. The area's population has grown by thousands, with the town's population by itself going from 3,500 to almost 8,000 when we take just its urban area. That is without taking in the catchment area. Parents are raising this matter consistently with us and it really is a pressure point in the area for second level education. The Covid-19 pandemic has put the improvements that need to be made under big lights. I ask the Minister to try to expedite these improvements, as sometimes these programmes can get bogged down in the first or second stage for years on end. We need to move on this project in the capital programme.

He mentioned the minor works grant that is also available and there is an opportunity for schools to act within the Covid-19 provisions. I appreciate that because of its location and the accommodation demands of a school of 1,300 pupils, this should be expedited. My Department and I will take on board all the points raised by the Deputy and I thank him for doing so.

I know her well from our days on Kerry County Council. My question was submitted prior to the publication of the education roadmap. I welcome many aspects of the plan, including the lack of red tape and the child-centred approach, and I acknowledge the hours of hard work put into it by departmental officials. What are her views on the implications for education of the ESRI report mentioned in the question?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	78	I thank the Deputy and appreciate his kind words. I welcome the publication of the ESRI report, The Implications of the Covid 19 Pandemic for Policy in Relation to Children and Young People: A Policy View. The report details the impact of the pandemic on the lives of children and young people both directly because of the closure of schools and a lack of face-to-face interactions, and indirectly because of increased financial stress that many families in Ireland are now experiencing as a consequence of Covid-19. My Department is acutely aware of the implications of the pandemic on the lives of pupils, including "learning loss" experienced by many students and the particular challenges facing students with special educational needs, many of whom may struggle to readjust with the routine of school in the autumn, and the importance of supporting the well-being of all our students and school community. Since schools closed on 12 March, my Department has provided a suite of supports and resources for schools, parents and students. Many of these are specifically targeted at supporting the most vulnerable students, including those with special educational needs and students at greatest risk of educational disadvantage. My Department, in consultation with educational support services such as the professional development service for teachers and junior cycle for teachers, and with agencies of the Department, including the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, the National Council for Special Education and the National Council for Guidance in Education, along with stakeholders has developed a three-phase approach to providing well-being supports on return to school. Supporting the well-being of school communities as they return is at the heart of this planning and maximising contact time with schools in the first term of the year ahead and re-establishing relationships with schools will be an absolute priority.

Particular concerns have been raised by parents of children with special needs. When they return after what the Minister described as the "learning loss", it is important that they would be able to form bonds with people outside their family unit. I have been contacted by parents and teachers who feel left out of the plan. Staff members who are defined as "high risk" do not seem to be taken into account, aside from those who are at very high risk. There is a difference in the Health Service Executive definitions in this regard. There seems to be very little detail in the plan for the parents of children with special needs or those who are immunocompromised, along with their families. Those pupils face a return to crowded classrooms so what will happen to them if they remain at home? The personal protective equipment and hygiene measures will fall short in schools packed to capacity. As we know, the average class size in Irish primary schools is 25, which can be compared with the European Union average of 20. In our county we have the largest percentage of children in classes of over 30 students. What will be in the plan to address such matters? We need newly qualified permanent teachers as a priority.

There are approximately 8,000 children, for example, in special schools and there are also approximately 8,000 children in special classes. They have been prioritised in the stimulus package provided for the reopening of schools with a significant amount of funding totalling approximately €13 million. That does not include the over €14 million allocated to special needs assistants that will be dedicated to helping children transition back to school. We know at least 24,000 children are availing of the July provision this year, which provides some respite for parents but will also help a child socialise and get used to a school environment before they go back full time. We also have funding for cleaning and sanitisation of approximately €3.7 million. There is approximately €5.7 million for school transport. There will be additional release days for teachers and a significant amount is also going into personal protective equipment. We know that when special needs assistants are dealing with children with special needs, particularly with respect to intimate care, we must ensure they protect themselves as well.

I ask the Minister and Minister of State to prioritise schools like St. Finian's, which has been refused access to funding to complete necessary works. An important point was made earlier on Garda vetting. It was indicated that many people have already undergone this vetting. The point is that some teachers and special needs assistants go between different schools. There was a farcical position earlier this year when special needs assistants were to be drafted to work on other areas but they must get vetted separately when they go to a second or third school. That is no different from when such people go between different sporting bodies. Will the Government take steps to address Garda vetting so there are no issues with getting teachers into a school without delay?

It has twice applied for an extra autism spectrum disorder, ASD, class but it was refused on both occasions due to "time restraints", to use the Department's term. However, at the same time 39 schools in Dublin have been ordered to reopen in September with ASD classes. It seems there is one rule for Dublin and another for the likes of Ballinasloe. I ask the Minister to consider the matter as the school is seeking an extra ASD class to facilitate eight children in Ballinasloe.

As he may be aware, we have 124 special schools throughout the country. We are always endeavouring to ensure that we accommodate all of our children with special needs. I will be taking this very seriously. In 2011 we had more than 6,000 schools. We now have almost 8,000 schools. As I said earlier, I am determined to ensure that no child with special needs is left without a place or without the same right of access as other children. That should not happen. This will be a priority for the Department of Education and Skills. I can give the Deputy a commitment in that regard. If he will pass the details of the case to me, I can follow up on it for him.

I look forward to having our own stand-alone question time in September so we can tease these issues out. I am very conscious that this is an important time for students finishing second-level education and hoping to progress to employment, further education and training or higher education. My own Department and the Department of Education and Skills are working to ensure that this onward transition can happen as smoothly and equitably as possible. On 16 July it was announced by the Department of Education and Skills that students would receive their calculated grades on 7 September. As the Minister, Deputy Foley, has outlined, this is the earliest possible date given the rigorous quality assurance checks required to ensure that the 2020 results enjoy the same status as those of previous and future years. Students will benefit from these checks. We now have clarity on what will happen next. This has been welcomed by students and their parents. We now know that the first round of Central Admissions Office, CAO, offers will issue on 11 September 2020. Last week I also met representatives of the higher education institutions, namely, the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, which represents the institutes of technology, and the Irish Universities Association. I welcome their publication of commencement dates for each first-year student. This was the next piece of the jigsaw. We now know when first-year students will commence, with the majority of our colleges welcoming first-year students on 28 September. The Deputy asked about the important area of practical supports. We have put a funding support package of €168 million in place to support the safe opening of the third level sector to students and provide the sector with the resources to ensure safe operations. I was eager for this package to include practical supports for students. We have doubled the student assistance fund from just over €8 million to €16 million. This recognises that many students have fallen on hard times through no fault of their own as a result of Covid-19. We have also increased the mental health budget, providing an extra €3 million of mental health funding for students. This has been welcomed by many. We have also provided a €15 million fund for access to digital devices. We must recognise the digital divide. People will need dongles, tablets, and laptops. This €15 million will be distributed through the Higher Education Authority and the network of education and training boards. I will comment further in a moment.

I am very conscious of the six weeks prior to the results. The anxiety levels will increase as we go through this process. How can someone access the money or assistance the Minister has mentioned? Moreover, will the Minister discuss the timeline for appeals? I also wish to discuss those who completed their leaving certificate in 2019. How can they be assured of a college place? There is a lot of anxiety among those students, who do not know whether this year's entry requirements will be along the lines of last year. Will the Minister provide reassurance to those students who have taken subjects outside of school? Has he considered reducing college fees in light of the fact that so many of these students will not have the opportunity to take up the summer jobs with which they expected to fund their third level education?

I made similar inquiries about mental health supports this morning. The €3 million in additional funding that we have provided has been allocated to the Higher Education Authority. That body will now distribute it among the individual institutions. I expect it to be used to increase the capacity of the counselling services that are in place in colleges. As I get a breakdown of that, I will be more than happy to communicate it to the Deputy in writing. Regarding the timeframes for offers and appeals, I understand that the first round of CAO offers will be made on 11 September, with a reply or acceptance date of 16 September. The second round will issue on 23 September with an acceptance date of 25 September. The first and second rounds of offers and acceptances will have taken place in advance of the commencement of the university year. The issue of registration fees is important. I will consider this in the context of the Estimates. I have commissioned an options paper to examine reductions of the cost barriers to third level education. That will look at registration fees, the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant thresholds and other issues. In the interim, the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, and I have decided to focus the additional supports on targeted areas like the student assistance fund and mental health supports.

As I mentioned earlier, enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government. Almost 20% of the education Vote, about €1.9 billion, is currently invested in supporting children with special needs. Notwithstanding this investment, there are some parts of the country, especially Cork and south Dublin, which I discussed earlier, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places for next September. The National Council for Special Education is interrogating this and exploring the available options. It has primary responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on special education provision for children nationwide. It has extensive engagement with schools, patrons, parents and others across south Dublin. Normally special school places are found through the reasonable efforts and full co-operation of everybody involved. Sometimes, however, this does not happen and we must engage with the relevant legislation, that is, section 37A of the Education Act 1998, as amended. This is an absolute priority of mine. I know that Scoil Colm, to which the Deputy has referred, includes another special school, Scoil Eoin, which has 150 pupils. There is potential for an additional four classrooms there. According to my deliberations and the considerations we have taken into account, the school would still come up short. However, we are working through this. The NCSE and the Archdiocese of Dublin met yesterday. The Christian Brothers own the school, but the archdiocese is assisting us in that regard. Talks are ongoing.

It is good to see a little bit of progress given the fact that this has been ongoing for several years. I cannot see how Scoil Colm could be inappropriate. There is a campus of educational facilities in the vicinity. Many of the parents are frustrated by the need to leave one child at the school and bring their other child home because places are not available. The Minister has already identified the huge number of students in south Dublin who do not have places in schools. Students' places have been delayed and deferred, and some have even been rejected for educational opportunities because of the way the system works.Will the Minister of State undertake to accelerate discussion on this to ensure that a special school opens for those children, who in many cases have the greatest educational needs, in September, and that a patron will be available to take on the work if the owners of the building allow it? I ask for urgency.

There were information sessions in January and there was a public forum with Involve Autism, which I met, and other relevant advocacy groups. There was also extensive consultation with some of the schools. The Department will also determine whether other accommodation options are available and can be identified. The NCSE will also continue to liaise with special schools in the area where places may since have become available that we were not aware of at the time. A site visit will also take place on Scoil Colm together with further contact with the trustees and principals of Scoil Eoin. If there is to be an expansion, although I am not saying there will be one, we do not want in any way to discommode the pupils of Scoil Eoin.

It is always the aim of the Department and the NCSE to accommodate every child who has special needs. As I have said consistently this morning, I am determined to eradicate this lack of provision. I do not want it to be the case in the future that there is a perennial issue of an absence of places for children with special needs. It is simply not good enough and it should not happen. We have sufficient funding. It is about planning ahead and I intend to bring targeted action in that respect. For those children with special needs who do not get a place at any stage, the 20-hours home grant tuition scheme is available. That is not ideal, however, and it is only an interim measure until a place is found for all children.

The question is about one group of people. Last year, a report by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, showed that about 16% of people of school-going age were not engaged in school or employment. What plans are in place at the Department to ensure they will have appropriate access to further education as the schools reopen in the final week of August and the first days of September?

The priority of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, the Minister with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Harris, and me is to offer accessible and inclusive further education and training and higher education for all. Student supports are in place throughout further and higher education to make the transition back to education as easy as possible for the individual. Last week, I announced an additional €168 million funding package for further and higher education, which includes €15 million allocated to fund technology devices for students, a doubling of the student assistance fund to €16 million, an additional €3 million in funding for mental health services for students and more funding for students with disabilities. Further education and training currently offer opportunities to many young people through bespoke provision such as Youthreach, which is aimed at early school leavers. Most learners on these courses meet the youth guarantee criteria. In addition, a young person who has reached the age of 16 can apply to begin an apprenticeship. There has been a significant increase in the numbers of people who now find themselves not in employment, education or training as a result of Covid-19 and who are in need of upskilling. The July stimulus package offers a €200 million investment in training and education, skills development, work placement schemes, recruitment subsidies, and job search and assistance measures, which will help those who have lost their jobs to find a new one, retrain or develop new skills. Under this package I have secured 35,000 additional places in further and higher education. These will be delivered through a variety of measures, including the Skills to Compete initiative, provided by SOLAS, Skillnet, Springboard+ and the human capital initiative. The apprenticeship incentivisation scheme will provide an initial €2,000 payment to support employers to take on new apprenticeships in 2020, followed by a further €1,000 payment after the first year's employment to support retention.

There is clear guidance on everything that needs to be done in that regard. Will the technology the Minister of State outlined be available to students who are studying at colleges of further education? What are the criteria? Many people within the sector have told me the colleges of further education are the Cinderella of the Department of Education and Skills. As for the clear social distancing measures and the guidelines for teaching practical subjects or practical courses that people study at colleges of further education, what are the Department's guidelines? Will a clear roadmap be given to colleges of further education to outline how they will reopen in the final days of August and the first days of September?

Institutions are trying to figure out exactly what they should be providing for students from various backgrounds in the same building. I ask the two Departments to co-ordinate on this with the institutions that are involved. The number is not significant but there is confusion.

Níl an córas sin ag obair, ní raibh sé ag obair riamh, agus níl an Rialtas ag déanamh faic dó. This morning, RTÉ has shone another light on an issue we have had to raise in the House for far too long and far too often. This is the time that children are waiting for an assessment of need for which an average waiting time of 19 months, despite a legal requirement for assessments to be completed within six months under the Disability Act 2005. Some have been waiting up to two years and more. The six-month timeframe is crucial because it recognises the vital importance of early intervention for children in these circumstances. It is one of the only legally set timeframes to which the HSE must adhere. It was put there for a very valid reason. Despite this, the State has consistently failed to live up to its legal requirements to ensure children can access an assessment of their needs. This is crucial to ensure the best possible outcome for every child. If we do this within the timeframe, proper outcomes for every child will be possible but this is not happening. Nine out of every ten children are being failed by the State with regard to their legal right. Children are being left behind and parents are at their wits' end waiting for an assessment for their children. They know that without a diagnosis for needs such as autism and communication difficulties, their children will not be able to get the vital supports and services they need. A couple of weeks ago, the Sinn Féin leader, Deputy McDonald, raised this issue with the Taoiseach. She raised the fact that parents are currently before the courts trying to address the situation and obtain an assessment of need for their children within the legally specified timeframe. Here again, we have another situation where citizens of the State have to go to court to vindicate their rights and the rights of their children. I will not comment on an individual case but it has become the default position of the State to force people into stressful and expensive legal battles instead of throwing up its hands and saying it was wrong. These parents deserve an apology and support, not a legal battle to ensure their children are afforded their legal rights in the first place. The Tánaiste should put himself in the shoes of these parents and imagine a day or a week in their lives, or a month or a year with no light at the end of the tunnel, watching and worrying as delay after delay causes harm to their children - harm that is absolutely avoidable. Walking this walk with these parents is the only way to understand why the timeframes of three and six months are set as a legal right. Will the Government do the right thing? Will it ensure children receive the care to which they are entitled under law? Will it act to ensure that no parent of a child with special needs must go to court to obtain vital and legally guaranteed supports for their children?

I know she will do a fabulous job. I thank Deputy Doherty for raising this important question. All of us know from our personal lives, people we know or constituents who come to us with their problems and difficulties how big an issue this is. Children are waiting for too long to get an assessment. We know that more than 6,000 have been waiting for more than six months to get the assessment of needs they need. It puts a lot of stress on them and on their parents and families. We know the delay in an assessment of need can be very expensive in the long run because earlier intervention means better outcomes sooner, and a delay in intervention can result in higher costs for the taxpayer in the longer term. This problem has existed for a long time and it is one we acknowledge and want to resolve. The new Government is committed to improving access to assessments and therapies for all children who require them. To achieve this, some important reforms are now under way. The HSE disability service is engaged in a major reconfiguring of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multidisciplinary geographically based programmes. This is part of the national programme for progressing disability services for young people. The objective of this is to make sure we bring about equity of access to disability services so it should not matter what part of the country children live in as they will have equal access to those services, and to provide consistency with a clear pathway to the services for children with disabilities and their families regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their particular difficulties. Additionally, a revised standard operating procedure for an assessment of need has been developed and implementation began in January 2020. Obviously, a lot of this was delayed as a consequence of Covid and the fact that assessments could not happen one to one. They could happen over a video link but not in person. Everyone will understand why this is not the same thing. The new procedure provides a standardised approach to assessment in all areas and is designed to ensure children with disabilities and their families can access appropriate assessment and intervention as quickly as possible. The reforms involve important structural changes that will have a positive impact on services for all children with disabilities, including those with autism, and the budget provided an additional €2 million in funding for an autism plan for these services.

Two years ago, when I raised this with the then Tánaiste on the floor of the Dáil, 3,850 children had been failed by the State. Today, the figure is more than 5,000. It is only going in one direction; it is getting worse. Two years ago, we heard excuses from the Government on reforms being introduced. The reality is the State is fighting these parents in the courts. There are numerous cases where parents have been forced to go to the courts to vindicate the rights of their children with special needs because they are being failed in regard to their legal entitlement to have an assessment of need carried out within six months. The State is not saying it is sorry and that it will support and help the parents and that it is trying to do better, the State is fighting these cases. These families are at their wits' end. Being a parent of a child with additional or special needs is a challenge in itself without having to battle every single day for services and supports. This is only the first hurdle. After the assessment of need, there are numerous other battles to get speech and language therapy, SNAs and all of the other supports, including school placement. Will the Tánaiste give a guarantee the Government will not fight these parents in the courts anymore and put in place a robust package of measures to make sure no child is denied his or her legal right?

I cannot possibly comment on court cases on which I have no information. Even if I had information, I probably could not comment on them either. Certainly anybody is entitled to take a case to court but we all appreciate this issue will not be resolved in the courts. It would not be right to give preference to people who go to court as opposed to those who do not. This is not a problem that will be solved through court cases or by paying lawyers' fees. This is a problem that if it can be solved it will be solved by additional resources where they are needed and the proper use of existing resources. This is the approach the Government is taking.

I have consistently highlighted the need to reopen schools not only because of its importance for children's education and their mental health due to the lack of engagement with classmates and even the lack of a regular routine but also for the mental health of parents, especially parents who have been juggling with childcare and employment since last March with no childcare support. We have already seen the impact of the lack of childcare on front-line healthcare staff, and we are seeing it again now as parents struggle to find childcare for young children. If schools do not reopen in September there will be a far bigger childcare crisis. However, before we face that crisis there is a current crisis with regard to the provision of school places for children with additional needs. This spilled over into the public domain when the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, wrote to 39 primary schools in south Dublin on 26 June last directing them to establish special classes for four and five year old children with autism in order to immediately accommodate 43 children who have no school next September. The then Minister took this decision on foot of the advice of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which had failed to convince schools in south Dublin to cater voluntarily for students within their catchment. On Tuesday evening, the Minister of State with responsibility for special education, Deputy Madigan, told the Dáil that she understands some progress has already been made and that the NCSE is working with several schools to establish classes in south Dublin for the coming school year. While a proactive approach has been taken by the Department of Education and Skills to accommodate 43 children in south Dublin next September, the opposite approach has been taken for eight children in south Roscommon and east Galway. St. Teresa's special school, Ballinasloe, is willing to establish an ASD class from next September following a request from the NCSE but the building unit in the Department of Education and Skills says that it cannot have a prefab classroom in place in time. St. Teresa's is so committed to accommodating the eight local children that it has sourced alternative temporary accommodation pending the delivery of the prefab unit but the response from the Department is the same, that due to time constraints the Department cannot open an ASD class in St. Teresa's school, Ballinasloe, this year. Why are children with autism being treated differently simply because of their address?

The Deputy has a long-standing interest in disability and looks out for the special educational needs of children in his constituency and beyond. The former Senator, Maura Hopkins, has spoken to me about this issue as well. The Government is deeply conscious of the worry facing some families in finding suitable accommodation and school places for their children who have special needs. Ensuring that every child has a school place is a priority for the Government, and we have taken a number of actions to achieve this. Where the NCSE identifies the requirement for an ASD early intervention class in an area, the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will consider all schools in the area with a view to establishing the class. Early intervention classes are not generally established within special schools but there are some exceptions in various places in the country. I am informed that the school in question does not have the physical space to accommodate an early intervention class in the existing school building. Eight children have been identified by the school, however, and some of them are not yet of an age to enrol in early intervention classes at only three years old. In establishing any special class, the NCSE reviews the current and expected future demand for classes. It has advised the school that it will explore the potential to establish an early intervention class with the school in the near future, but that might not be this school year. The NCSE will continue to engage with and advise the school and the local SENO is available to assist and talk to the parents of children with special educational needs about their options.

The NCSE has asked schools in Dublin to provide accommodation and has asked the Minister for Education and Skills to direct schools to provide that accommodation. There is the opposite situation in Ballinasloe where a school is willing to come forward and provide that facility for children with autism, yet a very different approach is being taken by the Department purely because of geography. Can the Tánaiste advise me of the support these eight families can expect for their children from 1 September and let me know what to say to the parents of those children about the additional supports that will be put in place specifically for them when we are not prepared to provide them with a school, which every child in the State should be entitled to regardless of address?

The budget is now almost €2 billion. One in every five euro we spend on education is for special education, roughly the same as we spend on higher education. In the last ten years the number of special classes has trebled. There will be an extra 1,000 special needs assistants for schools this year and an additional 120 special education teacher posts, as well as 31 speech and language therapists. A huge amount of investment has gone into special education in recent years, and it is necessary. Saying that, however, is cold comfort for parents who do not have a solution for their child in September. Options can often be put together. Sometimes it can involve a home tuition grant. Another potential option can be a place in another school if it is not possible to provide places in the local school. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, is present and she is interested in this topic. I will ask her to speak to the Deputy directly to see if more can be done because I know the parents will want a plan for their children for this September and for September next year.
#DannyHealyRae	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-party	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-dob	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	111	There is a serious jobs crisis in Kerry. I wish to raise the closure of BorgWarner in Tralee. This bombshell occurred a couple of days ago and took the workers and the town of Tralee by surprise. It was akin to the bombing of Pearl Harbour. I thank the Tánaiste for already showing an interest in this serious issue. I must explain that this amount of jobs being lost in Kerry, which has a population of 150,000, is equivalent to 2,100 or 2,200 jobs being lost in the population of 1.5 million in the greater Dublin area. If that happened here, the Taoiseach and every Minister would be out doing something about it. This is an awful blow to the areas where these workers live in Tralee, Killarney, Listowel and Killorglin. The job losses follow other job losses such as the 130 jobs in Debenhams in Tralee and almost 200 jobs in Fexco in Killorglin and Cahersiveen. Aqua Dome Tralee is to remain closed until at least next April. This has been a massive attraction and is a serious loss to business in Tralee. The move to cut three race nights from the monthly calendar by the Irish Greyhound Board and relocate them to Cork and Limerick has hurt many dog owners and will certainly hurt business in Tralee. I support the request of Ken Tobin of Tralee Chamber Alliance that Kerry be separated from Cork city when it comes to economic development as they are and have always been two separate regions and should be treated as such. I ask the Government to set up an emergency jobs task force to address the jobs crisis in Kerry and ask the relevant Minister to come down to meet the workers and stakeholders in Tralee as soon as possible. The Cahersiveen and Iveragh area has been devoid of any job creation for many years under successive Governments.From Kells station through Cahersiveen right up around the Ring of Kerry to Sneem and Kenmare is now totally dependent on a bit of farming, fishing and tourism. When the youngsters go off to college, most never return as there are no jobs to come back to. The only thing the Government has brought to Cahersiveen is asylum seekers to the unfit-for-purpose Skellig Star hotel, where we are told food and water are now being rationed. The Kerry jobs situation has been exacerbated by the Green Party's role in the programme for Government. We will no longer have Shannon LNG providing natural gas, which was to create between 350 and 500 badly needed jobs in north Kerry, even though this company has already spent €70 million of its own money and was going to fund totally the project itself. We need gas for at least 30 more years.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	112	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of job losses and employment in Kerry. As a result of what has happened to the economy due to this pandemic, we have all seen a major increase in unemployment in recent months. Thankfully, it is falling, and people have seen that the number of people on the pandemic unemployment payment, which peaked at more than 600,000, is now below 300,000 and is still falling at a rate of approximately 20,000 to 30,000 per week, which is encouraging. In addition, more than 400,000 people are having their employment sustained through the Government's temporary wage subsidy scheme. As for BorgWarner, the news of those job losses came as a terrible blow to the staff and to the town of Tralee. I have spoken to the IDA about this and have been in touch by conference call with the company to express my disappointment that there was no advance notice of this to any Government agency. The company explained to me that demand for its product is in terminal decline, which is unrelated to Covid, and that it does not see any future product line for the factory, so it has to close. It will close by the end of the year, although some people will remain on site until the second quarter of next year. I discussed the issue of redundancy and the need to make sure the workers get a good redundancy package. The company said that that would be put in place and that it will negotiate with the representatives on it. I also asked about the site because the company owns it and I would like to see a new company come in there and bring more employment back into Tralee. The company has agreed to work with the Government and the IDA to find either a new investor or a buyer for the site in order that we might replace some, if not all, of those jobs with new jobs for Tralee. That is what we are working on. In addition to that, as is always the case, Government agencies and supports will click in. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will make sure all the workers know their rights in respect of redundancy and welfare payments if they are losing their jobs. The education and training boards, the institutes of technology and so on will go in to make sure people are given a whole set of opportunities such as alternative employment, education and training and possible grants to set up businesses. All these things will be offered to the workers in order that they know their options and opportunities. This is separate from the fact that we will try to find an alternative investor for the plant. The job losses are really bad news not just for the workers affected but also for the impact on the local economy. I know it comes at a really awful time, when people are going into a labour market that is very difficult, but I assure the Deputy that the Government and its agencies will do everything we can to help the people who have lost their jobs and to find alternative employment for Tralee.

I highlight as well that very recently we lost 45 jobs in Kenmare when Jam closed its outlet. In the tourism industry we have lost hundreds of jobs: bus drivers, pub workers and many others. I ask the Government to probe urgently the following possibility. The Tánaiste has said he is doing this, but I ask the Government to leave no stone unturned in getting BorgWarner or another company to use this very skilled workforce, with many years' experience, and the facility there in the production of some other components, such as ventilators to deal with the coronavirus or other needed products such as air-to-water pumps, which we are importing from Germany and Denmark at present. We really value our remaining employers, such as Liebherr, Munster Joinery and Harty's of Causeway, and all the other small employers that are vital to the economy of Kerry. Many of our manufacturing jobs have been lost over the years to eastern Europe and have never been replaced. I ask the Government to look at Kerry and put in place a new task force to deal with the jobs crisis in Kerry because we are on our knees and the county is really suffering.

It would be a shame to see it go unused. The company says it will work with us on this, but it would be a new company coming in and probably producing something different. I was talking to the Minister, Deputy Foley, and Deputy Griffin about this the other day. We are very keen to put Government resources behind Kerry and to make sure it gets its fair share of investment. In the past ten years the number of IDA jobs in County Kerry has increased by 48%, so it is going in very much the right direction. That might fall back a bit this year, but I think we will be able to make progress again in the years ahead. One thing that will be absolutely crucial for the county, as we all appreciate, is getting our tourism industry up and running again because Kerry is Ireland's premier county when it comes to tourism. This is why we took the decisions we took in the July stimulus package only last week to put in place a stay-and-spend scheme, which I hope will be useful to the tourism industry in Kerry from October onwards. We are also extending the wage subsidy scheme well into spring of next year and allowing those employers to take on seasonal workers who were not on the payroll in February. This was one of the big asks that employers had. It is therefore hoped we will start to see some of those jobs coming back.

However, farmers in various sectors are at a loss at the moment. If they want to cut trees on forestry they sowed 30 years ago, they cannot do so because of serial objections and departmental incompetence. Soon 12,000 people in the forestry sector may be out of work. Timber is not available. We are now looking at importing it from Latvia and other countries to keep jobs going in the various areas. In addition, farmers do not know whether the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, will be rolled over. There is a section in the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, on strictly protected areas, under peaty lands, which would include Donegal down to Kerry, bar a few areas. Farmers affected may not get the new CAP funding because of new regulation coming in under CAP. After the last election was called, the candidates of the Tánaiste's party and Fianna Fáil, which comprise 90% or perhaps 95% of the Government, in all the hustings around the country and in their manifestos gave a commitment to the suckler sector. Sucklers comprise 95% of the cows in the area I have mentioned, which runs from the top of Donegal, along by the Shannon and right down to Kerry. They said they would fund a new suckler scheme to protect the suckler farmer. Is the Government prepared to bring this in shortly? If so, when will this happen? Will the Tánaiste give us a date for it?

One of the real worries we had at the start of the pandemic was distribution, supply and getting food into shops, onto tables and into and out of the island. Between the farming sector, our hauliers and our logistics industry, we made sure this was never a problem.We appreciate their role in that, not only in making sure we had solid food supply in Ireland but making sure other parts of the world and Europe were also well fed. The Deputy will be aware that in the past year we have put in place about €100 million of grants for beef farmers, which have helped. The future growth loan scheme is being expanded and the Covid loan scheme, which will be launched at the end of August, will also be open to farmers, giving them low-cost finance to help with cash flow. We have also brought in changes to tax laws to allow people who make a loss this year to claim back some of the income tax they paid last year, which will be helpful in some circumstances. On the Deputy's point about suckler cows, I do not think that was a commitment in my party's manifesto. It may have been in the Fianna Fáil manifesto. Our manifesto had something about sheep but I do not think we had a specific commitment on sucklers. I will double-check that but I think the Deputy is mistaken. The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, is responsible for forestry and she will work hard on it in the period ahead. We are at an unusual stage in Ireland where it is almost impossible to plant or fell a tree for various reasons related to licences. We need to get that sorted out. I understand it largely relates to legal issues. It is envisaged that GLAS will continue until a new scheme is up and running. There has been no formal decision on that but it is envisaged that it will continue until the new CAP starts or in the transition period. In the next couple of months, we will be working on getting REPS plus or REPS 2 up and running, which I know farmers will welcome. We will use proceeds from the carbon tax to set up a new REPS scheme which farmers will be able to avail of to make changes that will be beneficial for the environment and farm incomes.

I agree with him on the unsung heroes. The €100 million for a beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme was provided when the price of cattle was down to €320 or €330 to keep a floor under the price of cattle. I am familiar with the new REPS, which is a pilot scheme. However, a pilot scheme will only involve a certain number of people over a certain length of time. I beg to differ with the Tánaiste on the issue of a commitment because I sat beside his party's candidate. The different farming organisations got a commitment from the different candidates in each constituency and it is there in black and white. The Fine Gael Party, Fianna Fáil and other parties have given a commitment to introduce a new suckler cow scheme to protect the suckler sector in those vulnerable areas. I welcome the Tánaiste's statement that the GLAS will roll over but we need clarity on it. We do not want to hear the Tánaiste say he does not know when that will be. We need to know when the scheme is coming so farmers are no longer wondering where they are going. The Tánaiste said farmers have been the unsung heroes and he needs to give them clarity. Will he stand by the commitment that has been made to provide a suckler welfare scheme?

He will want to make that announcement as soon as he can. I do not know the details but the Minister may need Commission approval or other things to continue the scheme but I am sure he will be keen to make that announcement as soon as he can and as soon as it is confirmed. I will have to pull out the programme for Government but, to the best of my knowledge, the commitment the Deputy referred to is not in the programme for Government. I may be wrong about that. In a coalition, it is the programme for Government that contains the commitments made by the Government. I do not think a specific commitment on sucklers was in my party's manifesto either by the way, but I will check that out and perhaps I will stand corrected.

They would be acting as restaurants but without having to serve food. This is particularly important for rural pubs where, as the Tánaiste knows, numbers at the best of times are low and in many areas pubs are the hubs of local communities. Has NPHET had time in the meantime to consider that work or has it been asked to do so? Can the Tánaiste tell us when a decision is likely to be made on this?

We do not have the formal advice from NPHET on that yet. That depends on two things, first, the numbers of new cases of the virus over the last couple of days and the next couple of days and, second, any particular bespoke arrangements or guidelines that might be put in place to allow particular sectors to open. We would all like to see the pubs opened with social distancing and to see people able to attend much bigger outdoor gatherings, particularly football and hurling matches. We are all keen for that to be possible but we will have to take into account NPHET advice on those specific settings and on how we are doing in terms of the number of new cases, clusters and so on. We will not have that advice until just before the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday and we will be able to make an announcement at that point.

In relation to that, the five things we now know are that the Tánaiste made the request for this when he was Taoiseach; the current Taoiseach knew nothing about it, even though it was actioned while he was Taoiseach; the Minister for Justice and Equality knew nothing about it; the Government decision from 2011 regarding the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality having State cars still stands and has not been changed; and there is no paper trail and all of this has been done orally. I have some questions for the Tánaiste. How could he, as Taoiseach in the previous Government, make a request for a State car for a Minister in a Government that had not yet been formed? How is that constitutionally possible? Did he make this request in the full knowledge that Deputy Coveney would be the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in a Government that had not yet been formed?

I am happy to be very clear about this. There are particular security protocols when it comes to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade travelling to Northern Ireland. When that Minister, whoever he or she may be, travels to Northern Ireland, that person has to have a Garda car and Garda protection, that is, an armed driver. They are met at the Border by the PSNI which escorts them throughout Northern Ireland. That has been security protocol for the best part of 20 years. For most of the past ten years, the Tánaiste has also been the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade so this has not been an issue. However, it happened on occasion, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was not the Tánaiste, that they had to have civilian drivers south of the Border and also had to have use of a Garda car when going to Northern Ireland. That was the situation that the former Minister, Deputy Flanagan, dealt with. When I knew I was to be the Tánaiste and that, therefore, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in the next Government would not be the Tánaiste, I asked the Secretary General of the Government to look into the matter and decide what was appropriate. That was the beginning and end of my involvement in this. The Secretary General made inquiries and the Garda Commissioner advised that it would be appropriate for the current arrangements to be maintained.

What we are endeavouring to have in this Dáil, which is entirely appropriate, is that speaking time should be proportionate. Every Deputy elected to the Dáil has a mandate, and every mandate is equal. We had a situation in the previous Dáil where Government backbenchers could not get speaking time. Independent Deputies and people from micro parties got more speaking time than Government backbenchers did. That was not fair.

Currently, in the Skellig Star accommodation centre in Cahersiveen, 32 people are facing their third day without food. They have gone on hunger strike, which is a drastic decision to take, to force the issue of their need to be moved out of that rotten accommodation. The owner of the company that runs the centre, Paul Collins, has rationed their water to 1 litre a day. They would do better in a refugee camp in Lebanon. This centre has the disgraceful record of being, according to a consultant in public health medicine, completely inappropriate for accommodation during a pandemic. The residents need to be moved out. Their demand is simple, namely, that they be moved to own-door accommodation, which is available in Tullamore and Mosney. The Department of Justice and Equality is once again letting these people down. That they are on their third day of a hunger strike deserves a response from the Government.

We do, of course, want it resolved but before somebody can be moved to alternative appropriate accommodation, we have to find that accommodation. There is a difficulty in this regard and I think everyone appreciates that. The Deputy named somebody who is not a Member of the House and made an allegation against that person. I do not know the person and I do not know whether the allegation is true, but I am pretty sure it is a breach of the Standing Orders of the House for a Deputy to name somebody in the House and make an allegation about that individual. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may wish to take that up with the Deputy.

Many business owners feel they will not be in a position to open properly until a vaccine is found and they will require major financial support until that time. Social distancing is extremely difficult to maintain in a pub setting, but keeping pubs closed indefinitely is resulting in a massive surge in home drinking and uncontrolled house parties. This is contributing to the spread of Covid-19 and an increase in domestic violence, and it is building up a host of future health and social problems. Many publicans are over 66 years of age and do not qualify for the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP. A large number of pubs and bars were struggling to remain open prior to the start of the pandemic. The pub provides a very important focal point in towns and in rural and isolated communities. In many cases, it is the only social outlet available to vulnerable or elderly people who live alone. Its social importance cannot be overestimated. I ask the Tánaiste to introduce a package of significant measures under the July stimulus package to help publicans remain viable until a vaccine is found.

In my own constituency, as is the case for many other Deputies, the issue of whether pubs can remain viable in the long term is a cause for concern. Even if they do reopen under the next phase, when one takes into account the social distancing requirements, for a lot of pubs, especially smaller ones, reopening might not be feasible. Pubs and bars employ more than 50,000 people and we need a package to support publicans to get them over the next 12 months, by which time a vaccine will hopefully be available, and enable them to remain viable. Otherwise, we will have mass closures of bars and pubs, which are needed in our communities.

I share their sentiments. I too would like to see pubs and bars open on 10 August if it is possible for them to do so within the public health guidelines. I hope we will be able to make that decision in the affirmative next Tuesday but I cannot guarantee it at this stage. I totally agree that pubs offer significant employment throughout the country and are also really important to our social fabric, not just in rural areas but in urban areas too. A package will be in place to support them. In fact, it is here already and it includes no commercial rates for six months, a restart grant of between €4,000 and €25,000 for every pub, the wage subsidy scheme to allow publicans to take back or take on staff and have their pay subsidised by the State, a VAT cut of 2% applying to alcohol beverages, and the spend and save scheme, which will apply to food. Will we consider doing more? We can do so, but I think there is already a substantial package in place. The problem is that the pub owners cannot open and I hope that question can be decided in the affirmative next week.

Elderly parents who are caring for their grown-up children have no access to day care centres or respite. It is the same for carers of people with Alzheimer's disease. The Rockmount centre in my own town of Kilgarvan, a wonderful facility caring for people with that disease, is closed. These carers are strangled, torn and worn. They have no respite and no day care centres to help them care for their loved ones. I am asking the Government to do something for these people, who are the worst hit by this crisis in our communities.

In west Cork, parents were asked to seek out local hubs and many of them have found suitable buildings, including one in my own community in Schull.

I have tried to speak to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, several times this week to explain this issue but it has not worked out.

Liam is classed as one of the lucky ones as he has independent living in a council house, but he requires full-time care and assistance to ensure that can continue. He has been assessed and told he needs more hours but he will have to wait until January before he receives them. I would like to know why he has to wait for six months.

Yesterday, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, met the Enough is Enough group, which is campaigning for services for adults and children with disabilities. It was very moving to hear from families who have really been affected by the strain and stress of the past few months. Many of them feel they have had no support. I know the Minister of State is going to work with them, and it is important that she does, but there are more than 5,000 cases today of children waiting for tests for autism. That is unacceptable in 2020. The average waiting time for those tests is 19 months, despite a statutory requirement that they be provided within six months. These difficulties may be further compounded by the delays resulting from Covid-19. I ask that this be looked at and dealt with because these people cannot wait any longer and are having to deal with many difficulties.

The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has informed me that adult day services will gradually resume throughout August and service providers are working to get day services ready to reopen safely, in line with public health guidance. Service providers have been getting in touch with all families and service users during July to discuss when they can expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of. An information portal has been established, which will include the dates on which the 1,000 or so different service locations will reopen. After 4 August, service users and families will be able to access this information on www.hse.ie/newdirections.

This issue has been highlighted in Wexford over the past few years and as recently as last week. Will the Tánaiste commit to looking at the budget allocations regarding access to appropriate inpatient units and out-of-hours services? Has the Government taken into account the existing shortages in staff levels and the pending problem of retirements in the next five years, in order to end this bad practice of placing children in adult mental health units?

In some cases, there might be 16 and 17 year olds in an adult unit, while in other cases a decision is made in consultation with the family to put a child in an adult unit nearer to home rather than a children's unit far away. Still, it is not a satisfactory practice. As long ago as when I was Minister for Health and Kathleen Lynch was Minister of State with responsibility for this area, we worked very hard on this issue and were able to reduce the numbers, though not eliminate them. I am determined that this Government be the one to deal with this once and for all and I will be discussing it with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, in the weeks ahead. I thank Deputy Mythen for raising this issue.

He was a husband, father and brother who was hugely involved in the community. On Sunday, we heard the sad news of his suicide. This is not the first time I have dealt with this issue. I spoke with the family and they said that the difficult part was that this man presented himself to the mental services in Crosslanes, Drogheda, on the Wednesday before last and sought help. He was not admitted. I accept that hospitalisation and residential care are not always the most suitable options and I am not a medical expert. However, I am told that the home care team made a call the next day and stated that it would be a few weeks before it could deal with him, due to Covid-19 and, I must assume, a lack of resources. I am not looking to vilify services but I call on the Government to assess protocols and resources to ensure there is no wrong door when someone presents for mental health help and that the necessary care and connections are put in place. We need a full audit of mental health services. We also need to deal with the chronic underfunding and a system that is failing our people.

I have visited that unit numerous times with people from Dundalk and the surrounding areas and the service there was absolutely dreadful. I once brought a young fellow up there with his mother and six hours later he was running around a car park in the nude. We ended up in the Garda station and we had to get a doctor to section him. Two years ago, I also went there with the man to whom Deputy Ó Murchú referred and his sister, who was having serious problems. We have spent millions of euro in Crosslanes and we are getting nothing. It is a five-star treatment centre and yet a man is being buried today, as have other people in the area. It is about time someone conducted a national audit of the situation, including how many people have been in there in last number of years and how many of them committed suicide since they left the unit.

I have spoken with the Garda, the local authority and local people about it. I am not going to go into it because it is fresh in the mind. I worked for Tusla and the HSE for a number of years and on many occasions, I have seen young people and adults presenting themselves to hospitals in dire straits. Their mental health had completely collapsed and they went to those hospitals looking for help. They are sometimes waiting upwards of 24 or 48 hours. Two weeks ago, up to six people were waiting 16 hours to see a psychiatrist. The programme for Government contains huge promises in this area and I appeal to the Tánaiste to follow through on them. People are in dire straits across the board. They are looking for help and they need it now.

I wish to pass on my condolences to them at this time. I will not comment on the individual case or the service as I do not know anything about them but I will let the Minister know this was raised in the Chamber today. We have made a huge progress on mental health and suicide prevention in recent years. For the first time ever, the budget for this year exceeds €1 billion and the national anti-suicide strategy is being implemented. In fact, the number of people taking their lives in Ireland in the last year or two is around 30% lower than it was ten years ago. We are going in the right direction in that regard but that is no comfort to any family that has recently experienced suicide. It is worth putting on the record of the Dáil that that progress is being made. We need to be careful what we say about services and staff. I have worked in healthcare and with patients with mental illness. It is very hard to assess whether or not people will take their life if one does not admit them, or after they are discharged. There is no X-ray or blood test for it so it is not like other areas of medicine. It based on a clinical judgment and we should be very careful that we never stray into blaming doctors, nurses, psychiatrists or particular services for bad outcomes. It is unfortunately not that simple.

There are over 12,000 people on the waiting list for Mayo University Hospital today. Some 9,484 of those are outpatients, 1,171 have been waiting for more than three years, and 2,654 are waiting for inpatient procedures. The Tánaiste said last week that this was not about beds, but I beg to differ. The queues for the pain management clinics are getting longer. Those clinics are greatly reduced and there is an 18-month waiting list to get to them. The Government says it has spent €2 billion on the HSE during the Covid pandemic but it is certainly not getting to the people of Mayo. What message does the Tánaiste have for all those people who are waiting in pain for procedures?

It was still a bad situation but we had been going in the right direction and then came Covid-19, which changed everything. It meant that much normal healthcare had be suspended to prioritise Covid-19 care or because it was not safe. We need to get all that back on track again now, but it will not be easy and it will take time.

I refer specifically to the commitment to establish a set of well-being indices to move towards creating a holistic, well-rounded view of how our society is faring. The programme for Government promises to use new well-being indices and balanced scorecards in the development of Government budgeting. Against the backdrop of Covid-19 and its far-reaching impact beyond just economic consequences, the time is right for the Government to begin its work on addressing the broader needs of Irish society. Will the Tánaiste tell me what plans, if any, have been put in place to begin the Government's work on measuring well-being as a means of improving Ireland's understanding of our social and environmental progress? Is there room to include, for example, sustainable development goals in this work? Does the Tánaiste have any information concerning what experts and stakeholders can be brought in to support the Government's work in this area and what other countries we might be looking to when framing this work?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	164	I do not think we have got started on that aspect yet, but it is in the programme for Government. It is something that the Government and all three parties in government are committing to doing, because we need an accurate way to measure well-being in our society that is about more than GDP and about more than trolley numbers. We need something more sophisticated than any of those metrics. Regarding looking to other countries, New Zealand has done some good work in this area and our new Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland was the man involved with those well-being indices and budgets in New Zealand, so perhaps that is one country we can look to.  We should not forget, however, that some well-being indices already exist. For example, the United Nations Development Programme produces a human development index, HDI, every year. That looks at health through life expectancy, educational attainment and economics, and that index ranks Ireland as the fourth-best country in the world in which to live. Deputies would be forgiven for not believing that, but it is the truth.

Second, it will depend on the epidemiological data on how we are doing with the virus. We do not have those numbers yet but we plan to make a decision on this issue next Tuesday. I hope it will be a positive decision, but I cannot make that commitment now.

In north Kildare, it has been suggested that the water supply will be moved from the Poulaphouca reservoir, the water from which is six times softer than water coming from the River Barrow. This has caused consternation and upset for people living in north Kildare. Swapping from a high-quality drinking water supply from the Poulaphouca reservoir, and doing this over people's heads, should not be the way of any Government. Irish Water states that quality is not an issue, but water that will be six times harder than the supply from the Poulaphouca reservoir will be a major change in people's lives, for example, in respect of their electrical goods. What is the Government's plan for the water supply in north Kildare regarding public consultation and quality?

I was essentially making the point that this Bill is missing anything to address the situation facing the Debenhams workers and other workers who may be in the same situation in the future. There is a difference in the approach taken by the current Taoiseach compared with what he said about Clerys over five years ago. At that time, he spoke about what happened to Clerys as the worst example of vulture capitalism. The difference in approach is striking now that he is the Taoiseach and has the power to do something about it. He repeats a particular set of words about how poorly the workers are treated, which I am sure he believes, whenever he is asked about the subject. At the same time, he is taking no action. At the very least, there should be a restructuring of the order of creditors to ensure that workers come first. In this particular case, the State needs to give up its position as a first creditor and ensure that the €5 million tax debt owed to the State can instead go to workers. I encourage people to support the national demonstration that is happening on Saturday, 8 August because the fight for Debenhams workers is a fight for all workers.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, for proposing this new legislation. As an Independent member of the Regional Group, I am broadly supportive of it. It is necessary, appropriate and timely for a number of reasons. The business sector is important not just for the economy but also for society. Small and medium-sized indigenous enterprises and our microenterprises are especially important because they contribute billions of euro to the Exchequer, which helps to support vital public services but, most important, those types of businesses help to support, protect and provide thousands upon thousands of jobs in each constituency in this country. We in this House should seize the opportunity to support the smooth running of businesses and enterprises during these turbulent times. This Bill is more than just window dressing and routine housekeeping. There is good stuff in it. We need to regularise, normalise and codify in law the new remote working culture that has been recently foisted upon us as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. It is good that annual general meetings and extraordinary general meetings can now take place remotely, in whole or in part.Businesses can continue necessary operations quite smoothly, which is very good. People can now be present at meetings virtually, rather than just physically. The fact that a quorum can exist in cyberspace is important from a legal perspective. People can vote remotely at AGMs, provided normal precautions in terms of authentication are in play. That is all good stuff. Many of those who hold small numbers of shares are retirees and some company directors are in their early 70s and would be quite vulnerable. Any mechanisms or measures we can introduce which will allow businesses to continue as normal, bearing in mind public health concerns, should be welcomed. I support the measures on dividends in the Bill. A proposal in the Bill allows company directors to withdraw, withhold or reduce dividends at their discretion, even those that have already been announced. That is good because it allows businesses to maintain a cash buffer and reserve to see them through the stormy waters that are coming down the tracks. It facilitates cash flow. Giving company directors that level of discretion is a good thing and I encourage the vast majority of them, where appropriate, to consider taking that action. The most important and progressive part of the Bill relates to the period of examinership which is currently set at 70 days. Examinership is an excellent way to provide core protection for small and large companies that are going through difficult periods and are still viable, but vulnerable. It allows them breathing space to trade out of their difficulties so that they can become a going concern on the far side. The Bill refers to increasing the examinership period to 120 days. The Minister of State mentioned today that it will be increased to 150 days, which is positive. The fact that these measures will be in place until the end of the year is also very positive. I am in favour of putting them on a more permanent footing because, as I said, there is much that is good in the proposals. I agree that a phased introduction on an incremental basis is probably a good way to go. The fact that the Minister has, at his or her discretion, the opportunity to roll the measures over at the end of the year is also good. If the Bill is brought back to the House in the new year, I would be of a mind to support it and put some measures on a more permanent footing. As I said, because businesses are so important from a jobs perspective, as well as funding crucial public services through tax revenue, anything the House can do to support them should be considered.  I place on record my gratitude to the Minister of State, who is speaking on behalf of the Government, and the Opposition spokespersons present for the cross-party and unanimous support the Regional Group received last night for its proposal on perjury. It will make a significant difference to the cost of insurance. I am not suggesting for a minute that it is a panacea for all of the problems with insurance, because we all know there are other factors at play. It is, however, an opportunity to address one of the key components of rising insurance premiums, which has to be welcomed. I look forward to working with the Minister of State and other Opposition parties to progress the perjury Bill over the next few months. As was said during yesterday's debate, we hope to get it on the Statute Book by 31 October.

We have had no pre-legislative scrutiny, but there has been widespread consultation. In that context, as a Parliament, we have to act quickly. The provisions in the Bill allow companies to hold their AGMs electronically in a suitable venue. The Bill also allows for an extension of the time period for the presentation of a report by an examiner to the High Court to 150 days. This is important because it will give companies the opportunity to restructure. Workers will not have to get High Court approval before enforcing employment rights complaints when a company is being wound up. Depending on the context, the figures involved before a statutory demand can be issued will increase from €10,000 or €20,000 to €50,000. In that context and in the context of fairness and efficiency, I support the Bill. While these provisions are important, they form part of a bigger picture of supports for workers and businesses. During a debate with the Minister for Finance yesterday, I spoke of my extreme disappointment that the VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector had not been reduced from 13.5% to 9%. This decision will have a significant negative impact on tourism and hospitality throughout the country, in particular in Border regions.  I again ask the Government to consider the fact that there is a 5% VAT rate in Northern Ireland for the tourism and hospitality sector, while the rate is 13.5% across the Border. Many businesses will find themselves having to use the provisions in the Bill when that might not have been the case had the VAT rate been reduced. It would be far better if businesses did not have to use the provisions in the Bill in the first place. One way to help to protect the tourism and hospitality sector across the country, and especially in the Border and north-west region - the Minister of State comes from the area - would be to reduce the VAT rate. We should not charge 8.5% more VAT on tourism and hospitality services than operators north of the Border. I want to discuss support for companies. The restart grant was brought to my attention after yesterday's debate. It will increase from €10,000 to €25,000, and the minimum payment has increased from €2,000 to €4,000. Many businesses are happy about that. However, the Bill states that turnover has to be less than €100,000 per employee. That will leave a lot of businesses out in the cold. Some businesses, by their nature, have a high level of turnover. A garage could employ somebody who sells four cars worth €25,000 each in one year, which would put it over the €100,000 threshold. That does not make much sense to me. Not every business has that level of turnover, but many do. Take, for example, a drapery business in a regional town. If its employees sold six suits at €350 each per week, the income of the business would exceed the threshold of €100,000.The Government needs to look at this again. We also have the issue that if, for instance, a business has a profit margin of 15%, which is quite generous for some businesses, that would mean on a turnover of €100,000, the profit would be €15,000. One could not employ somebody for €15,000, even if one pays them minimum wage, by the time one has paid PRSI, etc. Somebody did a bit of multiplication and division here but did not actually work out how this would impact businesses on the ground. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, am I sharing this time?

I ask the Government today to look at the first steps in this process so fewer people or companies find themselves having to use the provisions in this Bill. Seeing that I have the floor unexpectedly for a little bit of extra time, I want to put on record my serious concerns about an agreement that has been reached on the rota of speaking time in this House. I raise this issue as there is no other opportunity to discuss this because we will vote on it this evening without debate. The issue is not about the amount of time, because the d'Hondt system is being used and there is an element of fairness in that; it is about the rota and how one speaker follows another. I said previously that I had the opportunity to spend 15 years in the European Parliament and we used the d'Hondt system strictly. In that instance, we had the largest group followed by the next, right down to the smallest group, one after the other. After that, the rota system kicked in. Members of this House, in Sinn Féin, for example, Deputy McDonald was in the Parliament at that time-----

In this House that would be Government, Sinn Féin, the various parties right down to the three independent groups, and after, that the rota would start. My issue here is that we cannot pick and choose. This is not an à
la carte d'Hondt mechanism for Dáil Éireann unless we say it is. Then it is not reform.

Finally, I will return to the point on the Bill after my slight diversion. This Bill is worthy of support and it shows this Government and this House can respond in a timely and proportionate manner to some of the issues faced by companies and workers at this time. I also agree with Deputy Berry who spoke earlier about the fact that this is good legislation in its own right. When it comes to the end of this year, on 31 December, I will certainly be one of the people looking at extending this legislation.

It recognises that we are in a new normal and people should not be penalised for not meeting requirements that are simply unworkable under the current circumstances. The Bill addresses the operational issues in respect of compliance and gives breathing space to businesses with respect to examinership. It makes sense to allow the company seal and the necessary signatures to be on separate documents and be able to hold AGMs digitally as more people move to remote working. While not the intended purpose of the Bill, this is a great win for balanced regional development. It removes the competitive advantage of city-based company employees who live near one another, which up until this point was a necessity under the current legislation. I know many towns and villages across Cork East that will benefit from this. It immediately makes them a more attractive location to work. People want to work in places like Youghal, and I recently spoke to young working professionals who had moved back and who wish to be able to work from and build a life in their own town. While this will not solve all the issues, it is a welcome step in the right direction. The Bill increases the current debt threshold for a winding up petition from an individual debt of €10,000 up to €50,000 for aggregate debts owed by a single creditor. This prevents companies being compulsorily wound up for relatively small debts. It enables the courts to extend the maximum period of examinership, in exceptional circumstances, from 100 days to 150 days. This is a substantial change that will enable much needed time for an examiner of a company to negotiate with key stakeholders and possible investors to put together workable rescue plans. Alongside this, under the legislation, directors of insolvent companies must have regard to the interests of creditors of a company and the preservation of the company’s assets. This is a significant provision, which acknowledges that it may well be of benefit to the creditors to not hastily wind up a company and to take steps to maintain value by protecting key assets such as leases.  These two measures go to root of what we could learn about the crisis. It is not always about companies working against one another to achieve high levels of profit in short-term-driven shareholders' capitalism. It can be about all stakeholders in communities working together to try to achieve a better outcome for all. As a public representative, an experience I have found to be deeply rewarding is engaging with stakeholders in our community that are supporting stakeholders on the ground. I recently spoke with the chairperson of Cork Chamber of Commerce, which supports and represents 1,200 businesses employing over 100,000 people in the region. He told me all about the great work businesses are doing right around the country. I want congratulate Cork Chamber of Commerce on the good work it does and I will continue to work alongside it to make sure Cork is a great place for businesses.  I will continue to support this Bill that makes the great work that is being done easier to do.

We both sit in that chair from time to time and it is a good and privileged experience. I know she will be a fair adjudicator on Dáil proceedings and I wish her my personal best. I am delighted to have a brief opportunity to speak on this Bill. As the previous speaker, Deputy O'Connor, mentioned, it raises specific issues on companies winding up, examinerships, liquidations, and, specifically, regarding the obligations, duties and responsibilities of directors of insolvent companies. In the present context, one cannot help but think of the plight of the Debenhams workers and the application some of the measures in this Bill may have. What was obvious, in terms of the Debenhams situation, was the perception that the company took advantage of Covid-19 to wind up the company and, certainly, the parent company. That is the claim of those who are picketing and striking and those who were laid off at short notice, many of whom had between 25 and 30 years' service with the company.It calls out for additional legislation and powers, much of which was flagged following the closure and winding up of Clerys four years ago after which we thought significant lessons had been learned. A review was carried out into the issue by two eminent researchers, Mr. Kevin Duffy and Ms Nessa Cahill, who produced a fine report and made some very fine recommendations which were sat on for four years. We now have a golden opportunity. While there are some dissimilarities between what happened with Clerys, a profitable company sitting on significant capital assets, and what happened with Debenhams where there have been trading and profit issues going back several years, there are significant lessons to be learned. Notice should be given, as was referenced in the Duffy Cahill report, and the value of stock should be taken into account. One significant recommendation, which unfortunately has not yet been provided for in law, is to legally facilitate State creditors to forgo losses in order to channel the capital from those debts into a fund that would look after workers who have been left in this situation. This simply cannot happen again. It should not have been allowed to happen this time. I know the Taoiseach and the Minister of State are meeting the representatives of the Debenhams workers today and the Tánaiste met them earlier this week. The State should use every apparatus at its disposal, every possible loophole, to try to rescue the workers from this. Some of them are of an age and could be facilitated if a task force was set up to provide alternative work for them. However, others have given a lifetime - 30 or 31 years - to one company. It is unrealistic to expect them to be in a positive, healthy position to be able to find gainful employment given the state of the retail market in Ireland now. This is a small but important Bill. It only gestures towards some of the measures I am saying are absolutely required to ensure that never again will a company whose coffers are empty wind up leaving employees who have made a lifetime of contributions at the back of the queue of creditors. I would like to see that issue addressed in the term of this Government. Workers' rights should not be put at the bottom of the list when it comes to dealing with the debts of an insolvent company that has gone into liquidation or examinership.
#SorcaClarke	unknown-#SorcaClarke-party	unknown-#SorcaClarke-dob	unknown-#SorcaClarke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	187	In general terms, the Bill is welcome. It is indicative of the extraordinary times we are in that operational issues in respect of compliance arising from the Companies Acts and the Industrial and Provident Societies Act need to be addressed as a direct result of Covid-19. The ability to hold AGMs through video technology is something that has been accommodated elsewhere for a long time and the Bill is simply catching up with what has been done in other areas with regard to the use of electronic communication. We have a real opportunity to make use of such technology. I spent time on the audit committee of Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Board where our meetings could be facilitated through video link with a member in the UK. Unfortunately, that was not available to other ETBs and caused significant difficulties. The elements of the Bill that deal with companies and small businesses struggling with debt are extremely welcome. However, I strongly recommend that these be inserted on a permanent basis. There are pressures on businesses' cash flow and the threshold at which businesses are deemed unable to pay debts for the purposes of being wound up is extremely low, even in normal times. Therefore, it is imperative that it is increased during this extraordinary time. In that regard, the Bill seeks to support as many businesses as possible to trade through this crisis, supporting economic activity and preserving employment. In constituencies such as mine, Longford-Westmeath, which has seen the closure of Bord na Móna and the ESB in Lanesborough, significant numbers of people are leaving employment and moving into another industry in which they will need to gain experience. We need those businesses to continue operating. Increasing the examinership period to give businesses breathing space to restructure will also be essential. However, much more needs to be done for business. When I saw what was on the agenda for today, I sat back and scratched my head. I sometimes wonder at the lack of joined-up thinking in the Government and if it is to be taken seriously. I spoke yesterday to a proprietary director who owns 15% of a very small business in Longford which will no longer be eligible for the wage subsidy scheme. This will put half a dozen people on jobseeker's payment because that company will close. The individual in question has run out of savings to keep it open. Businesses have been waiting weeks for the Government's July stimulus package to be announced. To say it was disappointing is an understatement. The announcements for businesses were a total let-down. Not one business owner in my constituency rang me to say they were delighted, but plenty rang to ask where the rest of what had been promised was. They said they had not been thrown a lifebuoy, but an anchor and they were about to sink. Businesses are struggling to get back up and running. They have been screaming out for liquidity injections through grants. The Taoiseach went off to Europe and spoke about grants for an entire weekend but came back only to load our small businesses with debt. The 4:1 ratio of debt to grants flies in the face of something that is supposed to support business, encourage enterprise and maintain jobs. Businesses have been calling out for real and substantial grants, but they are nowhere to be seen. The speed with which this legislation can be rushed through is also very interesting because it centres on the health and safety of company directors and board members. It is in stark contrast to the failure of the State to legislate to protect ordinary workers on the shop floor and in hospital wards and meat factories where we have repeatedly seen clusters of Covid. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been to the fore in campaigning for a simple change by way of regulation - not even primary legislation - to make outbreaks of Covid-19 in workplaces notifiable to the Health and Safety Authority. That could have been done at the stroke of a pen. Workers could have been given additional protection for their health and safety, but it was not to be. The incidence of Covid-19 in meat plants has been rife during lockdown, including in my constituency. Many workers had their lives put in danger because of that failure to act.

As a number of Deputies said yesterday, this stimulus is bring introduced at the same time as the initial pandemic unemployment payments are being cut, when we were implementing regressive measures in the economy and reducing the free flow of money in the economy. We need to take all that into account. We welcome some of the measures for companies, especially the provision on the debt threshold for administration and examinership, which gives some wriggle room for companies that are in a precarious position. We also welcome the provisions to allow AGMs to be carried out via videoconferencing, etc. Over this period through the use of Zoom and other applications we have learned that we can do a considerable amount of work remotely. The Bill rectifies certain issues for companies, but we also need to follow up with actions to protect workers who work from home.We also have to look at possible solutions that would represent a halfway house, particularly for people who do not have the same access to broadband as others. There are proposals for operational hubs in some areas and some already exist. There is plenty of space and the right facilities to do this in Dundalk. People who now work in major firms, particularly technological and IT firms in the city, could work in shared facilities in the town of Dundalk in groups of two or three or even on their own. This would save them and their families the time lost in commuting and would help save the environment as fewer people would be travelling using any type of transport. It would also allow people the positive aspects of the workplace setting because people have realised that, although it is great to be able to work remotely at times and to spend time with family, there are mental health advantages to shared workspaces. We need to follow up on this. I will refer to a major failure of the State which existed long before the pandemic. We welcome the moves being made to protect companies but there has been an absolute failure to protect workers. Some companies have taken advantage of this period and believe that one should never waste a good crisis. I know of a firm in my home town, National Pen, which laid off a number of people. People were able to see that jobs similar to those jobs which were about to be lost, or about which negotiations were ongoing, had already been posted on recruitment websites in Tunisia and other parts of North Africa. These postings were taken down from one website and put up on another. The company also failed to allow negotiations involving union members or third parties with experience in negotiations. This is absolutely unfair. This issue must be dealt with as quickly as possible. Sinn Féin brought a motion before the House which aimed to deal with some of these issues. It is unfortunate that it was voted down by the Government.  We have also spoken about the absolute failure of the July stimulus package to deal with these issues. Like my colleagues, a number of companies have spoken to me recently and they were very hopeful that the July stimulus would enable them to operate into the future. I fear that some of them will be in a very precarious position in the near future. We need Government action. We have not yet dealt with the difficulty regarding the Health and Safety Authority's lack of capacity and powers to investigate cases of outbreaks. We also need testing and tracing to ensure that we can isolate problems and continue to open our economy. There are significant problems and we need to ensure they are all dealt with. We welcome some aspects of the Bill but we need more action quickly.

I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on bringing it forward in good time. It is progressive and positive. It supports industry and companies that give employment. It is necessary. As a result of it coming before the House, jobs will definitely be saved. The investment is good and will benefit all of our people and our economy at large. As I said with regard to another Bill yesterday, I hope it will be possible to revisit this legislation if issues arise over the course of the next three, four or five months and if deficiencies still need to be addressed. I recognise that there is a sunset clause in the Bill but that it can, and will, be renewed as necessary. It should not be necessary to wait until the end of December. In the interim period, the situation should be monitored with a view to identifying any snags that might appear. Let us see how it is working. If it is working effectively and efficiently in the manner the Government intended, that is fine. If it is not and if voids appear, we should be prepared to look at it again to see what can be done. If I may digress for a moment, previous speakers made reference to the situation in respect of Debenhams. I agree with them. It is sad to see cases such as this and the Clerys case previously. People who worked for these companies, for almost their entire working lives in some cases, find themselves out on the road because of an executive decision. Although this decision was made in a non-EU jurisdiction, it is mean not to accept the normal responsibilities with regard to redundancies. That goes without saying and needs to be borne in mind.  I do not know whether anything can be done about the Debenhams case from a legislative perspective at this stage. I know there are many reasons for the decision and that trading issues arise from time to time but there may be more such cases, especially in light of Brexit. We need to be very cautious, careful and watchful with regard to what may emerge in the future. We need to be absolutely certain that, in the event of other companies taking a similar route in the context of Brexit, some preparations will have been made. I will again bring Brexit into the discussion because it is part and parcel of this matter. Along the Border, as and from now, businesses here that compete with businesses in Northern Ireland may find themselves in something of a difficulty. Businesses will obviously register themselves wherever they see their position being safest. In the situation which will emerge as we come to the end of this year and in light of the obvious implications of Brexit, we will have to be very watchful as to how our companies are progressing and to ensure they progress rather than running into the proverbial brick wall. I ask the Minister of State to keep that in mind with a view to identifying issues as they arise and dealing with them insofar as that is possible. It is necessary to deal with the issues with which the Bill aims to deal. I was in the House when the original Companies Act 2014 went through the House and when subsequent amending Acts were discussed. We have lived a lot in recent years. Business, industry, the general public, employers and employees have lived an awful lot of life in the last ten years. They have faced more challenges than they ever faced before. I have no doubt but that when Brexit, the virus and normal business challenges are added up, enormous issues will arise which we may have to revisit. We need to be ready for such situations and we need to be able to deal with them resolutely as and when they arise.

I call for counties in which the coronavirus is being controlled to be allowed to reopen businesses more quickly. The Department's list of confirmed cases of Covid-19 shows just one confirmed case in Kerry in the last 14 days. I call on the Government to use this information when making decisions on any future restrictions. Such measures should be considered on a county-by-county basis in order to allow counties with few or no new cases to open up all of their businesses.While it would be foolish to think that the real threat of Covid-19 has gone completely, the fact that of 260 cases nationally in the past fortnight, only one of those was in County Kerry, points to solid reasoning for allowing counties to open up at a faster pace than others. Since 15 July, a further 260 cases were confirmed, with Dublin accounting for 154 of them, so 59% of the cases are here in Dublin. Many small businesses were looking for good news in the July stimulus package and while some measures were welcome, there is little in it for many of the small local businesses in Kerry, which either still remain closed or are trying to operate at a fraction of their normal level. The Minister knows the argument I and others have been making about opening up public houses. They are small businesses. I want to see those people being catered for and allowed to open. It is causing real hardship. We are not even being told that they can open on 10 August. The Tánaiste replied to me on the day following the announcement that the only thing he could confirm is that they were not going to open before 10 August. Before the Dáil rises, I ask somebody in government to say for definite when they will be allowed to open. As we are talking about small businesses in the context of the Bill, I wish to raise flooding, which directly affects businesses. Unfortunately, in County Kerry we had an awful situation last night. I compliment staff and workers from Kerry County Council and the hard-working people in the fire service who had to work during the night throughout the county, in particular the Kenmare engineering staff, who had to go out to places such as Finnehy Court, Railway Crescent, Scarteen Park and the square in Kenmare. It is not too long ago since the then Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Kevin Boxer Moran, came to Kerry, visited places like Glenflesk and gave us money to carry out works. I was very grateful to him for the funding. He also gave us money for flood relief measures in other parts of Kerry, which was very welcome. What is happening makes no sense to me when it comes to flooding situations such as in Kenmare, where businesses on the square were directly affected overnight and awful damage was done to them. Many of them perhaps do not even have insurance now due to the fact that they were flooded previously. The square in Kenmare is at one level and there is a fall in ground going to Kenmare Bay. There is no reason in the world the water should not carry from A to B. In case the response is that it has something to do with the tide, I can say with absolute authority that the tide went out of Kenmare last night at 1 a.m. and the square was flooded between 2 a.m. and 2.30 a.m. Great people such as Kerry County Council staff, led by Mr. Jackie Horgan and others from Kenmare, did outstanding work throughout the night. I compliment each and every one of the individuals working for the council and those working for the fire service who came out at that hour of the night and worked through the night and early morning. They are still there today. Other staff were working in other parts of Kerry such as Falemore, along the N70 Sneem to Caherdaniel Road, the Inny Bridge, Dromod and Killeenleigh. An awful lot of damage was done last night and that is affecting the public but also the businesses. Simple measures could be taken. I call directly on the new Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, to do as his predecessor did in the past and come to County Kerry, see the problems that we have on the ground, listen to local councillors in the municipal areas, see what is on the priority list drawn up by the excellent people in management in Kerry County Council, who are working in conjunction with the hard-working councillors from all parties and none, and give us the funding to introduce flood relief measures, but, for God's sake, let us stop the flooding occurring in the square in Kenmare because it should not happen. There are engineering solutions to stop it. I urge the Minister of State to take that on board. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute.

Very few pubs are opened in Castleisland. Other places include Knocknagoshel and Brosna, Currow, Fieries and Ballyfinnane. So much of that entire countryside is still in lockdown, as such. There are two aspects to the issue. There are the publicans, whose doors have been shut for all these months, who were employing people and would be employing people. As has been said before, some of the publicans are over the age of 66 and they only have their pensions to pay for all the outlay they have in a public house such as electricity and insurance. Insurance bills do not go away. They are saddled with all these costs and they did not qualify for the Covid payment. All we asked is that their pension would be topped up by approximately €100 to bring it up to the €350 Covid payment, but that was refused, which was very unfair on people who were employing so many others and who add such value to the communities they serve. For the ordinary man who wanted to go for a drink or two, the nearest place they could go was to Killarney, Tralee or Kenmare and they had to have a meal when they might have just wanted to have two pints. It meant that they were away for three or four hours to have a meal and a couple of pints. That is very unfair on all those people. We should remember that mental health is very important too. Many people have gone into themselves because they cannot go out and meet people. It is not just about drink; it is about conversation, meeting people and discussing the events of the day, the week or whatever else and keeping in touch with people. They have lost all of that. I really hope the Government and the public health team give the green light to these premises to open on 10 August. We will be very concerned if that does not happen. There have been murmurs in recent days that pubs being open could adversely affect schools. I do not see any sense in that. Regarding flooding, we were very lucky to get the Flesk river cleared down as far as far as Gortahoosh, but the other half of it is still to be cleared, going into Killarney. Fleming's caravan site is prone to flooding. The Lake Hotel is also affected because the Flesk river flows out of the lake and the Laune river is blocked as far back as the Laune Bridge and the bay. This needs to be dredged and cleaned out. It cost the wonderful Huggard family a fortune and they were not covered by insurance because it has happened two or three times. I believe it cost them €2 million or €3 million to reopen the last time they were flooded. It is very unfair. If one were to fill a glass with water and put a few stones into it, the water would spill out over the top. People can talk about climate change until the cows come home but if we do not clear out the rivers, then houses and roads will be flooded and bridges will be swept away. We need to allow farmers to clean the rivers like they always did. They are stopped from doing it now because of cross-compliance and they would lose their payments. What is happening is very unfair.

I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, every success on his appointment.It is good that we have someone who understands business and the difficulty of transacting business in normal times, and that he has with such speed got to the point where these changes are now being introduced as part of the new Covid-19 requirements for businesses to ensure that legally they are able to operate in an efficient way covering all of the aspects of the law. It is essential legislation because it is law and one never knows when it is going to be contested one way or another, be it board meetings, paperwork or something else. It is essential that we get it right. Equally it is essential that renewing it, according to the Bill itself, for the periods that it is required, be done carefully and in a way that can be changed should that be necessary in the future. The provision and stamping of documents is a vital part of the transaction of business and a vital part of court proceedings, should they happen. The original documents that are required, therefore, must be arrived at in an appropriate legal way. They must then be acceptable not just to the business and the board but also such that they can be tested in the courts. That is an essential part of any legal challenge that may be faced by any business. The Minster of State mentioned that he is responding in the context of Covid-19 but in a common-sense way. I ask him to examine that in the course of his work and apply the common sense that is necessary for the transaction of business in this country. He will agree that there is a need for certainty in business in these very uncertain times. The proposals the Minister of State puts forward, or the supports that are put in place for businesses, must be secure and be for the longest period he can achieve in the context of dealing not just with Covid but with the serious problem that now faces the country, namely the pandemic coupled with the Brexit negotiations. It is quite clear from the world economy that a serious problem is emerging in the context of how we trade and how we keep individual economies alive and well and trading during these times. There will be new challenges but in Ireland the basic central theme of what we need to protect is small business and family businesses and the assurance that those family businesses can trade well. For a long number of years we have had issues with insurance companies and banks, and with regulations generally. I encourage the Minister of State, in the context of company law, to deal with the regulations that are weighing so heavily on businesses. The need to comply with regulation is an enormous cost to business and is preventing businesses from developing in the normal way they should because as a person takes the next steps in the development of his or her business, he or she must look over his or her shoulder to see what other regulations will be applied in his or her case and what the cost will be. My background is in the transport industry and in small business. The regulations in place now have substantially changed compared to ten years ago and they are absolutely in need of reform. I encourage the Minister of State to examine this issue just as much as I encourage him to look at the insurance industry. I appreciate it does not come under this brief, but he will understand, as someone who has developed a keen interest in not just the SME sector but beyond it, that the insurance industry needs to be reformed and needs to be responsive to the needs of a modern business community asking for extended coverage because of litigation. I understand that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming, and others are now looking at this but for five years on the finance committee and indeed before my time on it, we examined every detail and change that could be made to ensure fair play for small businesses. They were objected to and derailed by the industry itself. There is a need to find another way to solve the insurance problems in this country. If we do not do it soon, more and more businesses will close because insurance is a burden on top of everything else that they simply cannot carry and yet must carry. I know from my own experience that family business owners go home at the end of a week. The employees will be paid in full for their work, which they deserve, but the operator of the business often goes home with nothing or far less than the employee. That is the nature of the small businesses throughout the villages and towns of the country. The Minister of State has seen it himself and I have spoken about it in his own constituency. Post offices, pubs, small grocery stores and so on have closed. These are the heartbeat of a local community and they have all been closed with no opportunity for them to reopen with no grants available to the business owners to adapt to a changing world and a changing society. Regardless of how much the world changes or how much business will change, it is central to the rural way of life in Ireland that small businesses be kept alive. The Minister of State deals in this legislation with the co-operative societies and their general regulation under the Friendly Societies and Industrial and Provident Societies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 and so on. They also need support. The greatest example of community support through business comes in the shape of credit unions. They have significant assets and a willingness to participate in rescuing the economy through business, housing and so on. They have been prevented from doing so because Government has in the past been extremely slow to respond to the requests from credit unions for them to get involved with providing the type of credit that is needed at local level where the information is available on a business and a decision can be made on a really informed basis. In that regard I also encourage the Minister of State to look at the Irish Credit Bureau, ICB. Why should people who suffered during the crisis and did their best to keep their doors open, but for one reason or another missed a repayment or a number of them, and are now on the ICB list be excluded? They cannot get credit. We are killing off a generation of entrepreneurs who carried this country in difficult times but were unable to make it, not because of their inefficiencies or poor business methods but because of the world crisis that was brought about. They are still just recovering from that crisis. They are still carrying personal debt and they have used up whatever inheritance or savings they may have had. They are keeping their doors open based on pride and the desire to stay in business. We have not responded the way we should have. We have not given them the grants that they need because they cannot get credit. The institutions that have been set up such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and so on have acted as nothing but a roadblock to providing the funding. Banks have again not performed as they should in the interests of small businesses. As such there is an awful lot of work to be done. I am not loading all of it onto the Minister of State's shoulders. He is however a Minister of State with a vision and an understanding of what needs to be done. I encourage him not to be afraid of tackling the big issues because it is those big issues that will change circumstances in a very direct way for family businesses and those businesses that are caught up in the difficult problems that now exist in the world. It can come down to the basic need of carrying stock and not being able to sell that stock because it has now gone out of season.There are serious issues that need to be addressed and I ask the Minister of State to take a hands-on, common sense approach. I know he will achieve the best for the small and medium enterprises in Ireland.

As quickly as I can, I will go through some of the issues raised and there are other issues that I will leave and go through on Committee Stage because there might be a better opportunity then to tease them out with the Deputies. A number of Deputies noted that the Tánaiste and Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was not here for the debate. Very frequently, people are critical of the roles of Ministers of State and their role in a given Department. For my part, I am the Minister of State with delegated responsibility for company law so it is important, when company law is being debated, that the person with that responsibility be here to go through it and engage with Members. In fairness to Deputy O'Reilly, at least she stayed around to participate in the debate. Remote working from home is not always a good thing. Deputies were right to say that people who are working from home now are not doing so out of choice. They are doing so out of necessity. I agree with what Deputy Ó Ríordáin said about the lack of proper infrastructure and lack of access to proper equipment. It is for this reason that it is welcome the Department has launched a consultation process for people to feed into what needs to be done so we can have a proper system of working remotely, in which we will have the proper infrastructure, broadband and office infrastructure so people no longer need to leave Mullingar, Portlaoise or any of the commuter towns at 6 a.m. or 6.30 a.m. to go to work in Dublin. This is something we need to look at. We also have to be conscious that the mass exodus of people who normally work in Dublin has posed challenges to many of our service industries in the capital city. We cannot forget about that. The Bill provides for meetings to be conducted by electronic means. The Government will use this interim period as a trial run for measures to see whether they should be enacted permanently. A number of people have said they welcome these changes but they would like to see them on a more permanent basis. We can see how they work out over the next four to five months and, if necessary, we will put them on a permanent basis. Much has been said about the speed at which the legislation has been brought through. I would point out it is necessary and there are times when we have to act and respond quickly. Although there was no pre-legislative scrutiny, there was consultation with the trade unions through the Company Law Review Group. They fed into this legislation and welcome it. This is not about big business. I am tired listening to certain Deputies say that when a measure is introduced or a proposal is made to help and support business it is because it is for big business. The vast majority of businesses are small and medium enterprises. The vast majority of our businesses are run by people who employ local people and create opportunities and jobs. I do not think just because a measure is introduced that is pro-business or pro-enterprise it means we are against employees' rights or against employees for one reason or another. What we want to see is good businesses bringing forward opportunities for employees. We want to ensure businesses are supported because without businesses there is no work for employees. We need to remember that. The July stimulus was raised numerous times in the debate. The stimulus is the greatest and largest injection in the history of the State. While there are people who would like to see more being done, we have to look at this in the round. We have to look at the level of grant aid that is being made available. The grants have increased from a minimum of €2,000 to €4,000 and from a minimum of €10,000 to €25,000. Perhaps one of the biggest daily overheads any business has is the cost of labour. We have provided certainty to our business community that until April next year there will be a subsidy and a grant of €204 per employee.

I take the point the Minister of State made about the Minister, and it is very good to have the Minister of State with direct delegated responsibility for this issue in the Chamber but it is not unusual for the Minister and the Minister of State to attend. My comments were directed at the Minister, who is not here. I fully respect that the Minister of State is here and that he is he very engaged, which is extremely welcome, but it is not unusual for the Minister and the Minister of State to attend together and it is unfortunate that, once again, the Tánaiste has not felt it was important enough to come to the Dáil to participate in a debate on his own legislation. The amendment I tabled is on tactical insolvencies. We have had Clerys, TalkTalk and now Debenhams. Every time it happens people shrug their shoulders and say it is desperate and awful. Collectively, the Government and Opposition speak with one voice and say we cannot allow it to happen again. The Opposition brings forward Bills that would deal with it that get mired in procedure. Will the Minister of State commit to working with me and others who have an interest in progressing the legislation that reached Committee Stage in the previous Dáil? That Bill has been updated and is now extremely necessary. We cannot simply shrug our shoulders and say this should not be happening, that it is absolutely awful and that we cannot allow it to happen again but then somehow allow it to happen again. While I have the floor, I want to say a word of thanks to all of the civil servants who have worked on this legislation. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, whether he would like to associate with or disassociate from the remarks made by his party colleague, Deputy MacSharry, that implied that during the lockdown civil and public servants were at home watching box sets and doing virtually no work.I think he used the word "lazy" and if he did not, I am happy to be corrected. However, on behalf of my party, I thank all the civil servants for the work they have done, as well as all the public services and agencies that are involved in producing complex legislation such as this and ensuring that the Houses of the Oireachtas function so we can be here today to debate this Bill. It was extremely disappointing but the Minister of State has an opportunity now either to associate or dissociate himself with the remarks of his colleague. That is important. We should not just head off into the recess with those words ringing in the ears of the men and women who work extremely hard in the civil and public service. The people who are around us today are outside their usual place of work and are here to facilitate the House being able to sit today. They have gone above and beyond to come here and are certainly not sitting around watching box sets or the like. To return to the purpose of the amendment regarding tactical insolvencies, I would welcome a commitment from the Minister of State that we will be able to work together on the legislation Sinn Féin put forward in the last Dáil and which was supported by his party.

For my part, in my dealings with Westmeath County Council, Longford County Council, the HSE, the people who are running the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Garda and other bodies, many people went over and above the line of duty to facilitate the smooth running and operation of their respective roles. That goes without saying. That also applies in the private sector. Consider the retail workers who went above and beyond to ensure the shops stayed open. My parents had a concern about where we would get food when the pandemic originally broke out. Many people went above and beyond the line of duty. Unfortunately, in some instances some people probably did take the mick, but my dealings overall with everybody led me to believe that the vast majority of people went above and beyond the call of duty in their work. Regarding tactical insolvency, I have been advised by my officials and the legal advisers that there is a provision in the existing legislation under which tactical insolvencies can be challenged and if the challenge is upheld, any assets that were stripped would be required to be paid back. I believe there has never been a challenge. For me, that demonstrates that the burden of proof is disproportionate and there is a need to review it. I am more than happy to sit down with the Deputy and discuss how we can bring that forward. It is not something that can be done in a knee-jerk reaction, and I accept the Deputy is not suggesting it can. The Bill went through various Stages in the last Dáil but we must be conscious in enacting legislation, and this was mentioned by my colleague, Deputy McGuinness, that any new laws or regulations must be proportionate and we must examine the potential for any unintended consequences. This must remain an attractive place for people to start business and create employment and opportunities. If the Deputy contacts my office today, we can set up a meeting for the first week in September and I will happily sit down with her.

They referred to facilitating the establishment of workers' co-operatives. In the North, Scotland and across Europe, workers' co-operatives and community co-operatives are very much the norm, but they are not the norm in this country. It is a very good way of working. I read in the newspaper recently about a co-operative of migrant workers who came together to provide a not-for-profit home care service. If ever there was a place that needed a not-for-profit home care service, it is this State. We have debated at length the need for in-home care for people and giving them that choice and opportunity. Workers' co-operatives are a fantastic way to do that. Amendments Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, sought to make changes to allow for the formation of these co-operatives, to reduce the number required to establish a company board and to make provision for the creation of a legal definition for co-operatives. I stress that workers' co-operatives are a different way of doing business. We all talk at length about how we are living in unprecedented times and say that this is perhaps an opportunity for people. If there is an opportunity here to re-imagine how we do business and workers' rights, which I would love too, and to re-imagine the area of workers' co-operatives, we should take it. I was disappointed that the amendments were ruled out of order. Where businesses are struggling, the option of saving them through the formation of a workers' co-operative can be viable in some instances. We should be trying to create the conditions to facilitate that. If businesses are struggling, the employees or staff in some instances might want to be able to come together to form a workers' co-operative, as happens in many other countries in Europe. It is a mechanism through which one can maintain employment and continuity of service. The business can be kept alive. It is ideal for our State. It would be a good opportunity to see wealth and jobs created locally and kept within our communities. We have fallen behind the rest of Europe and my amendments sought to give us an opportunity to catch up. I welcome what the Minister said about us meeting in September to talk about tactical insolvencies. While we are there we might also have a chat about workers' co-operatives and the potential they offer. Historically, this island was a pioneer in respect of agricultural co-operatives. The Minister of State will be familiar with them, as I am. We are all talking about re-imagining business. The opportunity exists to do that. That was the purpose of my amendments and I am disappointed they have been ruled out of order. Notwithstanding that, I believe there is scope for us to discuss workers' co-operatives, perhaps not as part of this legislation but at some time in the near future.

She herself raised a question about the issue the first time I took oral questions, at which stage I confirmed to the House, and I am happy to do so again, that work has commenced on comprehensive legislation relating to the co-operative movement. That work is under way, and it is my intention to work with the Department to ensure we can bring it as speedily as possible to pre-legislative scrutiny, with an opportunity for all Members to feed into it. The legislative framework for co-operatives throughout Europe embraces a variety of approaches towards worker co-operatives. While some member states, such as France and Portugal, define worker co-operatives in their legislation, others, such as Germany and Belgium, leave it to the co-operative movement to provide definitions and rules surrounding worker co-operatives. As part of the review of the industrial and provident societies legislation, my Department intends to provide a definition of a worker co-operative in the new legislation, as I referred to. To increase the visibility of this particular form of co-operative, the Registry of Friendly Societies has added a separate category for worker co-operatives on the register of friendly societies. It is, of course, up to each individual operation to choose the model that best suits the nature of its businesses and the desired ethos of that identity. My Department does not promote one business model over another. Its role is to provide the legislative framework for co-operatives and facilitate their formation and transparent operation rather than actively to encourage or promote them as a preferred structure for enterprise. My Department supports co-operatives in the same way it supports other types of entities, and co-operatives can avail of all the supports available to all other enterprises via the State enterprise agencies. I acknowledge, however, that the legislation is antiquated and needs to be updated. That updating will take place. The Deputy is correct that there are so many good co-operatives in the agricultural sector. I am thinking even of group water schemes in rural Ireland, which were predominantly formed around co-operative movements.

I spoke previously about the concerns that were raised - nobody will be unaware of them - about access for trade unionists to the workplace. What this global pandemic has highlighted, particularly for those of us who are trade unionists, is the need for workers to be organised and to come together to prioritise their own health and safety. The new section I propose in amendment No. 9 includes a right to access for trade union officials and activists to workplaces. Although we all have the right to join a trade union, sometimes it can be very difficult for trade unions to access workers at their places of work. Remote working will pose a challenge to the trade union movement, but I urge all workers who are not in a union to join one, get active, get organised and protect themselves if they are working at home or in a designated workplace. If this global pandemic has taught us anything, it is that sick pay is now a public health measure and that getting organised, being part of one's trade union and working with one's colleagues to improve one's terms and conditions at work has never been more important. At no time in our history has it ever been more important for people to be able to do just that and to safeguard their own health and safety. To do so, however, we need to ensure those who need it can get access to workplaces. Of all the amendments I tabled, which I appreciate have all been ruled out of order, amendment No. 9 is the one I thought would be ruled in order. I am not a pessimist; I am an optimist with experience. I should have known it would be ruled out of order, but it is an important amendment nonetheless. It is my intention to table legislation to deal with this issue, and I hope that that will not be opposed by the Government because to do so would send a pretty awful message to workers and their representatives.

The right of access requires consultation with stakeholders, and it is not appropriate to include it in this Bill. I will not make a confirmation or commitment to support any legislation in the absence of seeing it. I wish to take this opportunity, however, to refer, as I did in my concluding remarks on Second Stage, to an assertion that was made about the HSA only having 67 inspectors. I wish to clarify this because it was raised in the Seanad and I promised Deputy's colleague, Senator Gavan, that I would revert on it. He made the same assertion, but it does not take account of or acknowledge that an additional 500 inspectors were transferred from within the Civil Service pool who are complementing the work of the authority. We, therefore, have more than 550 people looking at the protocols. To be fair to the Deputy, earlier she acknowledged the good work that has been done by the various stakeholders, including the unions, on ensuring that the return-to-work protocols are good and mean something. There are the required numbers of inspectors to enforce this. We should also take comfort in the fact, and acknowledge that of the inspections that have been carried out to date, 92% of companies are operating appropriately and adhering to the protocols that have been agreed with the unions and the representative bodies of business. They are being implemented well. The other 8% need to up their game and acknowledge that they have a responsibility to adhere to the protocols just as the vast majority of people are currently doing.

We have made our speeches and we know what is at stake. Our amendment clearly outlines our demand that the emergency period be extended. I am interested to hear the Minister's response to that.

However, I cannot accept the Labour Party amendment to provide the Government with power to extend the new emergency period. I am of the view, as I stated on Second Stage, that all parties should have an input into any further legislation required in this area. I commit to facilitating that. Strong primary legislation is my preference and that of the Government. Continuing extension of the legislation under emergency powers is not a robust way in which to provide the security and additional support that we need for our tenants, particularly the targeted group I am looking to assist by way of this primary legislation. The position of tenants on 1 August is different to their position on 27 March. I expect that, come 10 January next year, which is the date to which these protections are being extended, their position will again be changed. I hope this will be for the better and that this country will be changed for the better. I hope there will be no further need for the emergency protections contained in the Bill come next January. I refer only to the emergency provisions, not the permanent ones that I have also brought forward in this Bill. Covid has brought much uncertainty, as we all know, and we will need to work together between now and then to ensure the best outcome for a tenant. I look forward to the establishment of the Oireachtas joint committee on housing.I expect there will be input from that committee in a very structured way in terms of how we move forward on these issues. To be clear, the Bill I have brought forward extends the current protections through to 10 January next year for the most vulnerable people but it also introduces permanent changes, particularly in respect of rent arrears, getting the Residential Tenancies Board involved at a much earlier stage and getting the Money Advice & Budgeting Service involved to help tenants and ensure they do not go into arrears. I take this opportunity to say, once again, that if anybody is struggling with paying his or her rent due to his or her salary, wage or income being reduced or because he or she has lost his or her job, he or she should access the emergency rent supplement payment. It is there to assist such people and they should avail of it. We should all be of the view that any protections that are brought forward should be for the minority of cases. In some of the debate that has taken place heretofore, there has been a sense that the cases we are discussing are the majority position and that everyone is under threat. That is not the case and everybody is not under threat. We must try to target the measures we put in place at those who need them most. We will need to review the situation at the end of the year. I hope to bring forward further targeted protections, should they be needed.

The amendments to which I want to speak, amendments Nos. 2 and 3, deal with one specific provision of the section which relates to the requirement for tenants who fall into this category to write a declaration and submit it to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and to their landlord. These amendments also deal with section 4(1)(b), where in writing the statement tenants have to demonstrate that they are at "significant risk" of losing their tenancy.  During the Second Stage debate, several of us in the Opposition highlighted that requiring tenants, particularly vulnerable ones, to submit a written declaration causes major problems. Many tenants in the private rental sector, particularly at the lower end, have significant capacity issues. They could have mental health or addiction problems or language or literacy issues. While the Minister was right to state that some of those tenants can access the very good services available from the Citizen Information Board, Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, or the constituency clinics of many Teachtaí, not all those tenants can do that. We know that from the record. Requiring tenants to declare, therefore, is putting all the responsibility and onus on the tenants. Threshold recently produced research by Dr. Michael Byrne of UCD which made a compelling case that protection systems requiring tenants to declare, rather than giving them automatic protections, are always substantially weaker.  My amendment No. 2 simply removes the requirement to have such written declarations and allows the Residential Tenancies Board to make that decision based on the information it has before it, as it would ordinarily do. Amendment No. 3 seeks to remove the word "significant" from the section concerning the risk to a tenancy. There is no legal definition of "significant risk" in this Bill, so nobody knows what that term means. It should be a simple case of if there is a risk to someone's tenancy, whether for rent arrears or for any other reason other than significant anti-social behaviour or wilful non-payment of rent, then the RTB should be able to grant all the protections that heretofore have been available during the emergency period, namely, a ban on evictions, notices to quit and rent increases.  I know the Minister is not going to accept these amendments, but those of us who want to maintain a strong, broad set of protections for renters at this crucial time of economic and health emergency should support these amendments.

Some 17.9% of Irish adults are functionally illiterate, and these are the people who we are asking to navigate the housing schemes we put through the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is why we support this amendment and that is why I was glad to see the Minister, Deputy Harris, recognise the situation regarding literacy this morning. We need to work collectively to ensure we have measures, legislation and documents that can be accessed by all the citizens who desperately need these services.

The protections we have put in place during the Covid-19 crisis have led to a reduction in the homeless figures. In Cork and the south-west, we have seen those figures reduce from 111 people in January to 84 people last month. That shows that the protections we put in place worked. Why would we row back on them now? That is why this amendment is so important. We need to give protection to renters. Families are being evicted under the guise of renovation of properties and people are being moved out of houses for no good reason. Those are people who are paying their rent and who have good behaviour in society, but they have no protection. We are stating that it is necessary to ban evictions because we are reducing homelessness. When I raised this matter as a councillor on Cork City Council as the homeless figures kept going up, officials told me the single biggest contributory factor to homelessness in Cork was evictions by landlords under the guises of selling houses or renovations. That is morally wrong. The people who are forcing individuals out for those reasons are corrupting the system to suit themselves. Renters need fairness and there should be no evictions for the reasons I have outlined.

I am supporting this amendment. The Minister knows my views on this issue as I made them clear on an earlier Stage. There are good landlords and good tenants, and that is the majority of people. Then there are some rogue landlords and some tenants with whom people have major issues. They have used the Covid-19 situation to help themselves as well. I believe, however, that extra time is needed for these protections and the relief they have provided during the Covid-19 crisis has helped. Those protections should be extended.

I will put section 4 in context first, and then I will deal with some of the queries and points raised by other Members. It might be helpful if I set out the purpose of section 4 of the Bill. I wish to make it clear to those who tabled amendments on behalf of the Opposition, however, that I will not be accepting them. I will be moving the Government amendment to this section which is also one of those in this grouping. I refer to amendment No. 17. Section 4 of the Bill provides that Part 2 shall not apply unless the tenant makes a written declaration that he or she is unable to comply with his or her obligations to pay rent. On the issue regarding literacy and the ability to swear a declaration, this is a self-declaration. Further on, my amendment will allow this to be done electronically as well. That is one of the Government amendments to this section. Much advice and assistance is provided by Members of this House, MABS, the Citizens Information centres etc. We intended that a public information campaign would accompany the passing of this Bill. These are real protections for a targeted group. Section 4 will not apply unless the tenant makes a written declaration that he or she is unable to comply with his or her obligations to pay rent because he or she was temporarily out of work due to having contracted Covid-19 without entitlement to be paid by his or her employer, or he or she was in receipt or entitled to have received the temporary wage support subsidy, TWSS, or "any other payment out of public moneys provided for by or under statute, paid for the purpose of alleviating financial hardship resulting from the loss of employment occasioned by" the impact of Covid-19, including the rent supplement and-or any other supplementary welfare allowance and, as a consequence, he or she is at a significant risk that his or her tenancy will be terminated by his or her landlord.Such a declaration will be served on the Residential Tenancies Board and copied to the landlord and it shall be an offence to make a false or misleading declaration. The Government has not included any superfluous provision in section 4. Every word of every line in section 4 has been carefully considered from a policy and, most important, legal perspective.  I simply cannot accept the Opposition's proposed amendments. The law here needs to be strong and these changes need to be on a primary legislative footing. What has been proposed by others is to continue the emergency powers under the emergency Act. That is not tenable because it is not a strong foundation to provide the protections that we need for the targeted group of people who are the most vulnerable in this sector. The declaration and associated offence provisions are required. The Bill does not require the declaration to be made at any particular point in time and it is important that people know that a declaration can be made after the event. With the passage of this Bill, people who have been in arrears, people who believe they are in danger of falling into arrears and those who have been in receipt of these payments at a previous stage can declare now. I am referring to the Labour Party's amendment No. 14 when I say that. I believe the Government's provisions are a little stronger than those sought in the amendment, and I say that respectfully. The key focus is to assist tenants who are faced with adverse economic impacts on foot of the Covid-19 pandemic and, as a result, find themselves unable to pay their rent and at a significant risk of the tenancy being terminated. We need to target State assistance at those tenants who need it.  I will move amendment No. 17, the Government amendment in this group. It inserts a new section 7 to clarify that any tenant can email the required declaration under section 4 to the RTB in order to benefit from the protections under this Bill during the new emergency period, which is defined as running until 10 January 2021. The Government wants to make it as easy as possible for tenants to get the help they need when faced with rent arrears. The RTB will provide a template declaration for tenants and I have instructed it to ensure the declaration is accessible and written in plain English. New communities will not be forgotten in this either and assistance will be provided and help made available for every single tenant. Where the landlord consents, a tenant can serve the required declaration by electronic means. Not all landlords will have an email address so the tenant may have to post the declaration to the landlord. That is more of a procedural issue. The effect of Deputy Ó Broin's amendment No. 2 would be to swamp the board by the removal of the provision for a declaration to be served. It would result in blanket coverage that would be legally unsound. I think the Deputy knows that. These measures must be focused. I have also noted that provisions introduced in other jurisdictions do not go nearly as far as those we are providing for here. The only change made in the North allowed for the notice period to increase from four weeks to 12 weeks. There was nothing further. The Sinn Féin Minister for Communities introduced that change. The provisions the Government is introducing are much sounder and much stronger than those in the North. We have considered the amendments with an open mind to see whether they would improve the legislation. I have concluded, respectfully, that they would not improve it and would, in fact, further complicate matters. Our measures must be targeted at those who need them, the people we discussed at length on Second Stage. Other parties have brought forward ideas on this and other legislation. Another Bill that was tabled by Deputy Ó Broin made no reference to protection from evictions in any way, shape or form. That one-page Sinn Féin Bill dealt only with rent freezes. This Bill is comprehensive legislation that will protect those who need protection.  I will not be accepting the amendments tabled by the Opposition and I will move amendment No. 17.

I had not intended to respond but since the Minister repeated some of the factually inaccurate information he provided on Second Stage, I thought I should do so. I know the Minister does not pay much attention to the powers and functions of the Northern Assembly but if he did, he would know that the assembly does not have the legal authority to introduce the kind of legislation a sovereign parliament does. It cannot, for example, legally ban evictions. Under the current legislative provisions, the extension introduced by my colleague in the North, the Minister for Communities, Deirdre Hargey, was the maximum legally permissible. We would like to see many other protections introduced in the North and the South. However, in the North, these are a matter for Westminster and it is not within our gift to impose them but why let the facts get in the way of a good argument? At no stage have I suggested that the one-page Bill I published is Sinn Féin's comprehensive response to the crisis; in fact, the opposite is the case. That is a simple Bill to do a simple thing, namely, ban all rent increases for a period of three years. Following lengthy legal consultation, I believe that is constitutionally sound. Sinn Féin has submitted three other Bills that are currently with the Bills Office and a number of policy papers which are far more robust than anything the Minister has introduced or, I suspect, will introduce. Let us be clear about what is being proposed here. Fianna Fáil's proposal, which other parties will support, will dramatically reduce the protections for renters in the private rental sector to one small, narrow group of people. That group needs protection and I have no difficulty with that.  A woman from County Kerry, which is not my constituency, rang me after the Second Stage debate. Her income has been impacted by Covid-19 but she is not in rent arrears because she has made enormous sacrifices to ensure the rent continues to be paid. She will not get a single protection from this Bill. The day after it is passed, she will be faced with potential rent increases and a possible notice to quit. The Minister can shake his head but that is what this Bill does. If Fianna Fáil is satisfied to remove vital protections from large numbers of tenants who will need them in the coming months, that is fine, but the Minister should not misrepresent what I and my colleague in the assembly, Deirdre Hargey, are doing to justify his poor support for hard-pressed renters.

I also want to respond to the Minister because, to be honest, I do not know what he is talking about when he suggests that this is a comprehensive Bill to protect tenants. This Bill dismantles the protections that were put in place to deal with the emergency and maintains protections for only a small cohort of tenants who have fallen into rent arrears. We must remember that some of the people who might have fallen into arrears have not done so solely because they have made great efforts to continue to pay their rent and the rent supplement scheme was available to them. Not many people have fallen into arrears. The issue here is that it is not safe to evict people from a public health point of view during a pandemic of the sort we are now facing. That is the problem. The Minister did not address that point on Second Stage when it was made repeatedly and he is not addressing it now. Prior to the pandemic, evictions on the grounds of sale, refurbishment and so on were one of the major causes of family homelessness which has steadily risen to an unprecedented and historic level.It was a shame and a scandal for which the Minister, among others, regularly decried the last Government. With the passage of the Bill, the Government is allowing a return to a situation whereby people will be evicted for the same reasons that have led to record numbers of people being homeless. It will have compounded the awfulness and unacceptability of that with something even worse.  Not only will the Bill open the door to people being made homeless again, it will do so in a situation where there is a very substantial risk to the health and lives of people who are evicted. Many will be put into shared homeless accommodation, much of which is very unsuitable, where the likelihood of becoming infected with Covid-19 is much greater than it would be if people were in their own homes. The Government is risking vulnerable people's health. It is also risking the wider public health by doing that. As we know, when a few people get infected there is a possibility of wider infection.  The Government is directly undermining the public health effort and endangering people. While prior to Covid-19 it was unacceptable that people had to live in overcrowded conditions, couch surf with family or friends or, even worse, be put out on the streets, such things are now a danger to health given the pandemic. I do not know how the Government can justify that. If we are faced with a second wave of Covid-19 and infection rates begin to rise, the cohort of people who can now potentially be evicted will be really vulnerable. That is shameful. The Minister has not addressed that fact. He is opening the door to it.

The Bill is dressed up to appear as if it is only dealing with matters related to Covid-19. However, centuries of legislation will be abolished to appease vulture funds which evict Irish families. Chapter 3 relates to a very important decision in the Court of Appeal recently on the admissibility of hearsay, Promontoria v. Burns. The case took in all of the other relevant authorities and, in effect, gave the vultures and receivers a route to court and a more than credible defence in terms of how they might present the alleged evidence. The Bill is going through the House at breakneck speed. The Burns case was heard in April and the Bill was proposed in July. The Government not only wants to kill the decision in the Burns case in its entirety, but also make it easier to take evidence from third parties in civil proceedings which would make the system a free-for-all. People do not have to identify where they got information from. All that is required is that they believe it to be true and that should be good enough, according to the Bill as worded.  The Bill cannot and should not be allowed to be passed in its current form. It is a blatant attempt to further the cause of vulture funds and receivers, in particular, who have been finding the courts a much rockier road of late. Chapter 3 needs to be amended accordingly or discarded.

However, there are two groups of tenants and renters who should be included in the Bill but are not. The first group comprises vulnerable tenants at risk of homelessness and of addiction who do not fall under the protections in the Bill and have not been on a Covid-19 related payment or have not been out of work due to Covid-19. Plenty of vulnerable tenants at risk of homelessness do not fall into that category.  This second problem is that a large number of low-paid workers worked during the pandemic and have not been out of work or in receipt of Covid-19-related payments or the WSS. They have kept our supermarkets going, stacked shelves and manned the checkouts. They have worked as care assistants and cleaners or in meat plants. None of these people receive protection under the Bill.  We know from research recently published by the ESRI that low-paid workers in different sectors are most at risk in terms of Covid-19 and are more likely to have underlying health conditions. These groups should have targeted supports, if that is the measure the Minister wants to go for, but they are not provided for in the Bill. All tenants and renters should be protected under this Bill and in any other measures. If the Minister wanted to take a targeted approach, he knows that those groups of renters need protection but are not covered in the Bill.

All of us earnestly hope that a second wave does not present itself. If that does happen, we will consider the public health measures that would be required. The ESRI research is independent, rather than a survey on a party's website that asks people to click on a link. It has signalled the issue of potential and actual rent arrears. That is why the Bill focuses directly on that cohort of people. The Bill puts on a primary legislative footing the protections that are needed for those who need them most. The continuation of provisions under emergency legislation, regardless of whether people like it, were open to challenge and weak. That is why we need specific measures in the Bill targeted at those who need them most. I make the point to Eoin that the Sinn Féin Bill that has been published consists of only one page. There may be others in preparation. It did not go to the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers either. One would have expected if there were other measures that other parties thought should be brought forward from a legislative perspective, they might have prioritised them and brought them forward in the same manner as I and the Government have prioritised this Bill.  I discussed the Bill at length on Second Stage and responded to all of the queries raised in a 30-minute summation. There are two Government amendments. I have responded to this group of amendments. The Government will not accept Opposition amendments. As I said, we intend to move amendment No. 17.

I wish to correct the Minister. Section 4(1)(b), as drafted, does not allow for a declaration by a tenant after the event. I want the Minister to correct his assertion. Unless something is in law and written down in black and white, the Minister's comments on the floor of the House only travel so far. Many of us are frustrated by attempts to criminalise in respect of any aspect of public policy unless it is absolutely necessary. I spend a significant amount of my time trying to ensure that those living with addiction are not criminalised because of the lives they lead and the difficult circumstances they are going through. In the Bill only one cohort of person on either side of the tenant and landlord relationship has the potential to be criminalised on the back of a what is termed a "false declaration", namely, a tenant.On that basis, we feel strongly that lines 14 and 15 on page 5 should be deleted and we will press this amendment. I am interested to hear not only what the Minister, but also my colleagues from Solidarity-People Before Profit, have to say.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	237	The amendment seeks to delete the Government proposal to make it a criminal offence to deliberately and intentionally give false information on a declaration that would say that one's income has been hit by the Covid-19 crisis and, as a result, one is in rent arrears. The Government is creating a situation where a person can face eviction and then, on top of that, face criminal charges for giving a declaration that is false or misleading. Why would someone give a declaration that was false or misleading? There are many reasons that might be the case, one being that someone does not understand exactly what is going on. Perhaps there are issues with language or with a person reading what is put in front of him or her. I made the point in a previous discussion that many renters are immigrants who do not have English as a first language. Many are people who, because of the neglect in the education system, are functionally illiterate. Mistakes can be made and someone then faces not just eviction, but potentially a criminal charge. There is another scenario were someone would give a false declaration. A person, perhaps on a low income, may face not just eviction for themselves but for their family in the middle of a pandemic. Someone might give false information to protect and prevent their family being on the streets and I would not condemn them for doing that. I have no hesitation in saying that. I would not condemn someone who protects their partner and kids for giving a false declaration. The Minister is shaking his head. That situation will arise and the Minister is in favour-----

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	250	It is just seeing as we were discussing procedure. This is one law for the poor and one law for the rich. There are a number of examples, which I have cited regularly, of vulture funds using loopholes in the Residential Tenancies Act which were designed or left - I do not know - by the previous Government, and the Government before that, to facilitate vulture funds and unscrupulous landlords in evicting people. Tenants in these situations have successfully challenged and exposed the dishonesty of the vulture funds, as has happened on two or three occasions in the St. Helen's Court complex that I have told the Minister about. It was clear that the claim for refurbishment the vulture fund was using to evict people was completely bogus. It did not need to evict people to do the refurbishments. In fact, when one looked at the apartments being refurbished it was clear they did not need to be refurbish them at all, or the refurbishments were so minor that eviction was certainly not required. Most people in the block were tenants of the vulture fund but one or two were private owners and, strangely enough, the electrical works the fund claimed justified evicting people would have required the entire complex, including the privately-owned apartments, to have been vacated if it fund was telling the truth to the RTB. Of course, we, Threshold and the tenants pointed out to the RTB that the vulture fund was lying. The board agreed in that case and the effort to mass evict those tenants fell on that ground. This was the second time the vulture fund tried to evict them and then there was a third attempt. It ground down half of the tenants who left and said they could take it anymore, even though it was clear the vulture fund was lying to the tenants and the RTB. All it wanted to do was get the tenants out, get vacant possession and maximise the value of the property or dramatically increase the rent and get around the rent caps. I talked to the Minister about intervening and buying that block. There is a possibility the vulture fund is lying about planning to sell it. We should test it out and I hope the Minister will. There is a possibility that the company is a shell company operating on behalf of other people. A lot of funny stuff is going on but these people will not be criminalised, yet somebody who tries to prevent themselves and their family from being evicted into homelessness, particularly, during a public health pandemic, will be. I would do anything for my family. Would the Minister not do anything to stop his family being put out on the street, by a landlord he knew was evicting him to make money, if he knew that was the alternative? We are talking about people who are driven by money wanting to maximise the profit they can make out of a property and are willing to put families and children out on street, particularly, in the midst of a pandemic. If I was in that situation, I would do anything to protect my children. The Minister wants to criminalise them, which is shocking.  Fianna Fáil is a republican party. What does he think small peasant farmers did when faced with British landlords trying to throw them off the land? Would he say they might have been a bit dishonest with the landlords who were trying to evict them for whatever reason? They might have been, but we would mostly sympathise with them in trying to resist those evictions. It really is shocking that while these greed-driven vulture funds and unscrupulous landlords will be allowed to do whatever they want to do to get people out for money, they will not be criminalised if they happen to be dishonest in their efforts to do that.However, a household that is doing nothing more than trying to ensure they are not made homeless in the middle of a pandemic will be criminalised. The Minister should accept our amendment and recognise that this represents gross double standards. It is applying different standards to the rich and powerful as against the standards being applied to vulnerable people trying to keep a roof over their head.

I fully concur with Opposition colleagues. Based on his comments so far, one would assume the Minister will not accept amendment No. 4. I ask him to look at the wording of this section of the Bill, which refers to a criminal offence where somebody provides information that is false or misleading. The dictionary definition of "false" suggests that there is intent, that somebody intentionally falsifies something. However, "misleading" is a much vaguer term. Someone could mislead unintentionally or accidentally without full knowledge. Therefore, at a minimum I ask the Minister to consider my amendment No. 5, which would require at the base level the threshold of proof being that somebody did this intentionally. I listened carefully to Deputy Barry and I agree with his sentiments. That is why I am happier to support amendment No. 4. The word "misleading" is very vague and open. Somebody without any intention whatsoever could provide information which is argued to be misleading and therefore could be criminalised.

I will shortly deal with the specific queries Deputy Boyd Barrett had. Swearing a declaration is not a new provision. It is illegal to make a false declaration. That is not new and refers to a previous Act. In instances where somebody unintentionally does so, the RTB will obviously have discretion and will be asked to exercise its judgment for any unintentional or genuine mistakes that are made. That absolutely will not be an issue. I cannot accept any Opposition amendments to section 4 of the Bill. Every line and every word in section 4 has been carefully considered from a legal and policy perspective. The law needs to be strong. The declaration is key to activate the significant protections under the Bill. Making any false or misleading declaration is a serious matter. It is a serious matter if somebody falsely makes a declaration. The associated offence provision is required to counter any temptation to do so. As I have said, if a genuine mistake is made, the RTB will exercise its judgment in that regard. We need to be fair. The provisions that are coming in will endure until 10 January 2021 for a very significant number of tenants. Deputy Ó Ríordáin asked about the retrospective nature. I refer him to section 5(4) which deals with the retrospective application of the declarations. I am satisfied that is covered. I cannot accept those amendments. Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke to me about St. Helen's Court and we spoke again just a couple of days ago. I understand part of that is still under investigation by the RTB. Incidentally, it is an offence for landlords. I say this very strongly and I intend to follow it up. Where grounds of sale or refurbishment are being used spuriously or erroneously, landlords need to be prosecuted. That should not be allowed to happen. I will specifically look at the development the Deputy raised with me. I know there may have been an issue with getting correspondence from his office. I give that commitment. As Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, I have put out a call for housing, specifically focused on those who may be at risk of homelessness or those who are homeless now. I have asked our local authorities, through the Housing Agency to purchase properties particularly focusing on one-bedroom units because 70% of adults who are homeless are single people and there is not enough accommodation to satisfy that demand. We are pushing that very hard this year. Even though we lost nearly eight weeks in the public sector construction of homes due to the Covid crisis, I am also pushing the local authorities to do everything we possibly and physically can to meet the exacting targets set out by them on delivery of new builds and properties through the approved housing bodies, AHBs and through turnkeys. I have set up two specific units which I chair every Monday morning. The first meeting is on homelessness at 8 a.m. and the second meeting is on housing delivery immediately afterwards with partners in this sector, such as Threshold, Simon and De Paul. All those people do a lot of really good work and support the work of Government and this Dáil in assisting people who need help and those who have fallen into homelessness. It is an absolute priority for me. Another priority for me and for the Government is to ensure we have robust focused measures to protect tenants and this Bill does that. In that context and as I said, I will not accept amendments Nos. 4 and 5.

Somebody who owns property with a tenant in his or her property can play the game and get away with it by making declarations which many people know to be a half-truth, a non-truth or a blatant lie. That person will not end up with a criminal sanction under the provisions of this Bill, but the tenants who try to keep their family together, as other people have mentioned, face criminal sanction on top of potential eviction. That is why we feel so strongly about it and will press the amendment to a vote.

I do not think a single Deputy in this House would disagree with the amendment and would not want to see protections afforded to front-line workers, who have been running our essential services throughout the pandemic, many of whom are in low-paid jobs as carers, cleaners and have been keeping our supermarkets open, at the tills and stacking the shelves. I do not think a single Deputy in this House would not support the limited protections of this Bill applying to them as well. The only way that can happen is for the amendment to be agreed in order that the limited protections in the Bill will apply to all tenants. If the amendment is accepted, it will also help vulnerable tenants who are at risk of eviction into homelessness, who are not covered by the Bill because although they may well be on low income or on low pay, they are not in receipt of a Covid-19 payment, as they have not been out of work due to Covid-19. Such tenants do not receive protections under this Bill and it is vital that this amendment be passed and they are covered. According to ESRI research, the most vulnerable people in terms of health risks from Covid-19 are people working in lower paid jobs, many of whom are renting privately and are not getting protection under this Bill. I strongly urge every Deputy and party in this House to back the amendment to ensure that front-line workers get the protection and respect they deserve. The entire country feels gratitude to them for keeping our essential services open throughout the pandemic. Backing the amendment will also mean that fewer people get evicted into homelessness.

This cluster of amendments does something very similar to the amendment moved by Deputy O'Callaghan, albeit in a slightly more elaborate way. While the first amendment is probably the simplest amendment that I have tabled to this Bill, what it seeks to do is very profound, which is to widen the scope of the protections in this legislation to all tenants in the private rented sector.One argument the Minister has used both on Second Stage and today is that he wants legislation to be legally and constitutionally sound, arguing that the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, which we passed on 27 March, would not have stood that test. I would have no difficulty if the Minister had come to the House with a robust and legally and constitutionally sound Bill to do precisely that, but he has not done so and that is the fundamental problem. A key provision of the emergency legislation was to prevent the spread of the virus. That was one of the legal underpinnings for the constraining of property rights that was rightfully supported by the House on 27 March. Vacant possession notices to quit have been the single largest cause of family homelessness in recent years. The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, and Focus Ireland, through detailed research, have confirmed that to us on a number of occasions. More importantly, according to data from the DRHE for March and April, it witnessed a 56% drop in the number of presentations of families who had received vacant possession notices to quit moving into emergency accommodation, and the measures led to the lowest number of families with children in emergency accommodation in three years. I have spoken to front-line workers in homelessness services in the NGO and local government sector. They have said that more than any other measure, the ban the House agreed to, among others, on vacant possession notices to quit in March was the single greatest contributory factor in that trend. The reason we should extend that provision is not just that we do not want these families to become homeless, but if they do become homeless, at a time when there is still a significant threat of spread of the virus, they will go into emergency accommodation and congregated residential settings, and the risk of the spread of the virus for those people and anybody they are in contact with will greatly increase. Given that the end of the ban will coincide with the reopening of schools and given that large numbers of children who are currently, or could in the future end up, in emergency accommodation will be going back to school, that risk of spread will be even greater. While I do not want to create alarm or panic, the whole purpose of restricting the flow of families with children into emergency accommodation was public health led. I firmly believe that the original provisions in the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, as passed on 27 March, continue to apply, particularly to those at risk of homelessness or of entering emergency accommodation. My amendments, Nos. 11 and 12, will do something similar. The former seeks to extend the protections of the Bill to those who have received notices to quit from their landlords and are likely to result in homelessness, and there is a similar provision in amendment No. 12. Amendment No. 13 is slightly different. In media debates and meetings with landlords in which I have taken part, many of them have rightly raised a concern. It is important that landlords hear that those of us who want to strengthen tenants' rights are not against good landlords who abide by the law and provide a decent service by providing affordable and secure accommodation. Many of us would, of course, much prefer if there were a far greater reliance on the public sector to deliver public housing, but insofar as there is a private rented sector where landlords abide by the rules and give their tenants good service, they should be supported in doing that. Amendment No. 13 will create a number of very narrow exceptions to the general protections of what I and others in opposition would like to see in the Bill. If, for example, there is a tenant with a good job who simply decides to abuse these protections and not pay the rent, even though he or she clearly and demonstrably has a capacity to do so, the landlord should be entitled to take such a case to the Residential Tenancies Board during the emergency period, with the RTB to make a decision on the matter. Likewise, where, for example, a tenant is engaged in the wilful, anti-social destruction of the property - I do not mean someone who might have complex issues in his or her life and needs support and assistance - he or she should not have the protection of the provisions I propose. Again, the RTB should be able to adjudicate in such cases. There may even be a tiny number of cases of accidental landlords - not professional or commercial landlords or people who turn a profit - for whom their inability to get access to the property could result in their becoming homeless, and that should be something that the RTB would at least be allowed to consider. Amendment No. 13 will allow the RTB to hear, mediate and adjudicate on such cases. My final amendments in this grouping, Nos. 35 and 36, again simply seek to make the point, one that has been well made by others during the debate, that these protections should apply to all renters other than those in the narrowly defined circumstances I have outlined. On that basis, I urge Deputies to support the amendments.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	261	My amendment, No. 10, will add to the category of relevant persons people aged over 65, all those who have lost income and those with underlying medical conditions. There is much confusion in society, created in large measure by people involved in the Government's spin machine. They were on the FM radio stations at the start of the week saying what the Bill would do, which gave the impression that it contains far wider protections than is really the case. Many people have the impression that if someone is receiving the pandemic unemployment payment or the temporary wage subsidy scheme, he or she cannot be evicted between now and the new year, whereas those protections will apply only where the landlord seeks to evict on grounds of rent arrears. They will not apply in the case of the sale of the property, renovation, a relative of the landlord moving in and so on. Amendment No. 10, a minor amendment that is not our key point, will provide that even the narrow grounds the Government proposes on which to offer protections should be extended, beyond people who are on the pandemic unemployment payment or the temporary wage subsidy scheme, to include those over the age of 65, which is a very basic point. Does the Minister seriously suggest that people over the age of 65 should be evicted in the middle of a pandemic? For those who have lost their incomes, perhaps the Minister will say they are protected but they are protected only in a very narrow sense. Not all those who have lost their incomes will be protected, although they should be. It will also be extended to those with underlying medical conditions. That is a very reasonable, basic point. Is the Minister seriously saying the door should be open to evicting people with underlying medical conditions in the midst of a pandemic? How can that position be defended? I hope the Government will support amendment No. 10. If it is not prepared to do so, people should take note.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	262	I will speak to our amendments, Nos. 10 and 33. The argument we are making in both amendments, very simply, is that we are still in a public health emergency. The ban was brought in to protect people against being evicted and made homeless in the context of an emergency that threatens people's health. Unless something has changed that we have missed, we are still in that public health emergency, and it is widely expected that it will continue and that there will be further waves and spikes until we get a vaccine. What has changed that now justifies people being made homeless? It seems absolutely nothing has. It would be unconscionable to put people into homelessness and to allow them to be evicted where they have underlying health conditions or where they are over the age of 65 and in that high-risk group of older people who have been devastated. People with underlying conditions and older people make up the cohort that has been devastated to the greatest extent, in comparison with other groups, by the impact of Covid-19. The vast majority of the 1,700 people who have died as a result of Covid-19 are in those categories. The whole effort to protect people against Covid-19 is, to a very large extent, about protecting these groups of people from further infection, severe illness and death.How on earth could the Minister open the door to putting these people out on the street? That is what the Bill will do. Whatever about amendment No. 33, where we seek to go further and continue the entire eviction ban and prevent all evictions until the health emergency is over completely for everybody, I do not see how the Minister can possibly argue against amendment No. 10. People whose health, life and welfare are particularly vulnerable must be protected as a matter of priority and it would be unthinkable to make them homeless, and, of course, there are many tens of thousands of people who have lost their jobs and income and are already devastated economically by the impact of Covid-19. Again, it is unconscionable that these people would have the added hardship and despair of being made homeless and being evicted. I ask the Minister to tell me if I am missing something because it appears from the legislation that the Minister seems to think it is now okay and justifiable for these groups of people to be evicted. This is utterly unacceptable. Beyond that, our other amendment states the overall justification for this legislation remains and nothing has changed. If the Minister has an argument against this he should get up and make it. The general Government position is that we are still in a pandemic and we need restrictions, including travel restrictions. There is the potential of a second wave and that is why Members are in this building. Covid-19 is still a threat to our entire society. Nothing has changed from the context that led to this eviction ban coming in. If this is the case, I do not see how the Attorney General can claim somehow there is a legal problem with continuing a ban on evictions and rent increases, which was justified in March. Why is it not legally justified now as the pandemic continues?

I believe the legislation will create strong law but to protect vulture funds and landlords and not tenants. The Bill is about profit. That is what it is about. I am here, as are many other Deputies who have tabled amendments, to stand up for people, families and tenants. I am dealing with numerous families who were given notices to quit, in other words eviction, before the emergency legislation was introduced in March. What the Bill will do is evict these families. That is what it will mean to them. What protection will the Minister and the Government give these families who will be evicted and perhaps become homeless? These are families who are paying their rent. They are good people who are doing everything right. There is a lot of talk about a second wave and, like many others, I am very worried about another Covid wave. What the Bill, the Government and the Minister will do is create a second wave of evictions and homelessness and a second wave of a housing crisis.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	264	I want to speak to amendment No. 34. I emphasise there is something slightly disconnected happening with this attempt to remove the ban on evictions. As has been said, the reason the ban on evictions was introduced was to protect public health in the middle of a pandemic. What has changed? We do not know where we are heading with this. We do not know yet whether there will be another spike in Covid that will run rampant through all sorts of congregated settings, possibly even the schools when they return. This is not an attempt to scaremonger. It is an attempt to be real. If the Minister was being real he would recognise that if the emergency period was extended then the provisions in the emergency period should remain. In particular I argue this provision should remain. I am not just picking this out from my deep and innermost thoughts because I have people coming to me on a daily basis who are fearful and insecure about the ban on evictions being lifted, not because they are in rent arrears, quite the contrary as they are up to date with their rent and they do not have a problem with finances, but because prior to Covid their landlords had either issued a notice or had indicated the tenancy was coming to an end due to various reasons, possibly to sell, to move in a family member or to refurbish. There is a swathe of apartments in Emmet Court, Inchicore, that are due to be emptied to be refurbished, with dozens of families potentially being moved out of them. When we debated the original Bill, we tabled an amendment to strengthen the provisions already in it. This was agreed to, including by the Minister's party, Fianna Fáil, and I am sure at the time as an Opposition spokesperson on housing, the Minister voted in favour of it. This inserted subsection (7), which stated notwithstanding anything else all tenancies, including rent a room, licensee tenancies and with a specific focus on the Traveller community and council tenants, would be covered by the ban on evictions. If the amendments we have tabled fall, what will happen is that from 10 August, the floodgates on evictions will open. There will be a tsunami of evictions, not necessarily on that date but following it. If we end up in a situation whereby there is a massive increase in the number of families moving into homelessness, including children, we will go into a very dangerous situation in the middle of a pandemic. There is something missing from the Minister's brain if he really thinks this is acceptable. It is not acceptable to do this to people. It is not acceptable to put them through this fear and insecurity and the potential of having to go into emergency accommodation while we still have not suppressed the Covid-19 virus. It is very serious and every Deputy in the House needs to consider what button he or she hits today because when Members hit that button, they will open the tsunami come August and many families are already terrified about what the consequences could be. It just does not make sense because the Minister, who has responsibility for housing, will be faced with the fallout from this and he will not be able to cope with it, just as the previous Government, because of the type of housing policy it adopted, was not able to cope with an emergency and a housing crisis where people were pushed into homelessness on a daily basis. The Government does not have the housing stock to provide for people who are going to be evicted. The Minister is giving himself more problems but, more importantly, he is putting the population at risk, including some of the most vulnerable members of our communities. He is putting them and their children back at risk. He has no right to do this. As I have said, all Deputies, particularly those in the Green Party, really need to consider what button they push when they vote on this because it is outrageous to even contemplate the idea that landlords could evict after 10 August on all sorts of grounds. The Minister is focusing on the question of arrears. That is fair enough but it goes way beyond that. We spelled it out in subsection (7), which is why we have tabled the amendment. Remove the date of 10 August, allow the emergency period for a ban on evictions to continue until January 2021, and allow the subsection we inserted, with the support of the Minister and his party at the beginning of the crisis, to remain.

I am actually going into panic mode. The Government has a fabulous knack of watering things down. A lot of the Opposition amendments are based on one thing, which is fairness. Deputy Ó Broin spoke about protecting both sides, the renter and the landlord.As other speakers have said, there is a pandemic and an emergency, but there is also an emergency with housing and homelessness. We talk on and on about emergencies. With the utmost respect, every time the Minister speaks about a Government amendment, I see more people being thrown out onto the street and more people being affected mentally by this. We will be back here in the new year and we will be hearing about not hundreds but thousands of cases of mental health difficulties, suicides, families living with families and couch surfing, which has been mentioned already. I expect tents to become very expensive because people will not have a house or anywhere to live except a tent. I listened to the debate earlier about protecting the most vulnerable. It was mentioned that some people might not have had the luxury of a strong education and would have difficulty reading. The Minister replied with the suggestion that he would fix that, and that if they cannot read or write they can do it through a computer and send it by email. These people cannot even afford a computer and probably do not have broadband. As I listened I recalled watching a world championship snooker match when I was a young fellow. The commentator said, "For those people watching in black and white, the pink is between the blue and the green". That did not make much sense to me watching it in black and white. Many of the amendments I am hearing about from the Government have the same resonation in my head. We are facing massive implications if this Bill is passed tonight without protection for everybody. I appeal to the Members here and to the Members who will be here later to vote on the Bill to think with their conscience. Unfortunately, the future is unpredictable, but one can plan for it. I hope to God that the misfortune and suffering people are experiencing today never knock on the Government Members' doors. They will scratch their heads and say, "Where did we all go wrong when Members on the opposite side were trying to do the right thing?" I urge them to plan for the future. There is an emergency here and we must keep it going. The Government has said many times that we have to keep it going. We must keep these emergency measures and the protection of people going. I appeal to every Member of the House to do the right thing. Members should not make the mistake of coming back to the House in a couple of months scratching their heads and asking themselves where they all went wrong.

The overarching thing we are trying to achieve was referenced by the previous speaker, with whom I agree. There can be a level of political game playing, either here or in Leinster House, as the Minister knows, in which the Opposition tries to depict the Government as uncaring, unfeeling and on the side of everything that is bad while everybody in the Opposition is on the side of everything that is good. It is not as simple as that, as we know. We know that everybody in politics comes into politics to make a positive difference. We are not trying to depict anybody in the Government as trying to do something destructive. The issue is that we have been having debates on housing and homelessness for the best part of at least seven years and the public has lost faith in politicians' ability to come together and deliver solutions. However, what the public has seen since March is that a Government intervention has made the difference. We are asking the Government to continue its own policy. If a measure introduced by the Government in March has resulted in a decrease in the number of people presenting as homeless and a demonstrable improvement in tackling the problem, why would the Government not just continue with the policy that is seen to be successful? That is what is so frustrating. The Labour Party and other political parties in the House are not trying to depict the Government as uncaring or unfeeling. However, if a Government policy is working, why can we not just continue to work with it? The problem is, as I said the other day, that we will return here in September and, while we do not want to be right, there is every indication that we will be right and that we will be in a position to say, "We told you". It is much more comfortable for me to stand in Dáil Éireann and say we were right than it is for the person who is affected by this Bill. Those are the stakes with which we are playing. We cannot get this wrong. I fundamentally believe the Minister is a compassionate person who wants to do the right thing in terms of housing people. I know that he has absolutely no intention of making anybody homeless. The problem is that the Government policy is working but this Bill is going to change that. The stakes are so high that I wish the Government would accept the amendments that have been put forward in good faith.

I will deal individually with the items that have been raised. Perhaps I will deal with the section first and then try to respond to the queries. We have to look at the provisions that are in place now and the basis of those provisions, which is emergency legislation. What I and the Government will do is put the provisions on a stronger footing by way of primary legislation that will extend protections for those who need them most to 10 January next year. That is what the Bill does. I ask Members to be responsible in some of their contributions and comments. While I respect them and the position they are coming from, we also have a responsibility not to stoke fear among the population in this regard. The measures in the Bill will be very effective. Section 4 provides that Part 2 shall not apply unless the tenant makes a written declaration that he or she is a relevant person as defined clearly in the subsection. I will deal with the literacy issue raised by Deputy Buckley in a moment. A relevant person means a person unable to comply with his or her obligations to pay rent because he or she is or was - it is important that there is a retrospective nature to this legislation - out of work due to having contracted Covid-19 without entitlement to be paid by the employer or in receipt or entitled to receive in the future the temporary wage subsidy or any other payment out of public moneys provided for by or under statute and paid for the purpose of alleviating financial hardship resulting from the loss of employment occasioned by Covid-19, including rent supplement or a supplementary welfare allowance, and as a consequence is at a significant risk that his or her tenancy will be terminated by the landlord. The definition of "relevant person" in the Bill does not make reference to a person's age or general health, as some are suggesting by way of the amendments. They are inserting further conditions by proposing those amendments. The definition does not require the tenant to be at risk of homelessness. Sinn Féin's amendment No. 11 seeks to put a further condition in the protections. I am at a loss to understand why it would do that. The definition does not require the tenant to be at risk of homelessness but does require that he or she be at risk of his or her tenancy being terminated on foot of rent arrears. I am asking people to comply with a lower threshold. Sinn Féin is asking that the tenant effectively make a declaration that he or she will be homeless. We are not asking for that.

I heard Deputy Ó Broin comment on this both publicly and privately. That person's tenancy can be terminated in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act with seven days' notice. If there is a rogue tenant, and there are very few, who is wreaking havoc on an honest mom and pop landlord and is carrying out anti-social or criminal behaviour, the tenant is not covered under these protections.They are not-----

The key focus of section 4 is to assist tenants faced with adverse economic impacts on foot of the Covid-19 pandemic and who find themselves unable to pay rent and at a significant risk of having their tenancy terminated. It is not the case that such tenants have to declare they are going to become homeless, as Sinn Féin is asking people to do. We need to target help to those tenants who need that assistance. I cannot accept amendment No. 34. Section 12 of the Bill amends section 5, "Notices of termination under Act of 2004", of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 by providing in subsection (6) a redefinition of the revised termination date in order that it cannot expire any earlier than 10 August. The potential unintended consequence of amendment No. 34, if passed, is that it would actually remove the 10 August date, which would mean that any transitionary protections would be removed immediately. I do not think that is what Deputy Barry or Deputy Bríd Smith want to do, but that would be the legal consequence of the acceptance of the amendment they have tabled. A person who is due to move out at the end of March has an extra four months in situ, given the pandemic. The rental sector is open for business again. I accept that it has been an uncertain time for tenants, but the emergency protections were always temporary, and we need to strengthen protections for those who need them most by using permanent measures through primary legislation. The law needs to be clear. Section 5(7) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 needs to cease operation on 1 August along with the rest of Part 2 of that Act. This Bill will take over insofar as emergency protections for renters up to 10 January 2021 are concerned. I cannot accept amendments Nos. 37 and 38 to the Title, which has been agreed by my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.

It is the Government's intention to progress this Bill through all Stages and I look forward to engaging with Deputies in that regard. This important legislation constitutes the Government's response to the challenges posed to our courts and legal systems by the current pandemic. The Bill goes beyond the pandemic, however, and aims to make our legal processes more efficient and effective in future. I state confidently that this Bill is needed urgently and represents a substantial modernisation and reform of our courts and legal systems. The Bill covers a wide range of issues regarding our civil and criminal legal systems. I will outline these to the House.

Part 2 of the Bill contains urgent amendments to the Coroners Act 1962. The main provisions at sections 7 and 8 provide new powers for the Minister to authorise temporary additional capacity in the coroner system as necessary to meet the risks and challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. Section 6 is as standard. Section 7 inserts a new section, 11B, into the principal Act, entitled "Assignment and appointment of temporary coroners in exceptional circumstances". This section applies where a coroner makes a written request to the Minister justifying the need for a temporary additional coroner in that coroner's district. The Minister must be satisfied, first, that exceptional circumstances arise due to the number or nature of deaths arising from a pandemic, a catastrophic event or other mass fatality occurrence; and, second, that the requested extra capacity is necessary to increase the number and progress of coroners' enquiries into deaths in the coroner's district. If so satisfied, the Minister may assign or appoint a temporary additional coroner to that district for a period not exceeding six months. This may be renewed each time for a period not exceeding six months on a new justified request from the coroner of the district. A temporary coroner under this section will have all the powers and duties of a coroner for the district concerned during the period of appointment or assignment, other than the power to appoint a deputy. He or she will be, effectively, acting as an additional coroner. Section 8 inserts a new section, 13B, in the principal Act entitled, "Arrangements for coroners’ districts other than coroner’s district of Dublin". This section provides that in the exceptional circumstances already outlined where a coroner of a district so requests in writing, the Minister may authorise the deputy coroner of that district to act concurrently for the coroner during a period not exceeding six months, which may be renewed. The deputy must have consented to so act. The same justification is required for this request and any renewal as under section 7 of this Bill and the same arrangements in respect of powers, duties and costs apply. The proposed section applies only to coroner districts outside of Dublin. The reason is that in the Dublin coroner district the deputy coroner is already authorised to act concurrently with the coroner under a Dublin-specific temporary provision in section 13A of the principal Act, which is valid until 2022, and which was brought in by my predecessor as Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan. Section 9 proposes to amend section 14 of the principal Act. The effect of the amendment is that a person appointed as a temporary coroner under the new section, 11B, must have the same qualifications as are already required for a person appointed to the office of coroner or deputy coroner. I will now move on to the issue of reform of the law, and that concerning civil proceedings first. Section 10 of Chapter 1 of Part 3 provides for a definition of the term "civil proceedings". More substantively, Chapter 2 of Part 3 provides for the remote hearing of civil proceedings. At present, current social distancing rules are causing disruption to and difficulties for court hearings. This is leading to delays in the administration of justice. The current climate is particularly challenging for the courts service in managing the efficient and continued operation of our courts. I am sure the Deputies will agree with me that we must assist our courts and protect the well-being of those who engage with them. Section 11 of this Bill enables a court to direct that any category or type of civil proceedings be conducted remotely. A court may make such a direction either of its own motion or on the application of any of the parties. Participants will take part in a remote hearing by electronic means and from a location other than the court itself, whether inside or outside the State. A court shall revoke a direction to participate in a remote hearing where, for whatever reason, it would be unfair to any of the parties to do so or it would be otherwise contrary to the interests of justice to do so. It shall be also an offence to make a recording of a hearing without the permission of the court. Additionally, a judge may participate in a remote hearing, notwithstanding the fact that he or she is not physically within his or her district or circuit. In summary, the conducting of remote hearings will be an extremely important tool to facilitate the efficient dispatch of court business. It will increase court efficiency and assist in overcoming the current difficulties.Chapter 3 of Part 3 concerns the admissibility of business records in civil proceedings. The reforms in this chapter are based very much on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its Consolidation and Reform of Aspects of the Law of Evidence report in 2016. They mirror measures already in operation in criminal law cases under the Criminal Evidence Act 1992. The commission's report considers that business records are possibly the most common form of hearsay evidence presented in litigation and their legal status is of particular importance. In the majority of cases and in the previous absence of a statutory basis, many litigants agree to admit documentary hearsay evidence in order to expedite proceedings or spare themselves an adverse cost order if the objection proves unfounded. However, in a minority of cases, certain litigants may insist on proof of each and every document. These cases have posed increasing difficulties for our courts in recent years and highlight the need for statutory intervention. The commission's report recommends that records compiled in the course of business, because they are generally reliable, should be admissible in civil proceedings as an inclusionary exception to the hearsay rule, subject to the safeguards that have been set out in the Bill. Separately, the Court of Appeal was called in a recent case, Promontoria (Aran) Ltd. v. Burns, to interpret and apply the law as it currently stands regarding the admissibility of business records in civil cases. Both judgments delivered by the court last April were clearly of the view that the law in this area needs to be updated by legislative reform. More recently, the Judiciary has specifically identified legislative reform of the civil law rules on business records to my Department as among the most urgent priorities for it to be able to advance cases fairly and without unnecessary delays and costs to all parties concerned. This chapter, prepared in detailed consultation with the office of the Attorney General, provides that, in civil proceedings, any record in the form of a document compiled in the course of business shall be presumed to be admissible as evidence of the truth of the fact or facts asserted in that document. However, it is important to say that just because a document is admissible in evidence does not mean the court will presume the records are correct. Under the proposed amendments, business records can be still challenged in the normal way by another party to the proceedings. In addition, they can be challenged by the court itself which will have a specific power under proposed section 16(1) to exclude business records evidence in the interests of justice on its own motion - for example, even in a case where no formal application has been made to exclude a business record because a litigant is not legally represented. The remaining sections set out provisions around oral evidence in respect of those documents, rules in relation to providing copies of documents where the original is not available, the criteria for supplying documents to the court, and power for the court to determine whether it is in the interests of justice to admit documents as evidence, among others. Chapter 4 of Part 3 provides for two important measures in the use of electronic means in civil proceedings. The first is the remote lodgment or e-filing of documents with the courts. The second is a provision for statements of truth as an alternative to the swearing of affidavits. Section 20 introduces e-filing as an alternative to the lodgment or filing of document replications in paper form. Rules of court may specify the conditions under which documents are submitted by electronic means. Section 21 provides for a statement of truth. This may be in electronic form as it is an alternative to the swearing of an affidavit or statutory declaration as a means of submitting evidence or verifying documents. The section also provides for an offence of making or causing a false statement to be made. I will briefly discuss Part 4 which contains substantive reforms to our criminal procedural law, particularly relating to the use of widened video link technology in criminal proceedings. This Part also includes important reforms to improve efficiencies in executing warrants. These provisions are urgently needed to assist the courts with the conduct of their business in these extraordinary times. This Bill provides for wider use of video links between persons in custody and the courts which were formerly permitted in limited circumstances under sections 33 and 34 of the Prisons Act 2007. On the recommendations of the Attorney General, the Bill also extends the provisions to cover persons not in custody so that any accused person can attend by video link for certain applications where the court so directs. I only have ten minutes to speak, so I will move on to Part 5. It concerns the introduction of provisions relating to broad sets of issues. These seek to ensure compliance with social distancing and the health and safety of citizens. They facilitate the continued operation via remote means of State bodies, unincorporated bodies and designated bodies. Section 29 provides for the remote meeting of State bodies. They may be designated by the appropriate Minister for that purpose, subject to certain criteria.  Section 30 provides for the remote meetings of unincorporated bodies, for example, clubs, community associations and charitable organisations. The GAA would be an example of such a body. The interim period shall be for three months following the commencement of section 3 or for any other period requested by the Government in the interests of public health. Section 31 provides that the bodies designated by the Ministers may hold hearings remotely, subject to certain criteria. Section 32 is aimed at improving efficiencies in our legal system and provides for the execution of contracts or deeds in counterpart, subject to the requirements as set out in the section. Under section 26(1)(f) of the Courts of Justice Act 1953, the Courts Service must prepare and issue a statutory instrument each time it needs to vary a District Court opening time, location, etc. The requirements of that paragraph are complex and time consuming. They do not supply the Courts Service with the flexibility to address its requirements in situations such as, but not limited to, the current pandemic. Section 33 inserts a new section into the 1953 Act which provides that each time the Courts Service needs to vary the hours of operating or sitting location, etc., for the District Court, it shall publish a notice to do so on its website outlining the changes. This must be done in consultation and with the consent of the President of the District Court. The Bill contains important steps in the process in modernising our courts and our civil and criminal law systems in the light of the current pandemic. I believe the measures I have outlined will ensure the continuity of the essential services of our courts in a safe and efficient manner for our citizens. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to engaging with Deputies on the matter.

There was a sense of agreement around all of these measures about Covid-19, making life easier for people who work in our courts system and prison service and mitigating against the difficulties that exist. In that context, we all agreed there would be a suspension of the normal process we go through when passing legislation such as this. Normally, a Bill will pass through Committee Stage during which we tease out and work out all of the various issues that might arise or become contentious. We took the suspension of that legislative scrutiny seriously. We asked the Department to supply a brief in respect of the Bill, which we received. We discovered a small section in that brief which dealt with certain business documents being made admissible in civil cases. We wondered where this came from because, from our point of view and that of anyone in the legal profession with whom we spoke, there did not seem to be anything Covid related around that issue. It did not seem to be an emergency and yet it was included in this legislation which was not going to get legislative scrutiny. We were alarmed, and are still, in respect of that. Our proposal is to ensure that some sense of regularity is brought to this situation. We suggest a time limit on this legislation. The previous health legislation which was introduced to deal with situations related to Covid will expire on a particular date and can be extended with the agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas. That date is 9 November and we propose that the same date applies to the expiry of the Bill we are now discussing to ensure there is a sense of continuity. We all live in the real world and expect that, on 9 November, all of this legislation will need to be extended. We therefore commend the Sinn Féin amendment so that this legislation expires on that date and we can move forward from there. The other amendment deals with almost the entirety of chapter 3 and covers sections 12 to 19, inclusive. We feel it is totally inappropriate to have those sections included in this legislation. I spoke at length to the Minister about it. We have exercised our concerns at all levels and spoken to many people in the legal profession. Many people have suggested that this part of the Bill is to benefit the vulture funds and certain aspects of the banking sector. The nub of the issue is around contracts that people sign and enter into with a lending organisation. It is possible for that debt then to be sold, usually for two reasons. The first is that repayments may be in arrears to some extent or there may be a difficulty around them. The second is that the legal documentation may not be as secure as one would like. That debt is then taken by vulture funds who exercise their right to recover it through service agencies. These service agencies are another step away from the original contract that was agreed.  When a case is litigated, as it stands, those contracts are considered hearsay evidence. That is the issue and this legislation will change that. That evidence which is hearsay under current legislation might become admissible and taken as live evidence, particularly in a summary case. It could be then used to have a repossession order placed against a homeowner or business.We feel that is totally inappropriate. The Minister mentioned that the Law Reform Commission published a report on this, and it has made certain suggestions. However, in most cases where a report like that had been published, it would go through normal legislative scrutiny. We would bring in various people from different sides of the argument to hear their worries or concerns and why they feel there could be unintended consequences that may have to be worked out. We would then proceed. This Bill is, in our view, very precarious for borrowers in particular. The measure is being pushed through and is buried in a Bill which is supposed to be about Covid. When I met the Minister earlier today, I told her that I feel this has been done in a very inappropriate sleight-of-hand manner and is not in keeping with what all of us in the House have agreed to do in the context of Covid, that is, work together in a spirit of co-operation. It is wrong. I implore the Minister to withdraw that section of the Bill and ensure that we can deal with it later on.  It may be quite appropriate, but if it is it should be introduced through a proper legislative framework where there is full scrutiny of it and we weigh up all of the pros and cons, something we do not have the opportunity to do here at the 11th hour of the 11th day, that is, the evening when we are about to shut down for the summer. It is totally inappropriate that that particular provision is in the Bill at this time.  I understand the Department may produce proposals, but sometimes the Minister has to be strong, stand up to the Department and say that a proposal is not appropriate and should be withdrawn. I implore the Minister to withdraw the measure and ensure we can get as much support as possible for the Bill and all other legislation connected to Covid-19 because it is in the interests of everyone that we work together and co-operate in respect of these matters. This is a political issue. Buried within a Bill which is supposed to be about Covid is something which has nothing to do with it. It is wrong and inappropriate and I again implore the Minister to withdraw the proposal and ensure we can have some level of conscience in regard to what we are doing and ensure that people who are facing a David and Goliath struggle between bankers and the ordinary borrower-----

I want to speak on certain applications in section 23 regarding criminal proceedings to be heard via live video link. This section was obviously prepared a long time ago, probably pre-Covid. I know from having worked in the criminal courts for some years that there are many cases where it is unnecessary to bring a prisoner to court. Sometimes a prisoner would agree that he or she will not have to be put into a tiny cage in the back of a van and travel for hours to a court hearing.  I have particular concerns about what will happen in indictable cases. There are cases for case management, call-overs, preliminary applications and the like, perhaps even in appellate courts sitting during Covid. I would have less of a problem with this if it was done by consent of a prisoner. If the Bill had been developed in consultation with the Bar Council or the criminal lawyers committee of the Law Society, I might have fewer concerns. Some 80% of what are perhaps unnecessary journeys could have been made by consent. I fear, however, that the real reason behind the Bill is to reduce the €17 million bill for transporting prisoners to court. It is a triumph of expediency over fairness. I agree with the summary of the report from the Library and Research Service. Fundamentally, as we know justice has to be seen to be done. There are personal freedoms in the Constitution but on a practical level in indictable cases, every case apart from murder, rape, or, perhaps, treason, can be dealt with in the Circuit Court. There are cases where people could potentially face life imprisonment, and under the provisions in the Bill they could be heard remotely or via video link without accused persons having their legal teams beside them or members of their family in court. That is fundamentally unfair. I do not know how it could be in the interests of justice or how any judge could see that it would be in the interests of justice, to allow such a thing to proceed. The report from is very good. It states, quite fairly, that the general consensus is that such hearings are better suited to civil matters and less suited to use in the Circuit and District Courts and more suited to civil courts. It goes on to state that legal professionals on the criminal side are generally resistant to engaging in this type of technology on a substantive day-to-day manner.  The report deals in quite a fair way with some of the ways the courts in England operate. The UK Civil Justice Council said that the majority of respondents felt that remote hearings were worse, half of the hearings were affected by technical difficulties and 12.9% had serious technical difficulties. That is what we are dealing with. We all remember when the Department of Justice purchased a video system for Garda stations. When everything was going digital, it purchased a CD system for the recording of interviews in Garda stations. I fear the technology will not be sufficient. Professor Anne Wallace has noted there is often a difficulty in receiving and giving non-verbal cues from other participants in the proceedings and difficulty in hearing or seeing some of the respondents. Surveys have been carried out in England which show that 67% of respondents felt there was a negative impact on the ability of defendants and their lawyers to communicate. This measure will creep into the system. It is likely to become the norm. That cannot be in the interests of justice. I submit that it is not something that Declan Costello would have agreed with or that Eamon de Valera would have introduced. The Bill is rushed, flawed and dangerous. I do not think the necessary technology is in place. It will reduce the ability of defendants to communicate in confidence with lawyers. There is a provision for ex parte applications. That should be removed from the Bill. The proposal to use video links is a cost-saving exercise and we should consider it very seriously before introducing it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	292	I agree with Deputy Martin Kenny that the normal way of dealing with justice legislation is to have a protracted discussion, pre-legislative scrutiny and then a detailed Committee Stage debate. We should not vary from that, except to deal with issues that are absolutely imperative, a point I raised during the briefings. There are number of component parts of this omnibus Bill. I wish to address the part dealing with the existing coroners' law. Legislation on coroners was updated last year on foot of initiatives from the Opposition side of the House. The former Deputy, Clare Daly, MEP, put forward suggestions. The current legislation is somewhat of a patchwork and needs consolidation in order that we can read it as a whole. The Bill seeks to deal with a few issues that are, or have the potential to be, urgent in the case of a pandemic. Given that Covid-19 is upon us, what is the capacity issue? Under current law, there one coroner is allowed per district except for Dublin. To have in law that a coroner or his or her deputy is unable to deal with another district seems odd. A coroner and deputy coroner cannot act concurrently, regardless of the pressure of work, which again seems an odd state of affairs. There is an exception in the existing legislation for Dublin in that regard, but even that exemption is a special temporary provision.  All of these things should be generally allowed for in overarching and permanent legislation. These are largely administrative issues and legislators should provide flexibility so that people can react to the needs of a given situation. These are important matters. Coroner's courts and inquests are important for the families concerned. We have all dealt with families who can be consumed by this process. There is currently a two-year waiting list for some coroner's inquests in Dublin.That was before Covid-19 and it is wholly unacceptable. We need to provide an administrative infrastructure for that to be rectified. The Bill proposes to give statutory authority to the Minister to approve temporary extra coroner capacity in exceptional circumstances. Why would that be the case? Why can she not provide the required number of coroners and have flexibility to move coroners as needs demand? I do not know why it is either time-limited or restricted in that manner. Why limit to six months the period in which a coroner and deputy coroner can act concurrently, as the Minister proposes in this legislation? Why not allow that wherever the pressure of work and requirements allow? As I said, these are important matters of a most sensitive nature. I must gallop through the Bill as I only have ten minutes. For the further advance of civil proceedings, it is important to allow more work to be done remotely. I listened carefully to the comments of my Sinn Féin colleague. The notion of putting individuals in cages in a prison van, as he described, and transferring them for hours across the country to stand for perhaps 30 seconds in a court is ludicrous. It is my understanding from the briefing that this will only apply to limited sets of hearings and certainly could not apply to any hearing or proper trial where, of course, the defendant and legal team would have to be present. I ask the Minister to clarify that. We have all been challenged in trying to amend our work patterns and work remotely. All of society is doing the same and it would be useful for our courts system to catch up with that. The remote hearing of civil proceedings has been allowed for under section 26 of the 2008 Act. Under this proposal, that section will be removed. The Bill provides that courts can make directions to conduct a hearing remotely. I understand that because we do not want circumstances arising where cases could be put off indefinitely if people could object. It should be within the remit of a judge with a seizure of all the information to make that determination and make an order if the administration of justice, in his or her opinion, so requires. The Bill also provides clarity and simplification in the submission of documents of evidence. That is useful. Many solicitors have been in touch with me during this Covid crisis who are concerned about electronic filing of documents and about statements of truth, which are not provided for here, to substitute for sworn affidavits and statutory declarations. I hear the strong point made by Deputy Kenny on the business section of the Bill which, in truth, does not sit comfortably in the body of the legislation which deals, almost exclusively, with efficiencies in working remotely to overcome the challenges placed on the courts system now in both civil and criminal matters with regard to Covid-19.  The briefing document provided to us by the Minister states that these proposals follow the recommendations and the draft Bill produced by the Law Reform Commission in its 2016 report entitled, Consolidation and Reform of Aspects of the Law of Evidence. They are based on similar versions of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 regarding criminal proceedings. The sections in this chapter provide that in civil proceedings any record in the form of a document compiled in the course of business shall be presumed to be admissible as evidence of the truth - that is an important phrase - of the fact or facts asserted in the document. I would be much more comfortable if that provision were taken out and we were given time to consider it. I am a great supporter of the Law Reform Commission. It has done incredibly good and important work and I am, by and large, minded to support its recommendations. However, we need to have time and space, which we do not have in a debate confined to three hours, to make sure we are doing right here and there are no countervailing facts. I support the suggestion made by the Sinn Féin Deputies that the proposal in these sections be put in abeyance until we have a different vehicle in the autumn session to give the matter proper scrutiny. We should bring in expert witnesses and hear expert testimony before we deal with that. I will try to deal in two and a half minutes with the criminal aspects of the legislation. The Bill proposes to facilitate the prosecution of criminal cases in a Covid-19 world through video links, as I have already said. I ask the Minister to give clarity on that to assuage the concerns already expressed by one Deputy. We are talking about the non-trial elements, that is, returns to trial, arraignments and similar matters. There should be no circumstances where a proper trial or hearing would take place without the accused and his or her full legal team being physically present and able to see and cross-examine all witnesses in a normal way. That could not be done by video link.  I referred to other practical measures that lessen the need to transport prisoners across the country. Remote hearings of State bodies are a useful addition in this legislation, although again it is not something one might consider germane to a justice Bill. It is important to put beyond doubt the validity of decisions made by State bodies that now are increasingly meeting in a remote or online fashion and I support that.  There are important elements of reform on both the criminal and civil sides of the proposals that everybody in this House will have no difficulty in supporting. We need clarity and confirmation on the briefing we got from the Minister's officials on the scope of the legislation. I differ with Deputy Kenny on some parts of it, which I do not think should be timelined. In terms of the coroner provision, it is wholly unacceptable there would be a two-year wait for a coroner's inquest in Dublin. We should make permanent the capacity adjustments the Minister is proposing in that part of the Bill. I hope that part of the Bill is not timelined.  Sinn Féin has tabled an amendment simply to oppose all sections of the Bill. It is the prudent course for the Minister, and I advise accordingly, that the business sections not be pressed this evening. They can either inserted in stand-alone legislation in the autumn session or accommodated in other legislation when we have the appropriate time and space to give them the scrutiny they deserve. The Minister would then have consensus and support for this legislation across all sections of the House.

There is variety in it if nothing else. I do not mean to minimise it. We do not have concerns about many elements of the Bill and it is understandable that they should be addressed. However, I have some concerns in line with some of the issues raised by previous speakers. I will return to those in a few minutes. The phrase "justice delayed is justice denied" may be overused but it is vital that we have a justice system capable of maintaining the highest possible standards while functioning in a timely manner. In normal times, this has been a difficult balance to achieve and obviously in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis that challenge is magnified. Many aspects of the Bill are entirely practical administrative measures providing, for example, the option for electronic filing of documents and the provision of statements of truth as an alternative to swearing affidavits. They are necessary, for the time being, but also serve to modernise are courts system and should be par for the course going forward. Many of the workings of our courts system are out of date and border on the archaic. Efforts in this vein to leverage modern technology and streamline the administration of justice are welcome. In the interests of clarity, it is important that we progress this through the use of primary legislation and endeavour to ensure that processes keep step with the normal tools of administration we are all used to in all spheres of life. With regard to the amendment to the Coroners Act, the Bill introduces entirely practical provisions to act as a fail-safe when the coroner's office find itself needing to react to unforeseen events such as the pandemic or another disaster. It is welcome that the fail-safe can be triggered to address the backlog in inquests which has developed. A backlog of inquests has been an issue for some time in Dublin, at least. The Minister might let us know if the same issues exist outside the capital as a result of the pandemic. It may be necessary to authorise a deputy coroner of a district to act in concert with a coroner on a longer-term basis than is provided for in this legislation. Has the Minister had an opportunity to examine the impact of the Coroners (Amendment) Act 2019 on Dublin? Why was six months chosen rather than the two-year period which applies in the Dublin district? The change to civil proceedings seems to be one of the largest practical changes the Bill attempts to address. However, it is the area most open to abuse and manipulation given the lower standard of proof that applies to such proceedings. I share the concerns Deputy Kenny mentioned earlier. Section 14 in Chapter 3 introduces a very important amendment to the law of evidence, effectively allowing business records, which are currently regarded as hearsay, to be introduced in evidence. This change seems to be in response to a court case which made a ruling earlier this year. As I understand it, a vulture fund employs an agent. The agent is not the primary lender and that is why it was ruled inadmissible, because they do not have all the information. I believe this could be dealt with later in the year. Organisations involved in the insolvency sector, the banks and Revenue have all agreed a set of recommendations. They have been in a queue for a couple of years and they do not find a way into this legislation. At the same time three or four months after the ruling on Promontoria in the courts, we are seeing a change that could have profound consequences for people who are very often not able to stand up for themselves. The proposed amendment should be seriously considered. The Minister may well withdraw that section. I believe that merits considerably more scrutiny than we can give it at the moment. Why was this brought forward? It does not seem to be Covid-related. We all accept legislation that is necessary, urgent and limited to Covid is required in different sectors, but this one does not sit well in the Bill. If it remains in the Bill, it would be enough to make us vote against the legislation even though we accept it also contains many changes we welcome. Given the impact legislation on criminal proceedings can have on people's lives, we need to be careful with how we proceed in this area. Certain sections of the Bill will have a practical impact on this area. For example, section 27 deals with the administration of committal warrants. The current requirement that prisoners must be transferred between prisons to have a warrant executed is clearly an administrative burden that has no benefit for a prisoner's civil rights. I have some concerns regarding video links under section 23. This section provides for video links to be permissible in certain court proceedings, such as applications for bail and free legal aid. These are very serious proceedings that have the potential to seriously impact the lives of those making the application. As such there is an onus on us to ensure these forms of procedures do not have a negative impact on fair process for those appearing before them. We have all become used to platforms such as Skype and Zoom. There is a range of them, and I cannot think of their names now. People sometimes miss out on part of what happens owing to broadband quality loss. That can have an impact on the kind of meeting that takes place. There is nothing like a face-to-face meeting. I understand that we are in a different environment now but we need to give careful consideration to temporary measures as opposed to permanent measures. I am quite comfortable with most of the Bill, I have grave concerns over one section and the vulture funds. I do not know why it got the prominence it got. It would be prudent to defer it until later in the year.

I believe this is the first time I have addressed her in this role. I know she has a hard job to sort out. I have previously raised many issues about what is going on in the Prison Officers Association, which is totally unsavoury and needs to be sorted out. There is the issue of justice for the families of victims of the Omagh bomb. They were abandoned and never got the justice they were promised by her predecessors and the previous Taoiseach. There is the Fr. Niall Molloy case and countless others where people need justice. I am shocked that the Minister would slip into this legislation the provision affecting the vulture funds. The Bill is entitled the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 and it is intended primarily to deal with issues relating to Covid, which we all support. However, hidden in Chapter 3 is a section dealing with business records. It is very murky that it is being introduced in the final hours of this Dáil session. Chapter 3 is designed for vulture funds by their well-paid legal advisers to remove any protections for people from vulture funds. In this Bill, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party are making a very devious attempt to get around the hearsay evidence rule. That 150-year old law has stopped vulture funds in their tracks, one of the only ones that has done so. The vulture funds have demanded that the Government enact legislation that allows them to get around the rule by introducing admissible business documents from third parties.These currently have no legal standing before the courts. They may include photocopies of original documents which have been lost or destroyed or which are not available for other reasons. The Bill will also allow photocopies of photocopies to be admitted as evidence. This will allow families to be evicted on the flimsiest of evidence. It is truly shocking. The Bill attempts to undermine the independence of the courts to look at a case fairly and impartiality and seeks to tie the hands of the Judiciary in order that vulture funds can continue with their evictions, as they have throughout the Covid pandemic despite the promises we received that they would not.  This Bill proposed in the Lower House will be signed by President Michael D. Higgins within a matter of days. Over the years there have been several pushes to have the hearsay evidence rule removed from law by the Law Reform Commission and other parties with vested interests in its removal. It is understood that there has been heavy lobbying of the Department of Justice and Equality by vulture funds and legal representatives following recent judgments. The concern is that the Government has jumped to the job and done these people's bidding. That is shocking.  We are all the time railing against what these vultures are doing. The former Minister, Michael Noonan, said they were welcome to our shores. Vultures are not welcome anywhere because we know what they do. They take the eyes out of sheep and lambs out in the field. That is what they are like. They are craven people. As I have said, it is understood that this is the result of heavy lobbying. If the Bill passes all Stages and is signed into law, the balance of power will be with the vulture funds and no protections will be afforded to families, farms, homes or businesses. Deputies of all parties and Independent Deputies need to step up to the plate and oppose this Bill. I am glad amendments have been tabled. I will support the Sinn Féin amendments. If the vulture funds are allowed to dictate how the country is run, a grievous injustice will be allowed to prevail and those who have been fighting both a daily battle and battles in the courts over many years will be punished. It is a shocking indictment of the present Government and its direction.  I will also mention another issue in the important area of justice, a development which will be of deep importance to all citizens and to Members. On 9 July, the European Court of Justice issued a damning judgment against the State in respect of its handling of maritime tragedy investigations. It found clear and obvious fault in the fact that departmental officials were on the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, which is supposed to be independent. Of the five people on the board, two are the chief surveyor and the Secretary General of the Department or his appointee. An additional requirement for compliant officials is clearly set out in the European directive, which reflects international law. This is a damning indictment of our Marine Casualty Investigation Board. I have raised cases in the Chamber, including cases regarding Whiddy Island and many other places nationwide. Some of these incidents occurred off the south-east coast at Tramore.  The European Court of Justice judgment also explains that independence is critical if we are to learn from the tragedies and save other lives. Ireland has failed to put in place suitable arrangements. There is a clear conflict in officials investigating their own regulatory framework and supposedly making recommendations to themselves. Following the judgment, I wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, in respect of failed reports regarding the deaths of my constituents John O'Brien and Pat Esmonde off Helvick Head in 2010 and regarding the deaths of all others in respect of whom investigations were carried out while this conflict of interest prevailed. These amount to approximately 300 reports. With regard to the tragedy of John O'Brien and Pat Esmonde, may they rest in peace, I have been reliably told that, due to these fundamental failings, full information was not included in the MCIB report, which had the effect of compromising the Garda investigation. This needs to be investigated. I am happy that the Garda Commissioner has now directed the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation to reopen this case and look at it again. I thank Mr. Michael Kingston, the maritime lawyer, and Ms Anne Marie O'Brien for the sterling work they have done in an effort to get justice for Ms O'Brien's late brother and his colleague, Pat Esmonde, who died on that beautiful but fateful day ten years ago. Their families, and many others, need justice.  Coroners are also referred to in the Bill. We in south Tipperary are losing our coroner, Mr. Paul Morris. He is an excellent legal person who has given sterling service. The north Tipperary coroner will now be taking over. Tipperary is more than 120 miles long. The distance alone is challenging. Coroner's courts are very important. People need them when they experience tragedies and sudden deaths. The coroner in south Tipperary has always been much busier than the coroner in north Tipperary. This is a retrograde step and another downgrading of our court services. It is another loss to the town of Clonmel. I wish Mr. Morris a very happy retirement. He did a great job and I wish him well but we need a coroner in south Tipperary, as we have always had.  There are cuts everywhere but we are supporting vulture funds and passing legislation in the dead of night before our break for the holidays to ensure they are allowed to carry on their murky, unseemly, disdained practices. They have been carrying these on throughout the period of Covid and they are continuing to do so. I am not supporting this Bill for that reason. I will vote against it.

She is very fit. I saw her running to the Chamber yesterday evening and it was no bother to her at all. I will, however, be opposing and voting against this Bill because I am very worried about parts of it. This new Bill is dressed up to look as if it only deals with issues to help us deal with Covid-19. Centuries of legislation will, however, be abolished to appease vulture funds who want to evict Irish families or to take farms from farmers or property from commercial property owners. Chapter 3 relates to very important issues recently discussed in the Court of Appeal. In the judgment on Promontoria (Aran) Ltd v. Burns, a case which regarded the admissibility of hearsay, all other relevant authorities were considered and those taking cases against the vultures and receivers were given a very easy route to court and a more than credible defence against them with regard to how they might present their alleged evidence.  This Bill is going through at breakneck speed. This case was before the courts in April and this Bill was proposed on 22 July. The Government wants not only to effectively kill the decision made in the Burns case in its entirety, but to also make it even easier to present evidence from third parties in civil proceedings, which would result in a free-for-all. One will not even have to identify where one got information. According to this Bill as currently worded, it will be enough to believe it to be true. That is very wrong and very unfair. It will cause massive undue hardship for poor people who may have done nothing wrong. This Bill cannot and should not be allowed to pass in this form. It is a blatant attempt to further the cause of vulture funds and receivers in particular, who have been finding the courts a much rockier road of late. Chapter 3 needs to be amended. More properly, it should be disregarded. If we, as elected Members, let down ordinary working people, including farmers, house owners, and business people, by making it easier for vulture funds to take their property from them and sell it on, we will have abdicated our duty. As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, we all know what vultures are. The way the banks have handled this, in selling debts to vulture funds, is wrong in the first place. That is what we should be addressing. We should get rid of these funds. The banks should never have been allowed sell debts to vulture funds.

We will take five minutes each. I am up here in the balcony. This Bill deals with how to handle civil and criminal hearings during the Covid crisis. It broadens the types of hearings that can be heard electronically and allows for evidence to be presented electronically. It provides that the rules of court may provide for a statement of truth to be transmitted with the document in place of the affidavit or statutory declaration instead of an oath.It also provides for the appointment of additional coroners where necessary. These proposals seem reasonable when taken at face value. We have all had to change our work patterns and our work practices. I have listened carefully to the arguments put forward by Deputy Martin Kenny on the business section of the Bill concerning the admissibility of documentation as evidence of the truth. This arises from a specific case concerning a vulture fund. A number of Deputies have alluded to it. I do not have a legal background and, to be honest, there has not been sufficient time to go through the Bill properly. However, I have concerns, not least because we have not had time to fully consider this section. I have listened to the contributions here this evening and I am in favour of the suggestion of Deputy Howlin and others that we take out this section and that we debate and discuss it fully in the autumn so that we do not have unintended consequences. In any legislation, we need to be rigorous and prudent and in this case we are being rushed and unsure, mainly because of this specific section. It is generally recognised by all of us that the main purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the operation of the courts and to minimise travel and disruption. I draw the Minister's attention to a situation where instead of minimising travel and disruption, we are in fact creating it by a proposal to move jury courts from Sligo to Letterkenny. I accept the Bill is prompted by Covid and concerns capacity, yet courtroom No. 1 in Sligo has sufficient capacity to conduct a jury trial. A letter from the Courts Service issued yesterday states that Sligo Courthouse has the required capacity when the gallery is included. However, it goes on to state that the gallery contains six timber benches which are not suitable for jurors. As it is a listed building, it is stated that planning permission may be needed to make the benches comfortable for jurors. It does seem somewhat excessive, but if it is necessary I say it should be done, in the context of major disruption, major dislocation, major costs and the real possibility of creating a further backlog of cases. In that context, planning is a small issue. There are sufficient courtrooms in Sligo to allow for other work to proceed when courtroom No. 1 is in use for a jury trial. I want the Minister to consider the significant logistical difficulties in moving to Letterkenny. The distance from Sligo to Letterkenny is 113 km and one-way travel takes one hour and 31 minutes. Many of the gardaí will travel from Ballymote, which takes one hour and 46 minutes. We should also think of the chaos because of the possible backup of trials that cannot be arranged in the event of pleas or trials not proceeding for whatever reason. Jury panels could be brought in, only to be sent home again. Witnesses, gardaí and court staff must be also taken into consideration. In the context of a Bill that is supposed to increase efficiency in how we conduct our business, a proposal to move the jury trials from Sligo to Letterkenny goes in the very opposite direction, when we can facilitate those trials in the courthouse in Sligo. I hope Deputy Pringle will allow me to have another ten seconds.

I am not sure whether they have the right to do that and it is vitally important that the section should be taken out of the Bill, as other Members have suggested. That would make sense because there will be a division on the Bill tonight if that does not happen. That section should be removed and perhaps put in a stand-alone Bill. I am sure there will be other courts Bills and other justice Bills coming forward in the autumn and the section could be inserted in another Bill after it has had proper consideration if it is required by the Minister to deal with this issue. That would make sense. By any stretch of the imagination I do not think one could say this is a Covid-related piece of business that needs to be accelerated. It obviously has been put in to speed up the process and to make it more acceptable for vulture funds and banks that are pursuing people who are in a difficult situation as it stands, and who need to be facilitated and helped to move on. The Minister should take that on board and remove the section from the Bill. The other provisions in the Bill are clearly related to Covid. The Coroners Act does need to be amended and that should be done. Given the delay in coroners cases, we should consider making the change permanent. There may not a sufficient number of coroners at the moment to reduce the backlog of cases to a reasonable level so there may be a justification for appointing extra coroners for a temporary period. I note the points that were made about people having to attend court and the extension of videoconferencing facilities. Has consideration been given to how that could impact on the right of individuals to have discussions with their legal representatives, in particular confidential discussions? When somebody is brought to court that is probably the only time he or she might get to see a legal representative. Has that been considered in the context of the Bill, as it is vitally important? I accept that we must reduce the need for the transportation of prisoners across the country and not have them zigzagging around the place, but one of the important side effects of that is that they get to see their legal representative as well. I appreciate that the legal representative can visit the prison in order to have a consultation, but it is important that we should not restrict in any way a person's access to his or her legal representative, as that is vitally important for individuals in terms of pursuing their case. Those are my three concerns about the Bill. My main concern relates to section 14 and the operation of vulture funds. I urge the Minister to withdraw the section, as other Members have sought. At least then the Bill could go through the House.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	300	In March 2020 the Courts Service introduced measures to scale back the work of the courts because of the Covid-19 lockdown period. In a statement published in July, the Chief Justice, Mr. Frank Clarke, outlined plans to further increase the number of remote hearings offered by the Courts Service. Most appeals before the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal to date have been conducted remotely, save for a small number where a physical hearing was considered necessary. He stated that this situation will continue for the foreseeable future. The President of the High Court indicated that the service must preserve courtrooms for those cases that can be dealt with only by way of physical hearing. The president noted that remote hearings should be Covid-19 proof in the event that a second wave of the virus leads to the introduction of new health and safety restrictions in the country. The changes proposed in the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill take account of the new reality of dealing with the challenges of public administration in the Covid-19 environment and beyond.Our courts, like our hospitals, have seen increased workloads over the years and Covid-19 requires us to introduce legislation to allow continuous access to legal remedies and the provision of law in civil, criminal, commercial and family law matters. Bottlenecks in our courts system were already a problem before the arrival of Covid-19. The need to adhere with public health requirements and deal with the legal implications of a public health emergency requiring mandated social distancing cannot be relaxed when Covid-19 is in our country and the risk of a further spike remains at a high level. Provisions proposed in this Bill will broaden the types of criminal and civil cases which can be heard electronically. The new Bill will allow for evidence to be presented electronically by witnesses, where authorised. In order to accommodate evidence delivered by electronic means, a statement of truth may be requested to be delivered electronically with a digital affidavit or deposition. This statement of truth would in effect supplant the normal requirements of oath to be presented at court. The pending Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018 was resubmitted to this House last night by the Regional Group of Independents. It was agreed that it would be restored to the Dáil Order Paper. Hopefully, when it is passed it will further strengthen the issue of the veracity of electronically submitted evidence. The provisions proposed will also set out how meetings of designated incorporated and State bodies can be held electronically to support requirements for social distancing. The Bill runs to a great number of Parts and sections. There are notable provisions including amendments to the Coroners Act 1962 which seek to allow the Minster to appoint temporary coroners in exceptional circumstances upon the request of a coroner or coroner's district. This would be in exceptional circumstances such as in a pandemic or natural catastrophe that may lead to mass fatalities. The stipulations of such appointments would require that the person have years of suitable experience or already be a coroner for another district. The duration of appointment would be six months pending a review extension requiring the prevailing circumstances to be in continuation. The Minister would have the power to revoke this appointment at any time. We can see the value of that given the spike in Covid deaths in recent months. The new provisions will also allow for the remote hearing of cases in civil proceedings and can decide on the technology being used and on any objections raised to a case being heard remotely. The remote hearings will have the same powers as hearings in person and the same legal immunities and privileges will apply. It would also provide for an offence where a person wilfully obstructs participation of individuals or interferes with the technology platform the court is utilising. Fines and incarceration for up to three years are possible on conviction. Another range of provisions seeks to have business documents compiled during the ordinary course of business presumed to be admissible as evidence in civil cases. I note what other Members have said about section 14 and I would be interested in discussing with them and the Minister whether the section could be omitted from the Bill. Evidence to witness credibility for supplying such information will be admissible. Those who supply such information in civil courts will be deemed to be bound as if they were attending court in person and all normal legal parameters remain as before. To assist such civil proceedings evidence can be given electronically where a declaration can be launched with an accompanying statement of truth to be transmitted with documents. These statements can be signed electronically and would have equal standing to those given in person. Remote hearings have been noted to be suitable for the appellate courts and have been particularly useful in the hearing of preliminary applications and in case management. They are not well suited for certain matters such as where evidence is required to be elicited from witnesses or in matters that require a jury. In criminal court proceedings remote viewing enables a person to participate in the proceedings and see the proceedings before the court. It enables other persons participating in the proceedings who are not in the same location as that person to see and hear their input and evidence. Remote hearing in criminal cases needs to be widened in use and this Bill proposes to extend the types of matters for which video links may be used. These can include permit arrangements, returns for trial, sentencing hearings and certain hearings relating to surrender proceedings. An amendment of the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act 1924 provides that when warrants are outstanding on an individual already incarcerated such warrants can be served without the need to move that person to a different prison to have the warrant served. We can all see the benefits of that where utilisation of manpower and resources are concerned. Regarding the remote hearing of appeal proceedings, section 26 proposes that the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal in criminal proceedings may, of its own motion or on the application of any of the parties, direct that proceedings be heard by remote hearing. Section 26(7) proposes the creation of a new offence of interfering with or obstructing the communications technology used in promoting remote viewing. Ultimately, these proposals will recognise the new realities of operating the Courts Service within the constraints imposed by a pandemic. They offer an additional power to appoint dedicated legal coroners to provide additional resourcing to the State where required. They will help to streamline and create efficiency in our courts system and they will help to move our courts further and faster by embracing new technology and, in so doing, provide a better legal service for citizens and other legal entities. Having said that, I would not like to see these provisions used to fast-track cases concerning vulture funds, as was referenced earlier.

Níl aon dabht agam ach go n-oibreoidh sí go crua agus go dícheallach sna blianta amach romhainn. I start by commending the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and wishing her well in the years ahead. I wish her every success as Minister for Justice and Equality. There are many provisions in the Bill we are discussing which are urgent and necessary in light of the Covid pandemic. I am thinking in particular of the repeal of section 33 of the Prisons Act 2007. That Act provides and requires that a prisoner, when he or she is being arraigned or sentenced, must be physically present in the court. In the context of the Covid pandemic that is an unnecessary requirement but it was not a requirement that could be got around because of the law as it existed. As such, I welcome that this section is being repealed. I also welcome the new provisions being put in place for criminal trials and the decision to do away with the necessity of persons having to be in court in certain scenarios. It is preferable that people be in court but in the context of a pandemic it is important that we preserve and protect the safety of our prisons in particular. They have done very well during the course of the pandemic. There are, however, other provisions in the Bill which are not urgent and merit further discussion, debate and hearings of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, as was the practice on previous occasions. I refer in particular to the provision in respect of the admissibility of business documents, which I will address presently. I will refer first to the provisions in the Bill which are particularly urgent, save those I have already mentioned.  Chapter 2 of Part 3 deals with remote hearings of civil proceedings and I am pleased to say that the courts have already been having remote hearings of cases. That has been happening with the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the High Court. I assume it is also happening with the courts of local and limited jurisdiction. It is important to point out, however, that simply because there was not a statutory provision in place at the time those remote hearings were taking place, that does not mean there is any question mark over them. The High Court is a court of full original jurisdiction. It is entitled to govern its own affairs and to have its own rules on how it will conduct its hearings. Very properly, that court determined that the justice system in this country could not simply stop because of a pandemic and for this reason the hearings of the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court continued during the pandemic. I commend the presidents of the courts and the Chief Justice on ensuring that business continued at a very difficult time for all concerned. The next provision I will refer to is in chapter 3 of Part 3, which deals with business records in documents which are presumed to be admissible in hearings. A number of Deputies have spoken of how this a provision put in place to benefit what are referred to as "vulture funds". It is unquestionably the case that the provenance of this provision derives from a number of judgments of the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the superior courts, which have ruled on a number of occasions that evidence which has been put before them by certain financial institutions is not admissible because it violates the hearsay rule. In particular, that happens where financial institutions come before the courts, having had loans assigned to them, and try to put forward evidence on the basis that this is first-hand evidence.However, it clearly is not because it is information they have learned as a result of the assignment of the loan. It is important to note, however, that the issue of the inadmissibility of certain documents in these proceedings has been dealt with by the courts for a number of years. It was referred to by Mr. Justice O'Donnell in the case of Bank of Scotland PLC v. Beades. It was referred to by Mr. Justice Barniville in the case of Promontoria (Arrow) Limited v. Burke and others. Very recently, it was identified by Ms Justice Baker and Mr. Justice Collins in the case of Promontoria (Aran) Limited v. Burns. It is instructive to note, however that the decision in the Burns case, to which the Minister referred, was only given by the Court of Appeal in April this year. It was a decision given remotely because of the pandemic. At the end of it, Mr. Justice Collins referred to the fact that at some stage, when circumstances permit, it is clearly an issue that deserves the attention of the Legislature. I have to say that even he, I suspect, would be surprised that the Legislature was planning to completely change the law in this area within a period of four months. I do not think we can simply state there is an urgency to this that requires it to be dealt with this evening. It was referred to in the 2017 report of the Law Reform Commission but that was an enormous report that dealt with reforming the laws of evidence in general. Just to pick out selectively one provision in the report and state we have to run with it now does a disservice to the excellent work done by the Law Reform Commission. I would have thought it would have been preferable if this significant change to our law could have been examined, appraised and discussed at a lengthy hearing of the justice committee. It is important to point out to other Deputies that although they keep talking about how this is for the benefit of what is referred to as vulture funds, it is a provision in the law that will have a significant impact and it will apply to a variety of business disputes. The core of the provision is contained in section 13, which states that in civil proceedings any record in document form compiled in the ordinary course of business shall be presumed to be admissible as evidence of the truth of the fact or facts asserted in such a document. This is a significant change to the law. Generally, when a document is produced in a court of law the document is only evidence or proven if an individual comes before the court and states he or she generated that document or that it is a document he or she received. It is never the case that the information contained within the document is regarded as proof of the facts contained within the document. That is a presumption that the section is now inserting into our law. Like all presumptions it is a rebuttable presumption, and subsequent provisions provide for this, but I would have thought the provision would have benefited from it expressly stating it is a rebuttable presumption. I would have thought we need to be careful in how we enact legislation such as this, which could have consequences beyond which all of us intend. I will vote for the Bill as I am a member of the Government but I would have thought a provision such as this, which is not urgent and which clearly is something that has been discussed in the courts and has been the subject of a Law Reform Commission report, would benefit from more consideration, particularly by the justice committee. There are further provisions dealing with this matter in the Bill. This then takes us to Part 4, which deals with the criminal procedure. I have mentioned this briefly already and it is of benefit that we are repealing section 33 of the Prisons Act 2007. We also have miscellaneous provisions, and one in particular that stood out is the issue in respect of statements of truth. It is unfair that for many years people who do not have a religious belief felt they were compelled to swear on a Bible that the evidence they were about to give was truthful. I know it was the case that individuals always had the option of affirming but at present the affirmation process is more complicated than people believe it to be. We need to recognise that we need to accommodate individuals who do not share the beliefs many of us do but who want to be able to be part of the justice process. In respect of the provisions referred to in Chapter 3 of Part 3, the explanatory memorandum refers to the fact this admissibility of business documents is something that will apply in criminal proceedings also. The Bill does not apply for this. It is only in respect of civil proceedings. However, it is the case that in our criminal law, as the courts have recognised, we have relaxed the rules in respect of the admissibility of certain documentation to enable those documents to be admitted as evidence and not to fall foul of the hearsay rule. It is also important to note, and we can be comforted by this, that no matter what is in legislation that we enact here, when these issues get to be dealt with in a court we will have an independent judge who will appraise the evidence. Just because a document is admissible in evidence does not mean it will be accepted by the court as being proof of what is contained within it or that the court will accept the veracity of the person putting forward that document. Courts will always continue to assess cases in the civil field on the basis of the evidence that is given and no statutory provision that we create this evening will undermine that.

I welcome the debate this evening but I must say I am absolutely taken aback that the Government has abused the goodwill of Members of the Opposition who, given the pandemic, the serious risk to health and the impact on our economy and court systems and throughout society, have waived normal political and parliamentary scrutiny on legislation and allowed for legislation to be dealt with in one sitting of the House. We have allowed for a truncated period for amendments to be submitted. Legislation that would usually take months to pass in the Houses is now taking hours, with the support and facilitation of Members of the Opposition, including Sinn Féin. We have done this because we recognise the consequences the pandemic is having, sometimes despite the fact we do not support the legislation that is before the House. What we never expected was that the Government would use this support and use the pandemic to sneak into legislation amendments that have nothing to do with the pandemic, nothing to do with Covid-19 and nothing to do with the circumstances in which people find themselves and not emergency legislation. We had that in one instance last week, where in a three-section Bill, one section was to give a €17,000 wage increase to a Minister of State, and in this legislation, which is supposed to be emergency legislation, there is a whole chapter that facilitates vulture funds. We could not make this up. This is about supporting vulture funds. I sat on the finance committee for the previous two Dáil terms. Every member of the committee was looking to get vulture funds before it so we could question them about their practices of repossessing homes and how they are dealing with debtors in this State but not one of them would present before the finance committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Perhaps the question is why would they, when they have a Government that is willing not only to pass legislation for them but to pass emergency legislation that will do only one thing, which is, in Chapters 12, 13 and 14 of the Bill, to allow them to rely on hearsay and inadmissible evidence. These vulture funds will now be able to rely on these provisions to secure debts to evict people from their homes. It is simply not acceptable. At this late stage and at this late hour, I appeal to the Minister to do the right thing and not to facilitate the vulture funds. If she believes that is what needs to be done, at least let us go through the proper scrutiny process. Why has this come about? It is because the vulture fund in this case, Promontoria, which is well renowned in this State for its practices, lost a case. It lost a case that was appealed to the Court of Appeal just a number of months ago, in April. Lo and behold, the Government believed it was a priority, just a number of months later, to write into this Bill a number of sections that resolve the issue in favour of Promontoria, basically nullifying the decision made in Mr. Justice Collins's determination at the Court of Appeal.With all the pressing priorities in the State, this was the issue that was brought forward by the Minister for Justice and Equality to the Cabinet. Somehow, with everything else that is happening, she felt that this case, which ruled against the vulture fund and in favour of the debtor in April and which protects many people not just in the case of Promontoria but in other cases, was so important that the Government should get it through in a way whereby there is no pre-legislative scrutiny, no proper Second Stage debate which would normally take days to conclude, no proper Committee Stage but one that is guillotined and no proper Report Stage, which should take place two weeks later. It decided to do something unique and to use the cover of the pandemic to support the vulture funds. It does not matter that the vulture funds will not come in and talk to the elected representatives of the people of this State. Why would they? This Government has rolled out the red carpet to them, not only to say, "What do you want?" but to say, "We will not only give you what you want, but we will use emergency legislation to bring it in". This is wrong on a number of levels. I appeal to the Minister to do the right thing and not use the pandemic to introduce legislation that only favours vulture funds. It will send shivers down the spines of the debtors who are now in the grips of these vulture funds, be it Promontoria or the many others. I appeal to Members across the political divide here not to support sections 12, 13 and 14 of the Bill.

Legislation is an incredibly important element of what we do here and of the lives of the people outside the House. People live and die by legislation that is created in this House. We are discussing legislation here that has very far-reaching effects in Irish society. Obviously, vulture funds are a negative element of Irish society. As the previous speaker said, they have had phenomenal access to the Department of Finance over the last number of years, yet they have had very little scrutiny from the elected representatives in the committee on finance. Indeed, they refused every opportunity to be questioned by the committee on finance in the past. They simply pick on the financial carcases of families, individuals, farms and businesses. The Government's attitude to vulture funds over the last decade has been wrong. I have stood in the House before previous Ministers for Finance and asked them to ensure that assets, houses, farms and buildings can be sold back to families at the same price the vulture funds receive them, but Minister after Minister has refused to do that. It always seems that the vulture funds have the ear of the Government and have opportunities provided by the Government, whereas the people who are in battle with those vulture funds for properties, houses, farms and businesses, which they have poured their lives into and which they have bled and sweated to keep, always get negative responses from the Government. Now we have the Government crowbarring a section into a legislative measure under the cover of Covid-19 that radically reduces the grounds on which people stand legally in their battles against vulture funds. I ask the Minister to consider removing it and to place it where it should be. It should be given scrutiny. The idea that a Bill of this import should be dealt with in its entirety in a matter of hours on the last day the Dáil sits before the recess is nonsense. The reason there are processes in Leinster House for pre-legislative scrutiny and for ensuring that all affected groups have the ear of the Minister and are consulted and that legislation goes through five Stages, with the back and forth on Committee and Report Stages on amendments, is to ensure the legislation is right. We know that when we do not do that, we simply do not get it right. We create massive mistakes, and people will live and die by those mistakes. I ask the Minister to make sure that she has the will of the Dáil in this case. The Dáil has assented to helping the Government to get through legislation in short periods of time because of the Covid pandemic. I also wish to discuss another element of the Bill. Aontú is an Irish republican party. Our views date back to the ideas of Wolfe Tone. We believe in pluralism. We believe in an Ireland of Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter, as well as those of every other religion and none, being able to live together in harmony with one another. That pluralism is not one that seeks to make people's characteristics invisible in the public domain. We believe that people in their religious or cultural attributes should be able to flourish in the public space. This country has a history of extreme uniformity. In 1950s Ireland there was one way and one way only. If one did not accept that way, one was cast aside. We have reached a level of pluralism in recent times. People can express religious beliefs if they wish and do not have to express any religious belief if they do not wish to do so. Both the secular and the religious can live equally side by side. It would be a big mistake if the Government rowed back and attacked the pluralism we have today by returning to a situation where there is uniformity again and everybody must adhere to that new uniformity. When it comes to oaths and so forth, the Government should simply give people a choice on how to express their commitment to tell the truth in courts in the future. It is very disappointing that we would have a new uniformity or orthodoxy and that the achievements we have attained towards pluralism in recent times would be scrubbed out.

Given her age and energy, I have no doubt that she will be able to bring a new dynamic to the Department and, perhaps, bring about the reform that is urgently required. I ask her to examine the various inquiries that have been established but which still have not been concluded. Indeed, some have not agreed their terms of reference, such as the one relating to Lucia O'Farrell and the death or, more accurately, the murder of her son Shane. I ask the Minister to look at these and perhaps bring forward a report that would enable a further debate to take place in the Dáil on all those issues. We are in a similar position now to the one we were in last week. We have been presented with legislation that, in the main, is good. The Bill is a reaction to Covid-19 and provides for the necessary changes that are required to make courts more efficient in a pandemic. Perhaps the new changes might continue in place beyond Covid-19. I welcome them. However, in section 3 of the Bill last week providing for the establishment of the new Department for higher education, universities and third level there was a proposal to increase the take-home pay of Ministers of State by €17,500. I voted for that Bill. I voted for it because it dealt with education, had implications for the south east and furthered the interests of the technological universities we so badly need, particularly in the regions. However, I did not want to vote for the salary increase for the Ministers of State who will attend at the Cabinet. Like a three-card trick, that legislative measure went through the House. If we are serious about legislation, it should be scrutinised and go through the committee and so forth.This legislation in the main should be passed but, again, we are faced with either a three-card trick, incompetence within the Department and the Government or an attempt to hoodwink the House by slipping in sections 13 and 14. I object to that and, like Deputy Howlin, I ask the Minister to consider removing this part of the Bill and subjecting it to the appropriate scrutiny it demands and requires, keeping in mind that it was never discussed at parliamentary party level. The briefing document which was made available to us has about six lines on this section, with no reference made to the business records in detail. The briefing makes it look as if it is inoffensive legislation that will make no great difference, that it just formalises matters. The danger of passing legislation such as this is that it has consequences. Last week had consequences. It showed the Government as chaotic in its response to the various issues of payments and salaries. The law of evidence says hearsay is not admissible. The banks got a statutory pass in the Bankers' Books Evidence Act 1879, a privilege because they were reliable bookkeepers. This Bill, however, will allow all businesses to prove their records with hearsay documents. It is a recipe for dishonesty, a new rule on hearsay and a U-turn in the law of evidence. That is my view on this. Looking back at that Act of 1879 and what transpired in 2009, one would hardly trust the banks or the vulture funds. One would not trust them at all if one were to look at recent court cases brought in the main by lay litigants in which the original documents could not be produced and banks were proven to have had documents that were flawed and incomplete and did not reflect the loan arrangements that were entered into in good faith by the people who wanted to extend their businesses, buy businesses, go into different business or take some of the mad decisions that were made in the course of the Celtic tiger. These banks, because they do not have the appropriate documentation, the correct documentation, are using unregulated receivers to trample on the rights of people who are trying to retain perhaps a family home, a family business or a property. This affects farmers, publicans and every other individual who is in business or in trouble. The courts are being arranged to ensure that lay litigants will not have the same standing they had before. The presentation of these flawed documents relies on an Act of 1879 on the books that were held by the banks. Perhaps they were respected back then but they are certainly not respected now, neither for their accuracy nor for some of their actions. We have had a banking inquiry in this country and we should seriously question the privilege the banks had back in 1879 against what a modern bank or vulture fund is. It is not right to say that this is being constructed only for vulture funds. While it is being put in legislation for businesses generally, but if a banking official or a vulture fund represented by one of the major companies comes before a court and tells the judge, "You can rely on us, Judge, because what we are saying is true", that is hearsay. How stands, then, the lay litigant trying to defend himself or herself? How stands the other side at all? Anyone who goes to these courts will see a range of senior counsel, solicitors and so on of the best type on the side of the banks and vulture funds. On the other side will be a family in distress, people in tears fighting for their lives, homes, farms or whatever it might be. For this reason, I support all the other speakers who have asked the Minister to withdraw these sections. I notified our Whip at 8 o'clock this morning that there was something wrong with the Bill, and the explanation given on what the Bill contained and its implications was inadequate. Owing to this uncertainty, and because this House needs to stand over the legislation it passes, I ask the Minister to withdraw these sections. I have seen court cases take place where the documents have not been signed or where they have been reconstructed in the case of banks. When they sell those documents on to a second buyer, it is up to that second buyer, such as Promontoria, to sort them out through receivers or the courts. That is what this is about. We are rushing into this and doing the legislation incorrectly. We are poorly informed as to what is in this legislation. We have not been given a chance. I wonder what role the Ceann Comhairle plays in protecting Members and trying to get proper scrutiny of legislation going through this House. It is the Government's job to ensure we keep our people safe and have legislation that does not just benefit one well-off section but is there to benefit a judge as he or she makes decisions based on our legislation and on a level playing field. I support Deputy Doherty in what he said about the vulture funds and their attendance at meetings. I chaired the finance committee for five years. They not only refused to come in but gave us the two fingers, and they continue to treat people badly. We asked that there would be no evictions in the course of the pandemic. That has not happened. If we are to keep our people safe, and if the Government is to be responsible and take responsible actions, the one single action it needs to take is to withdraw these sections and give us a chance to look at the Bill in far more detail than we are asked to do today. It is simply not right and it is unfair to people who find themselves before the courts with the cards stacked against them once again.

I wish the Minister the best of luck in her new position. If she is to leave a mark with the new Government, she has an opportunity to do so this evening. I ask her to listen to the previous speaker, Deputy McGuinness, and to read the amendments that have been tabled, whoever is able to get to whoever from the banking sector in the Department. This is phenomenal. There is no legislation brought in that can facilitate people who want to go through the Insolvency Service of Ireland. That is not being facilitated in any legislation being pushed through here. However, it will now be ensured in the courts, as has been pointed out, that this bit of paperwork will save the vulture funds from coming in in person, whether the case involves a business, an ordinary person with his or her house or a farmer with land, whereas a middleman, such as Link Asset Services or all these others acting for the big vulture funds, can walk in, and that will do. The piece of paper will cover everything. In fairness to all Members here, they do not have problems with the rest of the legislation. My God, though, as public representatives who deal with this in every county across the country, we have to stand up and be counted. I know the Minister did not write the legislation.Some senior civil servant has written this. Someone has got to them from the banking side of things and they must have serious power to be able to do that. Ministers are for making the hard decisions and this is a decision the Minister can make this evening. Nobody asks the Minister to abandon it. We are asking her to park it to one side until it goes through the different procedures, as has been pointed out by the Deputies this evening. That is all I am asking. I do not want to criticise the rest of the Bill and I will not do so, excepting that section. What has happened in this country over the past five, six, seven or eight years is that some of those vulture funds, which every one of us has encountered in representing people, have mowed through the system and this is an opportunity for us. It is not a lot to ask somebody to walk into a court and confirm that it was they themselves who gave the money in question but to rely on a piece of paper means it is there for flouting every day of the week. I ask the Minister to pull that section.

There is much in this legislation that is useful and necessary, of that there is no doubt. I accept what my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, has said on remote hearings and so on for the courts, under their own rules of proceeding, to do this sort of thing and I welcome that. It is quite useful and I welcome the fact it is being put on a statutory basis. Some provisions in the legislation are welcome because they are urgently needed due to the Covid crisis but sections 13 and 14 are not urgently needed. The legislation is presented as a package that is urgently needed but there is a section which is not urgently needed and which, in my view, requires more considered debate. I listened to what the Minister said about the LRC and the judgments of the Court of Appeal. I have looked at those judgments and read the relevant section of the LRC report. Neither the LRC nor the Court of Appeal judges indicated that this legislation is either necessary in its present form or urgent. They did indicate that some changes were necessary but they did not indicate a change of this magnitude was necessary. The section states: "Any record in document form compiled in the ordinary course of business shall be presumed to be admissible as evidence of the truth of the fact or facts asserted in such a document". That is a fundamental change in the law. Who does it benefit? We have heard suggestions that it benefits vulture funds. It certainly does but it also benefits anybody who is preparing business documents in the ordinary course of their business. It is indisputably on the side of the heavy hitters. I agree with Deputy Jim O'Callaghan that the courts must take their own view in light of all the evidence presented but there is no doubt whatsoever that this tilts the balance significantly in favour of the person who is presenting this hearsay evidence in documentary form. The more I read the section, the more I am convinced that it is rushed legislation. For example, what does section 14(1)(c) mean? It states: "in the case of information in non-legible form that has been reproduced in permanent legible form, was reproduced in the course of the normal operation of the reproduction system concerned." There is obviously something missing there. I think that needs some redrafting. Section 14(2) provides that: "Subsection (1) shall apply whether the information was supplied directly or indirectly but, if it was supplied indirectly, only if each person (whether or not he or she is identifiable) through whom it was supplied received it in the ordinary course of a business." How can one say they received it in the ordinary course of business if they are not even identifiable? This has all the hallmarks of rushed legislation. I do not know what the objective is. I do not know why it was parcelled in here among very necessary legislation. I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this part of the legislation because it requires greater study and scrutiny. It will have wide-ranging effects and fundamentally tilt the balance in favour of businesses before the courts as opposed to what Deputy McGuinness referred to as lay litigants. I agree with Deputy McGuinness that there are echoes of what happened recently. I was in very much favour of the Ministers and Secretaries and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Bill 2020. I voted for it but I did not want to vote for the section that increased the pay of a super junior Minister by €16,000 at a time the country is facing a crisis as a result of the pandemic. I did not want to do that but, if I was voting for the Bill, I had no choice. If I had been a member of the Government or if I had been advising the Government, I would have advised them strongly to leave that section out. I am advising the Minister tonight to leave that section out. If it is included, I will vote for the Bill but with the greatest reluctance. I do not want to be put in this position on a permanent basis and I will not accept that. There is no reason this section should be included in this legislation at this time. I respectfully ask the Minister to withdraw it so it can get proper scrutiny. It needs such scrutiny because it will have the most widespread implications from this day forward.

I plead with her to listen to Deputies who have expressed their concerns about sections 13 and 14, what is becoming known as the vulture fund section of this Bill. People have been fighting these vulture funds in the courts. They thought they had won some sort of security but this will rip that from them. I spoke to somebody today who had a horrific experience with the vulture funds and fought them tooth and nail. They lied and lied again and we are handing those funds a golden ticket to take people's homes, lands and businesses. We have a chance tonight to listen to those people and to listen to the Deputies who spoke tonight and to take that section of the Bill out and ensure that people are protected. I refer to section 5(29), which relates to remote meetings that will allow Ministers to designate certain State bodies to hold meetings. I was contacted today by a couple of councillors and their concerns related to remote meetings of local authorities and, most importantly, making decisions remotely. They are concerned about how that will affect them. I was a local councillor myself. Some instances they gave included the local property tax, the county development plan, budgets and other serious matters they make decisions on. They were concerned that if a decision was tight, their Internet connection went down and a vote happened, what then would happen their vote? What recourse would they have? They are really concerned about some of those issues. I am asking for clarification. Is it the case that local authorities are included in that section? If so, could we insert a sunset clause, perhaps for six months or whatever? That would mean we could come back and look at this and see how it is implemented because there are concerns that there will be chief executives of local authorities who would love this legislation to come through, if that is the case.

I appreciate the concerns they raised regarding how quickly the Bill has been introduced and that it required the House to waive the process of pre-legislative scrutiny. I thank colleagues for their forbearance and co-operation in this regard. We have an obligation to keep our judges, jurors, witnesses, our prison population and all of those working in the Courts Service and the Prison Service safe. I refer to the Covid pandemic and the very difficult times we are going through. This Bill is, for the most part, specifically focused on that issue, although there are, as the final speaker identified, a few unrelated provisions. The measures in the Bill dealing with criminal and civil procedures relate to extending the use of modern technology, which is part of a wider agenda and plan to modernise the way in which our courts and prisons systems operate, and enabling the Judiciary and Courts Service to manage their business better and in a more efficient way. This is extremely important and necessary at this time as we deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. In the criminal law context, the Bill addresses some historical inefficiencies and practices in regard to the execution of warrants for persons who are already in prison and the huge burden that places on prisons. The measures contained in the Bill deal with issues identified by the Judiciary itself and they have been developed in close consultation with the Judiciary, the Courts Service, the legal profession and the Attorney General. All of the measures relate to necessary improvements to current practices and reflect changes that have been sought for years. These are not measures that were identified only in the past number of weeks or months. They certainly were not developed by vulture funds, banks - I will speak on this in more detail presently - or anybody other than the Judiciary, legal teams, and the Attorney General. They are the people who asked for these measures to be introduced to help them deal with Covid, but the provisions will have far-reaching positive implications as well. I will outline specifically who has sought some of the particular measures contained in the Bill. The provisions concerning remote hearing of civil proceedings were developed following detailed discussions with the Judiciary and the Courts Service. In the case of e-filing and statements of truth, the need for those provisions was highlighted as part of the external Courts Service organisational capacity review, which was carried out in the context of the Civil Service renewal plan completed in 2018. In regard to the admissibility of business records, the provisions are based on the LRC's recommendations in 2016. They were not included because of a particular case that happened recently and they mirror provisions already contained in the Criminal Evidence Act. The measures proposed in regard to video links were recommended for some time, including by the working group on efficiency measures in the criminal justice system, which identified the increased use of video links as an important tool in reducing the need to transport prisoners between prisons and the courts. We have already seen an increased use of video links in allowing prisoners to communicate with their families during the Covid lockdown period. That practice was part of the reason there were no cases of Covid-19 in our prisons over the past few months, which is an absolute credit to our Prison Service but also to the prisoners themselves, who have engaged and co-operated with management in implementing those arrangements. The use of technology was vital in this regard, and the importance of technology is recognised in the Bill. The civil justice medium-term planning group, which included members of the Judiciary and senior officials from the Courts Service and my Department, identified the need to address the lack of capacity for flexibility in the operation of the District Court. These are all extremely important measures and they have all been sought by our senior Judiciary. They are not proposals that have come about only in recent weeks and months. I believe they will address not just the immediate concerns around the Covid-19 pandemic but will also help us in developing an effective plan of modernisation, a piece of work that is currently under way within the Courts Service. I will now address more specifically some of the issues and concerns that were raised by Deputies. Deputy Martin Kenny argued for the inclusion of a sunset clause in the Bill, as proposed in one of the amendments that has been tabled. I accept his point that in the vast majority of cases where legislation has been introduced to deal with Covid-19, such a clause has been included. In the case of the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme, provision has been made to extend those measures far beyond 7 November. In the case of this legislation, there is a requirement under Standing Order 164 that I, as Minister, report back to the House within 12 months of its enactment. That requirement gives us a timeline and ensures there is a safeguard in place. I go back to the point that much of what is contained in the Bill has been sought for some time. If we were obliged to review every Bill that is enacted in this House every three months, we would be doing little else for years to come. Particularly where measures have been well thought out and sought for some time, it would be very difficult and would hinder the overall legislative programme to have such a requirement in place. I thank Deputies for their very positive remarks concerning the coroner service. Deputies Howlin and Harkin had a specific question about the backlog in the service. I do not think we have ever seen anything like what we saw in Dublin, where there was a two-year backlog. That was not acceptable-----

The relevant provisions in the Bill are targeted measures to address an emergency. The overall structure of the service needs a different and more fundamental reform that will ensure additional capacity. It is something I intend to deal with separately from this legislation. There was a question about the provision in section 23 in regard to pretrial and post-trial hearings. I would like to confirm that this is merely to ensure that we can speed up a process. There are very significant safeguards within the legislation that will ensure nobody's time is taken up-----

As was acknowledged by the Minister, all the other legislation enacted regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the emergency actions that needed to be taken, which were all appropriate, had a time limit set down for when they will come to a conclusion. We believe this should also be the case with this legislation. One thing struck me when the Minister was making her Second Stage contribution was that we had accepted there would not be pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill because we understood it was going to be pandemic-related. That was why we and all the other Opposition Members regarded it as fair enough that we would not have pre-legislative scrutiny, because there was a precedent in respect of other pandemic-related legislation.  Then, however, it was acknowledged in the first or second paragraph that the Bill goes beyond the pandemic. If we had been told that at the outset, we would not be in this position now. We would have said, "No", and that there must be proper pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill. That we are in this position now means that we need to ensure we at least have a time limit for this legislation. The time limit we have suggested is in keeping with the ending and renewal, most likely, of the health sections of legislation regarding Covid-19.  Our amendment states: "In page 6, line 2, after “provisions” to insert the following: “and continue in operation until the 9th day of November 2020, unless a resolution approving of its continuation has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas". The reality is that we expect that would happen if the pandemic is then still the crisis that it is now and it is looking most likely that it is heading in that direction.  In that context, I commend this amendment to the Minister and to the House to ensure there is a time limit on this legislation, just as there has been on all the other legislation concerning the pandemic. She may argue that this legislation is as it is because it extends beyond the pandemic. There is an issue with that, because we do not believe that this Bill should go beyond the pandemic. We believe that any Bill with provisions that extend beyond the pandemic should get proper pre-legislative scrutiny. That has been denied to this Bill and we believe that is to ensure that the vulture funds will benefit from it the most, as well as other large businesses that may go into disputes in court. That is totally unfair and reprehensible regarding how we do our business in this House. We should not be here in this position on the last day the Dáil is sitting before the summer recess.

The last day of a session is always one in which things can be pushed through. I do not think any of us expected to be sitting here very late tonight dealing with a very contentious section in this legislation and the very least that could be expected is that there would be a sunset clause in it. The Government has a majority and the question it must ask is: does it trust itself? Including this amendment in the legislation would at least mean there will be time for reflection and a review within a time limit that will allow us to deal with some of these aspects in an urgent manner. This is a very reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister will accept it. There are positive provisions in the legislation, but there are also provisions that we are rightly concerned about. As someone said earlier, it is highly unusual that every Deputy who spoke drew attention to the same issue with which they have concerns. How can that fall on deaf ears? I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.

I hope we will be in more proximate circumstances after the recess. The amendment suggests the insertion of a sunset clause to this Bill. As I indicated in my contribution on Second Stage, I believe there is a lot in this Bill that should be made permanent, particularly the long-awaited amendments to the Coroners Acts. The two-year waiting period for coroner's inquiries in Dublin is entirely unacceptable. Many of the administrative changes that are proposed in this Bill should be made permanent. Deputy coroners should be able to act. It should be possible to appoint more than one coroner per district outside Dublin to be able to respond to a build-up of cases beyond simply dealing with the pandemic. Having said that, there are aspects of this Bill that as the Minister is aware, do not fit in as requirements to address the pandemic and the emergency provisions that we are facilitating here. I cannot recall too many debates in this House where every speaker from each group has urged caution on the Minister, as has happened here. All contributors have asked that the sections that relate to the presentation of business evidence in civil cases be withdrawn from the Bill so that there can be proper legislative scrutiny applied to it in the cold light of day through the taking of expert testimony. The Minister wishes to persevere and, in three hours, enact legislation that would normally take weeks or months to enact. In light of that, it is a reasonable request that a sunset clause be inserted for the entirety of the Bill in order that we have the chance to put on a permanent basis those things that we will have a consensus to put on a permanent basis and to properly scrutinise, parse and analyse the potential impact across the civil legal process of the profound changes contained in this Bill, which is to go through this House in a period of three hours.

She admitted that she was not going to listen to anyone here and was going to force through all sections of the Bill. I support this amendment because the insertion of a sunset clause is vital especially when it is dubious how the sections that deal with hearsay evidence appeared in this Bill. The Minister is saying that these suggestions came from the Judiciary and officials in the Department of Justice and Equality but I do not believe that. Vulture funds have been in this country for more than ten years. They were welcomed by the former Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, in the time after the economic crash. They have been getting preferential treatment. I have been in the courts on countless days and justice unheard is justice denied. One cannot hear what is going on with barristers and judges who are whispering. Unfortunate defendants are shaking their feet and being told to stand up and speak up. What has gone on in the courts should be a cause of shame. This legislation is giving the vulture funds licence to do what they like and carry on. It has been happening throughout the pandemic and to include these sections in this Bill is shocking. I have heard Fianna Fáil backbenchers speaking against these provisions. The Government is all over the shop. If this Dáil session lasted another week or two, the Government would collapse before we went on our holidays. This is scandalous legislation. It is subterfuge, trickery and blackguarding at its best to get the way of the vulture funds. Those funds and the banks have the Government in hock to them. Is it a kind of homage the Government pays to them or to its European masters or whatever? It is despicable legislation and has no sunset clause. There is a sunset clause in every other legislative measure we have passed in response to Covid-19. Each Bill has a definite end point, although we can extend it. There is no such clause for this Bill because the Government wants to save the banks, bankers and vulture funds. There is no other reason for it. They have stuck these sections into the Bill to have it passed in the final few hours of the final Dáil session before we go on summer holidays. It is nothing but an outrage and the members of the Government should hang their heads in shame.

I support this amendment in order to defend any developer or landowner whose lands or factory building might be taken from him or her. There may be jobs at stake in such circumstances. It is wrong to give the vulture funds a whip hand in a court scenario and while I support the aspects of the Bill that deal with the pandemic, I am not supporting the rest of it because all those other things should receive legislative scrutiny. We all know that too many cooks spoil the broth. This legislation has been rushed together by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party. It will not be the three parties that are blamed in the fullness of time when this becomes known as wrong legislation, it will be the Minister. An hour or so ago, I wished the Minister well in her new post. I am appealing to her to see the light of day here and assure me that the Government will insert a sunset clause and expiry date into this Bill. If that is not done, this legislation is a recipe for disaster. The way this Bill is being rushed through is unfair. The Minister is new in her job but she will-----

I wish to voice my concerns over the legislation that is being rushed through here. Speaker after speaker has raised concerns over what the Minister and the Government are trying to do. To be honest, I think that the Government is extremely lucky that the Dáil is rising tonight for its summer recess. All the Government is doing is going from one crisis to another. As far as I am concerned, the Government is like a motor car going down a hill with four bald tyres, no steering wheel, no petrol in the tank and no brakes.

#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	336	I have not finished. I am appealing to the Minister to allow this sunset clause and amendment to go through. It is the right, honourable and decent thing to do.
#PaDaly	unknown-#PaDaly-party	unknown-#PaDaly-dob	unknown-#PaDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	337	I am also speaking in favour of the amendment. The Covid-19 crisis has been used as an excuse to do many good things such as the efficiencies that will be brought to the Coroners Acts. However, bringing in legislation such as the Bill about which we are speaking at the last minute to facilitate vulture funds cannot be right. I also think there is a serious problem with closing the courts in Sligo and Tralee and consolidating them in Limerick. It is not desirable to take members of An Garda Síochána out of the counties they are in and take them to a centralised location. The provision in this Bill to allow sentencing up to life imprisonment to take place in a prison, where an accused is not beside his or her legal team, is deeply flawed. I am supporting the amendment to prevent that becoming a permanent provision because it is totally unfair that someone could receive a life sentence outside a courtroom overseen by a judge.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	338	I will speak to this point and address another one. I ran out of time; I was not avoiding answering questions. The measures in the Bill are Covid-specific, but also address a lot of built-in efficiencies in a system that needs to be reformed. That is why there is no sunset clause in the Bill. The vast majority of what is in the Bill has been thought through. It has not appeared in the past few weeks or months. Sections 12 to 19, inclusive, which Deputies have referenced, were not developed by vulture funds or lobbyists. The Bill does not deal with that. They are being included because they, along with other issues, have been identified as being necessary to reduce delays in the majority of cases. There is no challenge to the majority of documents. It is important to say that a document being included or admissible in evidence does not mean that a court will presume that the records are correct. That is very evident in the Promontoria case, where it was a judge who identified this. Under the proposed amendments, business records can still be challenged in the normal way. There are a number of safeguards that will ensure all parties would be aware of, and have an opportunity to object to, the documents being presented via this channel. I have to again point to the fact that the vast majority of these documents are not contested and there is no issue with them. Where there is, and where somebody wants to raise concerns, they have an opportunity to do so. In addition, as I have mentioned, they can be challenged by the courts, which will have a specific power under the proposed section 16(1) to exclude business record evidence in the interests of justice on its own motion, such as, for example, in a case where no formal application has been made to exclude a business record because the litigant is not there or is not legally represented. The commission's report, which I referenced, recommended that records compiled in the course of business, because they are generally reliable, should be admissible in civil proceedings as an inclusionary exception to the hearsay, subject to the safeguards set out in the Bill. Under section 15, the party who seeks to rely on business record evidence must give advance notice or provide an advance copy to other parties. Under section 15(2), the other party is required to provide advance notice of his or her intention to object. There is no procedural restriction on the right to adduce countervailing evidence in terms of the evidential weight to be afforded to the business record section in the relevant part and that regard shall be had to all of the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to its accuracy or otherwise.  This is not something that has been brought in in the dead of night or which will benefit vulture funds. It is part of a wider package of measures that we want to introduce to ensure that our court system can start to function as close to 100% as possible. We know that will not be the case, but the Bill will introduce efficiencies that will benefit people. The measures will not in any way support vulture funds or hinder anybody in ensuring that justice is served.  I will not accept the amendment because under Standing Order 164 I have an opportunity, as Minister, to report to the Dáil after 12 months. I will monitor the situation carefully and I fully take on board the points Deputies have made. If what they are suggesting does happen, then I will respond. I do not believe that will be the case. If what they have said will happen does happen, I assure the House I will address that.  There are safeguards in the Bill to ensure that will not be the case and everybody has an opportunity to challenge documents brought before the courts. Given that there is a sunset clause in the amendment, I cannot accept it. These measures are not necessary for the longer-term development and modernisation of our court system, but are absolutely vital to ensure that our systems can function at as close to full capacity as possible while addressing the very significant challenges we face during Covid-19.

There is a major contradiction in this Bill. Everything we are doing is supposed to be about the pandemic, yet the Minister is introducing measures which have nothing whatsoever to do with the pandemic, and she said as much in her speech. It is worth pointing out what the Bill will do. Sections 12 and 13 will allow assignees to loans, commonly known as vulture funds, to rely on what would otherwise be inadmissible hearsay evidence when seeking summary judgments of money or property. Summary judgments happen in situations where a normal process is not in place and witnesses are not present and are not called. That is the problem. People can lose their properties and livelihoods, and can have significant financial judgments made against them when a particular type of documentary evidence can be used, which would normally be considered hearsay and inadmissible. That is a difficulty in the Bill, and we need to deal with that difficulty.

The Tánaiste said today that they were reintroducing democracy. The first proposal to reintroduce democracy is to deny a debate on something that is about the nature of our democracy. This is not about stopping speaking time; this is about how the speaking time is organised. That is what it is about.

It does not deny anyone speaking rights, but it is just about the sequence and where it comes in and where it goes out. Deputy Griffin accused some people here of spreading lies. I ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to make him withdraw the word "lie". We have the heavy boot boys back again in Fine Gael. We had them between 1973 and 1977. Are they back again? Is Deputy Griffin from Kerry the new heavy gang? Is he the new bully who is going to bully us? They might silence us here but they will not silence the people out there who are outraged at what is going on in this House and at the shambolic Bill that was passed here this evening. It is an outrage. It is a reasonable proposal. It is not taking time from anybody; it only relates to the sequences of time and that should be respected.

To be clear on what is being proposed here, the Government is trying to push through without debate a major organisational change in the way in which this Dáil organises its business, namely, to change the order of speaking time in Dáil debates. The aim of it is to ensure that smaller left parties and groups and Independent groups have less prominence in those debates. Why do they want to do this? Just look at what has happened in this House over the course of the past three to four weeks. If it was not for the role-----

It will be watched over and over again and will be seen for the shambolic process it is, whereby a majority Government is trying to silence the Opposition. The Opposition has bent over backwards at the Dáil reform committee and Business Committee meetings to make compromises and propose amendments and compromise motions, and at every hand's turn they were rejected. That is why this will appear to the people of Ireland to be the worst outcome of the general election of 2020. They have the Blueshirts and Fianna Fáil in a dictatorship.

We are merely seeking to ensure that that convention be continued. It is very disappointing to see the new Government, in one of its earliest moves regarding the business of the House, seek to dispense with that convention. This is not about denying Government backbenchers time to speak. They can have all the time they want to speak on legislation and statements. All we are asking is that we retain the order in which all parties have an opportunity to come in on the first round. It is a reasonable request that we stick with that convention, and there is no basis for the Government to deny that. It is fundamentally undemocratic to do so. What the Government is proposing is that the Social Democrats and the Labour Party, for example, which have exactly the same number of seats each, should be split in terms of that entitlement. Under the Government's proposals, the Labour Party can continue in its position in this regard but, for some unknown reason, the Social Democrats must drop down further in the queue. There is no logic to that. There is no defence for it. We have the same number of seats as the Labour Party and we should be treated equally. All we are requesting is that we continue with what was a very successful and harmonious system from the previous Dáil. That is all.

We spent nearly three hours in the Business Committee coming up with composite proposals, which all came from this side of the House. They were very reasonable proposals. I ask the Government at this very late stage to withdraw this proposal. Not only will it create the rancour we are seeing tonight, but this will happen every single day because of what the Government is doing tonight. We have a Business Committee that has worked very well for four years. It has worked on the basis of consensus. We have had good politics because of it. We can continue with that. There is no reason for this proposal. There are very sensible, very reasonable proposals coming from this side of the House. Proportionality would be maintained and the scheduling would be according to the regular convention we have always had. This is absolutely outrageous. The Business Committee may as well not exist, Dáil reform may as well not exist, and we will go back 20 years because of this.

If this country has suffered in the past, it is because of lack of accountability. The Government has all the cards in its hands. It has its offices and the human resources to be able to push through so much of its political agenda. One of the major elements of accountability is the ability of Opposition parties, especially smaller ones operating on fresh air in most cases, to hold the Government to account. Pushing our voices into the graveyard shift simply reduces our ability to hold the Government to account. This is simply about accountability, and it is absolutely ridiculous that the Government is looking to push our voices later and later in debates.

I want the people at home tonight and the people who will listen to this on the radio tomorrow morning to know that what we have here is a new set of procedures, which will still give the Opposition parties 74% of the speaking time, even though they have less than half the seats. If there is anyone who should be complaining, it is the Government parties. We have more than half of the votes, we have more than half of the seats and we are only getting about 25% of the speaking time. They are getting a disproportionate share of the speaking time. We are the ones who should be grandstanding, not them. In terms of the order in which people speak, surely it makes sense that the largest parties that got hundreds of thousands of votes, should come in before those that got one, two or three percent. Surely that is fairness and democracy and that is all we are trying to restore here.

He has 11 of that party now - one gone and more to go. That is the way it is now, sadly. We take no lecturing from the Tánaiste about that. There was a convention that worked well in the previous Dáil. We have had 32 meetings of the Business Committee in this Dáil so far and they have all been civil and they have worked very well. We have always worked things out without ever having a vote of the Business Committee, I think. What we see here is - and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows - that the Government backbenchers do not turn up for their time and they collapse the debates. This is a three-card trick. Put them all in first, they will not turn up for the debates and the legislation will fall and be closed down. This is an attempt to muzzle the Opposition. I am not from a far-left party at all or anything like it. We want fairness and equality. We represent the people of rural Ireland and they need to be heard. The Government pushed through a Bill here earlier to support the vulture funds. That is who the Government represents. We represent the ordinary people.

The secretariat brought forward proposals a number of weeks ago relating to modelling for proportionality to be fair to everybody. Those proposals were not accepted and we had Government proposals as we come to the end of this Dáil term. What has happened here tonight is deeply regrettable. Our party put forward a proposal to the Business Committee today to try to find a compromise between the legitimate requests for all of the Deputies to have an equal opportunity to speak in this Chamber. No matter what party one comes from, as a Teachta Dála for one's constituency, one has an equal right to have a say in this Chamber. We put forward a proposal that sought to strike a balance between that legitimate view and the current running order in place for Second Stage and Statements. We put that compromise proposal to the Business Committee today and, unfortunately, we have come to this. What I was trying to do earlier was make a point of order to point that we have tabled an amendment to this motion, which is the compromise proposal from earlier. The smaller parties, in fairness, have also come forward with compromise proposals in their amendments. What has happened here tonight is deeply regrettable and it does not reflect well on any of us. We could have resolved it today at the Business Committee. I am sorry to be in this place and I hope that, when we come back in September, we can reflect on the need for all voices to be heard and for proportional speaking opportunities. I make the appeal at the eleventh hour to the Government to consider the amendments to the motion and to allow us to proceed on that basis.

Furthermore, it has been mentioned already on several occasions that people are watching - of course they are. We do not need six weeks' holidays. I believe it would be much more appropriate if we were to resume proceedings on 1 September. I ask that we convene next Tuesday to facilitate questions and answers with An Tánaiste and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on an issue causing great concern. Concern was expressed about people looking in here. The same people are phoning radio shows. They are concerned. We deserve to have our questions answered and I believe the floor of the Dáil is the appropriate place to do that. We do not agree to the adjournment.

We can only resolve this issue if the Dáil is sitting. We cannot have a six-week recess for those who are in receipt of this payment.

This week has been a very significant one for the schools sector. Following an intense period of weeks involving engagement with the education partners, I secured approval for the comprehensive plan that is "Reopening Our Schools: the roadmap for the full return to school" and, most important, the funding to implement it. The funding secured is significant. As Deputies know, it is over €375 million. What is most significant, however, is that the plan and the funding addresses all of the areas that need attention, including everything that needs to be addressed to get our schools open again, and to keep them open. As the challenges before us from Covid 19 have been worked through, the paramount consideration throughout has been to do the right thing by students, their families and school communities across the country. This is my first occasion to address a Statements on Education session in the Dáil as Minister for Education and Skills. In April, May and June I was a regular contributor to earlier sessions putting views and perspectives to my predecessor. Therefore, I am aware of the interest in education but also the concerns and at times the anxieties of students, their families, and their school communities. As I have said consistently since I was appointed Minister the number one priority for me, for the Government, my Department and the wider schools sector has been to reopen our schools fully and safely at the start of the new school year. In seeking to reopen our schools we said we would be guided by the available public health advice and comprehensive engagement with stakeholders, including the school management bodies and staff representatives as well as students and parents. There has never been any doubt that I as Minister, together with my Department, school leaders and staff all want to see schools reopening as normal for the new school year. In earlier debates some Deputies suggested that teachers, principals and other school staff had not been involved in the planning process which led to the roadmap being published. I assure the House that the staff unions of teachers, SNAs, school caretakers and secretaries, representatives of principals and deputy principals, school management bodies, and representatives of parents and post-primary students were all directly involved and worked intensively with my officials to work through the detail. I appreciate that some hold the view that the roadmap could have been published sooner. The roadmap is built on the available public health advice, it is the foundation of the roadmap. That public health advice was published on 1 July. We then needed to engage with the school staff and other partners to redesign elements of how we operate and resource our schools. Deputies were aware that it was my intention to publish such a roadmap by the end of this month and that has been the intention for the last number of weeks. The roadmap was published as soon as it could have been. Rather than publish a set of aspirations, it was right to work through identifying the supports needed, to build consensus among the education partners, to get Government agreement and then launch the roadmap. The roadmap gives the clarity, confidence and hope that students, their families and schools wanted and deserved. The roadmap and the funding package recognise the challenges faced by schools in ensuring the safe return of more than 1 million students and approximately 100,000 staff in 4,000 schools in the context of Covid-19. It sets out clear plans and practical guidance on the measures schools will need to take to operate safely and minimise the risk of the introduction and spread of infection in schools. There is guidance on training, checklists for schools on preparing for reopening and guidance for operating the school safely in a Covid-19 context.It advises on areas across logistics, curriculum, teaching, managing school activities, supporting pupils with additional needs, administration and well-being. In other words, in every sense, it is a comprehensive plan backed up with the necessary financial package. It represents achievable ambition. The published template Covid-19 response plans for schools provide clear and practical guidance and support to our schools on the range of measures that needs to be put in place to bring everyone back to school safely. The funding supports are comprehensive across a wide range of areas including funding for replacement staff who cannot come to school because they are regarded as very high risk of Covid-19, including teaching staff, SNAs and administrative staff. There is also funding for additional supply panels at primary level delivering more certainty around the availability of substitutes, funding for more than 1,000 additional teachers at post-primary level to help with physical distancing and class sizes, which includes 120 additional guidance posts, and funding to provide release days for teaching principals at primary level to meet the administrative burden arising from the changes and the impacts of Covid-19. There is also funding for enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures enabling schools to have daily cleaning arrangements and to purchase supplies of hand sanitiser and any other personal protective equipment required, funding for enhanced supervision, which is a key control measure to support schools to minimise the interaction of students from different classes, in line with public health advice, and funding to support school leadership, especially principals who are getting the schools ready. All schools will be able to employ an aide to help get the school ready and, as announced in the July stimulus package, funding of €75 million will support minor capital works for all schools. We know that most students, their families and school staff will be looking forward to going back, reconnecting with school, reconnecting with staff and friends and settling back into school work. There is a strong emphasis in the roadmap on safety, and on practical arrangements, but also on ensuring the well-being of the students and of the entire staff community. I am particularly pleased that the package includes the filling of 120 guidance posts. Some have asked how this figure was arrived at. It represents the full restoration of the number of guidance posts to 2011 levels. Also, some have asked how the additional National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists posts can be filled. There is an existing panel in place, which can be utilised immediately to fill some of the new 17 psychologist posts. In addition, a new recruitment competition has commenced, with interviews due to take place in the month of August, which will create new panels for all NEPS regions meaning all vacancies can be filled at that point. Statements sessions earlier in the summer were often dominated by calls to confirm that July provision would proceed this year. The summer programmes have in fact seen the number of participating schools, participating students and the eligibility for these programmes exceed previous years, acknowledging that there were challenges. Deputies might wish to note that 245 schools are participating in the summer based programme for children with complex needs, benefiting 3,900 students; a total of 10,604 parents registered for the home-based summer programme, benefiting 11,350 students; a total of 231 schools are participating in literacy and numeracy camps in DEIS primary schools, benefiting an expected 7,600 students, and 81 schools are participating in the DEIS post-primary summer programme, benefiting an expected 2,700 students. These programmes provide a crucial stepping stone in rebuilding the connection between students and their schools before they return more fully in the autumn as there is a particular focus on re-establishing relationships, building connections, meeting emotional needs and re-engaging in routines to support participation and learning. We know that we need to support the most vulnerable in particular in returning to school and the summer programme is a vital element in preparing these students for the return to school. In the context of assessments in the 2020-21 school year, given the autonomy of schools in deciding how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, it is not proposed to prescribe adjustments of the curriculum centrally. It is considered that the most appropriate way to reflect the challenges that have occurred for students in 2019-20 and potentially into 2020-21 is to incorporate adjustments into the certificate examinations in 2021. A key consideration in making these adjustments is the need to maintain familiarity with the structure of the questions and assessment components for students and teachers. The changes will be broadly proportionate but may vary, taking into account specific context across modules, subjects and programmes. In all cases they will involve some combination of students being provided with greater choice in written examinations, which will be supported through the provision of additional questions and-or adjustments to mandatory sections on written examination papers, the dates on which course work briefs are issued being brought forward to allow for additional preparation time for students and teachers, and in some subjects, adjustments to the requirements for practical examinations being made, reflecting the need to manage access to equipment to complete the preparatory aspects. I assure the House that full engagement with the education stakeholders will continue and that we are committed to supporting schools to prepare at local level for their reopening. There will also be comprehensive communication with students and parents so that they are fully informed over the coming weeks through the campaign already under way. I encourage Deputies to use their offices and contacts to highlight where parents and students in particular can get accurate information on the gov.ie website. The Department is providing dedicated and direct contact channels to schools so that where issues might arise for them they can be resolved quickly. I have said several times in contributions to the House this week that these are changed times during which as a country we have stood up to the challenges before us, showing great resilience, demonstrating tremendous community spirit and accepting the shared responsibility to fight the Covid 19 virus. We are committed to re-opening our society in every sense and the schools sector is preparing to get our students back into classrooms in the coming weeks. The Government is fully committed to supporting this return and has shown the scale of this commitment in the support package announced this week. There is an obligation on us as public representatives to show leadership and to ensure we support our students, our schools and our communities in getting back to school as normal in the coming weeks.

It was a good debate on an important issue related to the funding of education, the pupil-teacher ratio and overcrowded classrooms. I appreciate that Deputies felt the need to protest tonight over speaking time arrangements but I regret that a vote on that motion was the casualty of the protest and that the protest was felt to be more important than the vote. In any event, I have a number of questions and I will allow the Minister time to respond before the four minutes have elapsed. The first question is on special education. There is a lot of concern among people involved in special education at this moment in time. This includes families but it also includes teachers and special needs assistants. The concern is that there is an inadequate focus in the roadmap on the fact this is a category of students who have lost out the most in many respects from the lack of school-based education. They feel they have fallen behind and that they deserve additional attention but there are no additional resources. What is more, and the Minister has not quite responded to this as yet, it appears that door has been opened to using special educational teachers as substitutes. It is in black and white in the circular that for teachers in mainstream classes schools may use other non-mainstream teachers to cover absences. In addition to this, the role they are expected to play in remote learning and the fact there are no additional resources for them lead people to be concerned that special educational teachers will be pulled from pillar to post and that the children in need of their attention will lose out. This is quite serious and it needs a response from the Minister. More than just respond to it, the Minister needs to address it. There is a need for additional resources and special education teachers should not be used as substitutes in any circumstance and they should not be used as a stopgap. That was a practice in the past and it was being rooted out. It cannot be allowed to be reintroduced. There is also an issue with regard to special needs assistants. The Minister has spoken about the additional SNAs who will be available to cover absences and this is welcome but there is no SNA substitute panel so it will be difficult for schools to identify SNAs. This also needs to be addressed. I will touch briefly on the next issue. I am not sure whether anywhere near enough substitutes have been identified. I made a point during the debate on Tuesday with regard to 500 unfilled absences last year and that 200 substitutes would not be enough to cover what was required last year and I do not see how it will be enough for this year. Tonight there was a report on Virgin Media in which a young man who has cystic fibrosis, Benat Broderick, was interviewed. He was very concerned about his education. I have to say I am very concerned about children who are high risk and immunocompromised and, where the children themselves are not but their family members are, I am concerned about them.There is no mention of that in the roadmap. My concern is that, unintentionally, a form of educational apartheid could take place over time. That cannot be allowed to happen. We cannot allow them to be isolated and unconnected with education. There must be dedicated resources for remote learning, but we also need a strategy beyond that because socialisation is important as well. We must give that further consideration. While there must be, first, dedicated resources to remote learning, we must go beyond that. Finally, the Minister disputes that this could have been published earlier. I disagree. Many of the resources were always going to be necessary in terms of staff, space and so forth. The Minister said it had to be up to date with the public health advice. The fact is that the public health advice is from June and there are some concerns that with regard to matters such as masks and the like it is not up to date at this point. Will that be re-evaluated on a continuous basis?

With regard to the commitment to special education, I am obliged to point out that 20% or one fifth of the annual budget for education is going to special education and children with special additional needs. That is very important and is a recognition of the importance of that sector in the education system. The Deputy referred to special education teachers with regard to substitution. A specific and clear measure has been introduced this year regarding substitution for schools. Obviously, it is important to have substitution available in the schools. The Deputy will be aware from his own experience that, at times, it can be difficult to find substitutes so what has been put in place is the national roll-out of a plan that was piloted over six different schools-----

I thank the Minister for being here so late or so early on Friday morning. She will appreciate that issues with returning to school are prevalent in the concerns that have been raised with us. Many people who are at the coalface do not yet have confidence that the Minister's plan will be sufficient to address their particular needs. I have two specific questions for the Minister and I hope she will be able to give me specific responses. The first relates to school transport. I acknowledge the financial allocation, but can the Minister give an assurance that every child who had an expectation of securing a seat on the school bus, including those with concessionary passes, will still be able to get on a bus in September and that the provisions will be in place? The second question relates to an issue Deputy Doherty raised on Leaders' Questions earlier. There is nothing more frustrating for an elected representative than dealing with the parents of a child who is waiting for an assessment of needs. The child cannot get any supports until that assessment has taken place. I have dealt with a number of parents whose children have been waiting in some cases for several years for the assessment to take place. That is unacceptable. Can the Minister give an assurance that she will provide the necessary resources and staff to ensure that by the end of this year the assessments of needs will be carried out for all those children?

Can the provision of autism classes be included in those remediation works so children with autism can get back to school as well? There is only one autism class in the postal codes of Dublin 2, Dublin 4, Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W. It is important for the parents that children have classes to which they can return. If schools were able to include the development of classes for children with autism in the remediation works it would be greatly beneficial for the parents of those children.

It feels as if we are in the worst nightclub ever, spending this time together. Perhaps there should be some type of mechanism for us to interact over the month of August. I appreciate that we cannot recall the Dáil but we should find an imaginative way for Opposition Deputies and the Minister or her officials to engage in the weeks before the reopening because this issue is so important. I strongly hope that this plan works. We all need it to work and we need the Minister to be successful. I strongly believe we could work with the Minister in whatever way we can over the next number of weeks to ensure it is successful. I have a question about masks. Many schools are concerned about what type of protocols will be issued from the Department regarding the wearing of masks, particularly at second level and in respect of students who are vulnerable and have special educational needs. I have in mind children with cochlear implants who have concerns about how they might wear a mask. We need some guidelines on that. The issue of special education teachers being used as substitutes is crucial. I was a resource teacher for a period of time. It was difficult if my work was interrupted by going into a class to substitute for that class. Not only was my work disrupted but obviously the child who needed the attention was disadvantaged as well. That is something that needs to change. We have spoken about the lack of time. We cannot blame the Minister for that as she has only been in the office for less than a month, but obviously this package would have been required a number of months ago. However, we are where we are, as they say. On school transport, we probably need a few more days to allow parents to engage with the system. The Minister has delayed it to 4 August, but it probably needs to be delayed for a few more days. Can she speak on that? Regarding the issue of calculated grades, in fairness to the Minister, as part of the discussion this evening, she did arrange for a briefing with Opposition spokespeople on this yesterday and it was very informative. If calculated grades are going to be used as a mechanism for the leaving certificate in 2021 - I know the Minister will not want to make an announcement on this now or admit defeat on it at all - junior certificate and leaving certificate students of 2021 will need an early decision on that. If that decision is going to be made, it needs to be flagged well in advance because, as the Minister knows, students will have been out of the system for a number of months. Their potential for maximising whatever grades they could have got in the junior certificate or leaving certificate will be greatly impacted by that loss, so there will have to be some way the Department can look into that. If it means there will be some level of assessed grades, can an early decision on that be made? The Minister has plenty of time to respond to my last point. It has come to my notice that there are third level institutions that have internal documents circulating within them suggesting that only one day's attendance per week will be necessary for students when they come back in September. As the Department with responsibility for higher education is not legally constituted, I still must deal with the Minister for Education and Skills on this issue. If third level institutions are circulating such documents, is she aware of such conversations taking place within third level institutions? If this is the case, how can we stand over the maintenance of the student contribution at its current level if students will get only one day per week of in-class tuition? Further, why should we expect students to seek accommodation for themselves in the middle of a housing crisis if the in-class tuition they are expected to receive in September will be one day per week? To summarise my points, I seek greater clarification on masks and mask wearing; on special educational teachers being used as substitutes; and on school transport and how long parents have to apply for it. Obviously, a lot of school transport providers are still unsure as to what they can do. I want a straight answer because, unfortunately, I asked the Minister a straight question a number of weeks ago in this Chamber and did not get a straight answer, and then there was a press release a couple of hours later. I am asking her about this situation in third level institutions. Is she aware of third level colleges that within their internal conversations are suggesting there will be only one day per week in class or physical teaching, if I might put it that way? If that is the case, and if she is aware of this, does the Minister think it is appropriate that the student contribution should remain at the same level? Does she think it is appropriate that students would be under such pressure to try to obtain student accommodation for themselves, given that they will be in class only once a week?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	651	I welcome the Deputy's positive engagement and absolutely appreciate that there should be opportunities for him and other Opposition spokespersons to engage with both me and the Department on an ongoing basis over the coming weeks. I would value that positive engagement. There absolutely should be a national effort in which all of us come together to reopen the schools. I appreciate the wisdom and experience within this Chamber and in other places. I am very happy to work with the Deputy going forward, as are my officials, so he should feel free to engage with me in that respect. Regarding masks in schools, if I am picking up on the Deputy's point correctly, schools are operating on the basis of the public health advice. There is no requirement for masks within the school environment, unless a child has a particular need to wear a mask or if it is something that has been agreed because of an individual need within a school or whatever. However, it is not envisaged that masks would be worn. I absolutely appreciate the point the Deputy makes about special educational teachers. It was made by others but I did not have time to reply. In the first instance, we have the newly inaugurated national roll-out of the substitute panel, which is an opportunity for schools to take from that panel. There is also the school's panel. I suppose that every school has its own resource or pool of substitutes. Then there is the national text system, whereby schools also can draw down on substitutes. It is my intention that they will be the three streams that are utilised to source substitute teachers. I say that with absolute sincerity because I recognise and value the importance and the role of special educational teachers. Regarding school transport and the requirement for pay, as the Deputy has acknowledged, that has been extended until Tuesday. I will look into the matter but it has been extended from Friday to Tuesday. It is the absolute determination and intention at this point that the calculated grades system be a once-off and that we look to a return to the traditional leaving certificate for the new leaving certificate class of 2021. That is only right and proper and fair. I appreciate that we were in extraordinary times and required an extraordinary measure in the calculated grades system but it is absolutely the intention that we move towards a return to leaving certificate as we would know it in 2021. I will engage with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on the third level institutions. That is his brief and portfolio. I appreciate the issues the Deputy has raised. I am very conscious of them. I know of many young people and parents in particular who are hugely concerned about the issue of accommodation and how they will cater for children if they are to move to a reduced timetable. I can give the Deputy no further information on that at this point other than to say I will engage with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on it and ask him to revert to Deputy Ó Ríordáin.

I thank the Minister for taking the time to speak to us this evening. I want to ask her about recommendation 5 of the framework to reopen schools. I will read it out just so she knows what I am referring to. It states, "For those larger classes which remain difficult to accommodate consider a live streaming of that class to another room or area in the school." I have contacted a number of schools both in my own constituency and around Dublin to ask them about these overflow classrooms and I have been met with some surprise that this was even a consideration. Has the Minister's Department done an analysis as to how many schools have capacity for overflow classrooms? Could she speak to the requirements for supervision to take place in these overflow classrooms? Does she think schools will have enough teachers on standby to go into a class of four or five students? Is the technology available to achieve same? I ask because at a meeting today of the Joint Managerial Body of more than 600 school principals, this was the number one issue raised. When principals raised the issue that they do not have overflow classrooms, they were told perhaps they could get Portakabins. Is it the Department's understanding that where these overflow classrooms do not exist, schools must get Portakabins into which they can then stream live? In addition, is the Minister aware there is currently a shortage of school tables from suppliers? I refer to the single tables that are to be put in according to the roadmap.

That is the first option for schools, namely, to reconfigure classroom space or other spaces where there are general purpose areas, assembly areas or whatever and to provide the necessary space that is required. As for the issue of live-streaming, the Deputy will appreciate that a number of options are being made available. The various proposals are outlined as a consequence of engagement with the education partners as options for different schools to work through. Live-streaming is one of the proposals that has been put on the table.For schools who feel it is suitable to them or that it meets their needs, it is an option that is there. Not every school will take it up or require it but it is an option. There is the autonomy for each school to decide on their own what meets their needs best. On supervision and whether I am confident that supervision will be available for any measures of that nature, the Deputy will be aware that there is a substantial investment in supervision for second level schools. Additional hours are being made available to the schools to use as necessary at different times, whether at morning when they arrive, break times, or in a situation of this nature. It depends but the school has discretion in terms of supervision.

The 1,000 new teachers that were allocated for secondary schools are very welcome. We have 723 secondary schools in this country. Does the Minister believe that will be enough if there is a second wave? I will also touch on the recruitment process for those 1,000 teachers. There is currently no advertisement related to the recruitment of these new teachers. When will the advertisement happen for the recruitment of these teachers? The Minister will be aware there is a two-week window in which these advertisements have to take place. There is also an interview process. When does the Minister believe these teachers will be ready to start teaching in class and what should happen in the meantime? I do not believe they will be ready in four weeks, given the short timeframe. As part of that new recruitment, there is also the very welcome reallocation of 123 career guidance counsellors for 723 schools. How will the allocation of career guidance counsellors be given to those schools? How can a school be fortunate enough to get one of those counsellors?

I will take this opportunity to explain to the Deputy how that will work. Each school will look at their own need. The hours available in each of those teaching posts will be 22 hours. Management will decide what is needed within the school, for example, an additional eight hours being needed for French and ten hours for physics or whatever the case may be. It will not necessarily mean that a single person will be in the school. The hours will be divided to meet the needs of the school at any given time. I have confidence that every principal will make the best judgment as regards the best use of those 22 hours. In some instances, it may be a single person but I expect from my own experience it will be a number of people who will cover the needs required within the school. Regarding the sourcing of the teachers, I have every confidence. Many of them, in my experience, are already in the school system. We have 1,300 job sharers, and for the first time we are raising the bar on the number of hours job sharers can work. They can extend their time. Equally, we have a number of part-timers already working in schools and their hours can be increased. We have more than 2,000 currently registered with the Teaching Council who are not currently working. Many of the schools already know who their substitutes are. They will have identified them. I have every confidence they can do it and this is a great boon and a great addition to the second level schools to have posts of that nature coming on stream. On guidance counsellors, the 120 figure restores the numbers to pre-2011 numbers and is a full restoration of guidance counselling hours. That is hugely positive because it is all tied up with the very strong resources we are putting into well-being within schools for our young people. Very substantial resources are also being put in place for the entire school community. That is also a very positive move and I know it is something the Deputy is particularly interested in.

I imagine it is quite a difficult position. Will the Minister tell us about this role, the person in charge of all the Covid-related activities and precautions in a school? How will this person be identified? My understanding is he or she can be any member of the school faculty. The person has to be elected by consensus within the school. There is no financial incentive for a person taking on this role. There is only one training session, I am told. Is that person personally liable within the role if guidelines are not followed? Given that this is a voluntary position, what happens if nobody takes up this position in a school? Does it default to the management of the school?

It is a recognition of the need for co-ordination of Covid-19 measures within the school and it is a recognition that there needs to be a number of personnel who are to the fore. There is the principal, the deputy principal and senior members of staff. I know from experience that it will be a whole-school engagement and effort, but there will be reduced hours available for the individual who takes up the lead worker role. I have every confidence that position is being mooted within schools. It is like any other position taken up within schools. Where a need is identified within a school, somebody will be put in place. Obviously, it is voluntary in terms of the person taking it up, but it is hugely important role. It is an acknowledgement of the need to streamline how schools will operate. In tandem, there is a further resource going into the schools to support the roll-out of Covid-19 measures in advance of schools opening, and that is the individual who will operate as an aide in the school for the next number of weeks. There are a number of measures and the lead worker representative is compensated by means of a reduced timetable within the school.

I have only a short amount of time left so I will ask a very quick question. This year's leaving certificate cohort will arrive back in school on 7 September. The Minister knows from being in schools that when the leaving certificate results come out, all these students come back, some in a state of emotional distress and some seeking extra guidance and support. Will those students who get their results on 7 September be allowed back into their schools to talk to their teachers and ask questions about their grading? Will there be guidelines to support them, given the other responsibilities on schools at that stage? What is the Minister's advice to students on 7 September looking for advice from their schools on grades?

Students will receive their results via the portal, but I know from personal experience that schools will always be open to support and to walk with, before and behind their students. I have every confidence schools will want to play a role, but in the first instance the results will go via the portal to the students themselves. I have every confidence that schools will want to be there in a supportive role.

First, I wish the Minister the best of luck in her new role. She is taking on the position at probably the most difficult time imaginable and I assure her she will have my full support should she undertake measures that will make our schools safe for students, staff and parents. The health and welfare of our students must be our number one priority. We cannot afford to take any chances with the well-being of our students and we cannot put a price on it. Whatever measures need to be taken now must be taken regardless of the costs. This pandemic crisis has showed us all how vulnerable we really are. Unfortunately, we may have to live with this dreadful virus moving forward. Taking this approach now, we must ensure we implement the right measures to safeguard students and staff in schools and colleges now and into the future. I have spoken to a lot of teaching staff and SNAs over recent weeks and months. Speaking on their behalf, I know they are extremely worried about returning to work in a few weeks' time. They have raised many issues with me which they feel must be addressed for schools to be a safe environment for students, staff and parents. I would like to outline some of the issues that have been raised with me and I would appreciate it if the Minister could respond to them this evening. If not, a written reply would be fine. The Department needs to confirm that the use of personal protective equipment, PPE, is recommended and not simply optional for special needs assistants, SNAs, in classrooms that have social distancing of 1 m. More guidelines are needed on infection control issues for SNAs carrying out personal and intimate care. Greater clarity is required in respect of the identification of students with symptoms of Covid and procedures for ensuring they do not attend school. Schools need to work on assembling substitute panels as a matter of urgency as staff may need to be vetted. Otherwise, replacements will not be available in time. More SNA staff will be needed if the pods and bubble approach is to be successful because many SNAs move between different classes and year groups, which could undermine the integrity of the pods. The SNAs I spoke to feel the guidance glosses over this issue and that more SNAs will be required if the objective is to minimise interaction. I thank the Minister for making €15 million available for replacement personnel who will cover for staff with underlying conditions or Covid-related sickness. I also acknowledge that her Department has made additional funding available for special educational needs provision by way of National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, posts and special educational needs school transport and bus escorts, all of which are very welcome. As I said, insufficient funding must not stand in the way of making our schools safe for students and staff. To be clear, we cannot put a price on the safety of our children while they attend school. If this pandemic has taught us anything, it is that life is precious and we must treasure it. In fairness to the Government, it is providing substantial funds to fight the virus. It is important that we use the money wisely and spend it on behalf of the taxpayer in the best possible way.  We are all learning something new each day in the fight against this deadly virus. I draw attention to an indigenous Irish company that is providing solutions to schools and hospitals to make them safe from Covid and other viruses. The company in question is a spin-off enterprise of Martin McVicar, who brought us the Combi-Ventilate some months ago. That device allowed a single ventilator to be split into numerous ventilators, which in turn allowed more patients be treated in intensive care units at the same time. His new company, Copper-Cover, has developed a unique process whereby pure copper can be installed on what are called high-volume touch surfaces. Such surfaces include door handles, push plates on doors and grab rails. This is an important innovation because it is scientifically proven that viruses cannot survive on copper surfaces. I understand there are more than 600,000 research and medical papers to back up the process. If a surface can be treated with pure copper, it is automatically safe from virus contamination. As we all know, one of the most common ways that the Covid virus is transmitted is through touch surfaces. If we could make all door handles, grab rails and other high-volume touch surfaces in schools and hospitals safe from Covid contamination, the impact would be very significant, not only for students and patients but also for staff and visitors. I have forwarded the company's details to the Minister and I am sure its directors would be delighted to meet her and her officials to discuss the potential this process has to make our schools, hospitals and care homes safe environments for all involved. Indigenous Irish companies like Copper-Cover can play a major part in the fight against this dreadful virus. As I said, Covid may potentially become a part of day-to-day life in Ireland and the rest of the world for some time to come. If that is the case, we will have to learn to live in a new way. I acknowledge the additional €350 million in funding announced in the roadmap for reopening schools. We must get the whole process of reopening right and I emphasise again that a lack of funding must not stand in the way. I wish the Minister the very best of luck in her new role at this most difficult time. She has an enormous job on her hands but I believe that if we all work together, we will get through this. This is not the time for political point-scoring. It is a time for us to work together for the greater good. Our front-line staff and our citizens have all been heroic since this pandemic hit. The reducing numbers of daily cases of infections and deaths are testament to this. We in this Chamber must follow their example and work together as a team. I assure the Minister of my support for her efforts to get students and staff back to schools safely. I also assure her that should any decisions be taken which I feel are wrong, I will be the first to raise them with her. I believe in a healthy democracy where we can have open and frank debates on the issues of the day. I look forward to working with the Minister over the coming years.

We must make every possible effort to work collaboratively to ensure we can safely and fully reopen schools in late August or September, depending on the individual schools. The Deputy highlighted the importance of SNAs in schools. I absolutely acknowledge that and I have first-hand experience of the invaluable role they play in supporting children with special educational needs. They are a hugely important part of the supports available to children with significant additional needs. SNA numbers have grown substantially, as the Deputy knows, and are now more than 60% higher than they were even ten years ago. We currently have more than 17,000 SNAs in schools supporting more than 35,000 students. Their role and its importance in the school system cannot be emphasised enough. In regard to the use of PPE, for SNAs who are dealing with intimate care or whatever the needs of the student might be, PPE will of course be a necessity. I appreciate the Deputy's point about the importance of everybody within the school community, including pupils, parents, teachers and staff, being aware of the symptoms of Covid-19, and the obligation on everybody within the school sector to stay at home if they are experiencing those symptoms. Once we open the schools, the most important thing is that we are able to keep them open. For that to happen, there is an obligation on all who engage with and interact in the school environment to know when it is best to stay at home. I take the Deputy's point that questions of funding, in any shape or form, must not stand in the way of schools reopening or the best care and services being provided for the children and young people we serve. To be fair, the package of more than €375 million is a very strong endorsement from Government of the importance of the education sector and, even more so, the importance of the children who are at the centre of it. The resources and supports are there and I have every confidence that the goodwill is also there to ensure schools can safely reopen and students and staff can safely return to classrooms.

I thank her for the very positive engagement she has afforded me on behalf of schools in Cork South-West in the short time since she was appointed Minister. She is a credit to the difficult position she holds. I have discussed a good number of issues with her in the past week and tonight I have a different area to travel. My question concerns fee-charging schools such as Bandon Grammar School, which will not receive any assistance under the minor works grant scheme for necessary changes to classrooms, toilets and so on to enable social distancing and enhance hygiene and will not receive any staffing alleviation to enable classes to be spread out. It is not fully clear to these schools whether they may avail of assistance under the Covid-19 capitation grant scheme for the provision of additional cleaning support and the purchase of hand sanitisers and PPE or access additional supervision supports to ensure the safety of pupils and staff. Will these essential supports be forthcoming to Bandon Grammar School and other fee-paying schools? The Bandon school caters for a very scattered community across south and west Cork and County Kerry. The school has had to make very substantial changes to its boarding facilities and reduce capacity to comply with the best advice. The fees for the school are kept at a minimum as it mainly serves rural areas. The cost of the works that are required cannot be passed on to the parents of the schoolgoing children.Given this very serious situation, Bandon Grammar School is in need of assistance and direction. Will it be given assistance under the minor works grant for the necessary changes and can it avail of assistance under the Covid-19 capitation grant? I might have a few more questions after the Minister replies.

The matter of fee-paying schools is an important one as questions have been raised around it. I confirm that all fee-charging schools have been contacted by my Department to advise them that while schools outside of the free schemes are not automatically covered by the minor works grant, the Department absolutely recognises that there may well be circumstances in which fee-charging schools require some support to implement necessary reconfiguration works, as envisaged under the Roadmap for the Full Return to School, to facilitate reopening. These schools have also been advised that in exceptional circumstances, they can seek assistance from the Department for staffing or financial supports where they can demonstrate particular challenges brought about by the impact of Covid-19. They can also seek support to implement any measures that might be required to limit the risk of spreading infection. In addition, the additional allocation of guidance counsellor hours absolutely includes the fee-charging schools. Of course, schools will be required to demonstrate clearly their difficulties in implementing necessary control measures and how the provision of additional supports would help them to overcome those particular difficulties. Additional supports will be considered in the context of education provision in the mainstream schools. I appreciate the Deputy raising this matter and I confirm that all these schools are eligible to apply for aid, should they have a specific need and requirement.

These schools are struggling the same as ordinary schools and they need the capitation grant and the minor works grant at this time. It is essential for this school and others. I have been talking to schools in Castletownbere, Kilcrohane, Ballydehob, Belgooly, Baltimore, throughout west Cork and in different places, and parents and teachers are worried. The school in Castletownbere will not open unless it gets an extra teacher. We have been in contact with the Department and the matter can hopefully be resolved. I am also worried about St. Brogan's College in Bandon. This is a very serious issue because it has been massively over capacity for the last number of years. Many beautiful plans are being discussed but there are no deadlines for when a sod will be turned. What is going to happen in September? We cannot even contemplate years down the road. Only a few months ago, many of the parents in Bandon were told to educate their children in Cork city, which was unacceptable. I am running out of time.

As regards school transport, I am getting worried about what actions have been taken or what interaction has been had with school bus operators. I must record my interest as I own some school buses. I do not believe enough is being done to ensure social distancing, where, for example, secondary school students or national school children are to be taken from Kilgarvan into Kenmare. An awful lot of work must be done if the numbers on the buses are to be reduced because if Bus Éireann has to provide more buses, I believe it will have to tender for them. That will take time and the days are passing very quickly. I ask the Minister to address that matter.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	677	On the issue of children or young students on buses, the buses are operating on the basis of the public health advice that has been given. That advice suggests that children in primary school, and older children at second level, be regarded as one single cohort. That means that the same children get on the bus every day. They will be assigned specific seats and will sit with a sibling or a child in their class. When they get on the bus, there will be hand sanitiser and wipes if needed, and PPE will be provided for the bus driver. I confirm that children under the age of 13 will not be required to wear masks on the bus and that children over 13 will. As they are a single cohort, the buses will operate as normal or as has been traditional for them. An investment of €11.3 million is being made available for any works that might need to be done on the buses, including providing PPE for the bus drivers, hand sanitiser and wipes, the cleaning of the buses once the children leave them, and so on. They will be operating in that manner on the basis of the public health advice and nothing else.

The community group in that parish is offering its hall or rambling house to the school, which is fully heated and is in great condition. The group owes money for its refurbishment but it has not been able to generate any funds this year as it could not fundraise. Such groups can offer halls or spaces. Obviously, they would like some remuneration for them. Would places like that be considered, given that the school is at maximum capacity at present and that social distancing may be required for the older children? There is work to be done in this area and there are other places like it as well.

I do not mean to repeat myself, but the funding of €75 million that has been made available to the schools is intended for providing space within the schools themselves in the first instance. They should look within their own classrooms, declutter them and remove all excess furniture. They can also look at other areas outside the classroom, like the general assembly or general purpose area, which they can reconfigure. It is believed that there may well be significant options within the schools. If all of that fails, they have the option of looking outside the campus and if they cannot immediately find space in their own campuses, they can look at local halls or whatever else may be available. That is not the first option and they have to be able to show that there was a justifiable need for them to do so. In other words, all other options within the school campus must be exhausted first.

I am will limit my questions because time is limited and I have only five minutes. This issue has already been raised by several speakers, but the Minister needs to clarify the Department's view on the issue of special needs teachers. Will they be redeployed to provide cover within their schools? What will happen to those children with special needs who were being looked after by those teachers previously? How is it envisaged that specialist rooms in schools, such as home economics and woodwork rooms, will operate? It will not be possible to increase their number. What consideration has been given to this issue and how will these specialist rooms operate? Regarding schools at, or well on the way to, the planning stages of building new premises, will those plans have to be amended to cater for greater social distancing and what will that mean for the building programme? 
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	682	I thank the Deputy for his questions. I assume the Deputy is asking what will happen when substitution is not available in a school. There are several streams or options within schools regarding substitution. I repeat that there is a national roll-out of a substitute panel. Importantly, and perhaps I did not say this already, it was piloted first in six places and a number of posts are being made available so that more than 60 areas around the country will have substitute panels. I want to be clear that if the number currently specified needs to be increased to meet the needs of schools, it will be increased. For this reason, I do not believe that special education teachers will be required to relinquish their role in the school. I value the work of special education teachers. As I said, there are other options available. There is the substitute panel, the pool the school would normally use for substitutes and the national text line. I would like to think that all those options will be exhausted. Those are the first and main options but I reiterate that if a substitute panel requires more teachers to ensure it is operating fully, then that will be done.  Regarding specialist rooms in schools, I confirm that in those rooms the number of students is reduced to the usual numbers that would be there because of the nature of the subjects. That will be very positive regarding social distancing. If there are exceptional measures, every opportunity to limit the number of students in a room or the option of looking at other rooms within a campus should be utilised. From my personal knowledge of the situation, the advantage I see is that the numbers in those classes are already reduced, which I believe will be of some help.

Looking around this convention centre, I am a little ashamed to be a Member of this Dáil too, but for very different reasons. We set an appalling example by decamping from Dáil Éireann in Leinster House down to this glass palace. We are told this was done so we can be safe. I know the cost is sometimes exaggerated. Someone told me tonight that it only costs around €30,000 a day, but how much could that money do for children in our schools and for special needs students in particular? I appreciate that the Minister is not terribly long in the job. I also appreciate that she has made a series of announcements, including that all sorts of works will be carried out in schools across the country. When will that happen? Schools will be opening in less than four weeks, and some schools have been refused money having applied to the Department in good time to carry out works. I appreciate that it was a different Minister in the post at that time. However, the role of Minister for Education and Skills continues and this Government is effectively the same as the previous Government. There are no policy changes, there is no change of direction and it is a continuum, unfortunately, as has been made very clear. When will these works be carried out? Will it be in time for children to go back to school? In particular, what is going to be done regarding special needs assistants who have to engage intensively with children with special needs? I appreciate that the Minister has met the teaching unions and will meet with the union that represents SNAs, but what, specifically, will be done in respect of those SNAs who have to engage intimately with students? It will simply not be good enough if the students in question cannot go back to school in this Republic, which is represented by a Dáil that looks after itself very well but does little for students and the SNAs upon whom these students depend for care.

Regarding works being carried out in schools and being resourced and carried out in time, the Deputy referred to many of the schools having previously applied to the Department for necessary and perhaps emergency works, including minor works, etc., and being refused funding. I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that the money for the works to be carried out in the next several weeks will be arriving in the schools next week. The money, not just for the works but for the additional aide or individual who will help to prepare each school in August, with the support of the management, will also be arriving in schools. There is, therefore, an absolute commitment that the funding and works that need to be done will be resourced and, as a sign of good faith, that funding will arrive before the end of next week. Regarding the Deputy's concerns about the timeframe, the minor works grant is a process with which primary schools are familiar. The schools are well used to operating it and know what it involves. Before any announcement was made, principals, deputy principals and management in schools knew exactly where that money had to be spent. Likewise, although it is a new form of funding for second level schools, they also know what needs to be done. I have been greatly heartened by the videos I have seen and the messages that have come in from principals. They are getting down to work and making the adjustments and arrangements that need to be put in place. I am sure the Deputy has also seen many of these messages on social media. They are positive, proactive and demonstrate a worthwhile engagement from all involved in the school sector. Principals are very keen to reopen schools safely and well.

I ask that because if they do, the works will simply not be carried out on time. I have one more brief question. Will anything be done to ensure students doing the leaving certificate who are hoping to go to university in the United Kingdom have results in time to take up places in the UK?

The leaving certificate results come out on 7 September, which will be fully in time for UCAS and there has been engagement in that regard. On the wider issue of students taking up university places in third level institutions elsewhere in Europe, I have written to my counterparts throughout Europe regarding students having the opportunity to take up places and asking that they adopt a flexible approach. We have had positive engagement on that issue and we have heard recently from the Netherlands that the educational authorities there have written to all their institutions advising them to show similar flexibility. That is very positive.

There will be small jobs and big jobs and, as I said, these funds are for minor works. The schools will know what will be involved in each case.

I know that the Government and the Minister accept that changes must be made to take account of that lost time. I was going to say that I had an exchange with the Minister earlier today but it was yesterday at this point. In that exchange, she indicated that the change was going to take the form of giving a greater degree of choice to next year's leaving certificate students. That seems like a sensible approach to take but of course, the devil is in the detail. Do the changes go far enough and are they acceptable to the broad mass of students? Precisely when will the students find out what the changes are going to be and the greater choice that they will have? Will they find out on the first day when they go back to school, later in the month of September or the week before Christmas? When will students find out about the changes that are being made?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	696	I thank the Deputy for raising the question. I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from when he said he did not know whether to refer to yesterday or today. I am not sure which it is, we have been here so long. I appreciate that the Deputy has raised an important issue and it is a matter of concern for the students who will comprise the leaving certificate class of 2021 and for their parents. The Deputy is correct, as I told him earlier, that the curriculum itself cannot change because there is no way of identifying what was taught at different times in different schools. The curriculum has to remain the same. Offering the option of a wider choice is that fairest system in terms of allowing the curriculum to stand but adjusting the assessment aspect of it. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has worked on the issue, that is, on the guidelines that will relate to all subjects and how they will be adjudicated upon. It has also worked on other programmes within schools that will be important for them going forward, including transition year and other innovations of that nature. All of those options will be available on the return to school and the information will be freely available to the students as they return. They must get that information because the earlier they know, the better. That will give them confidence in terms of how they will approach their leaving certificate. My opinion at this stage is that it is the fairest way for students to have an adjustment in terms of choice on the paper and how the papers will be examined.

I think the Minister said that the students should know about the changes as soon as they go back to school. That implies that they will know in the first week that they go back. Is that the position? Could the Minister indicate if I have got that right with a "Yes" or "No" answer?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	698	It is my intention that teachers will be informed of the changes to the assessment aspect of the leaving certificate prior to their return to school and, obviously, they will inform students, as they normally would.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	699	That is helpful; I thank the Minister. Earlier, I mentioned to the Minister that in an exchange I had during the week with the Taoiseach, he said there would be consultation with all of what he described as the stakeholders on the proposed changes in next year's leaving certificate about which the Minister has just spoken about. He laid particular emphasis on the fact that he considered it important that there would be a very high degree of consultation with sixth year students to seek their consent for the changes. I asked the Minister about this yesterday and she spoke in the past tense. When I asked whether there would be consultation in an effort to gauge the level of consent among students and if consent was not there, whether further changes would be made, the Minister indicated that the students have representative organisations that had already been consulted. I am not asking her that. Approximately 60,000 students will find out about these changes from their teachers in the first days when they go back to school. If the sentiment among students is that these changes do not go far enough, need to go further and that more or different changes need to be made, what will happen then? If there is the level of consultation that the Taoiseach indicated he felt was desirable, it would suggest that the matter would not then be concluded. In other words, the current position may not be final. Is the Minister open to further discussion and consultation with students on that issue if they feel there are matters that need to be addressed?

He will appreciate that the roadmap covered quite an amount of aspects, including cleaning, panels of substitution, additional posts or whatever. As I previously outlined to the Deputy, all of those aspects, including curriculum and assessment, were discussed at great length with the partners in education and the broadest section of representative voices. As a consequence, the roadmap was put together and, as I said, it includes addressing curriculum and assessment. The consultation has taken place in that respect. The guidance on the curriculum is now being brought forward and will be available to the schools in time for their reopening.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	701	I am concerned by that answer and I think that many fifth year students who will be going into sixth year in September will also be concerned. The Minister said that the consultation has taken place. I am not sure if many of those students to whom I referred will agree with that. I know that there is a representative organisation and I respect the good work it has done. I understand that the Minister has been in touch with that group and had a certain back and forth engagement. However, there has not yet been an opportunity for the approximately 60,000 students to say what they think about the changes because they do not know what they are. They will find out within a matter of days of going back to school. It may well be the case that they say the changes are good and support them. However, it is possible that the students may believe that the changes do not go far enough and that there needs to be something different in the mix. If one is to stick to the letter of the law of the line laid down by the Taoiseach, namely, that there has to be maximum consultation with and consent from the students, that means it is not a done deal and there needs to be further discussion. Is the Minister open to further discussion if needs be?

There was full engagement in bringing forward many and all of the initiatives that are in the roadmap. I confirm to the Deputy that the guidelines will be available. I believe those guidelines are in the best interests of the students. I have not heard at any point that students are not happy with the proposals, which are very fair. It would not be acceptable to interfere with the curriculum but it is manageable and right, and will be fair, that there will be an adjustment in the assessment method for the benefit of all concerned. I think students will see those changes for what they are and I reiterate that students were represented in the partners in education consultation. I am confident that what is being proposed is in the best interests of all.

If it does, the Minister will need to review that position. We will leave it at that.

#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	705	My opening remarks allowed me to set out again the commitment of the Government and my Department to the education of our schoolgoing students, and their families, schools and communities. I could use the time available to me to detail again all that has been done in the school sector, but the roadmap for reopening our schools has been published and is available to all on gov.ie. It is exactly what its title says, namely, a roadmap signposting how we can get our schools open once again and children back into their classrooms. We need our children back in school. They have lost enough of what we considered normal less than six months ago. Schools in the new term will not be exactly the same as they were, but they will be familiar places and are the best places for our children to learn in the broadest sense from their teachers, peers and experiences of being together, and, for some, from the structures, routines and sports that schools provide them with. I have listened carefully to contributions from Deputies today and on every other occasion on which I have spoken in the House. I was in the House to take priority questions earlier. I was in both Houses on Tuesday. I have been impressed by the engagement and interest shown by Deputies and the shared commitment to reopen schools safely and fully. I am very much aware that our schools are rooted in local communities and that we must ensure in the coming weeks that each school can reopen safely, remain open and, as we work to implement the programme for Government, can develop and meet the demands of communities in the longer term. There are challenges to reopening our schools over the coming weeks, but there has been significant resilience and initiative shown across society since March. By working together, we can get the work that is needed done to reopen our schools fully and safely. The reopening of our schools is a major logistical undertaking, and I know that has been a much-used phrase. I also know that some have expressed concerns about whether there is enough time to prepare, whether additional staff will be required and available and what might happen if there are outbreaks of the virus. We will all work together through any challenges that emerge. My Department is available to schools to support them in any particular challenges that might emerge. In the longer term, the programme for Government offers the framework for us to address many of the issues which Deputies and others have raised with me in recent weeks, including reform of the curriculum to include a focus on modern languages, digital skills and inclusion, enhancing how we support our language and culture, how we fund and resource our schools, including capitation payments, class sizes and support staff in schools, and how we can improve the school transport system to make it more sustainable in every sense of the word. I look forward to the establishment of a citizens' assembly on education, as it will give us a vehicle to debate some of the fundamental issues that Deputies and Senators have raised over the course of this week in different sessions with me. This House will go into recess tomorrow, but I and my Department will continue to work towards their priorities of reopening our schools and delivering leaving certificate calculated grades to 60,000 students on 7 September. Many of the students will have received those results and offers of further and higher education places by the time we have the opportunity to debate education matters in the House again. Our schools will also have reopened. As the Minister with responsibility for education and a former teacher, I know how important education is for our young people. Everything I, my Department and the education partners do is motivated by the best interests of the children and young people that we serve. Our schools in every sense, including their students, families and staff, are at the centre of our communities. Perhaps it took the restrictions which were necessary to combat the Covid-19 virus for us as a society to make that connection once again. We are truly all in this together, and we will continue to work with all concerned to the benefit of our students across the country, not just in the weeks ahead but in the years ahead as we strengthen and invest in our school sector. Faoi mar a bhí riamh, is atá sé anois: ní neart go cur le chéile.

It was so bad that it drove people to engage in a hunger strike. Coronavirus spread like wildfire through this direct provision centre. As I understand it, it has still not yet been inspected. Food and water were rationed. At one stage, people were limited to 1 l of water per day. A letter I received stated it had been almost four consecutive months of living in inhumane conditions. The Government has not done anything to address that. We welcome the news that, due to the pressure created by the hunger strike, the residents will be relocated. They want to know that everyone will be relocated. They engaged in this action in solidarity with each other and do not want anyone to be left behind. They want the relocation to happen very quickly and they want to know that the hotel will be closed. It is a bad and horrifying example of the horrifying system of direct provision. It is a system which treats people inhumanely while allowing others to profit to the tune of €1 billion of public money over the past 20 years. The residents have to be moved out as quickly as possible, but direct provision as a system needs to end.

They have been treated appallingly since the first day they were put in there in the middle of March. There were 110 people accommodated in 56 rooms. Imagine what that means in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic. When there was a boil water notice in the town, the residents were limited to 1 l of water per day. They reached out to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, for help and to engage in negotiations and discussions. They got little or nothing in return. They were driven to hunger strike. For three days, 28 of the residents went on hunger strike, and the Government has conceded in the face of that. I congratulate those asylum seekers. I also congratulate the people of Cahersiveen who, to their credit, stood behind the hunger strikers in solidarity. The asylum seekers and their supporters are calling for them to moved out at the weekend and for all of the other people to be moved out very quickly after that. There can be no waiting around for months. The hotel should be closed. Direct provision is inhumane and should be abolished. The idea that it would continue after this is not something the Government can stand over. How can the Green Party stand over that? I know the Government has said it will abolish direct provision, but that is within a framework of years. The system must be abolished immediately. That is the demand from everyone who is campaigning on this issue.

It is over, which is important. For anybody in Ireland to be on hunger strike sends a strong message to us. For the asylum seekers concerned to feel that was the only way they could have their voices heard is telling. It is time to resolve the issues and deal with them fairly and quickly. In her response I would like to hear from the Minister what the timeframe will be. It is not enough to say things will happen over the next number of months.We want to know what the timeframe will be because that will be vital to ensuring the issues will be dealt with. The protestors all demanded they be given access to a social worker so they could air their grievances in a safe way. What is the Department's view on that? It shows the lack of faith the asylum seekers have in the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, and the officials of the Minister's Department who, unfortunately, they do not feel they can talk to. That happens an awful lot and is a sign of something wrong in the system. It needs to be dealt with and I hope the Minister does so. Hopefully, moving it across to another Minister might resolve it. Time will tell, we will have to wait and see what happens.

Deputy Bríd Smith also raised it but she is not here. I referred to this earlier today and it still stands true. I am sorry that residents of the Skellig Star in Cahersiveen felt that for their concerns to be heard this was the only course of action they could take. It is a matter of deep regret to me but also to my Department and the officials who work in this area. I have taken their concerns seriously as have officials in my Department. When a group of people feel they need to put their health at risk by refusing food or by not eating we need to listen to their grievances. We are listening to the residents in Cahersiveen and I am glad they are now eating and we can move forward. Covid-19 has presented us all with difficult challenges and circumstances but, in particular, the residents in Cahersiveen who have been relocated and moved from where they were, potentially from friends and other family members. Restrictions were imposed on them because of the pandemic, albeit on all of us, but the virus itself made their situation particularly difficult and I acknowledge that. I also fully appreciate the outbreak that was in the centre, the challenges that caused and how distressing it was for residents, staff, the community and for people engaging with the residents. Thankfully, the outbreak was declared over on 20 May. Since then, and in the interim, several measures have been introduced to try to make life that little bit more comfortable for the residents but, particularly, for the children who are there. I spoke of this earlier. These children were potentially in school, the same as anybody else. Obviously, we have done everything we can through their parents with my own Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Tusla and others to make sure they were able to continue in their education and that, where possible, they had access to the right technology to make sure they could continue learning. This applies to all children in direct provision. My officials have been on site in recent days to assess the situation first-hand but, most important, to listen to the concerns of the residents. I also asked them to examine issues raised around the provision of meals and any issues arising following the boiled water notice that was and is currently in place in the entire town. Following their visits, they have informed me they are satisfied that residents have access to clean and safe drinking water and meals. Again, I acknowledge the inability to cook their own meals is difficult. It is not a situation anybody wants to be in. I am conscious that residents still have outstanding issues and concerns and these are being followed up as a matter of priority. Several residents have made applications for transfer from Cahersiveen to alternative accommodation. Two days ago, the Department wrote to residents informing them the restrictions around transfers are now being relaxed. This was in place across the entire country because of Covid-19. They were necessary in terms of precautionary measures during the pandemic but as we have been able to manage the effects of the pandemic, those restrictions are now being eased. The centre in Cahersiveen was opened as emergency accommodation at the outset of the pandemic and it is always the Department's policy to withdraw from emergency accommodation as quickly as possible. However, it is not always possible to do this as quickly as we would like. My officials will be implementing that policy regarding Cahersiveen. Places for first families are currently being identified and I gave a commitment earlier today that those families' moves will be completed by the end of next week. Other residents in the centre will be moved to more permanent accommodation as soon as spaces can be found in the coming months. I have given a commitment that I want this to be done by the end of the year. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, who will take over this role, very much agrees with this. In the interim, my officials are working on solutions to facilitate the transport needs of residents who wish to visit the larger towns which they should be able to do. We will continue to listen to residents to try to provide any additional supports they require in the wake of recent events surrounding the centre. Since we opened the centre in March our goal and our priority has been to ensure the health, well-being and welfare of the residents. It has been to the fore of my mind, that of my predecessor, the then Minister of Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and all the officials in the Department. I will continue to do everything I can to support them, as will the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman when he takes over this role.

That is not going to cut it with the asylum seekers or their supporters in the town. They welcome the fact that people are being moved out. Some people are being moved out this weekend. However, the idea that people would be left behind there for months is not acceptable to the people who have organised this struggle. If I heard the Minister correctly and she said it would be by the end of the year, that would be completely unacceptable as a timescale. Will she please clarify that?

People should not have been forced into that situation where they felt they had no other choice. This crisis has been discussed openly including in the media, protests, organisation and support from the local community for months. It took a hunger strike for a welcome intervention to happen but it should not have. We need reassurance that nobody else will be placed in these situations as well as a wider reassurance that direct provision will be ended.

The Minister should clarify that this evening. Unfortunately, the problem here is that IPAS is not dealing with asylum seekers properly and unless the Minister stays involved this situation will get out of hand again. IPAS will not accept people talking on behalf of asylum seekers. Asylum seekers will not talk to IPAS because they are afraid it will affect their cases. They will not accept me or the community talking to them. It has gotten to the stage now that they have set up the refugee legal service. They set up an information service through which the asylum seekers can talk to IPAS. Something is badly wrong with the Minister's Department and the way it deals with asylum seekers and that needs to be sorted out.

The first families will be moved by the end of next week and the remainder of the residents will be moved as soon as possible and as soon as places are found. I have gotten a commitment of no later than the end of the year but, obviously, the objective is as soon as accommodation can be found. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will follow through on that commitment when he takes on this area. Nobody will be moved in after them either. The situation in Cahersiveen underscores the importance of the root and branch reform of the system for accommodation international protection applicants we are now undertaking and that is needed. The current system is far from perfect but I must outline the huge amount of progress that has been made. A huge amount of work has been done by many of my predecessors and those in the Department. The commitments we have made in the programme for Government now provide us with a unique opportunity to finally get this right after 20 years. We have committed to ending the current system of direct provision within the lifetime of the Government and replacing it with a new international protection accommodation policy which is focused on a not-for-profit approach. Responsibility will move from my Department to Deputy O'Gorman's but what we will see in the next month and a half is a report from Dr. Catherine Day.We have asked her to bring together an expert group to make recommendations from asylum seekers and NGOs, to examine best practice from other European states in the provision of services to international protection applicants, to examine likely longer-term trends and to set out recommendations and solutions. This report was due by the end of the year, but we have brought it forward and it is expected by the end of September. The intention then is to publish the White Paper by the end of this year, informed by the recommendations of the expert group which will set out how the replacement of direct provision will be structured and the steps to achieving this. There is still some way to go. This is not something that can be changed overnight but we will continue to try to make progress to improve the current situation and to improve the lives of those in direct provision. We are talking about people here and we want to ensure they can get on with their lives while they are still going through this process. It is important that we have taken that step. In particular I am glad to say that the people in Cahersiveen have come back from the steps they were taking, and they are now eating. It is a matter of deep regret for me that it had to get to that point in the first instance.

She has had a long day of engagement with Deputies and Senators on a wide range of issues over the course of this day. It is now past 2 a.m. and she is still here. I appreciate that. I made a comment about a Cabinet colleague of hers not affording us the same respect, but she is here and it is greatly appreciated. For those who are interested in the topic that we are going to discuss, it shows the seriousness with which she takes the issue. The campaign for Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together school was started several years ago. I was involved in the campaign from the start. There is great interest in the establishment of an Educate Together school in the catchment area as laid down by the Department. The Department determined that there should be a new primary school for the catchment area of Killester, Raheny and Clontarf and so the competition, for want of a better word, was started and Educate Together was deemed to be the most appropriate patron body to take on the running of that school. All was fine. However, with the school to be opened last September, a site within the catchment area was not found. A particular site was investigated for a period of time, but my understanding is that there was an issue with planning. After a long period of time, a site was found outside the catchment area, at Suttonians Rugby Club in Sutton, to enable the school to open. As a result of that, many parents who were enthusiastic about sending their children to this school thought otherwise because the idea of travelling from Clontarf, Raheny or Killester to Sutton and back again for an infant was just not going to work out. I am not sure if the Minister is familiar with the geography of the area. Suffice it to say that having a school even on a temporary basis outside the catchment area when it is just trying to find its feet, to embed a culture and to embed a dynamic around the school was not going to work. On the basis that it would be a year, many people felt that over the course of that year the Department would work hard to ensure that by following September there would be a physical site in the catchment area. Obviously, the pandemic has most likely interrupted that process and parents will probably face into a second year on site in the rugby club in Sutton. The agreement from the off was that it would be a two-year arrangement. What plans and processes are in place for the Department to ensure that a temporary or permanent site within the catchment area of Killester, Raheny and Clontarf can be obtained for this school so that it can embed itself in the community which it has been established to serve? It has not been established to be located in Sutton. It has been established to serve the students of the Killester, Raheny and Clontarf catchment area. Of course, priority is given to children who reside in that catchment area. The issue is very simple. I ask for an indication of what moves the Department is making. It would be great to have it this September. If it is to be September 2021, what is the likelihood that we can have Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together school in the catchment area of Killester, Raheny and Clontarf?

On 13 April 2018, the Minister for Education and Skills announced 42 new schools to open between 2019 and 2022. A preliminary site identification process was undertaken in respect of any of the schools for which there had not yet been a site identified. In the first instance, this exercise sought to identify State-owned property which may potentially serve as a location to provide accommodation for the new school referenced. The Department of Education and Skills portfolio of Minister-owned property and the State Property Register were considered for this purpose. Generally, all new schools commence operation in temporary accommodation with a view to permanent accommodation being provided for them by my Department as quickly as possible. As the Deputy will be aware, Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together national school is currently located in temporary accommodation at Suttonians Rugby Club. A permanent site option for the new 16-classroom Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together national school has been identified and it is in the school planning area. Given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, I am not in a position to comment further at this time. I can, however, assure the Deputy that the acquisition of a new site for the school is a priority for my Department and the patron body will be informed of the location for the school as soon as it is possible to do so.

I appreciate the Minister's response. I think the parents of children who are attending the school or intend to attend the school will be very satisfied with that response. A permanent site option for the new 16-classroom school has been identified. We are not talking about a temporary site but a permanent one and it is in the school planning area. It is quite a wide area and it spans what would border Fairview all the way down to the Kilbarrack Road, which is quite a large catchment area. I also appreciate that there are commercial sensitivities associated with the land acquisition. I appreciate that the Minister cannot go into any further detail. I appreciate the answer she has given me. This will be greatly welcomed by the school community. I ask the Minister to continue to engage with me and other representatives in the area to ensure this matter stays on the top of the agenda locally. It is crucial that if a child is from the given locality, he or she has an opportunity to attend Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together school in his or her own locality. I appeal to the Minister to continue to engage with me, the board of management, local representatives and the school community as this process continues.

The retained firefighters did not see their role as just a job. They served their community with pride and that pride can be seen in speaking to them. I saw it the first time I met them. Castlerea fire station was closed in 2007. The only reason given for the closure at the time was staffing issues. A statement from Roscommon County Council in January 2019 stated that the fire station remained closed due to operational reasons.In April last year, the chief executive of Roscommon County Council told councillors that he was fully committed to the reopening of Castlerea fire station and that it would reopen at some time in that year. Just this week, after waiting months and months for the publication of a report on fire services in County Roscommon, I sat in the council chamber and it was as if the staffing difficulties the chief executive had consistently referred to for three and half years had never existed. Instead, the fire station in Castlerea was being closed because a new report written by the chief fire officer in Roscommon recommended it. This report does not consider the make-up of the town of Castlerea, that it is the second largest town in County Roscommon and the fact that it is home to a number of large factories, large schools, forestry, boglands, nursing homes and a prison. There has been no consultation with the key stakeholders. I know this because I have engaged with many of them myself.  This is a very basic service. The people of Castlerea pay their taxes, including property tax. I ask that the Minister intervene and review this decision urgently.

I have not had the opportunity to do so before. As has been outlined, Castlerea is the second largest town in County Roscommon. An industrial relations dispute has been ongoing in recent years. There have been public meetings. I and many others have talked to people on all sides of the dispute to see whether it could be resolved. Unfortunately, it has not been. There is a report out now. Castlerea, in which the prison and factories are located, and surrounding areas such as Ballymoe and Williamstown have been served by the fire service in Castlerea. Unfortunately, a decision was taken based on this report.  It also needs to be mentioned that some politicians unfortunately got abuse over this. I saw stuff about one councillor in the town on social media. That will not solve anything. We need to solve this together. Castlerea needs a fire station. We need to move and figure out how to make sure it has one. If we can present evidence that shows the need we believe exists and will exist down the road, can the Minister help us re-establish the fire service in Castlerea in the coming months?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	724	I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. I will clarify that the provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. In accordance with this requirement, Roscommon County Council provides a fire service comprising five fire stations at Roscommon town, Elphin, Boyle, Ballaghdereen and Strokestown. Significant areas of the county are also served from fire stations in adjacent counties, including those at Athlone, Ballinasloe, Ballyhaunis, Carrick-on-Shannon and Lanesborough. My Department supports fire authorities through general policy setting and preparing legislation, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.  It should be noted that my Department was informed by Roscommon County Council in February 2017 that a situation had arisen in Castlerea fire station that resulted in the fire brigade being stood down on a temporary basis. This situation arose because of staffing issues and it was judged by Roscommon County Council that it was unsafe to mobilise this fire station to emergency incidents. As the Deputies will be aware, under the Local Government Act 2001, arrangements with regard to staffing in each local authority are the responsibility of the relevant chief executive of that authority. In this regard, as employers, Roscommon County Council pursued grievance, disciplinary and mediation processes to try to resolve the issues within Castlerea fire station over the past number of years. As these efforts have been unsuccessful, a decision has now been made not to reopen Castlerea fire station. I understand that engagement with the remaining six retained fire fighters stationed in Castlerea on this decision is due to commence.  In coming to a decision, I am sure that the chief executive of Roscommon County Council will have taken into account the fire risk in Castlerea, its environs and the wider county as well as national policy, which promotes fire prevention and fire safety as well as fire service response. I understand that concerns have been raised about fire service provision with regard to Castlerea Prison. In the first instance, the prison authorities are responsible for the management of fire safety at the prison site. However, the Roscommon fire service regularly engages with the Prison Service and is satisfied that the level of on-site management, supervision, modern buildings and fire safety protection systems along with other controls are appropriate to mitigate risks of fire on the site.  I confirm that the Roscommon fire service and its chief fire officer are in regular contact with the Irish Prison Service and the acting governor and that there are regular fire service site visits and up-to-date pre-fire plans for the facility. The fire service is also active regarding ongoing fire safety management related to the construction of new buildings at the Castlerea site.  Finally, while I can understand that there are concerns relating to the non-reopening of Castlerea fire station, I am reassured that fire cover in the area has been and continues to be managed and delivered in an efficient and safe manner from adjacent fire brigades by the Roscommon fire service.

It was permanently closed because of this new report. The decision was solely based on that. There is a statutory obligation on local authorities to provide a fire service, as the Minister has said. That obligation is not being met. I mentioned the prison. There are 12 prisons in the State. Castlerea Prison is one of the largest, with capacity for 340 prisoners and 150 staff. Castlerea Prison will be the prison that is furthest away from a fire station in the entire State. It will be 22 km from the nearest station. Portlaoise Prison is 110 m from the nearest fire station. The Midlands Prison is 290 m away. Arbour Hill Prison is 4 km, Cork Prison, 3 km and Limerick Prison, 220 m, respectively, from the nearest fire station.  I have been in contact with the council, the chief fire officer and the Prison Officers Association, which cannot get a meeting with the council. In fact, the last time the association, which represents the workers in that prison, looked for a meeting with the chief fire officer, it was directed to the HR department. This is not good enough. We need this fire station reopened. It is a basic service but it can be the difference between life and death. I again ask the Minister to look into the matter.

As has been outlined, in the Castlerea area is the Harmac factory, the prison, a mart and various businesses. This does not only affect Castlerea. The service is needed not only for the town but also for surrounding areas. I live in County Galway but fire services go across borders in rural areas. Castlerea is 12 miles from my home. The next nearest station is 16 miles away. Everything is okay until something goes wrong. That is the big problem in rural areas. We can show there is a need for a fire service in the area. What happened happened. There is no point in saying anything different. It was an industrial relations dispute. A huge amount was spent trying to resolve it but it seems it was not possible to resolve. People were brought in from different areas to try to resolve it. There is now a report saying a fire service is not required in the area. We do need a fire service in the area and I ask the Minister to look at it again.

It is worth reading into the record that it is now 2.20 a.m. I thank the Minister for being in the Chamber to speak about an extremely important issue to the constituents of Cork East, whom I am elected here to represent and to me as their local Deputy and a former councillor in the Midleton and east Cork municipal district. I refer to the issue of traffic congestion on the N25 at Castlemartyr in east Cork. Castlemartyr is a beautiful village located in east Cork between the towns of Midleton and Youghal, and, of course, the N25 is the main economic artery on the southern side of my constituency, in the municipal district of Midleton. It connects Waterford city and Rosslare to Cork. It is an extremely well-travelled route and is an incredibly important economic artery for the region. Unfortunately, there is a severe issue at Castlemartyr, where consistent issues have arisen for a long number of years as the traffic has reached a point where it is no longer at a sustainable capacity for the local area. I have extreme concerns, which during my time as a county councillor I highlighted with previous Ministers, the Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to ensure that this issue is solved. From the research I have been doing into this issue for more than a year, it is quite clear that, unfortunately, the section of the constituency in east Cork that I call home, which is near Killeagh and Castlemartyr, has been left out of the existing national development plan. Something that excites me and which I am looking forward to is the opportunity for the national development plan to be reviewed, which will be completed in the last quarter of 2020. Will the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport give serious consideration to looking into this issue? As a Fianna Fáil Deputy, I share enormous interest in public transport as I am sure does the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Before I ever became an elected representative of the people I made an enormous effort to ensure access to public transport was improved upon for rural communities and for young people throughout the country. My record speaks for itself with regard to that issue. As for the issue of infrastructure that is required for heavy goods vehicles, private cars and public transport, it is absolutely crucial that this issue be solved. It is a detrimental situation in Youghal, which has suffered extraordinarily massive economic problems. I have been working alongside a very good friend of the Acting Chairman and mine, Sandra McLellan, at Youghal Chamber of Commerce and her colleagues, to try to push this issue up the political agenda. It is one of the main priorities I hope to achieve in my time here as a Dáil Deputy. I cannot reiterate enough to the Minister how important this is to me, and it would be a societal game changer for people who are living beyond Midleton in east Cork and would change the way they live their lives so they do not spend an additional 20 minutes or half an hour stuck in traffic. Local residents in places such as Mogeely, Killeagh, Garryvoe and Ballycotton would not get caught up in severe traffic on their way home from work or their way to work, school and university. It also would give people throughout west Waterford and east Cork the opportunity to live at home and commute to university and third level institutes, which at present is not an option for so many families. This is not just about a piece of road infrastructure or the economy. It is about the society which I have the honour of being here to represent as a Deputy. I strongly encourage the Minister to give this matter the utmost consideration.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-30 00:00:00	Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 [Seanad]: Second Stage	729	First, I would like to explain that once funding arrangements have been put in place through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Overall, TII is responsible for the delivery of the national roads programme in accordance with Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan, NDP. In that context, TII provides the Department with regular updates on its delivery of the national roads programme. Within the timeframe given in the lead up to this debate, the following information is the most up-to-date information available to me. Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the national planning framework, NPF. This provides the strategic and financial framework for the national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027. The focus of TII's activities over the coming years is, accordingly, being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes that are included in the NDP, along with the maintenance of the existing national road network. The proposed N25 Castlemartyr bypass is not included among those projects which have been identified for development during the period of the NDP. However, it should be noted that the programme for Government commits to bringing forward the planned review of the NDP from 2022 and to use the review to set out an updated NDP for the period out to 2031. The review of the NDP will be aligned with the NPF and Project Ireland 2040. Work is under way within the Department to contribute to this planned review. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, require statutory approval and compliance with the public spending code. While I have stated that this scheme is not within the scope of the NDP, I understand that Cork County Council, which is the road authority for the area, is currently undertaking a feasibility study on the possibility of providing a short to medium-term relief road for the N25 through traffic around the village of Castlemartyr. The study will consider the constraints that will need to be examined in the planning of such a scheme and will consider whether a compulsory purchase order and an environmental impact assessment report are likely to be required. Following a recent interim review of the ongoing feasibility study in quarter 1 of 2020, TII awaits the final report before deciding on the next steps. TII expects to have this by September 2020. Consequently, there is currently no definite project at this stage. The outcome of the final feasibility study on the N25 at Castlemartyr is awaited before a decision can be made on the best way to proceed. In any event, I understand from TII that extensive improvement works in Killeagh were recently completed to improve the streetscape and traffic issues in the village. The Castlemartyr bypass scheme, if found to be viable and feasible, could remove a significant portion of national through traffic from the village and improve journey times and reliability. It could also lead to environmental benefits with an improvement in the air quality and noise in the village itself. The impact of the likely benefits will be informed by the feasibility study. To date, I understand from TII that a small amount of funding has been allocated by TII to Cork County Council to carry out the feasibility study and this work is ongoing and is due to conclude shortly.

As he stated, there is no definite project at this stage but that is something I am elected here to try to work upon and to resolve, as I have been doing in recent months. I recently met representatives of TII at its facility at the Jack Lynch tunnel to discuss this project. It is absolutely crucial that we recognise the major shortage of road infrastructure in east Cork. I will give the Minister an idea of the scale of the lack of investment on the eastern side of Midleton. There is a proposal for more than €200 million to be spent on improving the N25 near and around Cork city, on the eastern side, but once we go beyond Midleton, we cannot even secure a commitment to get between €20 million and €40 million that this project is expected to cost, depending on what type of project TII deems suitable. I know it has been working alongside Padraig Barrett, who is the director of roads on Cork County Council, to try to push this issue along. I am aware that €100,000 has been allocated to Cork County Council to carry out a feasibility study but I know for a fact that if we cannot get this on the national development plan later in the year, this project simply will not go ahead because of the costs involved, given that it is a major scheme.We must acknowledge that the current situation is unacceptable and is causing massive damage to the economy in east Cork and to the residents of Youghal who have been through extraordinary hardship. When I was growing up, thousands of jobs were lost in the town at the turn of the millennium. We have been waiting ever since to rectify that. As the first Government Deputy the town has had since the 1960s, I am committed to ensuring this issue is solved once and for all by improving the competitiveness of our area by investing in our road infrastructure and by taking other necessary measures as well. I strongly encourage the Minister to give a commitment that he will look into the issue in his role as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. We are counting on him. I thank him for hearing what I have had to say.

I will add further detail to inform the discussion on the approval requirements associated with national roads generally, as set out in the public spending code, in the Department's capital appraisal framework for transport projects and programmes and in planning requirements. Two sets of approvals are typically required for projects such as the proposed N25 Castlemartyr bypass. The first would be the approval of a business case and cost-benefit analysis of the project and the second would be the approval by An Bord Pleanála of an application of development consent. The necessity to meet the requirements of the public spending code and planning consent from An Bord Pleanála, along with the need to have an adequate capital budget, are critical elements in the delivery of any such national road project. I want to share with the Deputy the reality of this proposed scheme, as I have been informed by the Department. As the scheme is at a very early stage of development, it is difficult to set out the exact possible timeframe for its construction, if it is deemed feasible to proceed. Any timeframe depends on obtaining the necessary consents and completing the detailed design and tendering process. Typically, schemes of this size can take eight years or more. It is a drawn-out process. As it happens, I had discussions with the county manager and local councillors in Youghal yesterday to discuss transport issues in the area. Deputy O'Connor is absolutely right when he says that the congestion and the difficulties are very acute and noticeable. We are going to have to address that by a variety of means. I said yesterday to the local representatives that Youghal is a town that we want to see rise, develop and become the really vibrant, attractive town that it always has been once again. I will certainly be committed to anything I can do to help in that regard. I would like to conclude by thanking the officials here. This is probably our closing session of this term. At 2.30 a.m., it is time for us all to go to bed to rest and to start the holiday period which we all look forward to. Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your patience with us here tonight.

Before we finish, I would like to thank the Minister and all the Ministers. I thank Mr. Peter Finnegan and his diligent staff. I thank all the Deputies and their staff as well. Moving down here to the new surroundings of the Convention Centre has been a trying time. Having said that, I thank our ushers, our gardaí and indeed all the staff of the Convention Centre. I wish them all a well-deserved break. Tá sé an-déanach ar fad anocht, nó ar maidin. I advise those present to enjoy the bit of a break.

I thank the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for staying here so late tonight to discuss this absolutely imperative issue. I wish everyone well in the recess ahead. It is much deserved. I look forward to seeing everyone back here in September.
