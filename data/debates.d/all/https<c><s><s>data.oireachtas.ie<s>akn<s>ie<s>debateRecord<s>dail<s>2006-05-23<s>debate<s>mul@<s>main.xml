          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_10">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">Discussions with the social partners continued up to Easter and resumed after the Easter break. Until recently, the first strand of the negotiations on pay and related matters focussed on concerns about maintaining and protecting employment standards in the context of a rapidly changing labour market, especially in light of the enlargement of the EU. A great deal of time and effort was devoted to addressing the important and complex issues involved. In particular, great efforts were made to strike the right balance between ensuring decent employment standards and maintaining competitiveness, flexibility and attractiveness to investment. An emerging package of measures has been identified, although more work needs to be done. I believe we can agree measures, in the context of a new agreement, which will provide the necessary strong protection for employment standards while ensuring Ireland continues to offer an excellent environment for business and job creation. As the House is aware, the executive council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions agreed on 26 April that sufficient progress had been made in this area to allow the talks to address pay matters and other workplace related issues. A number of plenary and bilateral meetings, involving the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Construction Industry Federation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, have since taken place on such matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">I hope we can make further progress in the talks so we can conclude the overall negotiations over the next few days. However, I have been advised that there is a considerable difference between the sides on the parameters of a pay agreement, as well as on some significant non-pay items. It is far from clear that an agreement can be reached. I have always believed that no agreement is better than one which is wrong in terms of the sustainability of jobs and living standards. I would greatly regret any failure to conclude an agreement that continues the benefits the country has gained from past agreements. However, the parties need to decide whether they can agree terms. As an employer, the Government has a view on what is sustainable, a view which is being reflected in the talks. I urge all parties to be flexible and creative in negotiating an agreement that is consistent with our genuinely shared concerns about employment, living standards and the quality of life of our people.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">The House will be aware that the parallel talks within the wider non-pay strand have been focussing on the implications of the proposed longer-term framework for social partnership, the macroeconomic context for the duration of a new agreement and the economic, environmental, infrastructural and social policy priorities within a new agreement, where the social partners have agreed that a longer-term perspective is appropriate for full implementation. While I have not been directly involved since the initial plenary meeting on 2 February last, I have been kept fully informed by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, who is chairing the ongoing negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">The National Economic and Social Council completed its three yearly strategic overview of economic and social policy — NESC Strategy 2006: People, Productivity and Purpose — last year. The document, which paved the way for the current negotiations on a successor to Sustaining Progress, was published in December 2005. The council completed a separate study — The Developmental Welfare State — in May 2005 and a further report — Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy — in December 2004. The council's work in 2006 will involve the completion of its work on child income supports, the preparation and publication of a report on migration policy and the completion of its earlier work on the Lisbon strategy, focussing particularly on policy learning through the open method of co-ordination. As part of the work of the National Economic and Social Development Office, the council's secretariat will be involved in the learning society foresight initiative, which follows up the work of the Information Society Commission and Sustaining Progress. Other topics in the council's work programme in 2006 are the preparation of a periodic social report, as requested by the Government, competition and regulation in networked sectors and taxation policy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_15">Does the Taoiseach agree it is no surprise there is such a significant gap between the employers and workers' representatives with regard to pay levels? For 19 years, so-called social partnership has allowed profits, speculation and rents to rise relentlessly and without restraints, while workers' wages in no way matched them. For example, many hundreds of thousands of workers, particularly young workers, find themselves priced out of a home as a consequence.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">Does the Taoiseach agree with the general secretary of the country's third largest trade union, MANDATE, which organises 40,000 members in the retail and bar sector, who stated that partnership had condemned thousands of his members to poverty and that, therefore, the union would pull out of this process in favour of launching realistic wage demands?</p>
            <p eId="para_17">Does the Taoiseach agree that the obvious difficulty in securing a new so-called partnership agreement also arises from the great pressure felt by trade union leaders from their members regarding the employers' thrust to undermine decent wages and working conditions by exploiting migrant workers? Does he agree this scepticism is well justified, given that in recent weeks the Technical, Engineering and Electrical Union has been obliged to expose a Polish subcontractor and a Serbian subcontractor. These companies, which operated in one of the country's most important industries, namely, the ESB, grossly and cynically underpaid their workers and then victimised them when they sought their rights on union advice. This follows from the Irish Ferries debacle.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">I refer to a regime of proposed labour legislation that would destroy collective bargaining and force workers into individual contracts, one by one, at the boss's behest. It would destroy unfair dismissal protection for all workers in places of employment with fewer than 100 workers and amounts to an all-out attack on trade union rights. These are the policies of the Taoiseach's guest, the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard. Has the Taoiseach discussed workers' rights with Premier Howard and is the Taoiseach as much in agreement with him on this issue as he is on Iraq?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_19">It is not the case that employees have done badly in any year over the past 19 years. Successive partnership agreements by successive Governments have shown that increases in workers' salaries and wages have far outstripped inflation and increases in similar countries. When taken with the tax concessions given during this period, the living standards of workers have increased dramatically every year. Hence, the Deputy's statement is entirely incorrect.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_20">It is not incorrect.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_21">Social partnership has also allowed companies to grow and expand, thereby creating an additional 1 million jobs in the economy during this period. At the same time, it created the economic climate which enabled us to move away from the conditions which existed when social partnership began, when there was an unemployment rate of more than 17%, with more than 10% in long-term unemployment. At present, we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe. Moreover, at 1%, our rate of long-term unemployment is one of the lowest in the OECD. Social partnership has also allowed the creation of resources to allow us to expand all our services, including welfare services, pensions services, helping our old and young people, expanding health and education and everything in between. While I would like to find something in the Deputy's comments with which I can agree, I cannot.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">I refer to the Deputy's comments regarding employers and improvements to our legislation. While we have a good stock of labour legislation, we have devoted most of our time in these talks to efforts to address issues pertaining to immigration, to ensure we can improve legislation to deal with the new situation in the economy, whereby we have moved from a small to a large number of non-Irish workers, and to provide the necessary protective legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">As I stated in my reply, we have achieved a good package of measures. Although they are not complete, we have certainly travelled a long way down the line.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_6">
            <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_7">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_25">Every trade union leader is entitled to his opinion. The issues for which the trade union leaders have been fighting in these talks are those of the basic minimum wage and issues around what is the low paid category of workers — even if their pay is not very low in terms of what we used to call low pay — and that they should get the better share of the deal. That is the right thing for the trade union leadership to fight for and they have been fighting vigorously for those.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">As one who has broadly supported social partnership for a long time going back to the 1970s, although not to the exclusion of the terms of any particular social contract emerging, am I correct in taking a pessimistic note from what the Taoiseach has said about the prospects for a new social contract? Am I right in thinking he is distancing himself from the talks and pointing out that the Secretary General is chairing them is an especially bad omen since, if there was the prospect of success, the Taoiseach would be in the middle of it working all night to bring the parties together? Am I right in taking the view that the Taoiseach believes the prospect for progress is not promising? These talks had an original completion target of 17 March. When does the Taoiseach believe the talks might conclude?</p>
            <p eId="para_32">In the Taoiseach's role of employer, is it the intention of Government to put some proposals on the table in the matter of pensions, which is a growing issue of considerable concern in particular to great swathes of private sector workers? Does the Government intend to make some tangible proposals in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_33">I raised the issue of job displacement and protection of living standards at the beginning of the year. While it was not supposed to be an issue at all, it has taken up 84 days of the discussion so far. Are proposals to alleviate this phenomenon that are focused on the construction sector likely to emerge in the near future?</p>
            <p eId="para_34">Does the Taoiseach not consider it a failure of social partnership that the employer at the sugar company in Mallow, Greencore, is trying to sidle out of its commitment on redundancy payments to the workforce at Mallow? Given what has happened there, this would be disgraceful. Does the Government intend to intervene to cause Greencore to behave like a proper corporate citizen and to observe the correct interpretation of the Labour Court recommendation in that regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_36">On the issue of employment rights, I am not sure what Deputy Rabbitte means in referring to the beginning of the year. This matter became a major issue last September with the Irish Ferries dispute. It was the subject of ongoing difficulties and negotiations right through September, October and November and was completed in talks in which I was directly involved on 4 December. It was from that period——</p>

            <p eId="para_38">They are not. I said they were 90% complete and the remaining issues, if people are reasonable and do not look for impossible situations, can be resolved. However, this issue has been in the domain throughout the process. It is totally incorrect to say the issue was not around this year. It was a major issue throughout the autumn right up to 4 December when we tried to see whether we could get going on talks.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">There has been enormous activity on pensions during the past year with different issues raised and different positions taken. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs issued proposals and the Pensions Board raised annuities issues. The Government is determined to resolve these issues but it is understood that it cannot be done in the short term because there is no short-term solution and the issues cannot be dealt with overnight. Pensions issues in the private sector must be resolved. Many workers do not have a pension and we must work to create a better climate. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has outlined the Government's position at several meetings and conferences and we are determined to work over a period to deal with this.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">Deputy Rabbitte's final question, which is the most important, was whether I am putting forth a pessimistic impression of the talks based on my knowledge and experience and the answer is "Yes". I do not see two sides engaged to find a resolution right now. Everyone will be aware that finding a resolution in these negotiations requires people to work hard, which they are, but also to reach the necessary compromises to bring the process to an acceptable solution for all sides and not just one side. That position does not exist today. I hope it will and I hope all sides will try to find a way of dealing with the issues, which I have outlined. The circumstances do not exist right now.</p>
            <p eId="para_53">The Deputy also asked how long the talks will take. The sides have exhausted each other, including the Government. However, we cannot force the sides to settle or to agree. There is a basis for settling but both the ICTU and, particularly, the employers — I do not exclude all the other social partners — must make the necessary effort to reach agreement. They have certainly put in the time and the commitment, but I do not see the basis to find agreement at the moment. Perhaps that will change in the days ahead, but I do not see it at the moment. These questions have been on the Order Paper for several weeks and it is only fair that I give my assessment.</p>

            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_54">The Taoiseach admits that he is pessimistic about the possibilities of concluding this. He said things were 90% complete, but that there had been no deliberations on pay and pensions. What are the sticking points as he currently sees them? What are the significant non-pay issues that are outstanding? Will we have a director for employment rights compliance, as has been mentioned in some newspapers? Does he agree with David Begg's comment that wages should be ahead of the cost of living? The Government has admitted that inflation will rise above 4% this year, meaning that a pay rise below 3% would result in anyone on the average industrial wage of €600 losing €6 per week and €15 to €20 in real wages per week over a three-year deal. Does that concern the Taoiseach? Does the Government accept that due to its inability to control prices over which it has some measure of control, inflation will rise above 4% this year? What is the Taoiseach's view on the impact of inflation on the talks?</p>
            <p eId="para_55">Has anything been achieved at the talks that will prevent wildcat strikes? These can cause absolute chaos to travelling consumers, as it did last week during a two-day rail strike. Real investment has taken place by Irish Rail in the last few years.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">What get-out clauses have been included in the talks to date? If the final deal reached in Dublin Castle is for in excess of three years, but were inflation to grow substantially due to the Government's inability to keep it down, what get-out clauses are there to rectify the situation? Wage increases are above the cost of living and the consumer price index is at its highest in three years at 3.8%.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_29">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_57">The work on employment contracts is 90% complete, but not on the overall deal. If people are reasonable on the other issues, we can reach agreement. There are some issues related to employment contracts on which employers have moved a long way, as have the relevant Departments and agencies. These are issues that involve the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners and the CIF. People must be reasonable and must not look for the impossible from employers, who can go a long way but cannot do everything. We can get most of the problems resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">The pensions report has been published and it will take some years to resolve the issues surrounding annuities and so on. The Government is prepared to work on the issues. There may be difficulties with some employers, who have their own responsibilities. This refers mainly to private sector staff rather than staff in the publicservice.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">Regarding inflation, we have seen recently the issues concerning energy. According to the EU harmonised index, our inflation rate is 2.7% compared with 2.4% for the EU as a whole, so we are not that far ahead. In so far as we can deal with issues that have proved in the past few yearsto bring down inflation, we have beensuccessful.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">While issues arise on the non-pay side, there is no need to go into them. In all discussions, different pillars raise different issues. By and large, the issues pertaining to agriculture can be resolved as part of an overall deal based on the successful negotiations completed by the Government last December on the financial perspectives, which were finally ratified by the European Parliament last week. However, we must take account of other expenditure issues in the context of the Estimates and other demands. These issues cannot be taken in isolation but must be discussed within the process of considering the Estimates and other issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">The biggest issue before us concerns pay. It would be wrong of me to breach the confidentiality of the talks but the lines between the positions of employers and unions are not meeting and, at present, they do not appear likely to meet. Things can be done and ways found to deal with it but that will depend on whether the sides are prepared to get agreement and win support on these issues and see it in their interest to do so, while at the same time sustaining the strength of the economy and continuing to increase employment. These issues must be taken into account. It is not just a question of fixing on a figure for a period of close to three years or for a shorter period. We must sustain the economy while also allowing it to continue to grow successfully rather than outprice ourselves, lose competitiveness and damage exports, which will ultimately affect investment and employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">The scale always remains the same and I urge all sides, and employers and trade unions in particular, to consider this, as people have had to do in previous rounds, and to try to find a resolution. A huge amount of effort has gone into it and they should be careful about moving away from social partnership to a period of free collective bargaining in which there will be some winners but lots of losers and difficulties. If that happens, all the other issues raised by Deputy Kenny fall by the wayside because all six agreements have had the same basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. All the work we successfully carried out would come to naught and very little would be implemented in the forthcoming period. Many of the issues which would improve rights and protections for workers, including the important issue I raised earlier pertaining to immigration, on which we have worked out a good, although not perfect, package, would fall by the wayside to the detriment of workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">There is more in this world than pay issues and, certainly, there is no way that people can be underpaid based on what we see happening here and in other countries. I hope we can resolve these issues. I have no question about the effort, commitment and time given by the people on all sides who have worked on this but, ultimately, everyone must compromise to reach a deal. We need to do that very soon.</p>

Nothing in the package will provide for bans because that cannot be done. All we can do is work towards an industrial relations situation in which we do not experience wildcat strikes by very small groups which disrupt public services at a time when the State is investing €177 million in infrastructure. It cannot be done by legislation or draconian measures that would cause more conflict than they would resolve. I hope the strengthening of our labour law in this package, if we have a successful agreement, will be reciprocated by workers and that they will realise their responsibility not to engage in such actions.

Because far more people are working than ever before, there will be greater difficulty, but we must keep working to clean up all sectors of industry, including construction. All the issues around tightening up employment law have been examined at great length. The social partners spent from early February to approximately 20 April working on that aspect of it. They have put huge effort into exploring the measures they can bring to strengthen the law, procedures and codes. Some 90% of that has been agreed, a good result in any negotiation. We hope to achieve higher than 90% agreement, if not agreement on everything.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">The manner in which public sector contracts are interpreted is posing difficulties. We are close to completing a review of public sector contracts. The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and relevant officials have taken part in a major exercise to produce a different kind of construction contract, taking into account value for money reports. The Government is determined to bring this to a conclusion and has had endless meetings to achieve this.</p>

We must await the planning process before continuing. Concerning child care, long-term care, older people, disabilities, and employment for vulnerable people, the Government has honoured an enormous number of commitments. We have also provided resources for them while maintaining a positive financial position that allows employment levels and living standards to increase, and that brings workplace sustainability to a large number of workers. The NESC has set out a long-term strategy. On 2 February I stated that we sought a ten-year agreement with pay elements within that sector. It would be important that we would get that. I hope we can achieve that in the current negotiations. In the NESC strategy, there is a very good work programme, for a ten-year rather than three-year period, and the Government is acting to enhance competitiveness, increase skill levels in the labour force, provide sustainable employment opportunities, improve workplace conditions and help build an inclusive society. The Government has set out its stall and programme on all those issues. It is prepared to work towards that with a greater degree of confidence in delivery. There is agreement on those issues with the social partners, but regarding pay and some other issues, there are greater obstacles.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">I have not been in the House since Wednesday morning, and there has been some controversy regarding an issue that I raised in response to a question from Deputy Rabbitte. Since I comply with all Standing Orders and have been doing so for the past 29 years, I will do so now.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">I have always felt strongly that the perception that the then management of Aer Lingus was proposing to organise the purchase of the company from the State was unwise and divisive. It was the impact of that perception to which I was referring in my comments last week. At the same time as I did so, I emphasised, as I have done several times, the quality and achievement of the then management team.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">The comments give the impression that I was impugning the integrity and motivation of the former management. While I did not refer to anyone by name, I accept that the clear implication was a reference to Willie Walsh and his two colleagues. Comments made in the context of robust political exchange in this Chamber can sometimes have unintended effects. I regret any implication that might have been taken from them regarding the position and contribution to Aer Lingus of the former management team, which was hugely significant. I have written to Willie Walsh personally conveying my regrets. As I stated to the media last week, using the words "steal the assets" and "shaft the staff" were inappropriate. I withdraw them from the record of the House.</p>

     <b>Mr. Bruton</b>
      asked the

     his views on recent trends in consumer prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
     [19698/06]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_53">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_96">Inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, CPI, was 3.8% in April. A large part of the recent pick-up in the annual inflation rate is owing to external factors such as higher oil prices and interest rate increases by the European Central Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">On budget day, my Department forecast that CPI inflation would average 2.7% in 2006. That forecast was based on the usual technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. My Department will publish updated forecasts in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">On an EU basis, Ireland's harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, was 2.7% in April, compared with 2.4% in the euro area. Ensuring that our inflation rate moves back towards the euro area rate is important to our remaining competitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance to competitiveness. The Government is doing its bit to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies. In addition, we have not increased excise duties for the last two years, and we are promoting greater price competition by removing the 1987 groceries order. We are also seeking a reasonable wage deal to maintain and improve our international competitiveness. We are investing in public infrastructure that will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services and keep inflation down in the process.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_54">
            <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_100">Does the Minister agree the trend is particularly worrying when one compares Ireland with the rest of Europe? In December our inflation rate was below the European average, but we have swung the other way, with a rate 0.7% above it on the latest CSO figures. While inflation affects all European countries, it is far worse here than anywhere else. Against that background, is the Minister for Finance concerned at comments made yesterday by the president of the European Central Bank who highlighted internal problems, which are controlled by government, as one of the core issues of inflation in Europe. Is the Minister aware that if one looks at government sectors, which the president of the European Central Bank highlighted, including transport, telecommunications, education, housing, utilities and health, Ireland is three points above European inflation in these areas? In the areas in which government has a real say in the trend of inflation, either through regulation or direct pricing, Ireland is seriously out of line and is becoming more so? Does the Minister believe the Government needs to look at pricing and regulation to ensure we have a more competitive environment for consumers?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_55" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_101">Looking at the trend over a period of time, since we joined the euro area some years ago, the figures at the back end of last year showed, for the first time, a coming together of the European and the Irish average inflation. The Irish average inflation before that was much higher. Part of that is a function of domestic demand which is greater here than in European countries. One of the problems of the failure to reignite growth in continental European economies quite apart from the structural issues of their economies regarding the flexibility of labour markets etc. is the inability to create domestic demand. Domestic demand, while it has increased the composition of our economic growth in recent years, also brings with it the ability of people to spend their money. We have higher income earners than in many parts of the euro area.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">The Deputy referred to gas and electricity prices. These are regulated industries and prices in these sectors are determined by regulators. Increases in recent years partly reflect the global increase in oil prices, over which we do not have control. If one looks at health and education, it should be noted that these sectors have relatively small weights in the basket of consumer goods and services and hence their impact on overall inflation is relatively low.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_56">
            <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_103">If one looks at transport, telecommunications and even oil, our inflation rates are growing much more rapidly than those in Europe. There is no reason our transport and telecommunications costs should rise more rapidly than those in Europe. In the past 12 months, there has been a 15 cent increase in the price of a litre of petrol whereas there has been only a 9 cent increase elsewhere in Europe. Something is happening in Ireland which is not happening elsewhere in Europe. Let us not forget we got the tag of "rip off" and the Government carries some of the blame for that because it has allowed this inflationary spiral and fuelled it with Government take in those sectors. That is where the Minister stands accused. He needs to deal with this issue before it again becomes a live one and Ireland becomes the most expensive place in Europe.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">——which were, in some cases, opposed by Members of the Opposition in trying to represent vested interests. There is no room for complacency in terms of our competitiveness, of which we must be mindful. Making the comparison with European economies, the difference is not 0.8% but 0.3% on the harmonised index of consumer prices inflation versus the euro area since 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">Looking at the relative inflation performances of Ireland and the euro area since the beginning of monetary union, the inflation rate in Ireland has been reduced from the highest in the euro area between 1999 and 2003 to being broadly in line with the average in the past two years. Where an economy is growing strongly and is at or about full employment, as is the case in Ireland, this can lead to excess domestic demand as people spend the additional money in their pockets putting upward pressure on prices and inflation. This particularly arises in the services area, which are domestically produced rather than imported. It is a side effect, albeit an undesirable one, of an economy which is doing well.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">In terms of EU comparisons, the harmonised index of consumer prices is used by the EU member states and the European Central Bank. It is a statistical measure using a basket of goods which has been agreed between all member states so that we have a common inflation index to compare member states and the euro area as a whole. The basket of goods is revised periodically but currently the main item where it differs from the consumer price index, which is our national inflation index, is the exclusion of mortgage interest and some types of insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">I acknowledge there has been an increase in the April figure compared with the previous one. Hopefully, we will not see further interest rate increases, although we cannot anticipate what will happen with the European Central Bank. The first of the interest rate rises last autumn comes out of the base in the autumn. Depending on oil prices, were everything to stay static, one would hope there would be some moderating influences in terms of year on year inflation by the end of the year.</p>

      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Finance</b>
     his views on whether an all-party review of decentralisation is required in the national interest to conform more closely with the recommendations of the national spatial strategy and take account of the census figures; his further views on the potential loss of expertise and corporate knowledge as a result of the Government’s decentralisation programme; if he is planning to address these concerns by allowing Secretaries General to replace agencies earmarked for decentralisation with other agencies; his further views on whether this measure will gain sufficient applicants to meet decentralisation targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
     [19445/06]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_60" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_111">I state the Government's full commitment to the decentralisation programme and reiterate that its policy on the relocation programme is unchanged. To date, more than 10,600 people have applied to the central applications facility and, despite consistent negative commentary, no political spokesperson has said that any town or county should be dropped from the programme. I take this opportunity to express my disappointment at the consistent criticism of the programme. This criticism is unfair to the thousands of public servants who have signed up for decentralisation and who are now making arrangements to establish their homes and families in new locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">I also reject the suggestion implicit in the question that the decentralisation programme was not properly planned. Contrary to suggestions from some commentators this was not an announcement hastily cobbled together for political purposes to fill a gap in the Government's budget. This programme was first proposed as far back as 1999. It had its origins in the very positive experience that Government, staff and customers of the public service had of previous decentralisation programmes. Following that announcement at the end of 1999 the Government received a wide range of views, ranging from trade unions and individuals to groups representing the towns seeking the relocation of staff to their areas. In all, representations were received on behalf of over 130 towns across the country seeking the decentralisation of either sections or whole Departments to their areas. This response showed the groundswell of support for the idea from all corners of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">As well as these submissions, the Department of Finance faced a constant stream of parliamentary questions and representations from local representatives anxious for news of commencement of the programme. One thing of which the Government could not be accused was of rushing to announce the programme. A long period of deliberation took place before it made its announcement on 3 December 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">A wide range of factors were taken into account and balanced against each other in selecting the locations for the new decentralised offices. These included the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial strategy, the existence of transport links and the locations of existing decentralised offices. The aim was to establish viable clusters of work units within a region, either in the form of self-contained locations or clusters of sites located geographically close to each other or to existing decentralised offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">In regard to the implications of decentralisation on delivery of service, the terms of reference for the decentralisation implementation group explicitly included the examination of how decentralisation might enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service. To this end the group asked that all organisations participating in the programme should prepare detailed implementation plans including not just risk assessment but also mitigation strategies. A wide range of issues, including the potential loss of expertise and corporate knowledge, are addressed in these plans. The plans were prepared and submitted to the implementation group which subsequently reported that the overall quality of the plans was good. Since then those organisations listed as early movers have prepared further updated versions of their implementation plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">The implementation group has met the Secretaries General of decentralising Departments and is satisfied that the implementation of the programme is being managed in a professional and carefully planned manner. The group is currently meeting the chief executives of a number of State agencies to discuss the planning framework in place, to assess progress to date and to hear about the challenges arising and steps proposed to address these challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">The Government is satisfied with progress to date on a number of fronts, including the level of applications to the central applications facility, property acquisition, assignments of staff etc., but I am conscious that a number of issues still have to be resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">As I have already said, more than 10,600 civil and public servants have made applications through the central applications facility to relocate. That facility continues to receive new applications every week. It is anticipated that interest will increase further as timetables firm up and buildings are completed. To date, 1,500 people have been assigned to posts destined for new locations and are being trained in their new roles in readiness to move. This 1,500 represents over 20% of the Civil Service part of the programme. Some 200 of these have already relocated and it is expected that up to 1,000 will have moved by the end of this year or early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">Discussions are ongoing with the unions in respect of the various human resource aspects of the programme. There are challenges in a programme of this size but I remain confident that these can be addressed with the active co-operation of all parties involved in the implementation effort.</p>

            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_120">Does the Minister share the Taoiseach's concern, expressed in recent interviews, that there is no appetite within the statutory agencies for decentralisation? Proof of that is that workers in FÁS are on picket duty today because they find it difficult to accept a policy of so-called voluntary decentralisation that is linked to their promotional prospects.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">The Labour Party's proposal for an all-party review is an olive branch because decentralisation is important to the country. In July the census figures will be released and will tell us a great deal about population movements. The national spatial strategy and decentralisation should be reviewed in light of that information.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">Why should I not regard this decentralisation programme as one more shambles and joke perpetrated by this Government? The Taoiseach has acknowledged this, as has the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for decentralisation because he is switching bits of Departments around. It may be the last joke that Charlie McCreevy played on this House before he left. We know that his view of the State agencies would be that if FÁS is not willing to go to Birr, who needs FÁS?</p>
            <p eId="para_123">What is the Minister's reaction to the Taoiseach's confession on the sofa with Sam Smyth that the Government got it wrong and there is no appetite for decentralisation? It is caught on the horns of a dilemma between guaranteeing that the programme is voluntary and insisting that people's career and promotional prospects are linked to it. The Labour Party's proposal is for an all-party review. Will the Minister indicate why he must hang tough on this when it risks destroying our public service?</p>
            <p eId="para_124">All the risk analysis I have seen shows that, for instance, in certain Departments all or most of the senior expertise would be lost. We are facing a meltdown in the Civil Service, especially in the statutory bodies, if this 53-centre relocation goes ahead with no proper consultation or planning. The taxpayer must bear the cost and many public service bodies will be destroyed. Maybe that was the joke the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, intended to play on us. Perhaps he is having the last laugh in Brussels.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_62" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_125">Unfortunately, what is laughable is the Deputy's inability to listen to the details of the reply which confirms that the suggestion that this was hastily cobbled together is untrue. Every time I answer questions in this House I must contend with the same tired old rhetoric on this matter, particularly from this Deputy who talks out of both sides of her mouth about the muted support of the Labour Party for this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">In response specifically to her supplementary questions, the Taoiseach did not say anything new. The decentralisation implementation group has always said that implementation of the programme should be on a phased basis. The group set out timeframes which recognised the differing business requirements of individual organisations, the central applications facility take-up for certain locations and the property solutions available. The implementation group proposed this revised timeframe and the Government agreed to it last year. The original timescales envisaged for the programme when first announced were very ambitious and required the full and active co-operation of all the parties involved. It was clear from an early stage that the issues which surfaced would take a considerable period to resolve. The setting of ambitious targets, however, was the best way to drive the programme forward and has enabled us to make significant progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">In regard to Navan, I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent media coverage surrounding the relocation of the probation and welfare service. The original decision provided for the relocation of approximately 100 staff in the headquarters of the probation and welfare service to Navan. It was realised early on that approximately 80 of these staff are case officers working in the Dublin area and, to make up this shortfall, several other organisations will move to Navan in accordance with Government policy. These include the national property services regulatory authority, the new coroners agency and the new unit responsible for the management of human resources for Garda civilian staff. The original number of posts going to Navan remains unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">Birr seems to be becoming a <i>cause célèbre</i> for certain Deputies but I would love to see them go there some time. Discussions were held on three occasions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission to see if progress could be made in respect of Birr. The latest of these meetings concluded in the early hours of this morning. These continuing efforts by all the parties to use the offices of the Labour Relations Commission to find a solution is heartening. This is the only way it will be possible to arrive at a resolution which will allow meaningful talks to commence on the substantive issues around the implementation of the decentralisation programme. I strongly support using all the established and dialogue mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">In respect of the loss of corporate knowledge through the relocation of staff to the country, the Deputy should consider the story of the Revenue Commissioners in a previous decentralisation programme. The Revenue Commissioners told the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last year that they set up decentralised offices with 900 staff in the mid-west in the early 1990s. At the time 10% to 12% of staff in the Collector-General's office opted to relocate. When staff who were employed in other Revenue posts are included, that figure increases to 25%. As a result, some 75% of decentralising staff were new to the Revenue organisation. The Revenue Commissioners regarded this as an opportunity to examine its internal efficiency and, consequently, significant improvements were made to processes, systems and work practices which were implemented in the course of the decentralisation. That experience by Revenue can be replicated in the current decentralisation process.</p>

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_131">Any proposals concerning the rates, structure and impact of stamp duty are a matter for the budget. I have acted already in several respects to reduce the burden of stamp duty on low value properties and on first-time buyers. New houses are generally exempt from stamp duty. Considerations of equity within the stamp duty code must be balanced by requirements for equity in the overall tax system. It is a question of ensuring that a fair share of taxation is paid all round.</p>

            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
            <p eId="para_132">Does the Minister agree that there appears to be no end to the present spiral in house prices with the advent of 100% mortgages which lending agencies are prepared to give us? The rates drawn up do not reflect the market price. The rates for first-time buyers are punitive. If a person wants to bid more than €381,000 for a house, the price will automatically rise by €11,400 before he or she bids. This works against the first-time buyer, especially when compared with the 4% stamp duty rate in Britain. It is punitive for people in the housing market in this country or who want to move up and keep the property business alive.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">Does the Minister agree that the €40,000 stamp duty take on the average house bought last year is punitive? Does he agree with the guidelines for the purchase of a site for a house? People who want to buy a piece of land to move out of a county council house and off the housing list, or from an apartment must pay a rate starting at €10,000. Where does the Minister think this will come from? It moves up in increments of €10,000. This does not reflect the market. The rate for a site for a house costing €100,000 is 7%, it is 8% for a house costing €120,000 and 9% for a house costing €150,000. That is on top of the price of the house. Anyone looking to buy a site in proximity to a town will get nothing for €150,000. This is the case throughout the country. The Minister must agree that these tables must be revised. Has he any intention of revisiting these tables? Will he ensure that they reflect the recent market trends?</p>
            <p eId="para_134">House prices have gone through the roof. A house priced at €250,000 seven years ago would have been a mansion whereas this is now the price of a standard house, in particular in the Dublin area. A price of €381,000 does not give first-time buyers a fair opportunity. A total of €2 billion in stamp duty is paid on housing transactions and this is a hefty imposition on people who are trying to better their situation. It is not fair to the consumer and these guidelines should be revised to reflect the market. I ask the Minister again to state his plans for that change and whether he will take on board that pricing structures have gone through the roof.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_65" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_135">Changes to the current stamp duty regime must be approached with caution as even minor amendments may significantly alter the dynamics of any housing market. I have no plans at present to introduce changes although the position is kept under review at all times. It is important to stress to the Deputy that there have been increased contributions from capital taxes generally as a result of the tax reforms introduced by the Government. I would have thought that people who regard themselves as being broadly on the left of the political spectrum would welcome such an idea, that the level of taxes on workers' income would be reduced. To have a sustainable budgetary position, one must decide what percentages are to be provided by other parts of the revenue line. If income tax has been reduced in the past ten years as a proportion of the total revenue collected from 36% to 30% and capital taxes have increased their contributions from 4% to 11%, corporate taxes have increased their contributions from 10% to 15%, and thankfully there are many more corporations and many more people at work.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">To ask a Minister for Finance about his plans in the period between budgets will never obtain a clear answer because these are matters for consideration at appropriate times in the financial year and they can be kept under review. If it is the case that sites are costing €150,000 on the outskirts of towns in County Monaghan, it may be a sign that things are not quite as bad up there as people led me to believe.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">I do not know whether they are quite so bad but sites in the towns are closer to €200,000 and this is reflected around the country. I do not know whether this is a reflection of how well counties are doing or of the money being pumped into them, but that is the reality. Will the Minister consider raising the limit to reflect the way the market has gone? Will he then consider a flat rate, a realistic rate for first-time purchasers?</p>

     <b>Mr. P. McGrath</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Finance</b>
     if he has assessed recent trends in the housing market and the capacity of this market to destabilise economic progress; and the strategy of the Government to protect against such a threat.
     [19699/06]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_72" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_144">Demand for housing has risen strongly in recent years. This demand has been underpinned by demographic factors, the innate strength of the economy and the impact of an accommodating monetary stance, including historically low interest rates. Housing supply has responded to demand with completions for 2005 reaching a historic high of about 81,000 units which, on a <i>per capita</i> basis, was among the highest in the world. House prices have also risen rapidly in recent years. As in the case of housing output, fundamental factors also largely account for the increase in prices. It is reasonable to assume that over time the large increase in new housing supply will restore equilibrium to the market. This should allow output to move gradually closer to sustainable demand and result in more moderate price increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">There is currently a broad consensus among commentators such as the OECD and the IMF that the most likely outcome for the housing market is for what is termed a soft landing. However, we cannot be complacent by assuming this is inevitable. As I said on a number of occasions and acknowledged in the stability programme update published with the 2006 budget, the fact that the construction sector now accounts for a historically high share of economic activity and employment implies that the economy is vulnerable to any shock affecting this sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">For its part, the Government continues to run a prudent, stability-oriented budgetary policy which gives it room for manoeuvre in the event of an economic downturn, whatever the cause. Its planned infrastructural investment programme is largely being funded out of current revenues rather than borrowing, while the careful choice of appropriate projects enhances the overall productive capacity of the economy and thus should underpin future growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">In addition, I announced in budget 2006 that a range of specific property-related tax incentive schemes were to be discontinued on foot of a comprehensive review of the schemes undertaken by independent consultants in the course of 2005. In line with the recommendations of the consultants, the 2006 Finance Bill provides that the tax schemes in question, several of which include a significant housing component, will be discontinued subject to transitional arrangements. These arrangements provide for full tax relief on qualifying expenditure in 2006 and with decreasing levels of relief available in 2007 and in the period from January to end-July 2008, after which the relief will cease. The gradual phasing out of the tax relief schemes is designed to avoid any sudden shock to the construction sector generally, having regard to the current important contribution of this sector to the Irish economy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_73">
            <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_148">The rate of inflation in the housing market in provincial areas in 2002 averaged 11.5%, 13% in 2003 and 11% in 2004 and 2005, and the corresponding figures in Dublin were much higher. Is the Minister aware this has added about 50% to the cost of a house for somebody entering the housing market, all within a period of four years? This is horrendous for people who are trying to get into the housing market.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">Is the Minister aware that of the 81,000 units to which he referred, only about 4,000 are local authority houses and a further 2,300 are affordable houses? How does he expect that with housing inflation running as it is, people will be able to find a house for themselves?</p>
            <p eId="para_150">The Minister referred to the tax take from housing. Earlier in the year he conceded that the tax take on new houses was running at 35%. A house costing €300,000 will give the Government a tax take in the region of €105,000. This gives the Minister an annual tax take in excess of €10 billion from family homes, which is approximately 25% of the Minister's total tax take and is extra to the tax take from infrastructure and commercial building. The tax take from the housing sector and the general building sector is remarkably high and this was conceded by the Minister in his reply. What percentage of the total tax take is this? It must be 25% or more. If even a fraction of this amount is taken out of the tax take, will there not be knock-on consequences for the services which need to be provided? What steps will the Minister take to avoid a sudden fall in the housing market?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_74" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_151">As I have said on previous occasions, the increase in house prices since the mid-1990s is seen in the context of considerable structural changes and advances in the economy since then. Employment has risen by about 50% since the mid-1990s, while <i>per capita</i> wages have also risen significantly over that period. This has been supplemented by a reduction in the burden of income taxation. Demographic factors such as immigration and the increase in the cohort of 25 to 30 year olds have also been important in terms of the demand for housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">The role of lower interest rates from our participation in the economic and monetary union, EMU, has also been important. For instance, real interest rates, that is, mortgage rates adjusted for the impact of inflation, have been close to zero since 2000, compared with typical rates of around 7% in the early 1990s. Financial market liberalisation, competition and innovation have also played a role by improving access to credit. These fundamental factors largely account for the increase in prices since the mid-1990s.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">The Deputy will have to table a separate question if I am to give an accurate figure for the contribution made by building materials, for example, in the context of the overall tax take. If he tables a question to that effect, I shall see whether Revenue can provide him with the details. The fact is we all acknowledge that the current contribution of the construction industry is equivalent to twice the European average in terms of gross national product. That is a factor of the process of national development, the fact that our demographics are so different from the continental economies, for example, as well as greater domestic demand. The strong preference that people in this country maintain for the acquisition of private property as a means of pension provision for the future is another consideration.</p>

          <speech by="#PaulMcGrath" eId="spk_75">
            <from>Mr. P. McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_154">The Minister referred to real interest rates, real money and so on. An ordinary couple paying €300,000 for their house must make repayments amounting to between €1,300 and €1,500 per month. If the economy takes a downturn, the consequences for them in terms of the increased interest rates they might face are serious, not to mention the other serious consequences if one of them must give up work. Does this not conjure up grave consequences for the future of the economy? When this is factored into the take the Minister has from the building sector and the knock-on effects, will this not have to be examined seriously in the context of preparing a budget at the end of the year?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_76" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_155">One has to take these figures into account and the state of the construction industry, given that it represents 12% of national output. We must take into account what the relative health of the construction industry would be in trying to project forward Revenue figures, given the good contribution it makes, as I have acknowledged. This is true in terms of the building industry, the materials that go towards the construction of residential and other properties and the stamp duty payable based on the conveyancing of those purchases by developers or other private owners. These facts must be taken into account. It is extraordinary in some respects looking back over the past decade, that the affordability of housing is still sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">As the Deputy has said, repayments of up to €1,500 are commonplace. Given that average industrial wage earners now have on average a take home pay of €11,400 more than eight years ago, that helps to put in context why, perhaps, it is now more affordable for people to make those types of repayment as a percentage of total disposable income. Wages growth has well outstripped inflation and there has also been tax reform which has made the difference between the net and gross disposable income in Ireland the narrowest in any OECD country. A much younger cohort of people is coming into the market because of the changing demographic profile. Their earning capacity and the types of jobs being created in the economy that bring them into the market are such as to give rise to this unprecedented growth. People in the construction industry and commentators in general, including economists, have been forecasting a cooling off in the requirements for increased output in the housing sector for at least four or five years, yet housing output is again at record levels this year, compared with 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">Is it not of concern to the Minister that 50% of the uptake in new housing last year was accounted for by investment properties bought by investors getting into the market? Is this not of concern to him <i>vis-à-vis</i> first-time buyers and young people trying to get on the property ladder?</p>

            <p eId="para_158">It is important we try to ensure that first-time buyers have access to the market. We have taken some initiatives in that regard. It is to be hoped that the success of social and affordable housing initiatives will see a greater contribution from that sector than before. A great many interventions have been introduced, some of which have been successful and some less so. Ultimately, supply and demand will dictate the market.</p>

     <b>Mr. Boyle</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Finance</b>
     if the vehicle registration tax relief for flexible fuel vehicles and the excise relief for biofuels measures announced in the 2006 budget have been introduced; the number who have applied for each of the measures; the number of approvals granted in each instance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_79" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_160">Vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief for flexible fuel vehicles, as announced in the 2006 budget, was provided for in the Finance Act 2006 with effect from 1 January 2006. We have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, to date, 12 flexible fuel vehicles have availed of the VRT relief, although this low number reflects the fact that legislation underpinning this relief was only enacted in late March. It was also announced in the budget that the VRT relief for hybrid electric vehicles, in place since January 2001, would be extended to the end of 2007. By the end of April 2006, 922 such vehicles had availed of the relief since its inception.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">A new large-scale scheme of biofuels excise relief was also announced in the 2006 budget as a development from the preceding pilot biofuels excise relief scheme that has been in operation since 2005. The new scheme will provide for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum, cost more than €200 million over five years, starting this year, will when fully operational result in CO2 savings of more than 250,000 tonnes per annum, meet a target of 2% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels, help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, and stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">The process of applying for state aid clearance from the European Commission for this scheme is under way. Once approval has been granted, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will advertise the scheme and set out the procedures for applying for the excise relief.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_163">The Minister is basically saying that, under the first measure, 12 vehicles have been granted tax relief and, under the second, no additional tax relief has been granted. Does this not give the lie to the fact that these are not just green veneer measures in what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government described as the greenest budget ever? Given the history of previous budgets, however, that was not a very proud boast. If it was a green budget, it was the most pallid of greens.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">The second measure in particular is hard to accept.</p>

            <p eId="para_166">The excise relief for biofuel measures. That has already been the subject of a pilot scheme measure, and not a very successful one because of the limitations placed on the scheme by the Minister's officials. That took 18 months to secure approval from the European Commission. After making a subsequent announcement to extend that scheme, the Minister says the process of getting the EC to accept that it is not state aid has not yet begun, halfway into the budgetary year.</p>

            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_170">Given ever-increasing energy prices, these types of initiatives are not even toe in the water measures. If the Minister is serious about trying to transfer energy dependence from imported and fossil fuels, his officials should be taking a more proactive role in these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">Do the VRT relief measures for flexible fuel vehicles apply to motors imported by individuals rather than the standard importation of large numbers of vehicles for dealerships? There might be an avenue open to people to avail of this relief because of better technologies in other jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_172">In terms of both measures, what does the Minister hope the possible take-up will be by the end of this budgetary year? If he thinks that only several dozen people will have availed of the first measure by his next and final budget and the second measure will not yet have come into force, he will not be able to tell the House that he has introduced any measure that has been effective in terms of tackling energy dependency.</p>

            <p eId="para_177">The Deputy should hold on and listen if he wants to hear my answer. He said I have not applied for approval, but approval is being applied for. The Commission must give its approval and we hope to have that in the coming months. I do not expect it will take 18 months as it did the last time.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">I am tired of people coming into the House in a panic and asking why I have not done this, that or the other on directives. Even when we abide by EU regulations and requirements, the Opposition has another crib. What I have introduced, excise relief for 163 million litres of biofuels, is 20 times better than what was in place previously. I have implemented the full requirement I received from the line Department and we must get the initiative up and running. It will be done on that basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">I presume flexible fuel vehicles imported individually rather than through dealerships would have the benefit of the VRT relief, but I will have to verify it. I do not have the information in front of me, but I will check it for the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">Rather than belittle the situation, which I suppose he will do anyway, the Deputy, since he is the green man, so to speak, should advocate to people the adoption of flexible fuel or hybrid electric vehicles.

     the number of meetings which he has had with the decentralisation implementation group; and the subject of these meetings.

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_102" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_193">When the decentralisation programme was announced, the then Minister for Finance appointed a decentralisation implementation group to drive the process forward. In March, July and November of 2004 and June 2005, the group published progress reports on the implementation of the programme. Each of these reports was formally submitted either to me or my predecessor before being considered by the Government. The Government approved the recommendations contained in these reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">I met the current chair of the group last July to receive an update on the main issues arising in the implementation of the programme. In addition, I understand that my predecessor met the former chair of the group in March 2004 and I also met the former chair of the group in November 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">The group has held a series of meetings with Secretaries General of Departments involved in the programme to discuss the planning framework in place, to assess progress to date and to hear about the challenges arising and steps proposed to address them. Following this round of discussions, the group is meeting the chief executives of a number of State agencies. I intend to meet the chairman of the decentralisation implementation group shortly to receive an update on the outcome of these meetings.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_103">
            <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_196">The Minister has not taken a hands-on interest in this if he only met the decentralisation implementation group once against a background in which the programme is falling asunder. Over 90% of the programme will not be delivered by the date at end of the year he has set. Since he took office, he has only bothered to meet the decentralisation implementation group once.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">Why has the Minister not discussed with the implementation group the lack of options available to people in State agencies who opt to remain in Dublin? There is no position from the Department on what will be done with them. Why has the Minister not sought information from the implementation group about the serious loss of experience likely to occur because of the low take-up among staff in specialist areas? This means that if he pushes ahead with the programme, we will lose significant knowledge, corporate memory and experience. Do these issues not deserve much more attention from the Minister than appears evident from just one meeting since he took office?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_104" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_198">I have been receiving reports from these groups. Unfortunately, Opposition Deputies often refuse to read them or do not acknowledge their existence when they make their assertions. Since last year, the Government has adopted the decentralisation implementation group recommendations on how we rephase the implementation of the programme. The suggestion that we will have 90% done is based on the implementation group's assessment which is based on ongoing discussions. Members of my Department continually brief me on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">I met both the previous and current chairs of the implementation group once and I will meet the current chair again soon. It is not a question of him having to report to me every month on these matters. The implementation group has met on approximately 27 occasions. There are many industrial and human relations issues to be dealt with by independent officers. The implementation group has brought forward three or four reports on these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">With regard to staff vacancies, there has not been a tradition of cross-departmental transfer within the State agency sector, unlike the Civil Service which facilitated successful implementation of previous decentralisation programmes. We need to deal with this and need a negotiation breakthrough to ensure it happens. We are not at that point yet because the unions representing agencies have been of the view that this level of co-operation and detailed negotiation should not take place yet.</p>

            <p eId="para_201">Is it not the case that the Minister is corralling them only to meet the specific executives within their agencies although he acknowledges there has been no tradition of State agencies having these other opportunities to move on? He is corralling the trade unions into a negotiating position where they cannot break into the wider solutions the Minister says he seeks.</p>

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_202">No, we must first get agreement with the trade unions that the promotions policy will be affected by the reality of decentralisation when it takes place. That is the first matter of principle on which we must get agreement. There is work ongoing in the Labour Relations Commission with regard to a specific and very prominent State agency, but were we to get agreement on that and resolve the difficulty, it would have a general application. We must find a formula that will enable us to get down to detailed discussions beyond that basic principle. It is an issue that needs to be negotiated and discussed.</p>

            <p eId="para_208">Given the sensitivity of the discussions and the efforts we are making to resolve the difficulty, I am not going to negotiate in public in the House. I am trying to find a formula that will be acceptable to all the parties and will enable us to sit down and discuss the options we can provide for the future. Such a formula should balance the need for the decentralisation policy to proceed with the need to cater for those who want to stay in Dublin. We can contemplate certain choices and options, similar to those which are open to civil servants, in respect of those in the State agencies if we get agreement on the first point of principle. We have to get off the mark in that regard if we are to progress to proper discussions. Deputy Bruton asked me a specific question about the options which are available. Substantive discussions with the unions on those matters will best elucidate what those options are. We are not even in that position yet, however. Therefore, I reiterate that we need to use the industrial relations facility which is in place to ascertain whether we can make a breakthrough in respect of specific State agencies. The decentralisation programme, the rest of which the Deputies opposite are seeking to rubbish, is proceeding well. We already have 1,500——</p>

When decentralisation programmes were successfully pursued by other Governments, including Governments in which the Labour Party successfully took part, there was a principle that new institutions being created should be decentralised. I refer to the decentralisation of the Environmental Protection Agency to County Wexford and the computerised driver licensing system to County Clare, for example. Where do Deputies think the prototype new Office of the Minister for Children will be decentralised to, according to an answer that was given by the Minister of State with responsibility for children the other day? Will the Minister comment on the decision to locate the office in Bishop's Square, Redmond's Hill, Dublin 2? Does he agree that this is a farce?</p>

The Opposition continues to ignore the point, which was accepted by the Government, that it will require time. Some 1,500 civil servants — 20% of the Civil Service part of the programme — are already in new positions and are ready to move to new locations. The specific issues which have been raised in respect of State agencies will be difficult to resolve because there is no tradition of transfer between such agencies, which makes this programme different from past programmes of decentralisation. That does not detract from the work that is being done, such as the identification of locations and the acquisition of properties. As we speak, more and more people are applying to participate in the decentralisation programme. The skills mix will also have to be dealt with.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">The Taoiseach should have been a weather forecaster. His personal statement to the House earlier in respect of his comments last week about a former chief executive of Aer Lingus dealt in part with the flak that might have flown if he had waited until now to make it. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will be as thick as thieves before the general election, but I did not think the Taoiseach would take it that far.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the Government's proposed early child care supplement scheme, as distinct from the child benefit scheme which has been in operation reciprocally for many years and which everybody supports. On 30 January this year, an announcement was made on RTE that the Government intended to introduce a new early child care supplement, designed to deal with the cost of child care for children in this country. It was said at the time that the supplement would also be paid in respect of children who are not resident here. When we raised this issue with the Taoiseach, he indicated that the cost of the scheme would be approximately €1 million. On 31 January last, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said the Government would carefully monitor the situation, particularly the cost. On 9 February, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, said the cost would be approximately €2.7 million. In a Dáil reply on 26 April, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced that a cost of approximately €10.8 million would have accrued by the end of 2006. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has stated in recent days that the cost could escalate to approximately €30 million in 2007.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">The cost of the early childhood supplement scheme will depend on the take-up of the scheme. According to figures provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, 50,000 non-nationals claim child benefit in respect of 120,000 children. These figures are known. Of these, 900 families with 1,600 children are resident outside of Ireland. Based on the present position, there could be claims for 1,600 children. However, Members should consider developments since the House debated this issue earlier this year. Since March, or since all Members gave much publicity to the issue, claims for non-Irish residents in Ireland are arriving at a rate of approximately 275 to 300 per week. Until then, the figures were quite low.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Between 60% and 70% of the claimants are Polish. That is the reality. Although the scheme operated for 30 years, no one used it. However, after Members publicised it, they started to send in applications.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">The Department receives 350 claims per week under EU regulations for children who are not resident in the country. Virtually all are nationals of accession states. Approximately 7,500 claims for non-resident non-Irish nationals have not been finalised. Based on claim uptake to date, it is anticipated that approximately 15,000 claims under EU regulations in respect of 25,500 non-national non-resident children will be processed this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">At present, 1,600 non-Irish national children who are resident outside of Ireland are in payment. The numbers are quite small at present. While Deputy Kenny has not asked about child benefit payments, one can only make projections based on a consideration of the child benefit calculation. As for the early childhood supplement, the Department of Social and Family Affairs has only provided one estimate in which it stated that it is likely that approximately 10% of such claims will be finalised this year. Expenditure on these cases this year is unlikely to exceed €1.5 million. The Department has moved from its estimate of €1 million made at the beginning of the year and now states the figure could be between €1 million and under €1.5 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">This reply is nothing but mastery of confusion. Although I asked him not to comment on it, the Taoiseach has referred to the child benefit scheme. This question concerns the early childhood supplement, which resulted from the interest generated and the manner in which the issue was highlighted during the Meath and Kildare by-elections. Although this supplement was meant to have been paid in May, it will not be paid until September. Families at the margins still feel the effect of the serious cost of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The Taoiseach stated that 1,600 children who live abroad were in receipt of this allowance. This is not the case. The scheme is not yet in payment. He has again confused it with the child care benefit scheme which has been in operation for 30 years and which all accept. The Taoiseach made the point that the Department of Social and Family Affairs has not commented upon the costs of this measure. However, I again remind the Taoiseach that in January, he stated it would cost approximately €1 million. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, stated it would cost €2.7 million——</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_286">There is something of a mix-up in this regard and the matter should be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I recall that when the measure was announced, the Taoiseach stated he did not wish to publicise it too much in case others might hear about it and consequently lodge claims. Obviously, they have heard about it. When one announces such a scheme, it exists for the benefit of those for whom it is intended. The Taoiseach stated this scheme was intended to help parents of all nationalities meet the high cost of child care in Ireland. If the Taoiseach wanted to link it to child benefit, he could have done so. However, it was set up as a child care cost payment for the benefit of those with child care costs in Ireland. Nevertheless, it is now payable to children living abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I again ask whether the Taoiseach has an estimate of the numbers of children abroad who will benefit from these child payments, which were intended to defray costs in Ireland? To clarify, I refer to the early childhood supplement and not to the child benefit scheme. I repeat that although the intention was to pay the supplement in May, it will not be paid until September. As Deputy Paul McGrath has pointed out, families on the margins now suffer seriously due to escalated costs.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_290">The scheme will be introduced in August and will be paid for the full period. It would not be a fair answer to the question to simply discuss the early childhood supplement without taking account of developments in child benefit. Members can see the manner in which the figures are rising. I can exclude it, if the Deputy wishes. As the child benefit figures rise and there are more claims from non-residents, the issues will ultimately be linked unless we change the regulations. However, I will accede to Deputy Kenny's request.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I refer to the early childhood supplement only. Based on all estimates and trends, on claims awaiting decision as well as ongoing claims, it is estimated there may be approximately 12,000 non-resident children under the age of six with an entitlement this year. The cost of such payments will be €9.5 million. However, the Department of Social and Family Affairs estimates that only approximately 10% of the claims will be dealt with this year. The actual expenditure in 2006 is unlikely to exceed €1.5 million.</p>

Is the Taoiseach concerned? Does he recognise the mounting concern about the decentralisation programme announced by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy?</p>
          <p eId="para_293">There is widespread concern, including on the Fianna Fáil backbenches. I welcome the support for the position I have repeatedly expressed in this House from so many Fianna Fáil Deputies. I am sure the Taoiseach read about it at the weekend. Perfectly sensible statements were made by Fianna Fáil Members. Such Members are interested in genuine regional balance and are genuinely interested in a decentralisation programme that is thought out, planned and negotiated. They are genuinely concerned about the damage that will be done to the coherence of governance as a result of going ahead with what was a blatant political stroke.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Can the Taoiseach tell the House of a single thing he has done to support his own spatial strategy? Will he explain to the House how the choice of the 53 centres, which were plucked according to the exigencies and requirements of local constituencies, supports the spatial strategy? Does he acknowledge he cannot proceed with the transfer of FÁS staff for the obvious reasons and arguments made outside this House?</p>

          <p eId="para_297">If the Fianna Fáil backbenchers have made such comments publically, one can only assume they have told the Taoiseach privately and at parliamentary party meetings that they have the deepest concern regarding the Taoiseach pushing ahead with what was a calculated political stroke by the former Minister for Finance; that it is incapable of implementation, is damaging to joined-up Government, is uprooting families and is simply unworkable and that it is time to return to the drawing board to come up with a plan capable of implementation and capable of getting the support of those elements of the civil and public service which can easily transfer within the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">I understand that SIPTU contends that this breaches existing contracts of employment. The matter was referred to the Labour Court which made a recommendation last February. The court considered the written and oral submissions by the parties and noted the terms of the company-union industrial relations procedure agreement and said that it was in the opinion of FÁS that it was in breach of the consultation procedures provided for in that agreement. It made no ruling on the substantive issue of the relocation clause. Instead it recommended that the matter be referred back to the appropriate central body, at which level the issue should be teased out with a view to arriving at an agreed long-term solution in consultation with the parties involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Discussions have been held on three occasions under the Labour Relations Commission to see if progress can be made. The last of these meetings concluded this morning. The differences remain between the parties and are being addressed through ongoing dialogue. It would not be helpful at this point for me to get into the details of the elements of the negotiations between FÁS management and trade unions. Naturally I support using the established consultation and dialogue mechanisms and I hope these discussions lead to a resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">On the general points on the other issues, as I have said previously, all these issues must be done through negotiation. Decentralisation is a voluntary programme and it must be done by negotiation. That is the best way of it working through. Some of these programmes have been well advanced. Other ones are a considerable distance behind because there are industrial relations difficulties. As they are different in each case, it is not possible to give a generalised view. Some people have made progress and are moving quickly. With others the uptake is very low and there is very little action.</p>

What does the Taoiseach have to say to the FÁS staff, of which only a small fraction is prepared to transfer? What is it about the probation and welfare service that makes any of the specialised agencies different? Does the Taoiseach acknowledge the finding of the Farrell Grant Sparks report that showed that the cost of replacing staff ranged between €51 million and €65 million? Is it not true that serious damage will be done to the way Government does its business in this small country, with senior civil servants criss-crossing the country merely because it is convenient today to locate the headquarters of a Department to where today's Minister happens to live? We know this will not last for very much longer. Does it mean that we change the headquarters of a Department every time the Minister changes?</p>
          <p eId="para_308">It is not working and I am sure the Taoiseach will get someone to facilitate another interview with him so that he can back down further than he did the last time. As far as I can see, the last climbdown only extended to a tacit admission that the agencies cannot be transferred and that he is pretending that while the rest of it is intact, it will take a longer period. He very well knows that, as currently planned, it is not workable, is damaging to the coherence of Government and is uprooting families.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The Taoiseach told the House to read what Robert Putnam wrote and said that he is very concerned about uprooting communities. He is uprooting families in these circumstances who have put down roots in this city, have children in education, have spouses in other employments — often in the private sector — and he is proposing that they be scattered like Smarties to 53 different centres. That is not decentralisation; it is merely dispersal of civil servants for blatant political purposes.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">I have said this so many times to the Deputy, but I will say it again. The last round of decentralisation was to approximately 20 locations. None of those has changed. The staff moved to those locations, are still there and have all worked very successfully there. It took longer than was envisaged in the early 1990s when we started the process, but they are in those locations, are working and are effective. I said to the Deputy last week, I said this time last year and I said in interviews last June and July — it is on the record — that we were never going to move 10,600 people in a short period and have it done by Christmas. That was going to be impossible, as I said last year and again recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Approximately half those people are already outside Dublin and trying to move to locations nearer their existing homes. The other half are mainly — although not all — young people who want to get out of Dublin. It is approximately 5,000 outside Dublin and 5,000 in Dublin. We already have good examples such as the Marine Institute, whose launch I will attend in one or two weeks' time. It moved to Galway.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">More than 100 people moved and only two did not. That institute is launching successfully in Galway. As I have said, there are problems with the agencies because there is not transferability between them. Some of the staff contend that there should be at lower levels but that arrangement does not exist at present. In the short term, approximately 2,500 civil servants can be moved. It will take a longer period to manage the situation in a way that does not affect the work relationship of any of the services to move to other locations. That has been worked with the Department. The agencies will be a more complex issue because, obviously, if staff do not want to work in an agency, there is a difficulty. That is true in the case of FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Regarding FÁS, the industrial relations machinery must be used to see if a resolution can be found. It is right for the management and unions to see if they can do this within the parameters set down by the Department of Finance which have been well tested through the movement of people to locations such as Letterkenny, Sligo, Limerick, Tipperary and Killarney over the years. It is not new or that extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The figures I have seen show that 2,500 civil servants will move in the period up to 2008. That in no way exaggerates the kinds of figures that moved back in the mid-1990s when there were at least those kinds of figures. I know Deputy Rabbitte previously referred to it as an enormous switch to the whole system, but it is not. Those kinds of numbers moved on previous occasions. Regardless of which Ministers were in place, successive Governments moved on and nobody changed them. Nobody wanted to move and nobody has complained about the service to the public. A process exists and it should be followed.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_321">First of all thank you for speaking up about Australian Prime Minister on his visit to Dublin. Here are some items from his record. John Howard has signed off on the greatest raid of destruction of Tasmania's forests and wildlife; locked innocent refugees — men, women and children — behind razor-wire for years in Australian desert camps; backed Indonesia's military control of West Papua — though 77% of Australians believe West Papuans should be given a vote on self-determination; sent Australian troops to Iraq without the authority of the Australian Parliament and condoned Guantanamo Bay abuse of international law; ramped up uranium exports to boost the global nuclear industry; rejected an apology to Australia's stolen generation of Aborigines; this month's federal budget ignored more than 1 million Australian pensioners while removing all taxes from wealthy retirees' superannuation; and allowed Australia to be labelled the world's worst <i>per capita</i> greenhouse gas emitter among OECD countries pouring huge sums into coal mining while stripping funds from scientists researching solar energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">We know of the Prime Minister's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Has the Taoiseach questioned him about his record?

          <p eId="para_360">Prime Minister, it is a great honour for us, the elected representatives of Dáil Éireann, to have you here today in this House. Since the foundation of the State over 80 years ago, this is the third occasion on which a Prime Minister of Australia has addressed us. A very strong part of our modern relationship is the close friendship between our two parliaments. It was my pleasure to lead an all-party delegation to Australia last year at the invitation of your good friend and former Speaker, Neil Andrew. I was delighted to repay some of that hospitality last year when I welcomed your foreign affairs committee, led by your party colleague, Senator Alan Ferguson.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The first Australian Prime Minister to address this House was Bob Hawke in 1987. It is interesting to read his address at the time. He referred to serious world problems of the time such as the Cold War and apartheid in South Africa. It should encourage us in looking for solutions to the serious issues of today to find that what looked like intractable problems in 1987 were no longer with us a few years later. The changes in Northern Ireland since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 have been phenomenal and we appreciate Australia's support. As the representative of a Border constituency, I acknowledge the contribution of the government and people of Australia to the International Fund for Ireland which has greatly helped reconciliation and social regeneration in Border counties. I hope the Prime Minister will continue to maintain his observer status for the lifetime of the fund. On the Prime Minister's first official visit to this country in October 1977 as Minister for Special Trade Negotiations, total trade between Ireland and Australia amounted to £21.4 million. It now amounts to almost €900 million, a marvellous achievement by any standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Despite the fact that our two countries are on opposite sides of the world, our special relationship has been positively influenced by a shared history and strong political and cultural links. The contemporary links between us are equally remarkable. Our people-to-people contacts continue to go from strength to strength. In 2005 some 150,000 Australians visited Ireland, while 60,000 Irish people visited Australia. The working holiday visa programme has been a huge success. Since its introduction in 1985, an average of 10,000 young Irish men and women, mostly graduates, have spent up to one year in Australia, while 2,000 young Australians have visited Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Irish people at home recognise the important contribution made by the Irish abroad to many countries, including Australia, through the centuries. This recognition is reflected in the Constitution, Article 2 of which was changed in 1998 as a result of the Good Friday Agreement to state: "The Irish nation cherishes its special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share its cultural identity and heritage".</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Today, many Irish people travel to Australia by choice but that was not always the case. In the 19th century many found themselves in Australia after being transported there for political and minor criminal offences. I want to describe one of these Irish people, Charles Gavin Duffy. A typical rebel, he was born in County Monaghan which forms part of my constituency. His remarkable life epitomises the entry of many of his generation into political life in Australia. Before going to Australia, he was editor of the <i>Nation</i> newspaper and in 1852 was elected MP for New Ross, County Wexford. He was tried five times for treason before being deported to Australia in 1855 where he was elected a Member of the Victoria Legislature. He became Minister and then Prime Minister of Victoria. When he thought he could rise no higher, he was appointed Speaker. Members will understand the natural progression involved. His remarkable reason for leaving was that he had found the monotony of the Chair and the tone of the legislative assembly to be uncongenial. I trust the Prime Minister will not find his time with us monotonous or uncongenial.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">I now have the honour of calling on the Prime Minister of Australia, the Honourable Mr. John Howard, MP, to address Dáil Éireann.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's warm welcome. I am conscious of the honour conferred on me and, more importantly, my country in being given the opportunity to address this meeting of Dáil Éireann. As a lover of the parliamentary system and admirer of what it enables us to do in the cut and thrust of parliamentary debate, it is a special privilege to address the parliament of any nation and, in particular, the elected representatives of the people of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">There are precious links between Australia and Ireland. During the years volumes have been written about these links by Irish people and Australians. The Irish have had an immense impact on our national character, politics and, in many respects, the way in which we view the world. The most famous chronicler of the Irish in Australia, Patrick O'Farrell, once wrote that the subject of the Irish in Australia was an impossible one, being too vast, various, complex and, certainly, elusive. I will not attempt to do what he claimed was impossible but must in passing make a few observations about the indelible and everlasting legacy Irish people have bequeathed to my country. That influence includes much of our sentimentality, a significant part of our prized larrikin spirit and a directness and candour in our personal dealings with one another. The Irish have also contributed enormously to our love of language and literature. The way in which Irish authors and poets have instructed us in the wonders of our language is deeply understood and affectionately regarded in Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The Irish in Australia have demonstrated incredible resilience. Those who came directly from Ireland and those of Irish descent were not always treated as fairly as they are in modern Australia. For almost 100 years the Catholic community of Australia which during the period from 1860 to 1960 was overwhelmingly of Irish stock was forced to maintain an independent education system completely from within its own resources and without any government assistance because of a decision taken by various colonial governments in the 19th century to introduce a system they described as free, compulsory and secular. It was not until the 1960s that assistance was first given. The resilience of the community in maintaining its own education system by means of often meagre resources stands as a testament to the determination and resilience of its members.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Today, Australia sees an Irish nation, fully understanding the balance and nature of its history. I warmly acknowledge the decision of the Government to mark the Easter Rising of 1916 with a military parade, just as I acknowledge its decision to honour the thousands of Irishmen who fell in the terrible battles of the Somme in 1916 and Gallipoli. They fell in their thousands alongside the sons of Australia who also fell in their thousands during those terrible battles.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I applaud the progress being made along the long and hard road towards a fair and just settlement in Northern Ireland, in which Australia has been an active helper. We are certainly an interested spectator and greatly admire the co-operative efforts of successive Prime Ministers of Great Britain and Taoisigh of Ireland. We hope for an end to the long and often bloody road towards a fair settlement in Northern Ireland. Much as we feel a sense of nostalgia, feel sentimental and break into laughter about the relationship between our two countries, it is important — as I have done on a number of occasions since I have spoken in Dublin — to not just see it as a relationship nurtured by history and sentiment. It is a contemporary, people-to-people relationship and one of the wonderful aspects is how the young of Australia visit Ireland and the young of Ireland visit Australia in growing numbers. This did not happen a generation ago and both governments applaud it. It is significant that Ireland is the third most frequent user of the Australian young visitor visa programme. Both countries are enjoying significant economic success. I applaud Ireland's extraordinary economic performance over the past two decades and the way in which this country, through a combination of innovative policies, hard work and imagination, lifted its economy from great difficulty to be the fastest growing economy in the European Union. It has enviable low levels of unemployment and boasts a modern, high-tech economy. It can boast exports in areas that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Ireland, in a short period of time has gone from an economy that was sometimes, however unfairly, pitied by its friends, to an economy that is the envy of like nations around the world and in marked contrast to many of the other economies of the European Union and the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Australia is no stranger to economic growth and expansion and Members would be surprised if I came here as Prime Minister of Australia without sharing something of our economic achievements and success. We are in our 15th successive year of economic expansion and Australia enjoys the strongest period of economic growth at any time since the end of the Second World War. This growth is more soundly based than in the past. Although we had levels of economic growth in the 1960s that might have approached what we now enjoy, in the 1960s ours was a closed, inward-looking and protected economy. We had a fixed exchange rate, high tariff walls and an even more highly regulated labour market. We were in every way an inward-looking economy and in many respects an inward-looking nation. Much of that has changed due to successive reforms. I give credit to previous governments for some of those reforms. We have brought about major changes. We have eliminated government debt and have the lowest levels of unemployment for some 30 years. This is a product of continuous economic reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">There is a lesson in this for both Australia and Ireland. In the modern, globalised world there is no turning back to economic isolation and protection. We live forever in a world transformed by communication and globalisation. Countries that have taken advantage of those developments should never turn back. That means Ireland as well as Australia and all countries that see themselves as modern, progressive economies. All of us must embrace more reform and explore new levels of openness. In Australia I frequently compare world economic competition with participating in a foot race to an ever-receding finishing line. Although one never gets there, one keeps trying and cannot slow down lest the other participants in the race overtake. That is the nature of economic competition in the modern world.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">This inevitably brings me in a spirit of candour to the current Doha trade round. The world must not allow this trade round to fail. If it fails, the developing world will feel cheated. It will feel the developed, privileged parts of the world have ignored its interests. Most importantly, if the Doha trade round fails now, it will be many years before an American administration again receives from congress the amplitude of the trade negotiating mandate the Bush administration has and which has led the Americans to make a generous offer on phasing out export subsidies. I respect and understand the difference between Australia and Ireland on this issue. I understand the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy to the Irish people and to the policies of successive Irish Governments. I also understand that unless some progress is made on agricultural reform and subsidies, it will be difficult to make satisfactory progress on the current Doha trade round.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">We live in a world that confronts the scourge and challenge of terrorism. In the fight against terrorism Ireland and Australia are united. None of us, no matter where we live or what attitude we take on individual political and foreign affairs issues, can regard ourselves as immune from terrorism. Irish citizens died in the World Trade Centre. Australian citizens have died in various places as a result of terrorist attack, most memorably and sadly in the Bali attack of October 2002, which claimed some 88 young Australians. As most Australians do at the end of a long football season of various codes, these people were celebrating the joy of mateship and being together in a holiday place that was familiar, friendly, beckoning and welcoming. That is the indiscriminate, lethal and cruel nature of modern terrorism. We all have a responsibility to meet and fight it and there is no single solution. It will need a combination of superb, high-quality intelligence, a strong military response where that is appropriate and justified, and, importantly, a spread of democracy, especially in the Islamic world. In that context it is important to recognise the role of moderate Islamic leaders, who can be a role model to those in their own countries who fight against the intolerance of extreme Islam. I think especially of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia, Australia's nearest neighbour. He is the moderate Islamic leader of the largest Islamic country in the world, and leads a country that in a few years has transformed itself from a military dictatorship to the third-largest democracy in the world. Sometimes the rest of the world does not respect and understand the extraordinary transformation achieved in Indonesia. It is important that leaders such as Mr. Yudhoyono succeed because they are not only democratic, but their example of being successfully democratic can be a powerful antidote to those in their societies who play on the prejudices of people who seek a comfort and resort in extreme manifestations of Islam.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">As countries we have our differences, not only on trade areas. Differences were frankly acknowledged between Australia and Ireland, and Australia and other countries on the military operation in Iraq. It is not my purpose to debate those differences today but it would be a grievous error if, in a democratically elected Chamber, I did not salute the bravery and courage of the Iraqi people who on three occasions voted in circumstances of most fearful physical intimidation. The formation of an all-party government in that country represents a watershed, certainly since March 2003. It offers hope of a better, more secure future for the people of Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I began by referring to the great ties of history, culture and sentiment between the people of Australia and Ireland. When I arrived in Ireland I felt at home, not in a tawdry sentimental sense but in the sense of feeling comfortable and welcome. The ease of discourse I have had with the people of the capital in my few days in Ireland has confirmed my judgment on the nature of the relationship between our two countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Ireland has been an enormous contributor to the modern Australian nation. It has given us gifts and has reminded us of the resonance of our history. Not only is this a relationship steeped in sentiment, nostalgia and history, it enables us to speak with candour and frankness about contemporary challenges despite the miles between us. Good friends are those one can speak to directly, knowing that it will not disturb the warmth of the relationship. I am conscious of the great honour paid to me and the compliment extended to Australia, which will always retain a deep affection for Ireland and Irish people. It will always be grateful for what this wonderful nation has vouchsafed to the people of Australia.</p>

            <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_411">I come from an area of Dublin that has suffered massively over the past few decades from the problem of drugs in society. In Tallaght and across south-west Dublin and surrounding areas, I have seen at first hand the devastation that it wreaks on communities. I have witnessed family, friends and neighbours succumb to its devastating impact. I have attended too many wakes, houses and funerals. I have seen talented and energetic young people turn into the living wrecks that we so often associate, usually without a second thought, with drug addiction. I know that I am very much in a minority in this Chamber when I say that because if I were not, as sure as night follows day, we would have addressed the issue in a more coherent, strategic and planned manner. We would not still be trying to bury our heads in the sand, operating over the heads of the communities most affected by the problem. No longer can we allow the establishment to wash its hands of responsibility for this crisis and formulate policies based on its own fears and obsessions, which do nothing to address the underlying causes of the crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_412">We have tabled this motion because of the gravity of the drugs problem engulfing many communities throughout Ireland. We have made it the theme of our valuable Private Members' time because of our belief that there is an urgent need to act now across a range of Departments, including the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Social and Family Affairs, Health and Children, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We can only tackle the problem if we first admit to its scale, which is of epidemic proportions. Then we must resolve to combine the efforts of those Departments in a systematic and strategic fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_413">It is imperative to raise the drug issue and debate this crisis, which for so long has been ignored by successive Governments. It is impossible to measure how many lives, families and communities have been and continue to be ripped apart by the scourge of drugs. Although problem drug use spans a wide category, from alcohol to opiates, in this debate we will focus on the so-called hard drugs of heroin, cocaine and crack cocaine, which have had a profound and extremely harmful effect on Irish society.</p>
            <p eId="para_414">Governments have reacted inadequately and far too late to the drugs crisis. When communities were forced to mobilise against the rampant heroin epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, the gardaí harassed many of those people instead of pursuing the major drugs traffickers. Communities were marginalised instead of being listened to. If the Government is not to repeat the mistakes of the past, it must realise that communities and their representatives must be involved in the fight against drugs. Let us not delude ourselves, something of which certain people present seem very capable, that we are currently addressing the problem. We are not, we are losing the battle.</p>
            <p eId="para_415">Although many addicts now seek treatment, they must endure unacceptably lengthy waiting lists. That is happening in many areas, although places are available on community-based projects, and it must change. A recent study showed that the majority of heroin addicts receiving methadone treatment were regular users of other drugs, including cocaine. Methadone maintenance, while useful for some, is not the only solution to making people drug free. We must also establish mechanisms to track addicts' progression through the system to enable all stakeholders to make an informed assessment of the success or otherwise of the current approach to tackling drug addiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_416">Ireland is awash with cocaine, whose use is spiralling out of control, with an increase of 1,600% in the quantity smuggled into the country over the last six years. There are approximately 13,000 heroin users in Dublin alone. It is not only a Dublin phenomenon, however. Since the middle of the 1990s, there has been a marked increase in drug-related premature deaths outside the capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_417">It is far from coincidental that while drug use cuts across all social divisions, it is most prevalent in areas of high social deprivation. Without question, poverty and social inequality contribute to drug use. The scourge of drugs will undoubtedly continue unless poverty and inequality are also tackled. Ireland is the second richest country in the EU and one of the richest <i>per capita</i> in the world. However, just under one in five lives in relative poverty and 7% of the population live in consistent poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_418">Surely Ireland is now in a better position than it has ever been, and probably ever will be, to eradicate grinding poverty. RAPID and CLÁR areas, designated areas of high disadvantage, need sustained support to emerge from their current predicament. On the education front, we need early start programmes in all schools in RAPID and CLÁR areas. The Government must improve social welfare payments and increase the minimum wage. It must encourage people to make the transition from welfare to adequately paid employment rather than force them from benefits into low-paid jobs. Incentives and supports must be made available to those who wish to return to education. Providing accessible and affordable child care is also essential.</p>
            <p eId="para_419">There is a growing trend whereby grandparents have had to shoulder the burden of caring for grandchildren, in most cases without State support. The parents of the children concerned are drug users. The abandonment criteria for grandparents to receive benefits must be changed and the financial gap between foster and orphan-guardian allowance narrowed to reflect the financial cost to many carers. The preventative role of the family should be emphasised more. Family support services should be greatly expanded so that they can act as effective buffers to drug problems. In any drug policy, the family must have a prominent role.</p>
            <p eId="para_420">A recent Health Service Executive survey showed that three out of every four Irish people do not have enough information or have the wrong information about drugs. Education should be used as a powerful weapon against the problem use of drugs and it should take place at school, at home and in the community. As 66% of those who have taken drugs did so for the first time while in secondary school, school children must be educated against the dangers of their use. There must be sustained and widespread educational campaigns in all required languages to ensure that everyone has enough knowledge of the harmful effects of drugs. The acceptance of drug misuse and the glamorisation of cocaine must be tackled.</p>
            <p eId="para_421">It is not uncommon for children to look up to drug dealers in their area, who are equipped with fast cars, big money and designer clothes. However, at the end of every deal is an individual jeopardising his or her life, health and future. Major drug dealers must be exposed for what they are — parasites amassing vast wealth at the expense of a person's addiction, a family's safety and a community's future.</p>
            <p eId="para_422">In many communities, drugs are rampant, making it extremely tough for addicts to reject that way of life as they are tempted by unprecedented availability. We must ensure that children and young adults have viable alternatives to hanging around street corners and becoming the prey of drug pushers and their minions. Those alternatives must be interesting, accessible, affordable and local.</p>
            <p eId="para_423">Educational disadvantage has not gone away, while its repercussions for the rest of a young person's life grow greater. There is a general correlation between low educational attainment and drug problems. While nearly 90% of children of higher professionals sit the leaving certificate examination, only 77% of those of semi- and unskilled manual workers do so. That means that 23% of the latter do not sit the leaving certificate and those children are inevitably more likely to be unemployed or in the poverty trap of low-income work, from which it is difficult to escape.</p>
            <p eId="para_424">It is estimated that up to 1,000 pupils fail to make the transition from primary to secondary school each year. What happens to those children? The Government must establish a comprehensive database of primary school pupils to track that transition and monitor those who drop out of school, who are a vulnerable target group. Schools and their environs should be drug-free zones rather than an easy market for unscrupulous dealers. Criminal legislation needs to reflect this.</p>
            <p eId="para_425">There is a certain irony that the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs presides over the housing situation — another crisis. An estimated 5,500 people are homeless. There appears to be a high level of drug use linked with homelessness and emergency hostels are, in many cases, full of drugs. Everyone has the right to a roof over their head and to live in a clean, safe and drug-free environment. People must have a choice and hostels need to reflect this.</p>
            <p eId="para_426">The Government must ensure the roll out of cocaine treatment projects and devise an action plan to prevent the escalation of crack cocaine. Departments must work in conjunction with communities to ensure local and regional task forces receive the necessary funding. There must be a concerted effort to tackle the root causes of why people take drugs.</p>

            <p eId="para_427">"She was sitting up in bed just before I slashed her. I slashed her on the throat two or three times in the bed. I covered her with a pillow so I wouldn't have to look at her face. There was a gurgling noise like she was trying to breathe. There was blood all over my hands." This is the testimony read out in court at the trial of heroin addict who killed his sister. I know this not because I read it in the newspaper or saw it on Sky News but because I sat through this harrowing court case. It was the court case of a constituent but, more importantly, it was the trial of a person who killed a close friend of mine and my family.</p>
            <p eId="para_428">Lisa Bell was killed by her heroin-addicted brother almost five years ago. Her father Pat and myself found her body stuffed in a sleeping bag in a wardrobe in her flat in St. Theresa's Gardens. Evidence at the trial indicated that David Bell had stolen his nephew's Christmas presents, his sister's TV, video and jewellery to feed his chronic addiction. This is what led to the argument that led to David taking a Stanley knife to his sister's throat.</p>
            <p eId="para_429">Can one imagine for just one minute as one contemplates the motion before us the absolute trauma that heroin addiction has caused the Bell family, their friends and their immediate community? This is an experience I never want to witness again and one which I would not wish on anybody. However, this is the reality behind heroin addiction. This is the reality that awaits more of us if we allow crack cocaine to take hold and fail to take decisive action to tackle the problem of drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_430">The Health Research Board estimated in 2003 that the value of the illegal drugs market in this State was €650 million. That included cannabis, heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD. This year it is estimated the cocaine market alone will be worth over €200 million. I believe both figures seriously understate the huge profits drug barons make. I believe the figure is well over €1 billion because the State and the Garda have never acknowledged the full extent of the drugs crisis and the associated crime wave. Gangland crime, including gangland shootings, are intrinsically linked to the increasing market in heroin, cocaine and crack cocaine and also to hash and ecstasy.</p>
            <p eId="para_431">The intimidation of whole communities by the continuing explosion of drug dealing, open drug dealing and the related crime spree has never been effectively tackled. If one looks carefully around most pubs in Dublin today, one will see the open drug dealing or abuse of cocaine, heroin or hash. One will see the drug abusers sniffing, snorting, injecting or smoking in the toilets or sometimes blatantly in full public view. One will see them ringing for their deliveries and dealers' cars pulling up outside to ply their trade. These dealers believe they are untouchable, invincible and the evidence to date shows they are not far wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_432">That cannot be tolerated or go unchecked much longer and if this State is not willing to seriously address this crisis head-on, then the destruction of communities as we saw with the heroin epidemic in the 1980s and early 1990s will be replicated and, as before, communities will have to take to the streets again.</p>
            <p eId="para_433">There is no easy fix and no methadone for cocaine. As with heroin or other addictions, it is costly and time consuming to address the reasons for drug abuse, to tackle the addiction and to rebuild the lives of the addicts, their families, their communities and their victims. In 2001, when faced with a crisis which was not going to kill a solitary soul on this island, the whole apparatus of the State was mobilised to shut down the country. The Garda, customs officials, Department officials and the public were involved in preventing the movement of suspects and stopping the trade. This was all for foot and mouth disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_434">Where are the emergency measures to tackle a trade which has killed hundreds, if not thousands, over the last 30 years? I welcome the large Garda seizures but I believe they are only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the large amount of hard drugs coming in and poisoning the country daily.</p>
            <p eId="para_435">The Garda Síochána could do a lot more to tackle this vile trade. Much of the so-called low level dealing occurs with the full knowledge of gardaí because they give immunity to small scale drug dealers in exchange for information. These are the same drug dealers who threaten neighbours and shoot competitors, bad debtors or anyone who attempts to cross them. These are the invincibles. These scumbags are destroying my country, city, community and my street. The Minister must tackle the large drug barons head on but he must also ensure a parallel operation against the smaller drug dealers, otherwise they will become the replacements for the large drug barons.</p>

            <p eId="para_436">While drug abuse and drug dealing was once a phenomenon almost exclusively associated with large cities and towns, unfortunately this is no longer the case. Many rural towns are experiencing those problems with a worrying number afflicted by heroin abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_437">In my county, while heroin abuse appears not to be a problem, there have been indications of the growing sale and use of cocaine. This would, to a large extent, be due to the conscious efforts of drug gangs operating in the region to build up a market for the drug.</p>
            <p eId="para_438">Apart from the health consequences which the use of cocaine has for those who take the drug, it also has serious implications for the safety of the wider community. There is substantial evidence to prove that cocaine use is a factor in increased violence, often in combination with alcohol abuse. In many rural towns this has certainly led to a marked increase in both the number and seriousness of violent assaults involving people who have taken cocaine.</p>
            <p eId="para_439">The scale of the problem has been indicated by the increase in cocaine seizures in rural areas. I hope this indicates the gardaí are dealing with the problem. I note they claim to have dealt with a number of attempts to establish dealing networks in different parts of the country. The concern must be, however, that the increase in seizures reflects a massive increase in the importation and distribution of cocaine. Only two weeks ago I attended in seminar in west Kerry at which the Garda drug squad admitted its strike rate of success was less than 10%.</p>
            <p eId="para_440">Apart from the prime aim of dealing with the supply of drugs such as cocaine and heroin and ensuring those involved are treated harshly by the courts, it is also necessary to deal with those who are addicted or habitual users of these substances. To a large extent, this must be dealt with by providing young people with viable alternatives in the way of education, employment and leisure. There are many preventative ways in which drug use can be discouraged. There is an onus on every State body to use role models in society who are able to click with young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_441">It is also necessary, however, to provide adequate treatment for those who have become addicted. In this regard, I note the comments of Dr. Pat Troy who has referred to the difficulty of persuading GPs in some areas to treat addicts. He has identified this as one of the obstacles to providing the community-based treatment that he believes is crucial to weaning an addict away from drug dependency.</p>
            <p eId="para_442">Currently there are no methadone clinics in Cork or Limerick which means addicts there must travel to Dublin which obviously makes it more difficult for them to pursue this form of treatment. It is crucial there are locally based treatment centres given that there has been a threefold increase in the number of heroin addicts in the south east, including Carlow, Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and south Tipperary. Some 3,000 people are in receipt of treatment in those areas. It is also the case that there are only 22 detox beds in the State which is shameful.</p>
            <p eId="para_443">While Sinn Féin believes drug dealers must be targeted and severely dealt with, we also recognise the need to treat as well as punish those lower down the scale who may commit petty crime or engage in small scale dealing to support their habit. These individuals are often a major source of anti-social behaviour, petty crime and harassment in their local communities but it may be the case that some can be dealt with in a non-custodial manner. This would not apply to anyone convicted of particularly nasty crimes but as an incentive to young drug users to avail of treatment and to move away from a life of crime. In principle the new drug court can provide a mechanism to address this issue although we are disappointed that it is being confined to Dublin. The idea behind the initiative, whereby addicts who are convicted may purge themselves by completing a rigorous course of treatment and rehabilitation is a good one.</p>
            <p eId="para_444">Those who succeed in passing through such a programme will not only have freed themselves of a dangerous and debilitating addiction, but will cease to be a threat to the community. Certainly, given the statistics regarding recidivism among young addicts sentenced to prison, such a programme ought to be given a chance. We also hope that it may be extended to areas outside Dublin so that drug users in rural communities can be given a chance to redeem themselves within the community, rather than possibly becoming a lost cause in prison where drugs appear to be widely available.</p>

            <from>Ms Harkin</from>
            <p eId="para_445">The scourge of drug-taking and trafficking is one of the major concerns of Irish people. It is also a real threat to the security and health of the nation. The use of drugs, particularly by young people, is at historically high levels. At one time those of us who live in rural Ireland might have considered the drugs problem to be an urban one. If that was ever true it is no longer so.</p>
            <p eId="para_446">Drugs are available in every county, village and town. Nowhere and nobody is safe or off-limits. Individuals, families and whole communities suffer utter devastation. This was highlighted earlier by Deputy Ó Snodaigh's riveting contribution. I support particularly the sections of this motion that call for close co-operation between communities, civil society and all other actors and agencies involved, the Health Service Executive, the Garda, the customs and excise officers, the medical and educational services and others. This is a societal issue and solutions are to be found at societal level.</p>
            <p eId="para_447">This is also a global problem. Solutions must be found at regional, national, EU and international level. Finding a realistic and effective response to this global problem must be a political priority for all countries. At European level we have adopted an EU drugs action plan that respects the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and leaves full scope for local, regional, national and transnational actions. This plan also encourages all actors to examine how these actions can be mutually supportive and contribute to achieving the objectives of an EU drugs strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_448">Co-ordination is crucial to the success of this strategy and at EU level we need to step up and develop law enforcement co-operation between member states and, where appropriate, with Europol, against international organised drug production and trafficking. Joint customs operations, investigations and intelligence gathering and strengthening controls at external borders of the European Union to stem the flow of drugs, play a crucial role in the war against drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_449">Global action complements national and local action and at national level education plays an important role. Having been a teacher for most of my life I know that sometimes society has unrealistic expectations of what schools and education systems can deliver, as if schools, often with limited or no resources, can solve all the ills of society. Schools do not exist in a vacuum and the influence of family, community and media impact on what schools can achieve. Adequately resourced, school-based prevention programmes can and do deliver. We cannot do this on a wing and a prayer and expect teachers to save us from ourselves. Regardless of their good work, schools are only part of our response. We need to set up, develop and improve selective prevention for target groups, and new ways of reaching target groups by using different media and new information technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_450">Drug-driving does not receive adequate consideration. There have been several campaigns against drink-driving which have had some success. We must also target drug-driving. Illicit prescribed and unprescribed drugs affect people's ability to drive and contribute to accidents and fatalities.</p>
            <p eId="para_451">I commend this motion to the House.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_248">
            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_452">The drug problem is getting worse. Teenagers go around freely with cannabis resin in rural areas. It no longer frightens them. They are not afraid of being caught. Maybe when they are caught they feel sorry. It is in every secondary school in rural Ireland. Young people do not seem to be aware of the legal or health consequences of what they are doing but are responding to peer pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_453">The Garda and the schools are doing their best but there is a lack of education. The stigma of being caught is not a deterrent. In rural areas the rise in drug use is inversely proportional to the withdrawal of gardaí. Peer group pressure is strong, there is a lack of education on the effects and use of drugs. We need to concentrate on 14 to 18 year olds who are the main users of the drugs. This cuts across all classes and boundaries in rural areas, without distinction.</p>
            <p eId="para_454">There is no designated rural drug task force in Mayo although we need one and we need education in the schools. The Garda runs a good school programme in national schools which in a welcome development was recently extended to secondary schools. The use of drugs in rural areas is an underground activity and needs to be given higher priority. Education of pupils and adults is the best way of bringing forward the issue. Awareness of the problem will help most of all.</p>
            <p eId="para_455">Good supports are available up to a point in Dublin, where people identify a problem. In rural areas where people think there is no problem there is no proper education. A total of 15% of secondary school children in rural areas regularly use drugs, mainly cannabis. Cocaine, which is too expensive for school children, is available in night clubs. We need mandatory drug testing of drivers. Alcohol can be detected but ecstasy which costs much less is not detected. One can buy a tablet of E for €5, which is said to be the equivalent of drinking eight to ten pints. It gives the user a high for the night. These users may pay high insurance premiums to drive on a provisional licence and high petrol costs but they can get high for the night on one E tablet because E is freely available. They drive around, spend the night at the nightclub on one E tablet and drive home.</p>
            <p eId="para_456">We need to examine this situation. It seems a cheaper option for the user but in the long run it is more expensive than alcohol. People can drive at will under the influence of drugs and they are much more difficult to spot than those driving under the influence of alcohol. Doctors would find it difficult to spot them. We need to consider the education of young people and the mandatory drug testing of drivers.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_249">
            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
            <p eId="para_457">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate because drugs are having a serious effect on society and are being increasingly used. They are available in every town and village. Members have referred to drugs being used in this House so we have not escaped their influence either.</p>
            <p eId="para_458">I recently heard a reformed addict on radio say that he could source drugs within ten to 15 minutes in any town. That is a frightening message. Previous speakers have mentioned several problems. The prices of illegal and legal drugs, such as alcohol, are levelling off making it more attractive for people to use drugs. There was a time when cocaine was for the wealthy only. Now school kids can afford this drug which, like all drugs, is sold without any health warning.</p>
            <p eId="para_459">I am concerned about the role of the media as an opinion maker. I suppose every newspaper is respectable but I recently read an article in a Sunday newspaper which stated that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_460">After five or six pints of beer you are far more out of it, aggressive or dangerous to other people than after a joint or a couple of lines of coke. Yet alcohol is legal. The advice seems to be to go for drugs instead of drink. This is a very dangerous message. The article further states that even with a hangover and the come-down, the thrill of the night before is worth it to the weekend cocaine dabbler. There is no reference to the word "addict" and the use of the word "dabbler" is almost an endorsement of use as an acceptable weekend activity. Warnings about misuse of drugs and the threat of the law do not seem relevant. The writer of the article questions whether it is really so terrible and whether they are really doing any harm to themselves. This article sends out very dangerous signals. I wondered when I read this article whether I was out of touch. I take a few pints but I certainly do not take cocaine and I am not responsible for cocaine being found in the toilets in this building. This article gives a signal that it is all right to use drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_461">Persons caught using a line of cocaine should be offered whistleblower's rights. They should be offered the option of pointing the finger at the supplier. They should be exonerated.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_250">
            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_462">The motion is commendable and on the face of it there should not be anything in it with which anyone in the House could take issue, but such is the knee-jerk nature of our politics that the Government has seen fit to table an amendment to the motion commending itself and indicating that it is doing all it can with regard to this problem. This is an attitude of whistling past the graveyard that ill suits the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_463">The motion makes only one reference to the actions of the Government and it is a very mild criticism of the effectiveness of Government policy. The motion calls on the Government to acknowledge the many shortfalls in the implementation of policy and to recommit itself to the overall strategic objective of the national drugs strategy 2001-08. It is not too much of a step down for any Government to admit that a policy may not be working as well as it could be. In the past week alone, the Taoiseach has stated that the decentralisation programme will not achieve what the Government originally hoped. If the Government is prepared to make statements of that nature about a policy such as decentralisation, why can it not do so about an issue of much wider significance which affects the lives and health of so many citizens? On those grounds I am very disappointed that the Government has seen fit to table an amendment to this motion.</p>
            <p eId="para_464">The Government amendment is in the name of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs whose Department has responsibility for the national drugs strategy. However, the amendment only refers to one person, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who has responsibility for drugs issues, and he is present in the Chamber this evening. If I were the Minister of State I would be very afraid of that reference because it seems to be a bit like the chairman of the football club giving a vote of confidence in his manager. The Minister of State is taking the flak for the failures of the policies of the Government and Department. This is unfair because I acknowledge the Minister of State has a personal commitment to sorting out a series of problems that many of us will readily admit are intractable.</p>
            <p eId="para_465">The scope of this motion shows how complicated this issue is and the question is whether it is a justice, resources or health issue. The Green Party is of the view that this issue has arisen as a result of the current culture. Double standards apply to the use of any drug, legal or illegal, and there is a celebration by society of some drug use. This attitude sends out a mixed message to many young people who decide that if it is all right for State sources and adult authority figures to endorse a particular mode of behaviour, they are prepared to go down another route and experiment by using and abusing drugs. Their lives take a turn into dark alleys by their making those choices.</p>
            <p eId="para_466">The Government chose not to bring legislation to this House to allow for regulation in the area of the advertising of alcohol products. The Government instead chose self-regulation. If one takes alcohol out of that equation and replaces it with cocaine or heroin and the Government informed those involved in that industry — it is an industry — that Government policy favoured self-regulation, this would be an indication of the level of double standards being applied towards any type of abuse of any type of drug. Until we are prepared to tackle those double standards, this debate will have painful consequences for all concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_467">There is extensive public concern about the existence of a drugs economy and a drugs society. I refer to the paraphernalia that attaches to this culture and the use of violence and deadly weapons to enforce that violence. The Government must adopt some form of weighing scales approach to our policy regarding people who come out of the shadows and practise these dark arts. They are allowed to operate because the Government has made the choice that this is overwhelmingly a justice rather than a health issue. It is taking a military approach to this issue rather than a community resource approach. Until the Government and the people who make statements on behalf of the Government, who seem to thrive on the whole idea of derring-do, change course, this problem will only intensify and worsen for many in our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_468">I hope this is a message which the Minister of State will be prepared to take to some of the Cabinet members because they seem to think that this is a problem that can be solved by the hard man approach, so to speak. I do not believe this approach will work. It is also indicative that those who use and abuse drugs are untouchable and the areas in which they live are no-go communities. It is as if we have drawn metaphorical lines of barbed wire around people and communities instead of engaging and tacking the root causes and problems which these people and their communities face daily. We regard it as a problem that can be tackled in isolation, but this is not so. We have spent decades trying to deal with this type of problem in isolation. The only effect has been that the isolation of the areas concerned has become deeper and the problem has expanded throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_469">It is not rocket science to understand that the policies are not working. The Minister of State has a strong personal commitment in this area and he would like to see solutions. It may be that the five-year term of a Government, or even less in some instances, does not allow for an individual politician or Government to bring about those solutions. However, small steps to challenge the nature of the culture of double standards could be taken. We fail to treat people for the nature of the condition preferring instead to treat them as some kind of stain on society. The Government adopts an approach that its war on drugs can be measured by the amount of drugs seized, on which the law enforcement agencies are to be commended, but we all know it is the tip of the iceberg approach. The more drugs that are seized, the more drugs that exist in society. This is a failure on the part of society. The Government's strongest measure challenging the drugs culture in the past year has been the banning of magic mushrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_470">Young people looking for escape choose to use everyday products such as solvents and legal substances such as alcohol and they are venturing into the use of illegal substances. Many people finish up with cocaine and heroin addiction. This is a route that has been chosen for them because of a degree of indifference that the system and the Government is responsible for through its lack of political leadership.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">My hope is that a motion of this type will spur a change of thinking so that in future we will not have the knee-jerk reactions of a Government amendment defending itself and that instead we will have a proper engagement, dealing with this issue in a way that it can and must be dealt with. It is a challenge for all of us within the political system, Government and Opposition, those who are in government and those who will be. It requires a long-term approach to a problem that we have only made worse by fiddling around the edges.</p>

            <p eId="para_484">—

supports the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, in his wholehearted commitment to, and successful handling of, the Government's drive against the problems of drug misuse in our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_485">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the House on the Government's response to the problems of drug misuse. Tackling drug misuse is an international issue and it is obviously not an easy task. The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime estimated that the value of the global illicit drug market for 2003 was over $429 billion. It has been claimed that, after oil and arms, the illegal drug market is the third most profitable in the world. The key drivers of the market include both economic factors and the attitude of societies towards illicit drug consumption.</p>
            <p eId="para_486">The economics of drug trafficking make it a particularly attractive activity for criminal organisations. The Celtic tiger phenomenon has both increased the attractiveness of Ireland as a market for those involved in the drugs trade as well as increasing the demand among our citizens. Globalisation has caused international trade in goods and services to increase exponentially over the past decade making it easier for criminal networks to conceal illicit commodities, including drugs, within legitimate freight. As a small open economy, Ireland is particularly vulnerable. The sheer scale of the challenges posed can be demonstrated by the fact that in 2004 an estimated 20.3 million passengers passed through the State's principal airports. Similarly in 2004, approximately 336,000 vehicles and 23.5 million tonnes of freight passed through the eight principal ports, the latter figure representing almost four tonnes of freight for every citizen of this State. That shows the difficulties that exist for the law enforcement agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_487">The use of drugs, particularly strongly addictive substances such as heroin and cocaine, has numerous social and economic costs. Costs such as drug related deaths, blood borne disease and other health consequences, are only part of the picture. The costs of drug misuse affect the individual, the family, the community and the State. No country has overcome the drugs problem. Neither the relatively heavy-handed approach in the United States nor the softer touch of the Netherlands has resulted in a drug-free population. There are no fully tested models to use and there are no quick and easy answers. However, Ireland's national drugs strategy, which runs until 2008, demonstrates the Government's commitment to address drug misuse in a proactive and decisive manner. The strategy's balanced and complementary focus on disrupting the operation of the drug market, reducing drug-related harm and helping those most in need, continues to be objectively valid.</p>
            <p eId="para_488">There are encouraging signs of progress over the past couple of years in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion of treatment services and prevention programmes in schools. The landscape has changed very significantly in recent years and we must all acknowledge the work that is being done and the progress that is being made.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_490">It is vital we recognise that the drugs problem is a volatile and changing one and that our policies need to be flexible to meet that change. It is also important to recognise that the progress made in the last few years has come about through a process of co-operation and partnership. We must focus on the fact that working together in a united way is far more beneficial than utilising a fragmented approach, especially when dealing with a problem as pervasive as drugs in our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_491">I will give the House some information on the structure, with which Members will be familiar. There are a number of elements to the Government's approach to tackling drug misuse. The national drugs strategy addresses the problem of drug misuse across a number of pillars — supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research — and implementation of the strategy across a range of Departments and agencies is co-ordinated by my officials in the drugs strategy unit of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_492">We launched the strategy in 2001, having recognised that we needed to address the issue of drug misuse across all the agencies and Departments, not just through one Department or agency. It has been apparent that the way to do it was to work in partnership with all the agencies, Departments and community groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_493">We have made considerable progress in implementing the 100 actions, which we set out in the national drugs strategy. This is borne out by the review of the strategy, which was published last year. The review process included a comprehensive public consultation process, where we engaged with, and listened to, communities on the ground. That included a number of meetings I attended around the country and in this city.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">The mid-term review of the strategy was overseen by a steering group, chaired by my Department and comprised representatives from the relevant Departments and agencies as well as from the community and voluntary sectors. The review sought to assess the impact and direction of the strategy at its mid-point stage. It concentrated on identifying beneficial adjustments to the existing strategy and highlighting priorities for the second phase up to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">The steering group found that the current aims and objectives of the strategy were fundamentally sound and that there were encouraging signs of progress since 2001 when it was first launched which suggests that our current approach to tackling the drug problem is proving to be effective. I am not suggesting that all is perfect and accept there is no room for complacency. The review highlighted the need to refocus priorities and accelerate the roll-out and implementation of various key actions in the remaining period of the strategy up to 2008. The changes recommended will strengthen the strategy and enable it to better deliver its aims.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">Rehabilitation emerged as an important issue during the consultation process. It was felt by many that, although there have been significant improvements in treatment provision, much more work is needed with regard to rehabilitation. In this regard, a working group was established last September, chaired by the Department, to develop an integrated rehabilitation provision as the fifth pillar of the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_497">The working group includes representatives from a range of Departments and agencies as well as the community and voluntary sectors. It is expected to finalise its recommendations by mid-summer and that it will report to the interdepartmental group on drugs and to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion at that stage. Among the bodies involved in dealing with the problem of drugs misuse is the national drugs strategy team, NDST. This is an interdepartmental team involving Departments and agencies operating in the drugs field with representation from the community and voluntary sectors and it plays a vital role in overseeing the work of the local and regional drugs task forces, LDTFs. The LDTFs were established by the Government in 1997 in the areas worst affected by drugs. Twelve of the 14 LDTFs are located in Dublin, one in Bray and one in Cork. Membership of the LDTFs includes representatives of all the relevant agencies such as the Health Service Executive, the Garda Síochána, the probation and welfare service, the relevant local authority, elected public representatives, the youth service, FÁS, voluntary agencies and community representatives. The task forces prepare local action plans which include a range of measures for treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply. In addition, they provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of services in these areas while, at the same time, allowing local communities and voluntary organisations to participate in the planning, design and delivery of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_498">The LDTFs have played a very important role in recent years in tackling the drug problem. They continue to be key players in dealing with the problem in the worst affected parts of the city and country. Many services and facilities have been established over the past nine years. More than €125 million has been allocated to support the work of the 14 LDTFs and this year expenditure on LDTF projects is €16 million. There are approximately 450 community-based projects, employing more than 300 staff and delivering services such as advice and support to drug misusers and their families in the worst affected areas. The focus of the LDTF plans is on the development of community-based initiatives that will link in with and add value to the programmes and services already being delivered or planned by the statutory agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_499">Last year we set up an emerging needs fund to facilitate a flexible and timely response to changing needs in regard to drug misuse in local drugs task force areas. Some 54 projects have been approved to date and funding of more than €3 million has been provided for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">We have also introduced a premises initiative fund which looks after the provision of accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects. Approximately 60 projects have been helped and almost €14 million has been allocated to the fund. The initiative will be extended to the regional drugs task force areas for the accommodation needs of community-based projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_501">The success of the local drugs task forces can largely be attributed to the positive and active involvement of local communities. I look forward to the same active involvement from communities in the implementation of the regional drugs task force plans. Ten regional drugs task forces have been set up and they cover all parts of the country outside the 14 LDTF areas, further proof that we are delivering on the commitments of the programme for Government. There are regional drugs task forces in all areas. Deputy Cowley said there was not one in Mayo, but there is. Every part of the country is covered by a local or regional drugs task force.</p>
            <p eId="para_502">Last year when the regional drugs task forces submitted their plans, l approved an initial annual sanction of €5 million for them. l envisage that funding will be increased on an incremental basis over the coming years to achieve the full roll-out of the plans, which are estimated to cost approximately €12 million. Until now, interim co-ordinators have been working on these task forces, but they are now being replaced by full-time appointees. It is expected that all ten full-time co-ordinators will be in place within the next month. The RDTFs have started to implement a range of drugs programmes in communities and l expect these will accelerate as the full-time co-ordinators come on board.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">Drug misuse is a complex issue and is not confined to urban areas or to just one region of the State. I accept that and that the problem has spread. The illicit drug market can be seen as having three interrelated levels: the global market, which incorporates drug production and international trafficking; the importation and distribution of drugs at a national level; and the local drugs market, which is basically the drug dealer who supplies to the individual. If we can disrupt the supply in the top two levels, we can prevent drugs ever reaching the individual. This is the reason the work of the Garda Síochána and the customs and excise is so important. They have achieved considerable success, although they have not managed to stop supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">The drugs strategy specifies a number of challenging supply reduction targets for the Garda Síochána. In terms of drug seizures, these targets are being met. Garda strategies for dealing with drug offences are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs. The strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs, conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered, and working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction, to address problems from a national and international aspect.</p>
            <p eId="para_505">The success of Garda operations has resulted in significant drug seizures. In 2002, the value of seizures amounted to €49 million and this increased €132 million in 2004. The upward trend continues. People will say that more is getting through, which may be true, but gardaí are working hard and doing their best to stop drugs at all levels. The Garda community policing initiatives are proving successful in the push against drug misuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_506">Customs and excise seized almost €200 million worth of illegal drugs in the past six years. No doubt such success will continue, especially as a result of the recent acquisition of a mobile X-ray scanner which can scan full 40-foot containers. This will aid drug detection and do a similar job to a scanner at an airport. Drug seizures are one of the many encouraging signs of progress and of the good work being done by customs and excise and the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">The Department has also invested in facilities and services through the young people's facilities and services fund which is aimed at diverting young people away from drug misuse. The fund was established seven or eight years ago and is used for the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The main aim of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. We target young people in the age range of ten to 21 years who are defined as being at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">To date, the main focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas where integrated plans were prepared on the basis of detailed guidelines agreed by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. In addition to these areas in Dublin, Bray and Cork city, funding was allocated to four other urban areas — Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow. Until recently these areas only had services, but we have allocated capital funding to Waterford and Carlow and may extend this to Galway and Limerick. Funding was also provided to a number of voluntary organisations with a national or regional remit with the capacity to deliver targeted education and prevention initiatives. Approximately 450 facility and services projects now exist, with approximately 300 employees being supported under the fund. To date, more than €100 million has been allocated from the fund for the development of youth facilities and these have been very successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_509">The main focus of the national drugs strategy in respect of the educational sector is on preventative strategies targeting primary and secondary level as well as the informal education sector, including youth services. Our children are now being educated on the dangers of drugs through the social, personal and health education programme, which is compulsory in all primary and post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_510">We also have a national drugs awareness campaign. The four phases of the national drugs awareness campaign which have been pursued to date have been aimed at the population in general and at certain groups such as parents, cocaine users and cannabis users. A number of data sources, including drug treatment data, law enforcement data and official survey data at national level, are used to determine the extent of drug use in society. These data sources have recorded increases in the incidence of cocaine use in Ireland, albeit from an initial low base, in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_511">A joint drug prevalence survey was undertaken by the national advisory committee on drugs, which acts under the remit of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in partnership with the Northern Ireland drugs and alcohol information and research unit. The survey is seen as providing the most reliable baseline data on drug prevalence in Ireland. The cocaine-specific data from the study, which I launched in January, are based on a survey of 8,442 people aged between 15 and 64 between October 2002 and April 2003. The survey found that just over 3% of the population had used cocaine at some time. One could argue that the information is three years old and that the situation might have deteriorated since then. It was the first time that detailed baseline information on issues such as the regular use of cocaine was available at a population level.</p>
            <p eId="para_512">The survey asked whether people had ever used cocaine, whether they were regular users of it, why they decided to quit its use and how and where it was obtained. It also gathered attitudinal information about cocaine use. Its findings confirmed that cocaine is becoming a drug of choice for many young people. It has probably always been available, but it was more likely to be used by professional people in the past. The use of cocaine has spread to the extent that it is now a drug of choice for many young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_513">I understand that the survey I mentioned, when compared with similar comprehensive population surveys in other European countries, found that the level of cocaine use in Ireland is roughly average or perhaps slightly higher than average. The national advisory committee on drugs is seeking expressions of interest for tendering for a second drugs prevalence survey. With the baseline figures which are already available, the new survey will allow us to measure the changes in the use of various illicit drugs in the past few years. One often encounters bits of surveys, but the survey I have mentioned was very detailed. Approximately 8,500 people were interviewed in their homes for between 30 and 45 minutes. The survey, which went into great depth, is seen as the authoritative baseline study. When the second study has been completed, we will be able to track the changes which have taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_514">With the prevalence survey, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and I are actively involved in co-operating with our colleagues in Northern Ireland at meetings of the misuse of drugs sector of the British-Irish Council. The council, which is a forum for the exchange of information and best practice, was established under the Good Friday Agreement. The members of the council include the British and Irish Governments, the devolved institutions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the assemblies of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man. Each jurisdiction takes the lead on one of eight topics. Ireland takes the lead on the issue of drugs through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Regular meetings of senior officials take place on specific drugs related themes. Each meeting is attended by national experts in the particular area under discussion, thereby facilitating the exchange of views and allowing members to network with their colleagues in member administrations. Four senior level meetings are scheduled to take place this year on the commissioning of drugs treatment services, the confiscation of drugs related criminal assets, the rehabilitation of drug misusers and the use of subutex as a possible treatment for opiate misusers. Ministerial level meetings are usually held once a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_515">The Health Service Executive has made significant strides in the provision of treatment services, such as prevention services and hospital and residential care services, if required. Specialist services, including needle exchange, detoxification and relapse prevention are provided for people with specific needs. More than 8,000 heroin misusers are receiving methadone treatment, which is more than twice as many as seven or eight years ago. The national advisory committee on drugs estimates that the number of heroin users has started to fall in Dublin and has stabilised at relatively low levels elsewhere. Capital expenditure in the past seven or eight years has resulted in the provision of 47 addiction clinics. The HSE employs more than 730 people in addiction services, in addition to the 300 people who are employed in local drugs task forces and the more than 300 people who are employed in the young people's fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_516">The extraordinary investment that has been made means that between 600 and 650 people are working in projects which started at community level. Those who always say that more investment could be made should bear in mind that more than 700 people are employed by the HSE and between 600 and 650 people are employed in projects which started at local drugs task force level. A substantial investment is being made and a great deal of good work is being done.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">No substitution treatment drug is available to treat cocaine misuse. Existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available. It should be noted that the health authorities have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in recent times. In 2005, I launched four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treating cocaine use, as well as a training initiative focusing on frontline workers, many of whom were originally dealing with heroin users. It is important to upskill the staff as circumstances change so they can deal with new situations. Funding was provided by the Department to support these initiatives. The four projects deal with intravenous cocaine users, poly-drug users who use cocaine, intranasal cocaine users and problematic female cocaine users. Consultants have been engaged to conduct an evaluation of the pilot projects. This work has commenced and it is expected that a preliminary report will be available in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_518">I am aware that Deputy Crowe has submitted parliamentary questions about a project in Tallaght. That project will continue to receive funding until its evaluation has been completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_527">This commitment is made clear by the Government's financial investment in the area, through the Vote of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The allocation for drugs initiatives was just under €27 million in 2004, but it was increased by 18% to just over €31 million in 2005. This year's Revised Estimates Volume provides €43 million in this area, which represents an increase of 37% on the allocation for last year and an increase of approximately 60% on the allocation that was made two years ago. One will not find many Votes in many Departments in which there has been such a high increase in investment. I reiterate the Government's commitment to playing its part in the efforts against drug misuse. Tackling the drug problem is a key priority for the Government and will continue to be so. The evidence of the Government's commitment in this regard is the extent of the resources it is investing in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_528">I note the motion which has been tabled. It has provided Members with the opportunity to debate the issue. However, I commend the amendment to the House.

            <p eId="para_560">The figures go across the board. Members do not require reports in this regard and know from personal experience that Ireland has an enormous drugs problem. There is no point in burying one's head in the sand. Parents are afraid, children are dying and people are getting hurt. Some day perhaps, Members will have a proper debate in the House that will deal with the facts. While all Members wish to ameliorate the problem, they cannot continually listen to the recitation of a range of initiatives that are not being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">The review stated that progress has been made in implementing some strategies and in launching some programmes. However, as far as the strategy's overall aim of reducing the number of people on drugs is concerned, it is failing. Regardless of what initiatives have been launched or what sums of money have been spent, more people are on drugs now than when it started. That constitutes failure. One should abandon the self-congratulatory myth that Ireland is doing well as it is far from doing so.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">I compliment the Minister of State for the increase in expenditure. However, the level of drugs misuse and the numbers of people on drugs have also increased. Hence, we must increase expenditure rapidly. Those who make millions from drugs every week will not be stymied by an expenditure of less than 10% of their profits. Members must wake up to that. Their financial resources must be matched and war must be declared on them. They must be tackled head on.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">The Minister of State noted that at present, 8,000 people are on methadone. This constitutes a doubling of the figures and is viewed as a positive step. How many people have come off methadone? Can that be re-evaluated? While it is good to wean people from heroin, should they not also be weaned away from methadone? It is a failure if most of the 8,000 people on methadone programmes turn out to be those who started on them in the beginning. How many people on methadone live to be 60, 70 or 80? That speaks for itself.</p>

            <p eId="para_566">I refer to the lack of urgency. While I do not have time to go into all the facts and figures, the Government's sense of urgency and commitment to tackling this problem is missing. People have been obliged to wait for 19 months to receive methadone treatment. We have 30 treatment beds for those who wish to get off drugs completely. Although the Sinn Féin Members mentioned 22 beds, I will increase their figures slightly to 30 beds. A total of 30 beds with which to get people off drugs is not good enough and hardly constitutes a success.</p>

            <p eId="para_567">What about the residential centres?</p>

          <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_284">
            <from>Mr. English</from>
            <p eId="para_568">The Minister mentioned residential centres. The people involved must beg for money. Every week, those people who try to do something useful must engage in fund raising. All voluntary groups must beg for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_569">This problem must be tackled seriously. The proceeds from the Criminal Assets Bureau should be ring-fenced and spent in this area. It should be spent on prevention programmes and schemes to give people a chance to stay off drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">As for community policing, proper gardaí are required. Every Garda station must have a number of gardaí specifically allocated to tackling drug abuse. I am tired of hearing from residents that although the drug dealers are known, the Garda cannot tackle them. Although everyone seems to know who is involved, no one wishes to tackle the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">It has been noted that rehabilitation will become the drugs strategy's fifth pillar. However, families must become involved in the treatment and addicts must be given a chance to get off drugs completely, to return to society and to get a job. We must greatly increase our expenditure on education and in community facilities to give young people a chance.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">This is not happening at present. The money set aside for the regional drugs task force is approximately €200,000 per county. As I stated last week, such a sum will not deliver much. It will not deliver effective youth programmes and will only employ one or two staff in an office. It will not achieve results. The Minister of State said €5 million has been allocated to the regional drugs task forces of which, half way through the year, 13% to 20% has been spent. A sum of €5 million out of potential expenditure of €12.2 million is far from what must be spent to achieve results. While I accept it cannot be spent in a single year, this problem is far from resolution. One should face facts. If the Minister of State deals in facts, Members will work with him.</p>

            <p eId="para_574">Tá lúcháir orm deis a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá maidir leis an ábhar tábhachtach seo. Ceann de na fadhbanna sóisialta is mó atá againn sa tír i láthair na huaire ná mí-úsáid drugaí agus achan rud a chothaíonn sí i measc gach páirt den phobal — brúidiúlacht, dúnmharfóirí agus mar sin de. Níl aon pháirt den tír nach bhfuil an fhadhb sin ann.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">Tonight's motion is very important. It urges the Government to sit up, take notice and realise that Ireland's problem with drug misuse is worsening and is spiralling out of control. The Government and the Minister of State would rather tell us that we are making progress in the fight against drugs. The reality is very different. Our young people, our parents and our communities could easily tell the Minister that the situation is different. They could tell us that drugs have never been more affordable, more easily available and more widespread at any time in our history.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">Since it took office in 1997, the Government has failed to get a grasp on this problem. Drugs were once mainly a problem in highly urbanised and disadvantaged areas, particularly in our capital city. This is no longer the case. Drugs, of all varieties, are now widely available throughout every village, community and estate in Ireland. This has occurred during the Government's watch. The Government has stepped back from its responsibility to tackle our national drugs crisis. This approach, or lack of action, in dealing with our drugs problem on the part of the present Government, contrasts markedly with that taken by the rainbow Government when it was in power.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">Between 1994 and 1997 the rainbow Government was the first Government in the history of the State to treat the drugs problem seriously. It launched two particularly significant initiatives in this regard. One was the establishment of the national drugs strategy, which in turn led to the setting up of the local drugs task forces. The other was the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau which allowed the State for the first time to seize the cash and assets of the crime barons. While the Criminal Assets Bureau did not solve the drugs problem, there is no doubt that the problem would be far worse without it.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">The Government has not shown a similar level of commitment to dealing with drug abuse. If anything, it has allowed the situation to slip back into the bad old days of increased violent gangland activity, as well as spiralling levels of drug dealing and misuse on our streets.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">Even since the beginning of this year, we have seen shocking levels of murder and violence on our streets, all of which is related to the burgeoning drugs trade. Criminal gangs are openly killing each other on our streets in their war to gain control of the drugs trade. The public shrugs its shoulders at each new gangland killing and our under-resourced security forces feel increasingly helpless at their inability to make an impact on or to end the drug culture developing on our streets.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">The lack of treatment places for heroin misusers outside of Dublin is a serious issue and has reached crisis. A response to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague Deputy English recently revealed that in one part of the country, addicts seeking a place on a methadone maintenance programme were obliged to wait for one year and seven months. This is disgraceful. Today I read a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the number of heroin addicts in the south east Health Service Executive area had trebled in 2005 compared with 2004. The picture is the same throughout the country and the sad reality is that we do not have the treatment services to deal with a problem of this scale. The Government has sat back and allowed the drug problem to escalate because it is not prepared to put in place the structures necessary to meet the challenges presented by growing drug abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">I call on the Minister of State and his Cabinet colleagues to get their heads out of the sand and give this problem the commitment it deserves. We need political leadership to deal with the problem. The Minister of State simply chooses to ignore that we have a problem. He would rather insist that we are making progress when it is clear we are moving backwards. The problem will only be tackled by committing the resources to our police force, to our treatment and prevention services and to our communities at the coalface of the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">The Government's paralysis in tackling drug misuse creates the impression that Ireland is soft on drugs, which is sending out the wrong message. It is undermining efforts to curb drug misuse. I urge the Minister of State and his Government colleagues to take the extent of our drugs problem seriously. We need to introduce measures immediately which make it clear to all that we will not tolerate drug dealing at any level in society and that the supports needed by misusers, their families and their communities are available to allow them overcome their addiction. If we fail to do so the drug barons will continue to hold our justice system to ransom and destroy the lives of our young and their families.</p>

            <from>Mr. Neville</from>
            <p eId="para_583">I wish to deal with the issue of drugs and suicide. It is internationally accepted that drug misuse has a serious role in suicide. Drug addicts have a higher level of suicide and are more likely to be in prison or homeless than is average in the community. I have been unable to find research in Ireland on the number of drug addicts who have completed suicide. I will deal with a specific drug and its effect on suicide, namely alcohol. Alcohol plays a key role in suicide. The drug alcohol is as lethal in terms of suicide as any other drug. During the 1990s Ireland experienced a 41% increase in alcohol consumption and suicide rates increased by 44%, showing almost 100% correlation.</p>
            <p eId="para_584">The effect of alcohol consumption on the adolescent and young adult brain causes an even greater depletion in important mood-stabilising neurotransmitters than occurs in a mature adult brain. A high level of alcohol consumption as might occur in a drinking spree can induce a significantly depressed mood state over the subsequent eight to 12-hour period. Research has shown that binge drinking is particularly associated with suicidal acts with the relative risk of suicide increasing tenfold for men and women relative to those of a similar baseline mood state who were not binge drinking. Liberal licensing laws and a lax regulatory environment contribute further to the problem. States with laws that set the minimum legal age for drinking at 21 years, such as the US, have lower youth suicide rates than states where the legal drinking age is 18.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">Aggressive marketing, political lobbying by the drinks industry and the increase in disposable income has enabled the opportunity of spending money on alcohol with its well described depressant effect on mood and the increase in distorted judgment and impulsivity in its wake. Notwithstanding the number of people employed in the drinks industry and the huge excise paid on alcohol, the Government's failure to implement the report of the national task force on alcohol has a serious negative impact on suicide prevention.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">It has been reported by general practitioners that 20% of their patients who died by suicide had a history of problem alcohol use, while psychiatrists reported 27% of their patients lost to suicide had a history of alcohol abuse. Only 46% of those were known to have attended for alcohol counselling.</p>
            <p eId="para_587">A recent study carried out on unnatural deaths in 2001 and 2002 in Counties Louth, Meath and Cavan found that 93% of young men aged less than 30 years who had ended their lives had alcohol in their system, with 58% of them having a blood-alcohol level of greater than 160 mg/dl and 25% having a blood-alcohol level of greater than 240 mg/dl. By comparison, no man over 30 years lost to suicide had the same level of alcohol consumed, which indicates that this is a key issue for younger people. A six-year study carried out by the County Louth coroner published in January 2006 revealed that 48% of the 47 people who died by suicide in his area of inquiry had consumed alcohol prior to ending their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_588">I ask the Minister of State to deal with the area of research into the effect of drugs on suicide which is known to be an issue internationally. We have figures for the effect of alcohol which are very serious especially for those under 30.</p>

          <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_288">
            <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_589">Clearly the Government is sleepwalking its way through a drugs epidemic. Cocaine is the example that is currently mentioned. Its use has become increasingly widespread. A reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Stagg indicated that the figures have increased each year. In 2001, 5.3 kg was seized by the Garda with a value of €371,000; in 2002, 31 kg was seized with a value of €2.2 million; in 2003, 107 kg was seized with a value of €7.5 million; in 2004, 167 kg was seized with a value of €11 million; and in 2005, 242 kg was seized with a value of €16 million. The Government seems to be helpless in addressing the problem of this very addictive drug which now apparently affects 3% of the population.</p>
            <p eId="para_590">Another drug, methamphetamine, is regarded as potentially even more dangerous than heroin. However, no extra resources have been committed to the Garda Síochána to deal with that problem. As Deputy English mentioned heroin addicts who wish to enter a rehabilitation programme must wait up to 19 months before being admitted to a methadone clinic. The Government promised the resources to deal with the problem. Above all we are experiencing the consequences of the Government not providing the Garda with the additional resources that were clearly promised before the last general election and in the programme for Government. We do not have the additional gardaí and the strength of the force is still less than 12,000. It does not have the equipment it was promised and the Government is solely responsible for the consequences of not providing those resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has talked big about drugs in prisons and acted very small. Under the regime of that Minister, prisons have become breeding grounds for new drug users. One of the most alarming aspects is the prevalence of drugs in prisons. The Minister has made great claims that he had addressed the issue and yet the problem of drug supply has increased each year since he became Minister. Instead of eliminating drugs from prisons, they have become crime universities. Studies have shown that between 19% and 21% of users of intravenous drugs began injecting heroin in prison. The programme for Government — the foolish document that was launched some years ago — promised a plan to completely end all heroin use in prisons by the end of 2002 in tandem with compulsory drug testing. Needless to say neither goal has been realised, which is to be expected from the Government in light of its performance, or lack of it, in so many areas at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">Talk about minimum mandatory sentences will not solve the problem. We have ended up with courts imposing sentences that are neither minimum nor mandatory. Talking about minimum sentences will not frighten the crooks. They know perfectly well that these sentences the Minister and his colleagues talk about are neither minimum nor mandatory. Ultimately these people go to jail. The day they enter jail, they receive 25% remission when they sign in. Has the Minister ever considered not giving them remission until they earn it through good behaviour, participation in rehabilitation programmes and ensuring they do not become involved in drug use? Such fresh thinking is needed but it will not be provided by the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_593">Why was no additional allocation provided for frontline organisations responding to violence against women in the 2006 budget and Finance Act? Frontline services are trying to operate with the same funding they were allocated in 2002. These services are essential for women and families. Between 1996 and 2002, 115 women were murdered in Ireland. They were ordinary women — mothers, grandmothers, sisters, daughter — of all ages. Given the awful effects of domestic violence, a national strategy for women is needed as well as resources to address the acute funding crisis being experienced by organisations that respond to violence against women and that work with women trying to rebuild their lives. This is a national issue and it is estimated an additional €7 million will be needed this year to deal with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">WAVES Women's Support Services, a community-based organisation in Sligo, Leitrim and west Cavan, was established in 2004 to provide essential frontline services to women experiencing domestic violence. Prior to this, no dedicated service was in place for such women in the region and many women had nowhere to go to access support, information and advocacy. WAVES provides a free and confidential service to women throughout the area and its workers are specially trained and supported to respond to women at risk. The group has five staff but the funding for one of the workers will run out in less than 12 months. WAVES cannot cope with the number of women and families who need their help. The organisation wants to advertise its services to women in the area who live in terror and who are at risk of abuse and violence daily, but it is stretched. It is a dreadful that the organisation knows that people need help, information, services, advocacy, security and support and it could deliver this. However, it is helpless because it is working at capacity and knows much more needs to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_595">WAVES works in partnership with the Health Service Executive which provides core funding and full support. However, the Government has not increased funding in this area since 2002 and, therefore, the HSE north west region has been unable to respond effectively to the needs of WAVES and other frontline organisations. In 2005, WAVES dealt with 2,811 support calls from women experiencing violence and abuse and received 76 requests for emergency and long-term accommodation but was only able to address 29 cases. What happened to the other 47?</p>
            <p eId="para_596">Much of Sligo, Leitrim and west Cavan is quite rural and, therefore, outreach services are needed for women. WAVES is endeavouring to provide services to women wherever possible but, given the failure to increase resources and the threat of losing staff, women living in isolated areas are being discriminated against because they do not receive a service. The position is dire. In 2006 the organisation's projected expenditure is approximately €34,000 more than its projected income and, therefore, it is in trouble. There is a four to five week waiting list to meet a member of staff one-to-one, despite many women not even knowing the service exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">This is an emergency for women experiencing violence in Sligo, Leitrim and west Cavan. I ask the Minister of State to provide additional funding because it is not too late. Approximately €7 million is needed nationwide. A fraction of that amount would address the problem in my area.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_598">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children. I thank the Deputy for raising it.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">The national steering committee on violence against women was established following the 1997 report of the task force on violence against women. It is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey. The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive are represented on the committee. The purpose of the committee is to provide a multidisciplinary, multi-agency and cohesive response to the problem of violence against women and, in so doing, to progress the recommendations of the task force.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">The steering committee is representative of a wide range of interests concerned with violence against women and has a number of objectives, which include ensuring that regional and local structures are established; developing public awareness campaigns; co-ordinating and advising on the distribution of resources among the health regions; and co-ordinating and advising on ongoing development of policies, including those concerning perpetrators, criminal justice intervention, services and supports. Last year, the committee undertook a national review of sexual assault treatment services. That report is complete and is due for publication in the coming weeks. The Minister is keen that the report's recommendations should be treated as a priority within the HSE and I anticipate that executive funding priorities for 2007 will reflect this.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">The Government is committed to working with all interested parties, including service providers, and it has undertaken a range of measures to reduce the incidence of domestic violence, to respond to the needs of both victims and perpetrators and to raise awareness among the public about the dynamics of this crime. These measures can be seen across a wide range of Government policies and include legislative measures, Garda response, health services, the national steering committee on violence against women, national research, and treatment programmes for perpetrators.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">A key indicator of Government commitment to the issue can be seen in the funding for service provision. Funding for victims is channelled primarily through the Health Service Executive Vote. In addition, other Departments, such as Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, also contribute to the response to the issue. The provision of all emergency housing, including women's refuges, is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Funding is provided by the HSE for the running costs of existing refuges.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">Funding from the health sector has increased from approximately €3.8 million in 1997 to approximately €12 million in 2005. Arrangements for funding these frontline services is a matter for the Health Service Executive. The HSE and, formerly, the health boards have worked closely for many years with a range of non-governmental organisations. My Department will continue to monitor investment in these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">In keeping with the recommendations of the task force on violence against women published in 1997, the HSE works through regional planning committees whose function is to determine the needs of their localities and to co-ordinate both statutory and voluntary approaches to these needs. A regional planning committee is active in the north west and it comprises representatives of local NGOs. The committee is also supported by a senior HSE manager.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">Sligo Rape Crisis Centre, WAVES Women's Support Services and Sligo Social Services are NGOs which provide frontline services in responding to violence against women in Sligo and Leitrim. The 2006 allocation to the NGO service providers within this sector in the region is €360,109. Through the regional planning committee, the HSE will continue to engage with these organisations in the context of service demands and development requirements. The HSE was funded to maintain existing levels of service in this area in 2006 and, therefore, existing service providers may expect to be funded to similar levels as last year to maintain service provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">I acknowledge the valuable work undertaken by all the organisations that provide many essential and important services in the violence against women sector. I also acknowledge the direct supports provided by the HSE through its sexual assault treatment units, counselling services, accident and emergency units, social work services, general practitioner and community services.</p>

            <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_607">I wish to share time with Deputy Connaughton.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">As I speak, water levels on the Shannon are rising rapidly and this has a devastating impact on the habitat of the Shannon callows. The callows consist of a flood plain of approximately 6,000 hectares with two very important bird habitats, namely, the wet meadows where the corncrake breeds and the damp pasture that is used by waders. The number of corncrakes and waders has declined drastically in the past 20 years. This unexpected and unseasonal flooding of the callows has wiped out the internationally important breeding on the callows for this year and this is seriously threatening the survival of the corncrake population, which is Ireland's only globally threatened bird species. It also has a dramatic impact on farmers and their livelihoods. Up to 10,000 acres of land have been flooded and farmers are forced to purchase fodder for their livestock.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">Flooding is expected during the winter months but not at this time of the year. There are a number of mitigating steps which can be taken. The OPW produced a report on the Shannon flooding, which outlined potential mitigation options and the economic viability of a flood relief scheme. The report was subsequently distributed to the 22 stakeholders, but no further action has been taken on this report and it is now gathering dust. If a sum of €5 million was set aside for maintenance of the watercourse, it would have a direct impact on the vulnerability of the callows to flooding and thereby protect the wild birds, farmers and the navigation of the river itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">Proposals have been presented to the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government to develop a wetland park in the north midlands, in County Roscommon and County Longford, which would increase the capacity of the flood area north of Athlone and thereby address the extent of the flooding in the Shannon callows. This proposal could help to alleviate flooding as there is potentially about 30,000 hectares of cutaway bog, which would naturally flood by up to 4.5 metres if such a project was developed. To get the project up and running, all that is required is the formal approval of the Government. This would provide a major buffer to the current and potential flooding in the Shannon basin and benefit farmland, callows and towns such as Carrick-on-Shannon and Athlone.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">There are approximately 600 farmers in the Shannon callows. Current environmental restrictions such as the nitrates directive place a significant financial burden on those farmers, on top of the cost of this flooding. Under the terms of the EU directives, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must compensate landowners for losses or costs incurred as a result of such designations. However, this issue is outstanding for the past nine years. If it was resolved, it would be an important and timely boost to farmers who now have to find replacement feed for their livestock.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">Roscommon County Council has made a submission to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to raise roads, improve safety and provide access for isolated communities in the areas of Clonown and Drumlosh. However, that has fallen on deaf ears in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">It is imperative that any debris along the river south of Athlone is removed immediately, especially the debris caused by Waterways Ireland and the ESB in the vicinity of weirs.</p>

            <p eId="para_615">The River Shannon and its tributary, the River Suck, are very angry this evening. The floods have broken the banks and have spilled out over thousands of acres of farmland. That farmland was just getting into full production this month. The silt left behind this evening destroys the hay, the silage and the grass for the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">A report of a joint Oireachtas committee of which I was a member and an OPW report in 2004 came up with certain proposals. We must be realistic because, economically, we cannot drain the Shannon. However, remedial works would be of great benefit, such as removing the silt that blocks the normal flow. There should be better management of the weirs, as well as a decent compensation package for the farmers of the Shannon callows. They are looking for it for nine years and I cannot understand why officials from the relevant Departments do not recognise the disadvantage suffered by those farmers.</p>

            <from>Mr. T. O’Malley</from>
            <p eId="para_617">I am replying to this matter on the adjournment on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who is abroad on Government business.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">The Minister of State and his officials in the OPW are aware of the current level of flooding in the Shannon callows. While winter and occasional summer flooding is a feature of the callows, severe flooding of the kind experienced at present is not. The current exceptional flooding is due to the unusually heavy rainfall which we have experienced in the month of May. Rainfall this month may prove to be the highest May rainfall on record.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">The Office of Public Works has no responsibility for the maintenance of the River Shannon. It is open to the commissioners under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 and the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act 1995 to prepare a scheme to prevent or substantially reduce flooding in an area. The possibility of undertaking an arterial drainage scheme for the River Shannon has been considered on a number of occasions and has been ruled out on economic and environmental grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">In 2003 the Commissioners of Public Works undertook a further preliminary assessment of the Shannon flood problem. This assessment reviewed the previous reports and their conclusions in the light of the changes that had occurred in the catchment in the intervening 40 years. The review considered a variety of issues, such as conditions in the river, competing uses of the river, perceived changed climate patterns, changed agricultural regulations and practices, different economic circumstances for agriculture and other industries, the higher values being placed on environmental and heritage assets, as well as tourism opportunities, to establish if the possibility existed that a more detailed study might identify viable options to alleviate the flooding problem. It recommended that a pre-feasibility study of possible flood risk management opportunities should be undertaken. That study was completed in late 2004 and copies were given to the stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">The study concluded that the application of non-structural measures appeared to offer the best way forward. This would include the identification of flood risk areas and the development and implementation of a flood warning service, within the context of a catchment-based flood risk management planning framework. The plan would be developed under the umbrella of a lead agency, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, and would set a long-term strategy for management of flood risk within the Shannon catchment.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">The Office of Public Works intends to prepare catchment flood risk assessment and management plans for all river basin districts, including the River Shannon. This is a substantial programme of work and will take a number of years to complete. The commissioners are in the process of commissioning consultants to undertake a pilot study of the lower Lee catchment. It is not possible at this point to say when the study of the Shannon will commence.</p>

            <from>Mr. Cassidy</from>
            <p eId="para_625">I ask the Minister for Education and Science to purchase a new site for the Mercy secondary school in Kilbeggan, County Westmeath, as a matter of urgency. A deputation from this school met the Minister on 1 February 2006. The school principal, Ms Catherine Moynihan, two sisters from the Mercy order, as well as Councillor Tom Cowley, Senator O'Rourke and I met the Minister to highlight the opportunity that would be presented in the Kilbeggan area. The Sisters of Mercy, who have been in Kilbeggan since 1893, have made an immense contribution to the entire area by taking on the challenge of educating the children of the area when it was not fashionable to do so. I represent County Westmeath and want to make a strong case for this school on behalf of students, parents, teachers and the board of management. The current school, which has stood the test of time, has 22 exits. The time has long past for the construction of a new school because the educational needs of second-level students should be paramount. A CSA report published in May 2005 noted that the existing site offers little scope for expansion or refurbishment and recommended that the school should be relocated to a greenfield site as a matter of urgency in order to cater for increased enrolments and new housing developments in the catchment area.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">The Sisters of Mercy have generously agreed with the board of management and teaching staff to make available a ten-acre site located a mere 200 metres from the existing site at a reasonable price. We all know the construction of the M6 from Kinnegad to Kilbeggan has caused the price of land in the area to shoot through the roof. This opportunity may not present itself again. As a Government Deputy for County Westmeath, I urge the Minister for Education and Science to avail of the offer being made by the good sisters.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">Kilbeggan is located between the gateway towns of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar and this school's reputation in terms of its comprehensive curriculum is second to none. The school's rural catchment area of Kilbeggan, Rahugh, Tyrrellspass, Castletowngeoghegan, Dysart, Streamstown, Durrow, Ballinagore, Bohar and Horseleap contains decent and hard working communities which deserve to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the sisters to the Department. The board's provision of lifelong learning opportunities represents a significant contribution to the area's communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">There is an urgent need for a technical assessment of the new site. Enrolment at the school was 301 in 2000, rising to 400 in 2006, and an enrolment of 500 to 550 is projected by 2010. Any fair minded person would have to agree the current opportunity will not be available next year because the road will by then be opened. I call on the Minister to give urgent consideration to this request and to bring the matter to a conclusion as quickly as possible so the people of the Kilbeggan area can be assured of a new site.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" eId="spk_297" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. T. O’Malley</from>
            <p eId="para_629">l thank Deputy Cassidy for raising this matter, which I will address on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science. I wish to outline to the House the plans of the Department of Education and Science for the proposed new secondary school in Kilbeggan.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">Modernising the facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of under investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging demands in areas of rapid population growth. Nonetheless, this Government has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">This Government has invested in the largest school building programme in the history of the State. Between 1998 and the end of 2004, almost €2 billion was invested in school buildings and in the region of 7,500 large and small projects were completed in schools, including 130 brand new schools and 510 large scale refurbishments and extensions. Funding for school building and renovation projects has increased fivefold since 1997. In 2006, €500 million will be spent on school building projects, compared to just €92 million in 1997. The 2006 allocation is an increase of over 9% in real terms on the 2005 allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">At the end of last year, the Department of Education and Science outlined its spending plans for primary and post-primary schools for 2006. With €500 million to be spent on school buildings, there will be more than 1,300 ongoing projects in schools throughout the country. This significant investment will allow the Department to continue to progress its major programme of school building and modernisation, which includes improving new technological equipment and information technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">On 16 August 2005, the Department of Education and Science published a new area development plan for the N4-M4 corridor which charts the way forward for school planning over the next decade. With regard to the proposed secondary school for Kilbeggan, the N4-M4 area development plan recommended that Meánscoil an Chlochair, Kilbeggan, should be relocated to a greenfield site and could cater for 500 to 550 students. A strict enrolment policy should be in place to ensure priority is given to students within the catchment area.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">The Department is anxious to be proactive in planning the needs of rapidly developing areas and this plan equips it with a blueprint for development in an area that will continue to experience rapid change in the coming years. An examination of the school's long-term projected enrolment is currently being carried out by staff in the school planning section of the Department. Factors being taken into account include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. Once the long-term projected enrolment is established, the school will be asked to complete an educational worksheet based on this figure and return it to the Department's senior educationalist, who in turn will draw up a schedule of overall accommodation for the proposed new school. In addition, staff in the school planning section of the Department will arrange a technical inspection of the existing school building to assess its condition. Following the outcome of this assessment, the issue of site acquisition will be examined and officials from the Department will contact all relevant parties.</p>

          <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_301">
            <from>Mr. Neville</from>
            <p eId="para_638">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the issue of Government's failure to address the severe infrastructural projects in west County Limerick. The failure to fund new sewerage schemes is starving our towns and villages of the resources they need to expand their populations and create new jobs. West County Limerick has experienced a serious drain from the land and the farming community there has decreased considerably in recent decades. The number of people whose income is derived solely from farming has also suffered a significant drop.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">Planning restrictions have deprived people of the opportunity to build houses in rural areas. To be eligible for planning permission in 80% of rural areas of County Limerick, applicants must be from the area and cannot already own houses. The general response of the local authority to one-off rural housing is to refuse rather than grant permission. The planners will say that towns and villages should be developed rather than allowing a pattern of one-off housing but, because of the lack of proper sewerage facilities, housing and business developments cannot be facilitated. Towns and villages in Limerick West which are starved of development owing to the failure to provide adequate sewerage include Askeaton, Shanagolden, Foynes, Athea, Pallaskenry, Dromcollogher, Adare, Patrickswell, Bruff and Kilmallock.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">The 50-year-old sewerage system in Kilmallock is seriously hampering any development and is resulting in environmental and developmental concerns in the village. There is concern that damage is being done to the Loobagh and Maigue rivers as a result of the lack of adequate facilities for sewage disposal in Kilmallock. The proposals before the Department to develop the town's sewerage scheme will provide for a population equivalent of 4,000 with a possibility for future development. The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, promised a new sewerage scheme in 2004 and we are no nearer to having this developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Shanagolden is in an area of great population decline where the exit from farming or the transfer to part-time farming has been very pronounced. An injection of economic activity into the area is needed. The construction of a new sewerage scheme would ensure this. Several attractive proposals from developers to regenerate this village have been discussed with Limerick County Council but such development cannot take place until there is a new sewerage scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">I was informed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that the Limerick county trunk water mains scheme servicing Patrickswell and Adare has been approved for construction in his Department's water services investment programme 2004-2006. Submissions have been made to Limerick County Council on a sewerage scheme which would substantially increase the population of Patrickswell. This population boost cannot take place until the new sewerage scheme is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">On 26 January 2005, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, informed me in this House that the Patrickswell-Adare sewerage scheme would commence construction in 2005. It did not. On 9 March 2004, the former Minister in the Department, Deputy Cullen, informed me that the Adare sewerage scheme was approved for construction under his Department's water services investment programme 2003-2005. This Minister also failed to honour his commitment. In 2003, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, also informed me that Adare sewerage scheme would commence construction in 2003 and that the revised preliminary report was approved in July 2002, but we are still waiting.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">A Bruff development plan is being completed and a town development plan is being drawn up. Key to the development of Bruff is an understanding of when the sewerage scheme will be introduced and developed. Serious flooding takes place in Dromcollogher, which is among the many problems that require a new sewerage development. Athea, which is in the western part of the area and nearest to the Kerry border, is an excellent community in a rural area with great potential for development and has always responded to developing its community but is hampered because of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">Limerick County Council has made comprehensive submissions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on this but the Department always returns with another question, issue, clarification, reduction or query on consultancy fees. Limerick County Council has been trying to progress this but every time it answers a question fully, it receives another query, development or a new approach on consultancy. The neglect of west Limerick must be addressed. The Minister should give us a chance to develop. The population is declining in most areas and the introduction of sewerage schemes is key.</p>

            <p eId="para_646">There has been unprecedented investment by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the provision of modern water services infrastructure in recent years and this has made a key contribution to the economic growth that has benefited every part of the country. The Department's water services investment programme 2005-2007, published in December 2005, includes funding for more than 20 water and sewerage schemes throughout Limerick county and city. Under that programme, towns and villages such as Adare, Patrickswell, Athea, Askeaton, Foynes, Glin, Shanagolden, Kilmallock, Mungret, Dromcollogher, Hospital, Pallasgreen and Bruff can all look forward to new or upgraded sewerage schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_648">Many areas will also benefit from improved water supplies from the major upgrade planned for the Clareville water treatment plant, improvements to the Shannon estuary water supply scheme and extensions of the Limerick county trunk water mains. Almost €158 million has been allocated under the programme for water and sewerage infrastructure in Limerick. I am as anxious as the Deputy to see these schemes get to construction and completion as quickly as possible and my Department is doing everything it can to ensure this happens. The Deputy will also appreciate that multi-million euro schemes funded by the taxpayer must go through detailed planning and development processes——</p>

            <p eId="para_650">This is to ensure they meet their intended objectives, are designed and constructed in an economical manner and produce drinking water or treated waste water to a standard that meets national and EU requirements. Necessary procedures such as the acquisition of land or fulfilment of statutory planning requirements such as environmental impact assessments, EIAs, must be completed before tenders can be invited for the construction of any scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">The Department recently extended a greatly increased level of responsibility to local authorities to speed up the process of new water services infrastructure. For every project in the water services investment programme valued under €5 million, local authorities are, as soon as they receive preliminary approval, clear to proceed right through to construction without further reference to my Department. This gives local authorities unprecedented authority to advance individual schemes with a minimum of departmental involvement. I hope the result will be a significant speeding up of hundreds of individual schemes from drawing board to completion. It will also mean that my Department's expertise can be concentrated on advancing the larger and more costly projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">My Department's funding on water and sewerage schemes is not limited to the schemes included in the water services investment programme. Funding is also provided for the rural water programme, which includes funding for both water and sewerage schemes. National spending on rural water has increased dramatically from around €15 million in 1997 to €133 million in 2006. Real progress where it matters, on the ground, is being achieved throughout the country on the back of this increased investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">When I announced the block grant allocations for the rural water programme in February, Limerick County Council received an allocation of €11.65 million, of which €650,000 is towards small public water and sewerage schemes. The allocation of €11.65 million compares with a spend of €4.35 million by the council in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">I have listened carefully to what the Deputy has said and I thank him for the opportunity to outline my Department's support for the provision and upgrading of water and sewerage infrastructure in Limerick. I will have to check his statements on previous commitments and letters he received. I do not know whether the delay was at county council or Department level.</p>

            <p eId="para_656">If incorrect submissions come in, they are sent back. Things must be in order. Perhaps we can find out why a project on an earlier programme is still on the next one and whether the delay was on the part of the Department or the county council. They are all included on the programme. The money is in place. The increased authority to proceed with the smaller schemes once initial approval has been given without answering 1,000 questions should speed up matters. The €158 million that has been allocated is significant and I hope there will be no further delays.</p>

            <p eId="para_660">The position is that homecare services provided directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) do not generally come within the scope of VAT, as Public Bodies are not regarded as taxable persons. This means that they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on their input costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">The package of services aimed at older people, announced by the Tánaiste in the 2006 Budget, is based on the pilot homecare packages in place and will deliver a wide range of services. The packages are delivered through the HSE, by a range of providers including the HSE itself, voluntary groups and the private sector. Homecare packages will consist of a mixture of grants, contracted care services, therapeutic input and equipment and other such community services as identified in the needs assessment as being necessary to facilitate the older person to remain living in their own home.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">However, where homecare services are provided for by private companies for a consideration in the course or furtherance of business, the provider may be obliged to register and account for VAT at the appropriate rate depending on the type of service they provide. Homecare provided to individuals consists of a variety of services which may be liable to VAT at different rates. The current VAT treatment of such services is in accordance with EU Sixth VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">However, my Department is examining in consultation with the Department of Health and Children the scope within the relevant EU Directives to exempt the provision of such services from VAT in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_665">As the Deputy is probably aware, the aggregate value of remuneration packages of executives, be they Irish or foreign, may consist of a number of items other than cash including, for example, a company car, shares or medical benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">The structuring or restructuring of such remuneration packages is a matter for employees and their employers. Indeed, the restructuring of a remuneration package may occur for reasons totally unconnected with tax matters. For example, the restructuring of a remuneration package can arise where a company wishes to retain, over the long term, the services of a valued employee.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">As regards the receipt by an employee from his/her employer of shares or options on shares in the employer's company, in common with all employees (including executives, whether foreign or Irish), the employee is obliged to account directly to Revenue for the Irish tax due rather than through the PAYE system.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">The changes to the remittance basis of taxation came into effect from 1 January last so it is early days yet to assess whether there has been any significant tax-driven restructuring of remuneration packages.</p>

            <p eId="para_673">Stamp Duty is a charge on documents, which are mostly legal documents, used in the transfer of property. Where a property is purchased, stamp duty is charged on the conveyance or transfer effecting change of legal ownership of the property concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">If there is no conveyance, there is no stamp duty. A builder or developer can, therefore, obtain a licence from a vendor to build on land owned by the vendor without incurring a stamp duty charge at that stage of the venture. Once the buildings, whether commercial or residential, are completed, the conveyances or transfers of such properties (i.e. both land and buildings) to purchasers are chargeable to stamp duty in the normal manner, unless specific exemptions are available to the purchasers.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">The number of cases involved is not available as there is no requirement on a builder or developer to submit any documents to Revenue for stamping in relation to a building licence arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">Taking account of the proliferation of developments generally in recent times, and in the context of its targeted project in the construction sector in 2006, the Revenue Commissioners are reviewing the use of licensing and similar arrangements, as part of their audit and compliance programmes. The review, as with Revenue's overall approach to its business, will focus on risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">I have asked Revenue to let me know the outcome of their review and I will decide what action, if any, is required bearing in mind the effect on the housing market and the cost to the Exchequer.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_679">I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied with the levels of supervision exercised by customs officers at points of entry into the State. In relation to drugs smuggling through airports, in the five years to 2005 customs officers made 3,428 drugs seizures, with a street value of approximately €23 million, in Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports. As regards cocaine, there has been a steady increase in the number and volume of cocaine seizures at airports — mainly at Dublin airport, but also, more recently, in 2005, at Cork airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">On the 30th of March 2006, I responded in some detail to Parliamentary Question No. 41 asked by Deputy Higgins on flight arrivals into Cork and Shannon Airports at times when there are no customs officers on duty. As advised in my reply, the Revenue Commissioners ended 24 hour rostered coverage in Cork in 2002 and Shannon in 2005, in both cases the reason was the low number of night-time flights. Cork Airport is closed between 11.30 p.m. and 5.30 a.m. and Shannon Airport handles no flights between 1.30 a.m. and 5.30 a.m.</p>
            <p eId="para_681">However, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they have a number of "on-call" non-rostered customs officers available to attend at both Cork and Shannon airports. These "on-call" officers provide flexibility of attendance and are available 24 hours, seven days per week. They can and do attend during hours when rostered officers are not in attendance, including on early morning flights from US airports when required, as dictated by risk profiling.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">The Deputy might wish to note that Cork Airport has no non-EU flights outside of normal hours of attendance of customs officials. For EU flights, customs officers may only stop and question people where there are reasonable grounds for suspicion. Almost all night-time flights originating in non-EU countries were met and checked by Revenue's 24-hour specialist staff in 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_684">There is a high degree of competition in the Irish mortgage credit market, providing a wide choice of competitively priced mortgage products including long-term fixed-rate mortgages. The choice of mortgage product ultimately rests with the consumer and the lending institution concerned. The preference of borrowers is influenced by factors such as their personal circumstances and their own assessment of the relative merits of fixed and variable rate mortgages. Consumers have the benefit of the information and advice supplied by the Financial Regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">It would not be appropriate for me in my role as Minister for Finance to seek to promote one type of mortgage product ahead of another. The information being made available by the Financial Regulator, together with the statutory information and warnings in the case of mortgages, serve as an adequate basis for consumers to make a decision about the type of mortgage which best suits them. The Financial Regulator's guide called "Mortgages made Easy" is available on its website or from its Consumer Information Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">The Deputy may wish to note that while fixed interest rate mortgages may have a role in smoothing mortgage outgoings at individual household level, it would require a very high level of take-up of fixed-rate mortgages and a substantial shifting out of variable rate mortgages in order to have any significant impact on the Irish economy's response to changes in interest rates. In this regard, a key factor would appear to be consumers' individual decisions and preferences. Borrowers must, at any particular time, balance the premium payable as part of a fixed interest rate mortgage to ensure certainty in repayments, against the continuing, low levels of mortgage interest rates available to variable-rate borrowers.</p>

            <p eId="para_688">The primary mechanism for placing general service civil servants who are in posts which are due to decentralise but wish to remain in Dublin is by way of bilateral transfer. As staff who have applied to decentralise continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate become available to those wishing to remain in Dublin. It is expected that a significant number of staff will be placed through these bilateral arrangements as the programme is rolled out. To end April 2006 in excess of 1,500 staff have been assigned to decentralising posts, of which over 800 are Dublin based applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">In addition, officials of my Department have been in discussions with the civil service unions on further arrangements to facilitate the placement of Dublin based staff. Under these arrangements, which have been recently initiated for general service grades, details of staff who wish to remain in Dublin at each grade level are provided to the Public Appointments Service so that a proportion of vacancies arising in Dublin based posts may be filled by those staff. It is intended that these arrangements will continue over the full transition phase of the decentralisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">Participation in these arrangements by Departments and Offices will be influenced by their timeframe for moving, their success in placing staff through the bilateral arrangements, whether they are relocating in full or in part and the extent to which their staff can be placed elsewhere within the organisation in Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_693">The SSIAs were introduced in the 2001 Finance Act and give a credit to all SSIA investors of 25%. The aim of the SSIA scheme was to encourage savings. This aim has been successfully achieved with 1.1 million persons availing of the special scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">It is widely acknowledged that one of the reasons for the success of the SSIA scheme was its simplicity. It was clearly stated from the very outset that the SSIA investment returns would be subject to a 23% exit tax at maturity with no exemptions for anyone. The information leaflets that were published at that time reflected this position.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">Although all SSIA accounts are subject to an exit tax, it should be noted that the SSIA scheme represented a very good deal for all of those taking it up, whether aged 65 and over or not. For example, a person who will have saved €254 per month over 5 years, into their SSIA account, will receive a credit of €3,800 from the Exchequer even before any interest is taken into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">It should be noted that DIRT on deposit interest was introduced in 1986 and only two reliefs apply, i.e. for those aged 65 or over and for the physically or mentally incapacitated, where the DIRT is deducted by the financial institution on the deposit interest and is refunded if the person claiming the refund is not otherwise liable to income tax on their total income. Thus, it is not a total tax exemption for all those aged 65 or over, or for the incapacitated.</p>

            <p eId="para_698">The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is independent of Government in the exercise of its functions. It controls and manages the Fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement the Fund's investment strategy in accordance with the Fund investment policy set out in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. This investment policy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term subject to prudent risk management.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">The independence of the Commission is a cornerstone of the legislation which ensures that the Commission will invest in a manner that maximises returns. Essentially, it is similar to the trustee arrangements that apply to private pension funds and places an obligation on the Commission to act commercially and in the best interests of the Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">With regard to commercial investment in public sector projects in this country, the Annual Report of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission for 2004 states that the Commission has made an initial allocation of €200 million for investment in public-private partnerships in Ireland and will increase this allocation should suitable opportunities arise. The Report also states that the Commission will make equity and/or debt finance available to the winning bidder in the tender process for public-private-partnership projects, provided it is satisfied with the prospective rate of return. I understand that, to date, no moneys have been invested by the Commission in any such projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">The Commission was a member of a consortium — The Celtic Roads Group — which was a bidder in a competition for the contract to upgrade the M50 which was conducted by the National Roads Authority. The NRA abandoned the original competition some time ago and launched a new competition on different terms. The Celtic Roads Group consortium decided not to enter the new bidding competition and the Commission's involvement in that project as a member of a bidding consortium is accordingly now at an end.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">I would also note that lack of capital is not an issue with Ireland's PPP programme and the success or otherwise of the programme is not in any way dependent on investment by the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_720">I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 114 and 150 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">The preparation of the next NDP (2007-2013) which is being coordinated by my Department is proceeding. The content and focus of the next NDP and the resultant allocations and prioritisation will be a matter for decision by Government. The new Plan will seek to address the investment now necessary to maintain national competitiveness within a sustainable economic and budgetary framework. It will also set out a coherent investment strategy at sectoral level with particular reference to the infrastructure investment necessary to meet economic and social challenges. In addition the Plan will address a number of horizontal themes including;</p>
            <p eId="para_722">—The implementation of the National Spatial Strategy;</p>
            <p eId="para_723">—The All-Island Dimension and the potential benefits of cross-border cooperation;</p>
            <p eId="para_724">—The promotion of Social Inclusion; and</p>
            <p eId="para_725">—Environmental Sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">I envisage that the Plan will be a high level strategic document which will set out a clear framework for project selection over the period of the Plan. The capital investment element of the Plan will obviously reflect the Budget 2007 five year capital envelopes which will be rolled out to 2013 for the purposes of the Plan. Given that the Plan will cover a seven year horizon the seven year capital allocations reflecting Government priorities by programme will be indicative to some degree. This will allow sufficient flexibility to adapt as appropriate to changing circumstances over the period.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">An extensive consultation process on the next National Development Plan is under way. Formal submissions have been sought from the Social Partners, the Regional Assemblies, Regional Authorities and a number of concerned interest groups such as the Heritage Council, Comhar, the Combat Poverty Agency and the Western Development Commission. A considerable number of submissions have already been received and my Department has also had meetings with some of the bodies concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_729">I welcome the Information Commissioner's Annual Report for 2005. I particularly welcome her finding that the FOI Act continues to achieve positive and notable outcomes both for individual requesters and for society generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">In the Report, the Information Commissioner sets out her thinking on a number of issues, including a need for amended FOI legislation concerning access to the personal records of deceased persons. The Information Commissioner's views on this matter are being considered by my Department at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">The Report also draws attention to certain bodies that are not subject to FOI. Extension of the FOI Act to a number of the bodies identified by the Information Commissioner is being examined by my Department at present. FOI has been extended gradually as experience has been gained in its application. The Act applied to just 67 bodies when it was introduced in April 1998, mainly to Government Departments and Offices and closely related bodies. In October 1998, the Act was extended to the former health boards and to local authorities. One year later, a further large group of bodies, including voluntary hospitals and bodies dealing with people with an intellectual disability, were brought under its remit. Bodies in the broadcasting sector came within the scope of the Act in 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">In 2001 and 2002 the Act was further extended to a range of public and publicly funded bodies in the social services, health, regulatory, environment, cultural and enterprise areas and to universities, institutes of technology and colleges of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">In October last year, I announced plans to extend the Act to a further 137 bodies which will bring to over 500 the number of bodies subject to Freedom of Information. The necessary regulations to give effect to this extension are currently before the Houses and will be made once the necessary approval has been obtained in each House.</p>

     if he is satisfied regarding the tax treatment of families with children to support.

          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_323">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_738">This Government acknowledge the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">The Government have substantially increased Child Benefit since coming into office in 1997. From last month Child Benefit payments have increased to €150 per month for the first and second children and €185 for the third and subsequent children. These Child Benefit payments, which are exempt from income tax, represent a 294% increase in the rate for first and second children over the rate prevailing in 1997 and a 274% increase in the rate for third and subsequent children. By comparison, during this period the increase in the consumer price index is estimated to be 34%. Overall expenditure on Child Benefit has increased by 279% from €506 million in 1997 to almost €2 billion in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">In addition, in Budget 2006 I announced a new Early Childcare Supplement of €1,000 in a full year for each child up to his or her sixth birthday. This new payment, which is also exempt from income tax, along with increases in Child Benefit, brings the amount a family will receive, for each of the first two children under six years, to €2,800 per year, equivalent to over €50 per week in direct financial support. This will be even higher where a family has more than two children under six.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">On the supply side, the provision of formal childcare places is being stimulated through a programme of investment under the new five year National Childcare Investment Programme which I announced in Budget 2006. This programme will support the creation of an additional 50,000 childcare places from 2006 to 2010, building on the success of the €500 million Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme which has already been provided under the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006. So far this funding has generated over 26,000 new places with a further 15,000 places due to come on stream before it ends in 2007. This means that between now and 2010 some 65,000 additional places will be funded.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">In total, over €2.5 billion extra will be invested in the area of child support over the next five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">Measures have also been taken by the Government to favour the supply of childcare by tax incentives to set up facilities and provide relief from benefit-in-kind taxation for free or subsidised childcare where this is provided by employers. Taken together, these represent substantial measures to assist with the cost of childcare.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">In addition, the tax system treats parents with dependent children more favourably than persons with no dependent children, in recognition of the additional financial burden associated with parenthood. This is done mainly through the one parent family tax credit, the widowed parent tax credit, the incapacitated child tax credit and the home carer tax credit. Also, persons who qualify for the one parent family tax credit, including widowed parents, qualify for the associated standard rate band cut off point which is €36,000 in 2006. This is €4,000 greater than that which applies for a single person.</p>

            <p eId="para_746">Following the announcement by Revenue clarifying the stamp duty treatment on purchases of shares underpinning the contracts for differences (CFD), my Department received strong representations that there would be severe consequences for the liquidity of the Irish Stock Market and, therefore, on the ability of Irish companies to raise capital here.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">In particular, representations were made by the Irish Stock Exchange and by the London Investment Banking Association. The representations made by the London Association reflect the fact that the majority of the CFD business concerned originates with London-based firms. A survey of Irish Stock Exchange member firms conducted by the Exchange indicated that the aggregate value in 2005 of trades in Irish shares associated with CFD contracts represented 30% of the overall value of trades on the Irish Stock Exchange for that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">I considered the representations made carefully as they seemed to have substance, taking account of the international nature of stock markets. In the circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the relevant stamp duty legislation predates the development of the CFD market, I decided to have the matter reviewed in advance of the next Budget and I issued a statement to that effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">I was advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the light of the planned review, with a view to Budget 2007 announcements, and of the surrounding circumstances, they had decided to allow the existing practices of CFD issuers to continue pending the review. Although a significant percentage of trades in Irish shares was associated with CFD contracts, Irish share-based CFD business was a small fraction of the overall CFD business conducted by the London firms concerned. The Commissioners further advised that, in those circumstances and given the likelihood of that business transferring to non-Irish shares, it was unlikely that there would be any real loss of stamp duty arising from allowing the existing practices to continue pending the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_752">I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 249 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">The plan for private hospitals in the grounds of public hospitals is designed to be a cost effective way of expanding the supply of beds for public patients. However, there have been no decisions yet in regard to approving any particular proposal. It will be a matter for the HSE to assess any proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">The scheme of capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals was reviewed by Indecon Economic Consultants as part of the overall review of property tax incentives in 2005. Indecon consulted widely in the course of their review, including consultations with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive. Their report was published on 6 February 2006 and is available on the Department of Finance's website. The review recommended that this scheme should continue as there was a need for ongoing investment in private hospitals. The consultants observed that the construction of private hospitals could free beds in public hospitals used by private patients. It should also be noted that the consultants observed that the Government's plan for private hospitals in the grounds of public hospitals is designed to be a cost effective way of expanding supply and if properly managed will increase supply and competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">The summary of the main findings from Indecon's analysis is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_756">•There has been an overall increase in planning applications and approvals for private hospitals since 2000 but most have not proceeded to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">•Most of the extra investment in the sector would either not have been undertaken, or would have taken longer to come on-line in the absence of the tax incentive scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">•While it is too early to provide detailed estimates of the impact of the scheme on the supply and on the costs of hospital beds, Indecon believes the scheme has the potential to address supply shortages in the sector and to reduce costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">Private health care is a long established feature of the system of health care provision in Ireland and acts as a strong complement to the publicly funded system. Private health care provision spans from general practitioner services through private beds in public hospitals and private hospitals to private nursing homes. The Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity in the health system. The key objective is to provide the required extra capacity, whether this is in the public or private sector. A number of Government policies-initiatives support the co-existence of public and private health care such as: the designation of private and semi-private beds in public hospitals; income tax relief on private health insurance premiums; income tax relief on medical-dental expenses; the National Treatment Purchase Fund sources capacity in private hospitals for public patients; and the Tanaiste's policy direction to the Health Service Executive to build private hospitals on public sites thereby freeing up beds for public patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_770">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that inquiries relating to residence are a feature of the risk based programmes operated by Revenue. The procedures adopted in relation to validating a claim to non-residence status depend on the circumstances in each case. The administration of the validation procedures is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the methods used to verify claims to non-residence include a range of tests and an intelligence dimension which for obvious reasons they do not publicise.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">However, in relation to the work carried out by the High Wealth Individuals Unit of Revenue as one dimension of its risk-based programme for 2005, the Commissioners have advised me that they have no reason to conclude that there is failure to comply with the statutory rules governing non-residence status. They will continue to include examination of a cross-section of cases where there is a claim to non-residence status in their risk-based programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible at present to identify the number of Irish domiciled persons claiming to be non-resident for tax purposes. Income tax returns for 2002 onwards request data from self-employed taxpayers in relation to their residence and domicile status. This is however not captured electronically which means it is not practicable to derive global statistics in relation to claims to non-residence status. The Revenue Commissioners are currently looking at means of capturing this data electronically in the future which will make it practicable to derive such statistics.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">I would remind the Deputy that Irish citizens who are non-resident for tax purposes are obliged to file Irish tax returns only in respect of:</p>
            <p eId="para_774">—income arising in Ireland e.g. income from directorships, rents etc. and</p>

            <p eId="para_778">The Government's budgetary strategy is based on the objective of continued budgetary sustainability both in the medium-term and the long-run, in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">This Government considers that prudent fiscal policies underpin competitiveness, support growth and create flexibility to respond effectively to economic shocks. Of particular importance is the need to ensure that public expenditure growth is sustainable and broadly in line with available resources and, within this, to increase the level of investment needed to tackle the economy's infrastructure deficit.</p>

     the action he intends to take to address the negative impact of the significant increase in the rate of inflation for the fourth month running; if it is not timely for more State intervention in view of the fact that increases have been driven largely by higher energy costs leading to price increases in sectors that are largely controlled by the State; and his views on whether inflation will average 2.7% in 2006.

            <p eId="para_782">Inflation, as measured by annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was 3.8 per cent in April. A large proportion of the rise in the annual inflation rate is due to external factors such as higher oil prices and recent rises in interest rates by the ECB.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">Higher energy costs largely reflect the trend in international energy prices. The Government has no control over international energy price developments.</p>

     <b>Mr. Crawford</b>

            <p eId="para_786">Residential construction has grown rapidly in recent times. Supply of housing has increased in response to strong levels of demand, which, in turn, have arisen from a number of fundamental demographic and economic factors. Total completions in 2005 reached an historic high of about 81 thousand units. Construction employment growth was also particularly strong in 2005 and now accounts for one in eight jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">As acknowledged in the Stability Programme Update published with the 2006 Budget, the fact that construction presently accounts for an historically high proportion of economic output and employment implies that the economy is vulnerable to any shock affecting this sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">A high proportion of household indebtedness in Ireland relates to borrowing for house-purchase which, in turn, involves the acquisition of an asset for the households. In the same way, borrowing by the business sector generally underpins investment, and the creation of business assets yielding future income. It therefore reflects the strong performance of the economy and confidence in Ireland's economic prospects.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">While the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels in the economy are supported by a range of fundamental factors such as growing employment, rising real incomes, favourable demographics and low inflation and interest rates, the Central Bank at the publication of their latest Quarterly Bulletin, highlighted the need for borrowers and lenders to take account of the current very low level of interest rates and the fact that this situation cannot continue indefinitely. I share the view that both borrowers and lenders need to factor into their financial decision-making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">Finally, as far as overall economic and financial stability is concerned, an overall measure of credit encompasses both public and private sector credit and debt levels. The Minister for Finance has a key role in this regard in ensuring prudent management of the budget and overall sustainability in the public finances. In this context, Ireland's fiscal performance is among the best in the developed world with Government indebtedness the second-lowest in the euro area. Responsible budgetary policy has made a significant contribution to economic performance overall and to the achievement of record employment levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_794">I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 140 and 267 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">The range of services offered by credit card providers to subscribing retailers and cardholders is primarily a matter of private contract, and I have no legislative role in specifying the form of those services. Commercial considerations such as demand, cost and technical feasibility will influence the range of features offered by providers at any given time, and the take-up of these features by retailers and cardholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">Currently seven regulated financial institutions provide credit cards in Ireland; some of these also provide services through other financial institutions. The service referred to by the Deputy is I understand a commercial option which may be offered to retailers but neither my Department nor the Financial Regulator has any statistics on the number of institutions that offer the service. However, the Financial Regulator has advised my Department that a small percentage of point of sale terminals offer cardholders the option of having their transaction converted into their home currency at the time the transaction is undertaken. In this instance the rate applied is the rate prevailing on the day of the transaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">The rules governing currency conversion on credit cards are set by the international card payment schemes such as Visa and MasterCard. Credit card providers, such as financial institutions in Ireland, are required to comply with the rules of these schemes. I understand that the rate of exchange applied to credit card transactions undertaken outside of the euro area is set each morning under the rules of the international card payment schemes with reference to the prevailing international rate of exchange. As currency markets are volatile, these rates are likely to change daily. The amount of the transaction is converted into euro at the rate of exchange on the date that the transaction is debited to the customer's credit card account. The rules governing the conversion of foreign currency transactions should be itemised in the terms and conditions that accompany the credit card account.</p>

            <p eId="para_799">The policy on numbers employed in the public service has succeeded in cutting back on the rapid rise in public service employment in the period 1997 to 2002. This took place at a time of significant increases both in employment in the economy generally and in the population with the corresponding increased demand for public services.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">Numbers employed in the Civil Service, Defence, Local Authority and non-commercial state-sponsored sectors have been reduced by 3,700 and the target for this group has been exceeded. However, original targets in the Health and Education sectors have not been met because the Government has been prepared to increase numbers to meet priority needs in frontline and essential services, for example, new health units and the disability area in the Health sector, Special Needs Teachers in the education system and to increase the number of Gardaí; this is in line with the approach stated when the policy was launched.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">Going forward, the Government has decided to continue to control and regulate numbers in the public service within the following agreed ceilings.</p>

            <p eId="para_930">Inflation, as measured by annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was 3.8% in April. A large proportion of the rise in the annual inflation rate is due to external factors such as higher oil prices and recent rises in interest rates by the ECB. On the assumption of unchanged interest rates, I expect inflation to moderate in the second half of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">Higher inflation would lead to a deterioration in our competitiveness. The Government is doing its bit to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies. In addition, we have not increased excise duties for the last two years, and we are promoting greater price competition by removing the Groceries Order. We are also looking for a reasonable wage deal in order to maintain and improve our international competitiveness. We are investing in public infrastructure which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services and keep inflation down in the process.</p>

According to the Information Commissioner's recent Annual Report, 963 requests were made by journalists in 2005, compared with 870 in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">The level of FOI requests being made by journalists is still down on that witnessed in 2003 and previous years. I would not attribute this reduction to the fact that certain bodies are not subject to FOI. It would appear that the introduction of an ‘up-front' fee of €15 in July 2003 has had an impact on the number of FOI requests being made by journalists. I have no proposals to review this fee, which I consider to be very modest when set against the cost of administering FOI requests. I certainly do not consider the fee to be a major deterrent to usage of the FOI Act by journalists.</p>

            <p eId="para_937">I made clear in my address that I have no preconceptions regarding the shape of the model for the future development of credit unions and that all proposals for changes in the legislative framework will be assessed on their merits drawing on the advice of the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) the expert advisory body on credit union matters under the Credit Union Act — and key stakeholders such as the League.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">In terms of the regulation of the credit unions, I emphasised that all stakeholders recognise that strong prudential standards are a prerequisite to the growth and development of credit unions and that strong dialogue is a prerequisite for regulatory policy that is evidence-based and effective, and for regulatory practice that conforms to the highest international standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">I outlined to the CGM progress in implementing the Social Finance Initiative announced in Budget 2006, drawing attention to the long-established role of credit unions in combating financial exclusion in rural and disadvantaged areas and the innovative programmes of social investment undertaken by certain credit unions. I provided an update to the CGM on progress in relation to a number of current issues of concern to credit unions:</p>
            <p eId="para_940">•the investment framework;</p>
            <p eId="para_941">•regulatory and legislative changes; and</p>
            <p eId="para_942">•limits on longer-term lending by credit unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">In relation to the reform of the League's Savings Protection Scheme (SPS), I confirmed that from a public policy perspective, the overarching priority is to have legal certainty regarding the protection of savers in credit unions and indicated that the next step was to assess the League's current set of proposals against the objectives set for savings protection arrangements by CUAC's report on SPS and the Annual Reports of the Registrar.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">In conclusion, as set out in my address to the CGM, it is essential to strike an appropriate balance between the need to facilitate credit unions in adapting effectively to the changes taking place in society and in the financial sector, while also maintaining appropriate standards of prudential supervision, with a view to supporting the long-term sustainability of the credit union movement in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_982">As part of its consumer protection role, the Financial Regulator reviewed a sample of SSIA documents sent by financial institutions to their customers to see that they are clear and transparent. Some financial institutions had, along with the SSIA4 form, sent other documents to their customers, including direct debit mandates and forms for other savings products. The Financial Regulator was concerned that this could result in some consumers signing and returning these documents, without realising they are committing to further saving or signing up for a new financial product. The Financial Regulator has received the co-operation of the financial institutions in amending the literature being sent to customers and it should be clear to customers that the only document that they are required to sign and return to the SSIA providers is the SSIA4 form.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">In recent weeks the Financial Regulator issued a warning to savers to carefully read all letters and forms they receive from their account providers before signing anything.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">Overall, the Financial Regulator monitors general media advertisements to ensure compliance with the Regulator's Advertising Guidelines, under which advertisements must be fair and not mislead the consumer. In addition, the Financial Regulator's strategy for 2006 includes a commitment to undertake an information initiative to coincide with the maturity of SSIAs. This initiative commenced earlier this year with the publication of the Consumer Information "Little Black Book on SSIAs", which provides guidance to consumers on the issues that may arise as their SSIAs mature.</p>

            <p eId="para_988">I reject entirely the Deputies allegations about the role and equity of the indirect tax system. A simple look at the facts will show that the conclusions in the report referred to are misdirected.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">Firstly, there is no VAT on the main low income items such as food, oral medicines, children's shoes and clothing. Secondly, most excise revenue (60%) comes from excises on petrol, diesel and cars. These are not items that low income groups spend most on. As far as the remaining 40% of excise revenue, this comes from duties on tobacco and alcohol where there are solid health grounds for using the tax system to discourage consumption.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">Thirdly, there are special reliefs in the VAT and Excise system for medical and other equipment for the disabled. There is no VAT on public transport and diesel used in buses and trains is subject to reduced rates of excise. Most public services are not liable to VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">Furthermore the report referred to is simply wrong when it claims that we are relying more on indirect taxation now than in the past as the following table will show.</p>

In fact, every effort is made, as far as EU law will permit, to reduce the incidence of VAT and Excise on low incomes, but, by their nature, such taxes are not direct taxes on income (this is why they are called indirect taxes) and cannot be easily related to one's ability to pay, however good one's intent. If one wishes to off set any claimed distributional effects, the proper focus is more on the expenditure side of the Budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_1043">My Department has been analysing the potential effects of the maturing of the SSIA scheme on the economy. The impact will crucially depend on how the savings and the monthly subscriptions are used. Unfortunately, projecting the likely spend-save ratio is a difficult task, not least because it is not possible to draw on previous domestic experience as a basis for anticipating the effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">Nevertheless, the analysis of previous international experience, economic theory, as well as the findings of various surveys undertaken domestically would tend to suggest that, upon maturity, a large portion of existing savings will continue to be saved. In these circumstances, it is not expected that the maturing of the SSIAs will have a determining effect on house prices.</p>

            <p eId="para_1048">I would like to state the Government's full commitment to the decentralisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">The Decentralisation Implementation Group chaired by Mr. Finbarr Flood was established to drive the process forward and to oversee its effective delivery. The Group, recognising that it would not be feasible for all organisations to move at the same time, proposed phasing arrangements and revised timeframes out to 2009 for civil service organisations. These arrangements were accepted by Government and announced in June of last year and I am satisfied that good progress continues to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">I understand that the Decentralisation Implementation Group has met with a number of Secretaries General and are satisfied with the level of planning in each of the Departments. The Group is currently meeting with the Chief Executives of a number of State Agencies to discuss the planning framework in place, to assess progress to date and to hear about the challenges arising and steps proposed to address them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">The figures confirm that this is a popular programme among staff. Over 10,600 civil and public servants have applied to the Central Applications Facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">To date some 1,500 people have been assigned to posts destined for new locations and are currently being trained in their new role in readiness to move. So far, some 200 of these have actually relocated and it is expected that up to 1,000 will have moved by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">Many staff have opted to move to locations outside of Dublin while others have indicated that they wish to be assigned to posts remaining in Dublin. The Government is committed to facilitating those who wish to remain with a public service post in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">There is an extensive range of preparations underway in relation to the acquisition of property by the OPW, as well as the detailed implementation planning within individual Departments, Offices and Agencies, and ongoing discussions with unions in relation to the various human resource aspects of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">As always when dealing with a programme of this size there are challenges to overcome but I remain confident that these can be addressed with the active co-operation of all parties involved in the implementation effort.</p>

            <p eId="para_1061">As I set out in my reply to Question No. 60 on 30 March 2006, the aim of the initiative is to give an impetus to the development of, and make a real contribution to expanding, Social Finance provision in Ireland. The Social Finance initiative will, therefore, complement the wide range of measures that are currently in place to promote and assist community infrastructure and local development, including the development of micro-enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">A practical model for social finance funding is currently being developed. The intention is to keep the administrative structures as light as possible, consistent with meeting the objectives of the initiative, and ensuring that the funds are used effectively on a value-for-money basis. With a view to developing an effective model my Department has, to date, consulted with a number of public, private and voluntary bodies currently involved or with interests in this area, in addition to its discussions with the banking community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">A key priority is early implementation of the initiative. This will provide the opportunity to market test particular options, which can in turn inform the further development of the social finance initiative. To this end my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, is developing proposals for Government on the appropriate legal framework which would clarify the objectives, roles and functions of the investment vehicle, establish the type of delivery structure judged most suitable to the requirements of social finance, and also deal with such matters as governance and accountability arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">As far as the potential sources of funding for social finance provision are concerned, there has been a positive reaction from the banking community to my invitation to support the initiative. However, as I set out in reply to Question No. 53 on 28 February 2006, the sum of €100 million referred to by the Deputy is not accurate. The banks have committed to contribute seed capital funding of €25 million to the initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_1071">The one parent family tax credit is a credit that can be claimed by a single parent (whether widowed, single, deserted, separated or divorced) who has a dependent child resident with him/her for the whole or part of the relevant tax year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1200">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on preliminary declarations by all qualifying savings managers, the total number of active accounts at 31 December 2005 was 1,082,265 and the average monthly subscription was €196. This is the latest date for which figures are available. The Revenue Commissioners are currently processing SSIA details supplied by financial institutions in their 2005 annual returns. When this processing is complete the analysis of the returns will commence and it is expected to have the results available by the end of June 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">The net cost of the scheme in 2005 was €597.4m, with a cumulative cost of €2,181m for all years to end 2005. The cost of the scheme in the first four months of 2006 was €211.1m. As indicated in replies to previous questions, it is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables over the remaining period of the scheme, including where participants voluntarily withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions over the remainder of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">The first SSIAs commenced in May 2001 and will mature at the end of May 2006. For the reasons stated above, it is not possible to state the cost to the Exchequer of the scheme in each of the 12 months after the SSIAs begin to mature.</p>

     the position of the Government’s policy on decentralisation and relocation; and his views on the impact this policy is having on the morale of several agencies, in particular semi-State bodies.
     [19205/06]

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1220">Firstly I would like to state the Government's full commitment to the decentralisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">There has been a substantial amount of media coverage in recent times in relation to the decentralisation programme. Much of that coverage has been speculative and most of it has been misinformed. This Government is working towards full implementation of the decentralisation programme and I am satisfied with progress to date on a number of fronts including CAF take-up, property acquisition, assignments of staff etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">In relation to the State Agencies, the Decentralisation Implementation Group took the view that it would not seek to dictate every step in the process to the management of those organisations. Although the Group proposed a group of State Agencies for early mover status it did not include specific timeframes in recognition of this approach and also of the fact that it is the responsibility of the board and senior management of each agency to implement Government policy. The Group stated in its June 2005 report that each agency included in the programme should have a successful relocation as a high level strategic objective and should prepare the next and deeper iteration of its implementation plan. In the meantime, the OPW is continuing to seek property solutions in respect of any agency that requires it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">It is recognised that little progress has been made in advancing agreement between management and trade unions on allowing both public and civil service staff to transfer into State Agencies from the civil service and other State Agencies and vice versa. There has been little substantive engagement to deal with these and other human resource issues relating to the relocation of the organisations concerned. In many State Agencies the number of applicants is influenced at least in part by the overall position on Decentralisation adopted by unions representing staff in those organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">Resolution of the outstanding issues is central to the overall implementation process in the State Agencies. There is no question of this element of the Programme not proceeding. From the outset guarantees have been provided at Government level that all those employees not wishing to transfer out of Dublin will be facilitated with an alternative public service post in Dublin. It should prove possible to facilitate the transfers of those public and civil servants who wish, also on a voluntary basis, to relocate to provincial locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">It is recognised that proposals for inter-organisational mobility go against traditional employment practices but it is precisely this type of ground-breaking initiative which is needed to give impetus to the implementation of the programme. While the Civil Service has had the opportunity to develop an understanding of the decentralisation process over the years, this has not perhaps happened to the same extent with State Agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1228">I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 139 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">I attended the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers of the EU, or Ecofin as it is popularly referred to, in Brussels on 5 May 2006. The meeting was attended by representatives of all 25 EU Member States and of Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">The Council agreed its comments on the economic aspects of the EU's sustainable development strategy. These comments will form part of the input into the meeting of the European Council of Heads of State or Government on 15/16 June. The comments underline the need for proper impact assessments of new investments and the role of market-based instruments in promoting sustainable development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">The Commission presented its preliminary draft of the EU budget for 2007 to the meeting. This is the first annual budget within the new financial framework to guide the EU finances up to 2013, agreed at the December 2005 European Council. The next major step in the process for the 2007 budget will be the Ecofin (Budget) Council's conciliation meeting with a European Parliament delegation on 14 July, after which the Council will adopt its first reading. We will be ensuring that Irish interests are fully safeguarded in these budget negotiations that will be concluded towards the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">Commission Vice-President Kallas presented the Commission's Action Plan on an integrated internal control framework. This Plan sets out the actions that the Commission considers that the EU needs to take to ensure more effective and efficient control of EU funds. No decisions by Council were required at the meeting, as this was simply a formal presentation of the Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">The Austrian Presidency presented a package of measures on three dossiers dealing with VAT arrangements for business. The dossiers concerned were place of supply of services as concerns VAT payments, simplification of cross border VAT obligations and refund procedures, and the prolongation of an EU directive on VAT arrangements for e-commerce. Some Member States raised technical and policy issues which will be discussed further at the 7 June Ecofin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">With regard to financial services, the Council adopted conclusions on financial supervision, on Cross Border Consolidation and on the Commission's White Paper on Financial Services Policy for the 2005-2010 period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">Finally, Ministers participated in a special Ministerial Dialogue with their counterparts from the EU acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, and the candidate countries, Croatia and Turkey. Joint conclusions and opinions were issued by Ministers on the basis of the 2005 Pre-Accession Programmes of the countries concerned. Bulgaria and Romania are scheduled to join the EU on 1 January 2007, while accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey commenced in October 2005 and are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">It will be evident from this list of items disposed of that the meeting was productive in terms of pushing forward with the business of the Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_1239">Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness. The Government is doing its bit to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies. In addition, we have not increased excise duties for the last two years, and we are promoting greater price competition by removing the Groceries Order. We are also looking for a reasonable wage deal in order to maintain and improve our international competitiveness. We are investing in public infrastructure which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services and keep inflation down in the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1244">While many staff have opted to move to locations outside of Dublin, others have indicated that they wish to be assigned to posts remaining in Dublin. The Government is committed to facilitating those who wish to remain with a public service post in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">There is an extensive range of preparations ongoing in relation to the acquisition of property by the OPW, as well as the detailed implementation planning within individual Departments, Offices and Agencies, and ongoing discussions with unions in relation to the various human resource aspects of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">As always when dealing with a programme of this size there are challenges to overcome but I remain confident that these can be addressed with the active co-operation of all parties involved in the implementation effort.</p>

The information in this report has been carefully considered as regards the tax liabilities of the persons concerned. In addition, Revenue made a further application to the High Court for access to the supporting papers to the High Court Inspectors' Report. The High Court order in the matter was granted in June 2004 and perfected in January 2005 and allows for access to documents relating to clients of Ansbacher named in the High Court Inspectors' Report and those persons and companies, including members of the board, found by the High Court Inspectors to have failed to co-operate with their inquiry. The order also allows for Revenue to make application and grounding affidavit for the obtaining of information and documents relating to any other individual or company. Access to documents is subject to the direction of the High Court.

            <p eId="para_1274">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available at this time which would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be provided. Section 13 of the Finance Act 2006 introduced the childminding tax exemption. Where the gross annual income from the provision of childcare services does not exceed €10,000, the income is fully exempt from tax. To avail of this relief, the care provider must be self-employed (not an employee) and include the gross income in their annual return of income to the Revenue Commissioners. The claim for tax exemption is made in this return. The claim must be accompanied by evidence that the care provider has notified the person recognised for that purpose by the Health Service Executive. In practice, this will mean the officer appointed by the local City or County Childcare Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">An individual must ‘elect' to claim the exemption by notice in writing to the inspector on or before the specified return date for the chargeable period.

            <p eId="para_1277">In its recent recommendation in a dispute between SIPTU and FÁS concerning Decentralisation and FÁS contracts of employment, the Labour Court recommended that the matter be referred back to the appropriate central body, at which the issues should be teased out with a view to arriving at agreed long-term solutions, in consultation with all the parties involved. In addition, I understand that, subsequent to the Labour Court recommendation, the Labour Relations Commission has held three conciliation conferences on the matter and is in ongoing contact with the parties. I am confident that the use of the recognised industrial relations procedures will lead to a resolution of the issues in dispute. It is important to recognise, however, that the Labour Court recommendation related to a particular State Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">It would not be true to say that promotions are confined only to persons willing to decentralise. For example, agreement has already been reached on a number of human resource and industrial relations issues with the general service unions, including an agreement on promotions which provides opportunities for personnel willing to decentralise as well as those who wish to remain in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">The position in relation to the State Agencies is of course more complex and the current dispute at FÁS highlights some of those complexities. The Government has always said that this process is voluntary. Any staff member wishing to remain in Dublin will be accommodated with a public service job in Dublin. However, there is a need to balance the business needs of the organisation in furthering its relocation objective with the needs of staff remaining in Dublin. In these circumstances promotions policy must take account of the reality of Decentralisation. These issues can only be resolved through dialogue and negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">The Decentralisation Implementation Group recognises that resolution of outstanding human resources issues is central to the overall implementation process in the State Agencies. It recognised, for example, that proposals for inter-organisational mobility go against traditional employment practices. Nevertheless, it considers that it should prove possible to facilitate the transfers of those public and civil servants who wish, also on a voluntary basis, to relocate to provincial locations. In its view, it is precisely this type of ground-breaking initiative which is needed to give impetus to the implementation of the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1282">Inflation, as measured by annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was 3.8% in April. A large part of the recent pick-up in the inflation rate is due to external factors such as higher oil prices and interest rate increases by the ECB.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">On Budget day, my Department forecast that CPI inflation will average 2.7% in 2006. This forecast was calculated using the usual technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. My Department will publish new forecasts in the Autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">Talks on a new national partnership agreement to follow Sustaining Progress are ongoing and it would be imprudent to make any detailed statement at this stage about these talks.

We must maintain and improve the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for inward foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">Fundamentally, the cornerstone of a new agreement must be the protection of the long- term competitiveness of the country. If pay increases under the next agreement are not kept at a moderate level and do not take account of pay levels in competitor countries, we will see job losses in vulnerable parts of the private sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1346">The Deputy is referring to the amendment to Article 12 of the Sixth VAT Directive, which allows Member States to apply the reduced VAT rate to supplies of natural gas, electricity and district heating provided that no risk of a distortion of competition exists. However, the position is that under Irish law the supplies of fuel used to create heat or light are already subject to the reduced rate of VAT of 13.5 per cent. Under Article 28 (2)(e) of the Sixth VAT Directive the supply of fuel is subject to the reduced VAT rate. This Article allows Member States, which at 1 January 1991 applied a reduced rate to supplies of goods and services other than those specified in Annex H of the Sixth VAT Directive, to apply a reduced rate provided for in Article 12(3) to such supplies. Under EU law Member States can continue to apply reduced rates in such cases provided the rate is not below 12%. Such a reduction in the reduced VAT rate, while having a significant Exchequer cost, would have little or no impact on the retail price of such products.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347">It should also be noted that the Council decision referred to by the Deputy would not have any impact on the rate of VAT applicable to alternative energy systems which are subject to the standard rate of VAT. In Ireland the standard rate of VAT is 21%.</p>

            <p eId="para_1349">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Investigations and Prosecutions Division was established in the course of the comprehensive restructuring of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which took place during 2002 and 2003. The Division spearheads the Revenue drive to combat serious non-compliance in relation to tax and duties. It carries out the work in conjunction with the Revenue Regions and the Large Cases Division. It has a remit to co-ordinate all Revenue prosecution activity with the aim of increasing the number of criminal prosecutions for serious tax and duty offences and to co-ordinate the major Special Investigations Projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">In the area of criminal investigation and prosecution, there were 24 convictions for serious tax and duty evasion in 2005, including two guilty pleas, for which sentencing was adjourned. Custodial sentences totalling 12 years (suspended in some cases) were imposed as well as fines totalling €237,052. There are currently 61 serious cases under investigation for potential prosecution, the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering a further 12 cases and has given directions to prosecute in another 8. There are in addition, 20 cases currently in the court process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">The Special Investigations Project, involving the Bogus Non-Resident accounts, Offshore Assets, Single Premium Insurance Policies, National Irish Bank/Clerical Medical Insurance, Ansbacher and cases emerging from the work of several Tribunals have resulted in recoveries, from 30,000 non-compliers, of around €2.2 billion in tax, penalties and interest for the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">The Division, in addition, has responsibility for matters such as the co-ordination of the approach to cross-border VAT fraud, criminal cash seizures, serious cases of smuggling involving tobacco and other products, oil laundering and other fraudulent activity and deepening the formal and informal links with other agencies, both national and international, in the pursuit of these goals. In addition, it is responsible for co-ordinating the Revenue commitment to the supply side objectives of the National Drugs Strategy. During 2005 the Revenue Customs Service seized illegal drugs with a street value of €37 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1353">The Investigations and Prosecutions Division's central role in the drive against serious tax and duty fraud needs to be viewed in the broader strategic context in which Revenue restructuring took place. There are now 16 Divisions in Revenue, each with its own particular responsibilities and they act in an integrated and interdependent manner tackling non-compliant taxpayers on a cross tax-head basis. This approach is underpinned by the use of technology-based risk assessment tools to focus on areas and individuals posing the greatest threat to the Exchequer. The latest figures indicate that this approach is bearing fruit.</p>

            <p eId="para_1361">On the broader issue referred to by the Deputy I am advised by Revenue that they have an active programme of monitoring new company registrations for tax purposes with a view to identifying new company formations designed mainly to avoid tax liabilities. Where they identify such cases, they will and do take robust collection and enforcement action to counteract such activity when non or late tax compliance occurs in the new company. Such action may include petitioning the court for the appointment of a liquidator and through that process and in conjunction with the Director of Corporate Enforcement, if appropriate, seeking to have the behaviour of the directors examined with a view to restriction or disqualification. Such action is in addition to action taken to recover debts due by the old company and to address the behaviour of the directors of the old company. The liquidation action and subsequent processes are undertaken in accordance with and subject to company law.</p>

For this to happen, essential elements of the roll out must be in place including adequate staffing, effective training and quality assurance programmes. Capital funding in the region of €21m has been made available to provide static screening units and five mobile units. My Department made additional revenue funding of €2.3m available to BreastCheck this year and approval has been given for an additional 69 posts to facilitate roll-out. BreastCheck is in the process of shortlisting applicants to construct the new clinical units at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, Cork and University College Hospital Galway. BreastCheck recently interviewed for Clinical Directors for both regions and has commenced the recruitment process for other essentialstaff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">The BreastCheck clinical unit in the Southern Area at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital will have three associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary S.R., 71,188 women are in the target population for invitation to screening, or 35,594 per annum. This is expected to result in the detection of in excess of 174 cancers per year in the first round and a minimum of 87 per year in subsequent rounds. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of roll out to Southern and Western regions will be met.</p>

            <p eId="para_1434">There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements are made to provide these services. Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time. Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over. In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.

            <p eId="para_1453">I have been advised by the HSE that a number of external agencies placed technical (programming) resources with the PPARS project for configuration work related to the SAPHR software which the PPARS project utilised. These staff worked under the direction of the PPARS management team. PPARS was invoiced by the external agency for the services provided by the technical resources and the agency paid the individual contractors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">Department of Finance Circular 22/95 states that "In the case of all public sector contracts of a value of EUR 6,500 (inclusive of VAT) or more within a twelve month period the contractor ( and agent as appropriate) will be required to produce either a valid tax clearance or C2 certificate." The HSE Internal Audit report on the Procurement Process in respect of the Supply of Contract Personnel to the PPARS Project concluded that "appropriate tax clearance procedures were not followed in respect of payments to these companies."</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">The HSE has indicated to the C&amp;AG and to the Internal Auditor that tax clearance procedures have been reviewed to ensure full compliance and stated that a designated manager must be formally appointed for each major contract. Tax Clearance status must be established prior to the award of a contract. The recommendation to award a contract must include a certification by the contract manager that all policies, procedures and other requirements (including tax clearance) have been complied with in the tender process. This procedure will be further strengthened when the composite Financial Regulations of the HSE are introduced later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">The recommendations of the Internal Auditor arising from his audit of this matter have been supported by the CEO of the HSE who has also stated that under the HSE's National Procurement Policy which came into effect on 1st January 2006 "there are now no acceptable excuses for non compliance". Professor Drumm has also indicated that he has asked the National Director of Finance, HSE, to ensure all necessary procurement and financial procedures are being followed by the PPARS project office.</p>

            <p eId="para_1458">The Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the ‘Development of Human Resources management System for the Health Services (PPARS)' published in December last year stated in relation to procurement that: "A competition for the procurement of technical configuration and support contractors was held in November 2002, one year after the PPARS National Project Team has begin to engage personnel on an ad hoc basis through recruitment agencies. Notwithstanding the results of this competition, there does not appear to have been any change in the companies engaged in this work. Companies that had not been involved up to then, but ranked well on price, were not engaged. Even after this procurement round the actual rates paid to a number of the companies who submitted tenders were higher than their tendered rates. The HSE is currently reviewing the arrangements that were used to procure these services."</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">I have been advised further by the HSE as follows: The report of the HSE's Internal Audit unit on this matter found that: "The procurement process in respect of the recruitment of the companies to provide technical contractors for a number of the years examined (November 2001 to May 2003) was not carried out in accordance with the appropriate Financial Regulations and Procurement Policies and Procedures."</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">It is important to note that this Internal Audit Report has not attached any irregularities or impropriety to any staff member in relation to the selection of, the use of, or expenditure on technical contractors. Furthermore previous and subsequent PPARS procurement initiatives were carried out in accordance with the appropriate Financial Regulations and Procurement Policies and Procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">The breach of policy related to not advertising requesting companies to participate in a process to provide contract staff. Resources were sourced from companies who had offered staff and the remainder were sourced on the basis of recommendations from existing consultants. The fact that contract personnel engaged by the PPARS project were subsequently engaged by the PPARS Technical Implementation Partner endorses those contractors' experience and capability. Finally, subsequent PPARS procurement processes support the fact that rates charged by contractors represented good value.</p>

            <p eId="para_1837">The Health Strategy set as a target that no public patient should wait longer than three months for in-patient treatment in hospital following referral from an out-patient department. Responsibility for the collection and reporting of data on waiting times now rests with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). It has developed the Patient Treatment Register (PTR), which provides, for the first time, verified information on actual patients on public in-patient and day-case waiting lists. The latest figures from the PTR show that for the 20 most common surgical procedures, 85% of patients are waiting less than 6 months for treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">Nineteen hospitals are currently included in the PTR. It is intended to complete the roll-out of the PTR to all acute hospitals by the end of this year. The NTPF advises anyone waiting more than three months for an operation to contact it as, in most instances, treatment can be arranged for them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1841">In 2005, I asked the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to examine the needs of patients waiting longest for hospital out-patient appointments. As a result, the NTPF set up a number of out-patient pilot projects around the country. The outcome was that approximately 4,400 persons, who had been waiting longest in a number of specialties, were given out-patient appointments in private hospitals. An additional 3,100 patients were removed from out-patient waiting lists as part of a validation process. In 2006 the NTPF proposes to build on the progress made in 2005 by arranging out-patient appointments for a further 6,000 patients.</p>

The Health Service Executive announced the following on 11 May: "Following a joint initiative by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Irish Medical Organisation, (IMO) negotiations have been ongoing for the past number of weeks with a view to establishing an out-of-hours GP based Co-operative to serve the population of North Dublin. These negotiations have made considerable progress to date and it is anticipated that a successful conclusion will be arrived at in the next few weeks. The agreement will provide for the establishment of an enhanced urgent out-of-hours GP Service commencing in September 2006. The co-operative model in this agreement is based on the model successfully in operation in other parts of the country. The HSE, the IMO and the General Practitioners in North Dublin are committed to enhancing the services available to the population of North Dublin."</p>

            <p eId="para_1845">I presume that the Deputy is referring to a suggestion made by a consultancy firm, Tribal Secta, which was commissioned by the Health Service Executive to carry out a mapping and efficiency exercise across ten acute hospitals. The consultants were asked to identify blockages, causes and potential solutions in the patient's journey from the decision to admit from the Emergency Department, to discharge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1846">The Report refers to a significant number of patients in the acute hospitals in question who had completed the acute phase of their care but could not be discharged to a more appropriate setting for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons identified was a shortage of appropriate care and convalescence facilities for older people. Another was that the families or carers of patients do not always accept the first placement that becomes available and sometimes refuse to allow patients to be discharged from hospital. The Report suggested that hospitals might consider imposing charges in such cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1847">Providing more sub-acute care options is an important and integral part of the measures being taken to tackle problems in A &amp; E departments. So far this year, 350 patients have been discharged from acute hospitals to intermediate care beds; additional home care packages have facilitated the discharge of a further 200 patients, and over 250 patients have been discharged under the private nursing homes initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">The inter-Departmental Working Group on long-term care for older people has submitted its report to Government, where it is under consideration. In relation to long-term care capacity, the HSE is preparing a report on such capacity for my Department and it is expected that this report will be available over the next few weeks. I have not received and am not considering any submission suggesting the charging measure in the Tribal Secta report.</p>

            <p eId="para_1852">The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, "A Vision for Change", which was published on 24 January 2006, recommends that plans be drawn up for the closure of all mental hospitals. The closure of large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, together with the expansion of community services, has been Government policy since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">In "A Vision for Change", a four-stage process is recommended for the closure of the hospitals, as follows: Stage 1 — identify measures required to enable admission to cease and put these measures in place; Stage 2 — cease admission to the hospital and draw up plans for relocations of existing patients; Stage 3 — implement plans for the relocation of existing patients; and Stage 4 — the final closure of the hospital. The recommendations in the Report have been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">The Health Service Executive has stated that it anticipates the closure of mental hospitals and the reinvestment of the proceeds to take place on a phased basis. It has also emphasised that hospitals can only close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings such as additional community residences, day hospitals and day centres together with a substantial increase in the number of well trained, fully staffed, community-based multidisciplinary Community Mental Health Teams as is recommended in "A Vision for Change".</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">As the Deputy may be aware, under the Health Act 2004, the management and delivery of health and personal social service are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.

            <p eId="para_1978">Under arrangements for public hospitals introduced in June 1991, on foot of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, everyone, regardless of income is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Private patients are liable for both the appropriate accommodation charges and consultants' fees in addition to the statutory charges. The proportion of the population availing of private health insurance has continued to increase since this legislation was enacted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1979">Over 50% of the Irish population now avail of private health insurance in addition to their eligibility for public hospital services. A Market Review commissioned by the Health Insurance Authority, and published in September 2005, reaffirmed earlier research by the same organisation that people considered hospital treatment as the most important aspect of private health insurance (77% of all responses), while only 11% of individuals thought hospital accommodation the most important aspect of their cover. As stated in the Government's 2001 Health Strategy, "private health insurance will continue to play a vital part in the overall resourcing of health care in this country".</p>

The Government will continue to control and regulate numbers employed in the public service within agreed ceilings. Organisations can recruit staff within the overall ceiling which has been agreed for their sector. It is a matter for each individual Department and sector of the public service and relevant Minister to set priorities to give effect to this policy. The agreed ceiling for the local authority sector is 33,300.</p>

These include: the 5 year rolling multi-annual capital envelopes for public capital investment introduced in Budget 2004; new guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure in February 2005; proposed reforms to public procurement and the introduction of public private partnerships to procure suitable projects; value for money measures on procurement, ICT projects and consultancies in October 2005 which include provision for fixed priced contracts as the norm, full cost benefit analysis of capital projects over €30 million, audit of these major capital projects, the appointment of an individual as project manager for major capital and ICT projects and peer review of major ICT projects; and the Government's plans for reform of the Estimates and Budgetary process which I announced in Budget 2006. From 2007, Ministers will be submitting an annual output statement in tandem with their Estimates to facilitate Dáil consideration of the Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2032">In addition to the above, I am planning improvements to the operation of the expenditure review initiative which will see a further element of the new robust framework for better public expenditure management and enhanced value for money put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_2034">As the Deputy will be aware, the 2005 Budget introduced a stamp duty relieving measure for first-time house purchasers who are owner-occupiers of second-hand houses by increasing the stamp duty exemption threshold for such purchasers from €190,500 to €317,500 and by having reduced rates for house values up to €635,000. Any further changes to the stamp duty regime are a matter for the Budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_2109">The National Development Plan (NDP) provides an indicative expenditure profile for each of the seven Operational Programmes for the Border, Midland and Western (BMW) and Southern and Eastern (S&amp;E) Regions for each year 2000 to 2006. These Operational Programmes are: Economic and Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Resources Development, Productive Sector, Border, Midlands and Western, Southern and Eastern, Technical Assistance and the Peace Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">The profiles for spending under each Operational Programme were set in 2000 when the Programmes were being prepared and to ensure consistency of reporting, have remained at that level. The funding requirements in the NDP are subject to a number of factors which, over time have implications for the physical level of output and impact on the level of funding required during the term of the Plan. Factors include, for example, the level of demand for schemes and for grants from the private sector, re-specification of projects, delays in the planning process and the performance of particular sectors such as the weakened tourism and agriculture sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2111">For non co-financed measures in the BMW region to the end of 2005, the indicative profiles for public expenditure, including exchequer financed expenditure, is €11.9 billion and for private expenditure it is €1.67 billion. Based on the most recent information reported to my Department, exchequer and other public expenditure on these measures, to the end of 2005, stands at €9.7 billion representing 81% of original profile. Private expenditure on these measures to the end of 2005 stands at €418 million to the end of 2005, representing 25% of original profile.</p>
            <p eId="para_2112">Progress on the implementation of the NDP is subject to ongoing monitoring through the individual Operational Programme Monitoring Committees and the overarching NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee chaired by my Department. This Committee which monitors overall progress on the Plan, is comprised of a wide partnership of interests, including implementing Departments, the social partners, sectoral interests, and members of local authorities representing the regional assemblies. It is scheduled to meet on 25th May 2006 at which stage it will have considered the progress reports of the individual Operational Programmes for the period January 2000 to end December 2005. Following this meeting, my Department will be communicating with Departments to ensure they continue to prioritise spending in the BMW region.</p>
            <p eId="para_2113">National development planning and investment is an ongoing process and investment to achieve more balanced regional development is a key government priority. This has been underscored by the publication of the National Spatial Strategy (NSS). The implementation of the NSS, which sets out the Government strategy for achieving balanced regional development, will be a central element of the next National Development Plan (2007-2013) whose preparation is now under way. The new National Development Plan will build on the achievements of the current NDP and continue progress towards ensuring a more balanced distribution of development in the country.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2137">I propose to take Questions Nos. 260 and 261 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to certain limit) on the purchase of a car adapted for the transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car up to a certain limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2139">The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. A person must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2140">(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2141">(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2142">(c) be without both hands or without both arms;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2143">(d) be without one or both legs;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2144">(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2145">(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">The scheme has been in operation in some form since 1968. As regards changes to the medical/ disability criteria: only criterion (a) was in place up to 1989, when they were expanded by the addition of (b), (c), (d) and (f); and in 1994, the final criterion at (e) was added.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant Health Service Executive area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the SMO to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme. The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">In respect of the long-term recommendations, which included the qualifying disability criteria, I should say that given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after very careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">The best way of addressing the transport needs of people with disabilities including the effectiveness, suitability or otherwise of the Disabled Drivers Scheme in that regard will be progressed in consultation with the other Departments who have responsibility in this area. In any event, a car tax concession scheme can obviously play only a partial role in dealing with the broader issue of transport needs or difficulties experienced by persons with various disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">With regard to costing the addition to the scheme of either of the following cohorts — (i) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of one arm, or (ii) persons with a severe mental or physical disability, the Deputy will appreciate that this is not feasible, as it is not possible to estimate the numbers that might satisfy either of the criteria, particularly the latter, nor the number of such persons who might have the use of a car and wish to avail of the scheme. However, the average total annualised value of the benefits of the scheme is estimated at around €5,500 per claimant.</p>

            <p eId="para_2300">It is assumed that what the Deputy means is that the employee (PAYE) tax credit would be abolished and the personal tax credit would be correspondingly increased by €1,490 for a single person and by €2,980 for a married couple.</p>
            <p eId="para_2301">The position is that the PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax position of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis. The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2302">There have been changes since 1980; the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis, for example. However, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit. Moreover, given that there can be significant timing advantages in the payment of tax for the self-employed, the employee credit is still perceived as necessary to ensure a balance in the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2303">I do not believe that the provisions of the European Convention on the Social Protection of Farmers, which was agreed in 1977 and has not been signed or ratified by any Irish Government, would have any implications for the employee tax credit.</p>

The Commission is independent of Government in the exercise of its functions. It controls and manages the Fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement the Fund's investment strategy in accordance with the Fund investment policy set out in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. This investment policy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term subject to prudent risk management. Under the legislation, the Commission is required to publish its Annual Report and Accounts within six months of the end of the financial year to which they relate. The Report is required to contain a detailed list of the Fund's assets at year-end. In its Annual Report for 2004 (the most recently published) the Commission announced that, in the context of broadening its asset allocation strategy to include new asset classes, it intends to invest in forestry.</p>

The stamp duty on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes has existed for many years with no exemptions of the kind referred to by the deputy. When electronic means of money transfers were subsequently introduced, stamp duty was gradually extended to these products to ensure that the stamp duty from cheques etc. was not eroded. I do not believe that the current charges on bank cards are either excessive or act as a disincentive for pensioners using financial institutions and there are no plans to introduce exemptions to stamp duty for any category of individual.</p>

            <p eId="para_2411">The Office of Public Works met with Kildare County Council on 31st March 2006 and agreed to undertake a Local Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study for the Rye River, encompassing the towns of Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock. This will ultimately form part of a Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study for the entire Liffey Catchment, which it is planned to undertake at a later stage. The Office of Public Works agreed to prioritise this section of the study at the request of Kildare County Council in light of the existing flood risk and development pressure in the area. Work will commence as soon as possible. Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Plans provide a strategic overview of a river catchment and a context within which decisions on the most appropriate measures to manage existing and potential flood risk. Subject to availability of funds, works recommended by the study which are economically and environmentally sustainable will be funded by the Office of Public Works within its overall Flood Management Policy. It is expected that it would take approximately 18 months to complete such a study of the Rye. Kildare County Council will continue with studies currently underway by ESBI in Leixlip and environs. In the context of this arrangement the OPW will be willing to consider with Kildare County Council whether elements of work recommended by the studies could be regarded with reasonable certainty as likely to be compatible with the recommendations of the Rye CFRAM study. OPW is willing to consider providing funding to KCC to carry out such works if they can be shown to be economically and environmentally sustainable.</p>

            <p eId="para_2415">As the Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service. As part of a review of policy on the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service, my Department commissioned independent research on the operation of the 3% employment target. A survey carried out as part of this research which was published as "Employment and Career Progression of people with a disability in the Irish Civil Service" (IPA 2002), shows that 7% of Civil Service staff have a disability. I can assure the Deputy that the Government gives a high priority to policy in this area. A number of significant initiatives have been taken recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_2416">The Department of Finance has recruited a Disability Advisory Officer to develop guidelines in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer for the monitoring, reporting and recording arrangements for staff with a disability in the Civil Service. My Department is working with the National Disability Authority to explore potential new approaches to supporting staff with disabilities, including the possible use of a survey based on voluntary self-disclosure, both for new staff on appointment and for existing staff. A Disability Liaison Officers network involving all Departments has also been set up to share information and advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2417">It is also important that the Civil Service continues to offer employment opportunities to people with disabilities. In light of the research and the independent consultants' recommendations in relation to recruitment, discussions are taking place with the Public Appointments Service about putting in place a programme of targeted recruitment for the Civil Service. It is expected that the programme will begin in the autumn. In addition, I should also mention that, this summer, every Government Department and a number of Offices are supporting a project entitled WAM (Willing Able and Mentoring) whereby summer work experience placements will be offered to graduates with disabilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2419">The Civil Service has had family friendly working arrangements available for nearly 20 years. The schemes are available in all areas of the Civil Service. The main schemes are worksharing, flexitime and term time. Worksharing allows staff to job share or to adopt a part-time attendance pattern, subject to the business requirements. Flexitime gives staff flexibility to vary their starting and finishing times. Term Time allows staff with children up to 18 years of age to take either 8, 10 or 13 weeks unpaid leave from June until the end of August to match their working arrangements to their children's summer holidays. In addition the Civil Service also allows staff to take up to two career breaks during their career. A career break is a period of unpaid leave from work of between six months and five years. The Civil Service also provides crèche facilities in a number of locations, including Mount Street and Marlborough Street in Dublin, Athlone, Ennis, Sligo and Backweston, Celbridge. Family friendly initiatives allow staff the flexibility they need to manage their family commitments while contributing fully in the workplace. Family friendly policies make a vital contribution to the recruitment and retention of staff. Requests for access to work life balance schemes are facilitated as far as possible, subject to business requirements. The Civil Service is acknowledged as offering the widest range of flexible and family friendly options and participation rates are much higher than in equivalent employment in the private sector.</p>

Where it is felt that loss or damage has been suffered as a result of the works, it is open to the party concerned to submit a claim for compensation upon completion of the scheme. It should be noted that any benefit incurred to a property as a result of the scheme works is offset against any losses sustained. All compensation claims received have not yet been settled. Repairs to the houses at Johns Quays which were affected by the flood relief scheme are not yet complete. OPW has been in touch with the owners of the properties affected and matters are progressing.

            <p eId="para_2431">To date property acquisitions relating to the Government's decentralisation programme have been completed or significantly advanced in 25 locations. The particular solutions in these locations include State owned sites, sites purchased from local authorities, private individuals and purchases and leases of existing buildings. The estimated total committed expenditure in these 25 locations is €42.7 million excluding VAT. Suitable solutions have been identified in another 14 locations and negotiations to acquire these are ongoing. The overall site acquisition cost of the entire decentralisation programme is expected to be in the region of €75 million to €100 million, excluding VAT. The prices paid to the date for sites are considered by the OPW to be in line with market prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2432">It is estimated that approximately 210,00 sq. m of office space will be required to accommodate the total numbers included in the programme. OPW cost norms (April 2005) in respect of offices would indicate an average build-cost to fit-out standard, in the range of €1,800 to €2,200 per square metre for suburban / rural locations and €2,500 to €3,000 per square metre in city/town centre locations. Such figures exclude VAT, professional fees and inflation. In addition the cost of equipping the accommodation to standard office equipment levels could be estimated at approximately €4,000 per person. This would exclude the cost of Information and Communication Technology and specialised equipment requirements. Such general measurements of cost do not include specialised facility and equipment requirements and other variables which would arise from the spread of possible procurement methodologies. In addition general cost indicators of this type show a snapshot in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2433">It is self-evident that a firmer scale of costs for the decentralisation programme will only emerge on foot of actual cost proposals being received from the market. It will be some months yet before sufficient data can be extracted from a suitable range of tender competitions to provide a basis on which more robust estimates of the overall cost of the programme can be made. Nevertheless, it can be estimated that, generally speaking, the cost of providing accommodation in provincial, compared to central Dublin locations should yield considerable cost savings to the State over time in terms of site costs, capital build costs and indeed maintenance costs. The receipts accruing to the Exchequer from the disposal of surplus buildings in Dublin in the context of the Government's Asset Transformation programme to date exceed €345 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_2435">I would like to state the Government's full commitment to the decentralisation programme. The Decentralisation Implementation Group, chaired by Mr. Finbarr Flood, was established to drive the process forward and to oversee its effective delivery. The Group, recognising that it would not be feasible for all organisations to move at the same time, proposed phasing arrangements and revised timeframes out to 2009 for civil service organisations. These arrangements were accepted by Government and announced in June of last year and I am satisfied that good progress continues to be made. I understand that the Decentralisation Implementation Group has met a number of Secretaries General and are satisfied with the level of planning in each of the Departments. The Group is meeting the Chief Executives of a number of State Agencies to discuss the planning framework in place, to assess progress to date and to hear about the challenges arising and steps proposed to address them. The figures confirm that this is a popular programme among staff. Over 10,600 civil and public servants have applied to the Central Applications Facility. To date some 1,500 people have been assigned to posts destined for new locations and are being trained in their new role in readiness to move. So far, some 200 of these have actually relocated and it is expected that up to 1,000 will have moved by the end of the year. There is an extensive range of preparations ongoing in relation to the acquisition of property by the OPW, as well as the detailed implementation planning within individual Departments, Offices and Agencies, and ongoing discussions with unions in relation to the various human resource aspects of the programme. As always when dealing with a programme of this size there are challenges to overcome but I am confident that these can be addressed with the active co-operation of all parties involved in the implementation effort.</p>

            <p eId="para_2437">House price inflation has been accelerating since September 2005. According to the ESRI Permanent TSB house price index, the year on year growth rate increased from 6.2% year on year to September to 12.1% year on year to March 2006. The Financial Regulator has already drawn attention to the need for lenders to act prudently in extending credit, especially for house purchase, and for borrowers to carefully consider their ability to service borrowings. The Regulator recently introduced a technical prudential measure requiring financial institutions to put more capital aside for higher "Loan to Value" loans. This measure reinforces the message consistently conveyed to lending institutions by the Financial Regulator that mortgage lending policies and practices should be prudent and responsible. The Financial Regulator's proposal is informed by trends and developments in the mortgage market, for example, the introduction and growth of 100% mortgages. The action is strictly of a precautionary prudential nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_2438">In the case of housing loans, mortgage providers are specifically obliged under the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to inform borrowers of the effect on the amount of their repayment instalments of a 1% increase in interest rates in the first year of their mortgages. A number of specific initiatives have been developed to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products. Mortgage lending practices are closely supervised by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank who require lenders to conduct appropriate stress testing of borrowers' ability to meet their obligations, not just in the current economically favourable circumstances, but also in more challenging times.</p>

A large proportion of the rise in the annual inflation rate is due to external factors such as higher oil prices and recent rises in interest rates by the ECB. Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness. The Government is taking positive actions to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies. In addition, we have not increased excise duties for the last two years, and we are promoting greater price competition by removing the Groceries Order. We are also looking for a reasonable wage deal in order to maintain and improve our international competitiveness. We are also investing in public infrastructure which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services and keep inflation down in the process.</p>

Departments and agencies are required to procure projects, goods and services on a value for money basis. The value for money framework which applies to all public bodies includes:</p>
            <p eId="para_2454">•the 5 year rolling multi-annual capital envelopes for public capital investment introduced in Budget 2004;</p>
            <p eId="para_2455">•new guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure in February 2005;</p>

            <p eId="para_2457">•value for money measures announced in October 2005 in relation to procurement, ICT projects and consultancies which include provision for fixed priced construction contracts as the norm, full cost benefit analysis of capital projects over €30 million, audit of these major capital projects, the appointment of an individual as project manager for major capital and ICT projects and peer review of major ICT projects. These and related requirements are now codified in Department of Finance Circular Letter of 25 of January, 2006 to Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2458">Departments and implementing agencies are responsible for ensuring that the public procurement function is discharged honestly, fairly, and in a manner that secures best value for public money. The Management Committees of Departments and the Boards of public bodies must ensure that there is an appropriate focus on good practice in procurement and that procedures are in place to ensure compliance with relevant legislation and guidelines. Departments, in the main, approve contracts under delegated authority from my Department. I am satisfied that these initiatives and the greater focus on best practice that I expect from all within the public service will help deliver improved value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

The closing date for receipt of applications was 1 November 2005. Sixty-four applications were received on time by BIM, which is the implementing authority for the scheme. Letters of offer totalling €22,508,000 in grant aid issued to forty-four applicants under two rounds of approvals in November 2005 and February 2006. However, not all of the successful applicants have accepted the offer of grant aid.</p>

BIM advise me that funds are available to pay the balance of grant aid allocated to vessels, however, some applicants still have to provide the required documentation in respect of the offer of grant aid. In a small number of cases matters have arisen in relation to the information necessary to underpin the grant application. Discussions are ongoing with the owners concerned with a view to bringing matters to a conclusion as early as possible. A detailed breakdown of grant aid approved and paid to date by County, Owner and Vessel is provided below for the Deputy's information.</p>

     if the oil field in Lanimor belongs to East Timor under international law; and if he will raise this matter with Mr. John Howard, the Australian Prime Minister and Mr Alexander Downer, the Australian Foreign Minster.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2749">I understand that there has not been any adjudication under international law with regard to the Laminaria oil field referred to in the Deputy's question. Timor Leste, or East Timor as it was formerly known, and Australia make overlapping claims to parts of the continental shelf in the Timor Sea, an area understood to contain large reserves of oil and gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2750">Under the terms of a bilateral Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea, signed by the Foreign Ministers of Australia and Timor Leste in January of this year, the two sides agreed to set aside their maritime boundary negotiations for fifty years and to share the resources of what is referred to as the Greater Sunrise field (formerly known as the Sunrise and Troubadour fields which had also been previously claimed by both countries) on a 50:50 basis. The agreement, which has yet to be ratified by the Parliaments in both countries, would also allow Australia to continue to conduct activities in relation to petroleum or other resources of the seabed and subsoil in respect of Laminaria and other remaining contested oil fields.</p>
            <p eId="para_2751">Prior to this agreement, Australia and Timor Leste concluded the Timor Sea Treaty in May 2002, which accords to Timor Leste 90% of the revenue from a "joint development area" in the Timor Sea. I understand that the Laminaria field, together with the Buffalo and Corallina fields, lie to the west of the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) as defined under the Timor Sea Treaty. This Treaty came into force on 2 April 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">It would not be appropriate for this issue to be raised with the Australian Prime Minister or Foreign Minister in the terms suggested by the question. However, Timor Leste was on the agenda for the official talks I held yesterday with Prime Minister Howard during his visit to Ireland. We had an exchange of views on the situation in Timor Leste during which I referred to Ireland's long-standing commitment to the country's political and socio-economic development.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2755">I propose to take Questions Nos. 308 and 313 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">I refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions on this issue on 17 May 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">The Government has been consistently active in promoting a lasting and peaceful settlement of the Israeli — Palestinian conflict, based on the negotiation of a mutually acceptable two-State solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2758">I share the concerns which have been expressed about the increasingly difficult situation facing the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza. The EU has been the strongest supporter of the Palestinian people internationally. It is also the largest donor to Palestine, providing an average of €500 million annually in humanitarian assistance and in support of Palestinian institutions and civil society. Since the Palestinian elections in January, the EU and the international Quartet have made it clear that the new Hamas Government of the Palestinian Authority must commit to the peace process. It must renounce violence, recognise Israel's right to exist and adhere to agreements already negotiated by the Authority and the PLO.</p>
            <p eId="para_2759">In February, the Council approved the urgent disbursement by the Commission of €121 million in humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians. While, since early April, the Commission has temporarily suspended direct assistance to the Palestinian Authority, the EU is reviewing its assistance against the Government's commitment to the principles set out by the Council and the Quartet.</p>
            <p eId="para_2760">There is full agreement among the Member States that it would be unreasonable to expect the EU to continue its capacity-building support for the Hamas Government irrespective of its willingness to respect the basic rules of the peace process. The Government believes, however, that the Palestinian people should not have to face the prospect of a humanitarian crisis because of the reluctance of their Government to meet its responsibilities. The EU is committed to continuing necessary assistance to meet the basic needs of the Palestinian population, and Ireland has argued strongly for the widest possible definition of these basic needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2761">On 15 May, following the Quartet meeting on 9 May, the Council undertook the urgent work of developing a temporary international mechanism to channel assistance directly to the Palestinian people. The Council stated that, as a matter of priority, the mechanism will aim to provide for basic needs, including health services. It will be essential that all international donors cooperate to ensure the effectiveness of the new temporary structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2762">The EU has already called on the Israeli Government to resume the transfer of withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues, which are essential in averting a crisis in the Occupied Territories. I hope that a decision to resume the transfers can be taken without delay, if possible through the new international mechanism. Equally, it is important that both the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority take concrete steps to implement their obligations under the Agreement on Movement and Access, which was signed on 15 November 2005 and which provides for the movement of people and goods between Gaza and the outside world.</p>
            <p eId="para_2763">I have given a commitment that the Government will maintain the level of Ireland's bilateral assistance to the Palestinians, which amounted to over €4 million in 2005. In February, following the Palestinian elections, the Government allocated €1.5 million in humanitarian assistance through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). I expect to make further allocations in the near future.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2765">The Cotonou Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States and the European Union (EU) provides for the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) between the Parties. The EPAs are first and foremost instruments for development that are intended to foster the smooth and gradual integration of the ACP States into the world economy, thereby promoting sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication.</p>
            <p eId="para_2766">The intention is that EPAs should create a positive environment for the private sector by enlarging ACP markets through regional integration, and by making regulatory frameworks in these countries more transparent. EPAs should therefore help develop the conditions for south-south trade, with all the benefits of new markets which this promises for the ACP countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2767">For the purposes of EPA negotiations, the ACP states are organised into six regional groupings. EPAs are intended primarily to foster trade between, as well as within, these regional groupings. As stated above, the concept of regional integration is fundamental to the EPA process. On their own, the small segmented markets of the ACP countries are poorly positioned to take advantage of the global trading system. Stronger regional integration, which will facilitate an increase in production and competitiveness, is the critical first step toward greater participation in international trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_2768">On the other hand, the EU's Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative, while offering preferential access to EU markets for all LDC exports, except arms, does not advance the process of integration in the ACP regions. As regards EPAs and competition, it is not intended that EPAs will expose ACP economies to EU competition prematurely. In this regard, Article 37,7 of the Cotonou Agreement provides that the negotiations on the EPAs "shall take account of the level of development and the socio-economic impact of trade measures on ACP countries and their capacity to adapt and adjust their economies to the liberalisation process. Negotiations will therefore be as flexible as possible in establishing the duration of a sufficient transitional period, the final product coverage, taking into account sensitive sectors, and the degree of asymmetry in terms of timetable for tariff dismantlement, while remaining in conformity with WTO rules then prevailing".</p>
            <p eId="para_2769">Or as Commissioner Mandelson has put it, "the EU is not pursuing an equal bargain in relation to our EPA partners".</p>
            <p eId="para_2770">Ireland is continuing to follow the EPA negotiations closely. A review of the negotiations is scheduled for this year. At the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg in April, which I attended, the Council asked the Commission to ensure that the review is formal and comprehensive, particularly with a view to identifying any measures necessary to ensure the timely completion of the negotiations. On several occasions, I have raised partner country concerns about EPAs with both the European Commission and Development Minister colleagues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2771">The Cotonou Agreement envisages that EPAs will come into force in 2008. Until that time, it is open to any LDC as to whether they wish to enter an EPA or not. Should they decide not to, they will continue to benefit from preferences under EBA. Ultimately the matter of whether an ACP LDC chooses to enter into an EPA is a sovereign decision for each country.</p>

            <p eId="para_2773">The Government and its EU partners have growing concerns about the protection of human rights in Iran across a wide spectrum of issues, including use of the death penalty. There appears to be a significant increase in the use of the death penalty in Iran, including the case referred to by the Deputy. Our concerns also relate to the use of the death penalty in cases of under-age offenders, lack of due process and safeguards, and the manner in which executions are carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">The EU makes these concerns known in demarches to the Iranian authorities and in public statements, as well as through action in international organisations. Most recently, on 19 April 2006, the EU issued a public statement about executions in Iran.</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">To quote from that statement, "The Union expresses its serious concern about the general increase in executions in Iran. This trend is confirmed by the ten executions carried out recently in the prison of Evin. The EU reiterates that it is, as a matter of principle, opposed to the death penalty under all circumstances and calls for its universal abolition. Where the death penalty still exists, the EU calls on states to progressively restrict its use, and insists that capital punishment could be imposed only for the most serious crimes and according to minimum standards, and that the death penalty may not be imposed on certain categories of persons such as, for example, juvenile offenders."</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">The General Affairs and External Relations Council reiterated these concerns at its most recent meeting, in Brussels on 15 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">I regret that the Iranian authorities have shown little interest in improving the protection of human rights in their country. The EU has also endeavoured to engage constructively to encourage improvements through a formal Human Rights Dialogue with Iran. The last session of this dialogue was held under the Irish EU Presidency in June 2004. Iran has for two years now failed to agree a date for the next round.</p>

            <p eId="para_2783">As the Deputy will be aware, C.J. Hambro was a distinguished Norwegian political leader in the earlier part of the last century. He was a strong supporter of Irish independence, and a particular admirer of Éamon de Valera. My Department is unaware of any approach to date to mark Mr Hambro's support for Irish independence, but I would of course be happy to consider any such request we receive.</p>

            <p eId="para_2785">I am informed that since the Agreement with the PGA European Tour to stage the Ryder Cup in Ireland was signed in 1998, total expenditure by Fáilte Ireland in securing the event and exploiting its tourism promotional benefits, will amount to €15.7 million, of which €9.4 million (60%) is committed to 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2786">The total expenditure figure includes an amount of €4.9 million paid to the PGA European Tour under the terms of the Agreement. It also includes an additional €4.5 million allocated to Fáilte Ireland in the 2006 Revised Estimates in order to support an enhanced programme of marketing and promotional activities around the Ryder Cup, including a National Branding Programme and a number of golf marketing initiatives, and support for an appropriate complementary programme of Ryder Cup related events, including the official opening and closing ceremonies and other initiatives intended to raise the profile of the occasion within Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2787">The benefits of the Ryder Cup, which will take place in the K Club, Co. Kildare, from 22-24 September, 2006, are enormous and include television coverage to over 550 million homes worldwide, with a potential audience of up to one billion viewers and the presence of over 2,000 international media personnel who will report from Ireland before and during the event.</p>
            <p eId="para_2788">It is unlikely that Ireland will ever again host a sporting event which attracts as much worldwide interest as the Ryder Cup and it is important that we continue to maximise the enormous potential that exists to capitalise on the event.</p>

            <p eId="para_3033">The Labour Inspectorate carried out an inspection of records in regard to this issue. In relation to the category of workers concerned the material examined did not indicate that the rates of pay were not in conformity with the Statutory Minimum provided for in legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3034">Inspectors, with the assistance of an independent interpreter, interviewed several employees, none of whom expressed any dissatisfaction with their pay or conditions of employment. The Inspectors selected the employees who were interviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3035">The Inspectorate understands that a ‘Good-Will Bonus' payment has been offered to the employees. In light of the continuing allegations a further examination of records, together with another round of interviews will be shortly be undertaken by the Inspectorate. As in all matters concerning non-compliance with employment rights legislation, I would urge anyone with information that would assist, to provide such material to the Labour Inspectorate who has responsibility in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3036">Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services defines a posted worker as "a worker who, for a limited period, carries out his work in the territory of a Member State other than the State in which he normally works". This Directive was transposed into Irish law by section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part Time Work) Act 2001 which provides that all employee protection legislation on the statute book in the State applies to posted workers in the same way as it applies to Irish workers. Therefore, all Irish employee protection legislation applies to the Serbian workers referred to in the Question.</p>

            <p eId="para_3106">The Competition Act 2002 prohibits anti-competitive arrangements between "undertakings" and the abuse of a dominant position by undertakings. From the information provided, it appears that this issue may relate to an alleged restriction on competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_3107">The Competition Authority is an independent statutory body responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State. Any evidence of an alleged breach of competition law should be referred to the Authority at Parnell House, 14 Parnell Square, Dublin 1. The Authority also accepts complaints by email at <i>complaints@tca.ie</i>. The Authority’s website — <i>www.tca.ie</i> — provides more information in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_3108">It is not clear, however, how a management company could prevent a householder from shopping around for insurance cover. While I am aware that such companies may seek quotations for insurance on behalf of their members, this is generally for the purpose of obtaining a more competitive quote for house owners, who would then be free to take out insurance with that insurance company, or any other from which they had separately obtained a quote.</p>

            <p eId="para_3161">Part III of the Pensions Act 1990 requires occupational pension schemes to provide preserved benefit, calculated in accordance with the normal scheme rules, for members who leave relevant employment after completing at least two years service in the pension scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3162">Part III also provides for the revaluation of such preserved defined benefits from the date of termination of employment to the date of normal retirement. The rate of revaluation, which is set out in regulations each year, is the percentage increase in the general level of consumer prices up to a maximum of 4%. The annual Consumer Price Index increase for the year 2005 was 2.5% and as such was the revaluation percentage for that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3163">The current funding standard requirements under Part IV of the Pensions Act are designed to ensure that, if a defined benefit scheme winds up, there are sufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme at that point in time. Any proposed increase in the maximum revaluation percentage from the current 4%, would therefore have to be examined in the context of the resulting increase in the funding requirements that would be placed on defined benefit pension schemes. However, current forecasts from the ESRI and from the Central Bank &amp; Financial Services Authority of Ireland are for a CPI rate of around 3% or less in 2006 and 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3164">I am anxious to ensure that a reasonable balance is struck between the protection of the interests of all scheme members and the interests of employers who sponsor and contribute to schemes.

            <p eId="para_3172">All carers who are in receipt of carer's allowance, carer's benefit, prescribed relative allowance or constant attendance allowance on the first Thursday in June will automatically receive the respite care grant without having to apply for it. Similarly, carers who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance from the Health Service Executive will automatically receive the respite care grant from the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_3173">The respite care grant was extended in 2005. Carers who do not qualify for the grant under one of the above schemes may now receive the grant if the following conditions are met: the carer must be providing full time care to a person who is in need of such care for at least 6 months. This period of care must include the first Thursday in June, and as is the case with recipients of carers allowance, a full time carer must not be engaged in employment for more than 10 hours per week (this will increase to 15 hours for the purposes of the 2006 grant).</p>

            <p eId="para_3177">Where a hard shoulder area is provided on a non-motorway road i.e. on a national primary or a national secondary road, on a regional road or on a local road, a driver is allowed to pull over onto the hard shoulder area to facilitate overtaking by faster moving vehicles in the circumstances referred to by the Deputy when it is safe to do so, and having regard to the presence of any pedestrians or cyclists etc. who are using the hard shoulder area. The situation is different in relation to hard shoulder areas on motorways. It is prohibited to drive on the hard shoulder area on a motorway or to stop or park there except if an emergency situation arises in relation to the vehicle being driven such as a mechanical defect or breakdown. The rules for traffic on motorways are set out in article 33 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 (SI No. 182 of 1997). An offence is committed if a vehicle is driven on a hard shoulder on a motorway and, on payment of a fixed charge of €80 within 28 days or that amount increased by 50% within the following 28 days, a person will have one penalty point endorsed on their driving licence record. If the person opts not to pay a fixed charge and is convicted of the offence in Court, he or she will receive three penalty points.</p>

Additions have been made to the Manual in the interim period if new situations arose, such as, for example, the design of information directional signs that may be installed on orbital routes in urban areas. A comprehensive review of the provisions of the Manual was initiated in late 2004 and is on-going with a view to identifying any areas where amendment or updating would be appropriate. This review is being carried out by consultants in conjunction with a Steering Group comprising of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Roads Authority, the County and City Managers Association and my Department. For convenience, the present Manual also provides depictions of regulatory traffic signs. These signs are prescribed in statutory regulations and details of traffic sign regulations that have been made since 1996 will also be included in the revised Manual.</p>

Local authorities had power since the passing of the Road Traffic Act 1994 to make special speed limit byelaws and Section 12 of the 2004 provided for the automatic conversion of the units of measurement from miles per hour to kilometres per hour in respect of any special speed limits that were applied under byelaws that were made prior to 20 January 2005. These bye-laws remain in force until such time as new bye-laws are made by the city or county councils under section 9 of the 2004 Act. From enquiries made I am informed that the special speed limit bye-laws that were in place prior to 20 January 2005 are still applicable across all 34 local authority areas and that 5 of the local authorities have adopted additional special speed limits. I understand that the majority of the councils either have a review of existing speed limits underway at present or are planning to do so later in 2006. A new policy element was introduced under section 10 of the 2004 Act to enable a county manager or a city manger to make a road works speed limit order to apply a road works speed limit for a limited period. This power has been and is being exercised in relation to road works locations in various areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_3209">Regulating for the control of modifications to the glazing and exhaust systems of motor vehicles give rise to certain complex issues. Before considering legislative changes in relation to these matters, I would first wish to have them examined by the proposed Road Safety Authority on its establishment. In the meantime, one of the recommendations contained in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on the mid-term review of the NCTS is the establishment of a Technical Standards Forum to consider and make recommendations in relation to vehicle technical matters associated with the NCT. It is my intention to implement that recommendation and, in that context, the matters of excessively "blacked-out" windows and modified exhausts would be referred to the Technical Standards Forum for consideration. The outcome of the work of the proposed Technical Standards Forum on these matters will assist the RSA in advising me in due course on future policy in relation to these matters.</p>

These discussions form part of a process of engagement that will facilitate and inform the determination of the appropriate structure for the new framework and supporting legislation. This process is also being informed by the work of the team of experts which was appointed to finalise the remit, structures and human resource requirements of the proposed Dublin Transport Authority.

The roll-out of these measures has commenced and applications are being invited for the specific programmes on a phased basis as the operational arrangements are finalised. With regard to funding for services dealing with domestic violence, no specific measure for this purpose is included in the proposals approved by Government under the economic and social disadvantage category. I should point out, however, that approximately €415,000 was allocated under the initial round of funding administered by the former Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board for projects dealing with domestic violence.

At the European Council in December 2005, it was agreed that member states could, on a voluntary basis, increase the rate of modulation. The modalities are to be discussed at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, probably in June. There was no agreement to increase the compulsory rate of modulation.

I understand that it was Coillte's District Manager who indicated, on behalf of the company, that it had no objection in principle to providing access. The question of granting a right of way, along with the associated public consultation, will only arise if the proposed development itself is approved by the planning authorities. The letter indicating that the Company had no objection in principle to a right of way over its lands was issued in December 2003.</p>

            <p eId="para_3276">As a member of the EU and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Ireland is in a position to avail of opportunities for trade that are essential for the development of our open economy. Membership of these organizations also brings reciprocal trade obligations. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries that have been approved by the EU authorities for export to the EU. In the current WTO discussions in the Council, I have always pressed very strongly the non-trade aspect of market access, which I regard as a crucial element in the overall negotiations. I addressed this issue at yesterday's discussions on WTO at Agriculture Council to remind the Commission once again of the importance of equivalence in standards, particularly in relation to all exporting countries, including Brazil.</p>
            <p eId="para_3277">I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from Third Countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU Member States. In this context I contacted the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Markos Kyprianou, concerning the sanitary rules applying to the import of livestock products, especially beef, into the European Union. I took the opportunity of once again raising my concerns in this regard with Commissioner Kyprianou in the margins of yesterdays Council meeting in Brussels. The Commissioner pointed out that, with respect to traceability and controls of residues of veterinary medicines, the purpose of EU legislation is not to impose on exporting third countries a system of guarantees that is equal to the EU system, but that the exporting country provides guarantees that are equivalent to the standards applied in the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_3278">The Commissioner indicated his service is committed to protect the health of European Consumers and European Livestock. Adoption of safeguard measures in relation to imports, for example in the matter of dealing with the risk to the EU of the spread of high pathogenic avian influenza, in the finding of residues of unauthorised substances in poultry meat and in the quick and proportionate protective measures applied to imports of beef as a result of the recent outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) demonstrate the Commission's primary objective of maintaining the high sanitary status of the Community and respecting the EU's commitment under the WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS agreement).</p>
            <p eId="para_3279">The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants. An EU Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) inspection to evaluate animal health and public health control systems, traceability and certification procedures in place in Brazil was carried out in September of last year. The FVO recently published its findings following a period of consultation with the Brazilian competent authorities and the review of action plans that have been submitted by the Brazilian Authorities to the Commission. This report, as well as all previous FVO reports on inspection of third countries' controls for export, may be accessed from the EU Commission's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_3280">While the report comments on a general improvement in the structure, organisation and tasks of the Brazilian Competent Authorities it has listed a number of recommendations to the authorities to address deficiencies that were recorded in the course of its audit. The Brazilian Authorities have undertaken to submit an Action Plan in response to these recommendations and my Department will continue to monitor the position. My Department is seeking assurances from the Commission that the FVO will undertake further missions to Brazil to evaluate the implementation of its action plan. At a recent meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health where the matter was again raised by Ireland, the Commission indicated to Ireland that a FVO mission is being planned to take place some time before the end of the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3281">In the meantime additional health certification requirements have been introduced for imported beef from Brazil under Commission Decision 2006/259/EC requiring guarantees concerning animal contacts, vaccination programmes and surveillance. These certification provisions took effect from 31 March 2006 and are checked by EU approved Border Inspection Posts through which all third country imports must first be presented.</p>

            <p eId="para_3286">The restructuring aid is subject to the submission by the processor of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry, following consultations with the beet growers. The reform agreement provides that at least 10% of the restructuring aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors. That percentage may be increased by Member States after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. In that context, my Department has recently issued an open call for submissions which will be subject to scrutiny by Indecon International Economic Consultants who have been appointed by the Government to provide me with independent expert advice on matters relating to the implementation of the restructuring fund. A final decision on the percentage will be made in due course having regard to this advice and following the adoption in the near future of the Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid. It is my intention that the restructuring aid will be implemented in a fair and equitable manner and strictly in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3287">The timescale for implementing the restructuring aid is very tight where restructuring takes place in the first year of the new regime especially having regard to the delay in finalisation of the Commission regulations. The Council Regulation requires that the application for restructuring aid must be made by 31 July 2006. A decision on the granting of the aid must then be made by the Member State at the latest by 30 September 2006. The Council Regulation also provides that where aid is awarded in respect of restructuring in the first year, payment will be made in two instalments, the first instalment of 40% in June 2007 and the second instalment of 60% in February 2008. Depending on the financial resources available the EU Commission may decide to split the second instalment into two payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_3303">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána as at 31 March 2006 was 12,439. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737 (or 16.2%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3304">I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that there were no Garda stations permanently closed in the Donegal Division from 2000 to date in 2006. Garda management states that in 2002, Carrick Garda Station was temporarily closed for refurbishment for a short period. In 2005, and early 2006, Glencolmcille Garda Station was temporarily closed for refurbishment and it is now open to the public again.</p>

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737 (or 16.2%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3420">The Dublin 15 area is served by Blanchardstown Garda Station, which is the Divisional Headquarters for the Dublin Metropolitan Region West Division. I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Blanchardstown Garda Station as at 31 March, 2006 was 167 (all ranks). The number of Community Gardaí based in Blanchardstown Garda Station as at 31 March, 2006 was 17 (all ranks).</p>
            <p eId="para_3421">Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p>
            <p eId="para_3422">I should also say that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the first group of newly attested Gardaí under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and a further 275 newly attested Gardaí will come on stream every 90 days from here on in.</p>
            <p eId="para_3423">The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Dublin 15 area will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_592">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3427">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána as at 31 March 2006 was 12,439. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737 (or 16.2%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3428">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the first group of newly attested Gardaí under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and a further 275 newly attested Gardaí will do so every 90 days from here on in.</p>
            <p eId="para_3429">The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3430">In addition, the OPW has made a significant investment, in the order of €20m, in the Garda College in Templemore. The primary aim of this investment, coupled with the transfer of certain in-service training to Nenagh, is to provide the college with the capacity to cater for the additional recruits required to bring the Force up to 14,000. The resulting new facilities will serve the College long into the future and ensure that the Force has top class training facilities not just for the immediate future but for the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3431">As regards costs for the Garda Vote, I am informed by the Garda authorities that allowing for the incremental expansion of the strength of the Force and the training requirements involved, the approximate Garda Vote current and capital costs of increasing the size of the force by 1,000 members are €110 million and €10 million, respectively. The equivalent current and capital costs to the Garda Vote of increasing the force for every 500 members thereafter would amount to approximately €55 million and €5 million, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_3432">Other capital costs that could arise from a future additional expansion in the strength of the Force to 15,500, such as the possible replacement or expansion of Garda Stations to accommodate the greater numbers, are not readily quantifiable at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_3436">I wish to state at the outset that none of the persons referred to by the Deputy are, or were, at any immediate risk of being deported. The reason for this is that the persons concerned have, in the main, failed one or both stages of the asylum determination process, which processes are in place for the purposes of determining, on a case by case basis, as to whether each person should or should not be deemed to come within the definition of ‘refugee' as set out in Section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended). However, none of the persons concerned have had their cases finalised pursuant to the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). Furthermore, I would advise the Deputy that one of the 41 hunger strikers entered the State in 2000 and was granted refugee status in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3437">As the Deputy may be aware, in the context of every individual failed asylum applicant, they are afforded three options vis a vis their position in the State, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 (4) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and these options are (a) to leave the State voluntarily, (b) to consent to deportation or (c) to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why they should not be deported i.e. why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Where, as happens in the great majority of cases, an application to remain temporarily in the State is submitted, the case is examined under the eleven headings specified under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), including consideration of any representations submitted by, or on behalf of, the person concerned. Each individual case is also examined having regard to Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3438">The Deputy should be aware that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a Deportation Order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries. It is only after these assessments have been carried out in each individual case can a decision be taken to issue a Deportation Order or instead to arrange for temporary leave to remain in the State to be granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_3439">Given that the persons concerned have not exhausted all statutory processes available to them, as provided for under the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the actions taken by them to circumvent these processes were totally unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_3440">Finally, I am very pleased that this situation was brought to a peaceful conclusion and for that I wish to record my appreciation to the members on An Garda Síochana and my own Department who worked tirelessly and skilfully to bring this matter to a peaceful resolution.</p>

            <p eId="para_3461">As the Deputy is aware Clondalkin is one of the 11 remaining locations nationwide which form part of the Garda CCTV programme. Following recommendations from the Garda authorities, I have approved the implementation of six new Garda CCTV systems. With the addition of these 6 new locations a total of 17 Garda Town Centre CCTV Systems, including Clondalkin, will be implemented in the following locations: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_3462">As I have indicated previously I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda Síochána in this regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3463">In recent months the Garda Síochána have conducted a thorough examination of all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV Systems. Following this review, I have recently received a comprehensive and innovative proposal for the project management and the outsourced service provision of Garda CCTV systems, including Clondalkin, from the Garda Commissioner. The Garda authorities wish to commence the initial public procurement process and I am also anxious to proceed urgently with this comprehensive request for tender to source the best CCTV service possible for Clondalkin and the other 16 locations selected. This will happen in conjunction with Section 38 of the Garda Síochána Act, 2005, which provides a legislative basis for the operation of CCTV in public places.</p>
            <p eId="para_3464">My Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract the project managers and outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems. My ambition is to have a Garda CCTV system operating in Clondalkin and in the other locations, at the earliest opportunity, subject to compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures.</p>

This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the first group of newly attested Gardaí under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and a further 275 newly attested Gardaí will do so every 90 days from here on in. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_3571">The Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. In the case of a non national applicant who is the spouse of an Irish national those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age; be of good character; be married to the Irish citizen for at least 3 years; be in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting; be living together as husband and wife with the Irish spouse; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the application and, during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the island of Ireland after naturalisation; have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3572">In other cases the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain (more rigorous) statutory conditions are fulfilled. Those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3573">In the context of naturalisation certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State; periods granted for the purposes of study; and, periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.</p>

Approximately 17,000 persons have been granted leave to remain under this scheme to date. It is open to such persons to apply for naturalisation at any time provided, of course, that at the time of their application, they comply with the statutory requirements as set out above.</p>

Any proposals to amend road traffic legislation are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport. In response to the disturbing number of road fatalities in Buncrana District a Garda Traffic Corps Unit was established in the District on a pilot basis with effect from 20 October, 2005. The Unit was in addition to the Traffic Corps personnel already operating in the Donegal Division.

Such residency is conditional on the non EU national residing in the same household in a family unit with the Irish national spouse. It has come to the attention of the Immigration Division of my Department that the person in question is no longer residing with his Irish national spouse as part of a family unit. The person concerned was given an opportunity to make representations on the change in his circumstances and following a full consideration of all the facts of the case it was decided to revoke the permission granted solely on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.</p>
            <p eId="para_3595">As he has no other separate basis on which residency can be considered, a notification of proposal to deport from the State under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 issued on 9 May 2006.

While due regard must be had to any risk which a particular release might pose, the generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be even greater if, in certain circumstances, attempts at planned reintegration were not made, since prisoners must return to the community in any event, on the expiry of their sentence</p>

            <p eId="para_3600">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of robbery and burglary offences of chemist premises recorded to date in 2006 in the Northern Division of the Dublin Metropolitan Region is 7 and 4, respectively. Figures provided are provisional, operational and liable to change. I am pleased to see that the Garda Policing Plan 2006, under the heading "Policy Reviews 2006" includes a commitment to assessing causes of the rise in crimes of burglary in 2005. This work has commenced with a view to reversing the current upward trend and identifying strategies to target this significant issue. This includes mounting special operations in particular problem areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3601">It should be borne in mind that any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population.</p>

            <p eId="para_3667">I recently received a submission from the Garda Commissioner regarding, <i>inter alia</i>, the appointment of a significant number of additional Sergeants. I intend to bring proposals to Government on this matter shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3668">Garda management advise that personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Store Street Garda Station will be fully considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_3669">I should also say that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the first group of newly attested Gardaí under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and a further 275 newly attested Gardaí will do so every 90 days from here on in. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_3674">I made the statement to which the Deputy refers in relation to the operation of the Sex Offenders Act 2001, Part 2 of which sets out notification requirements for persons convicted of certain offences. This discussion arose on 11 May 2006 in the context of the consideration by the Select Committee for Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights of my amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 aimed at introducing similar notification arrangements for persons convicted of certain drug trafficking offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_3675">I am aware that the United Kingdom provides in its laws for the courts to impose travel restriction orders on persons convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for drug trafficking offences. Such orders begin with the offender's release from custody and continue for a period of at least two years. Rather than going down this route I have opted for an approach similar to that in the 2001 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3676">In relation to the situation in other EU Countries many of them have a different approach to Ireland in relation to dealing with drug offenders and other criminals. As the Deputy will be aware in many continental EU Member States it is obligatory to register one's residence with the State or the municipal authority and to carry an identity card on your person at all times. The system in Ireland is very different and our citizens are not obliged to carry an identity card or to inform any external body of their normal residence. It is therefore necessary, in my opinion, to introduce in Ireland a system of notification arrangements for persons convicted of certain drug trafficking offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_3677">My proposals place an obligation on a person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than one year for drug trafficking offences to notify his/her name(s) and current home address to the Garda Síochána within 7 days of the conviction for the offence concerned where the sentence of imprisonment is suspended or, where the offender is remanded in custody, from the date of full release from prison. Thereafter, the offender must notify the Gardaí of any change of name or address within 7 days of that change. Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as 7 days or two or more periods amounting to 7 days in any 12 month period must also be given to the Gardaí. If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of 7 days or more he/she must inform the Gardaí of this fact and the address at which he/she intends to stay and also notify the Gardaí of his/her return. The notification periods run from one year to twelve years, depending on the length of sentence imposed. My proposals extend these obligations to any drug trafficking offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad subject to certain conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3678">I believe this approach will be of value to An Garda Síochána in keeping track of such persons and thereby provide valuable assistance and intelligence in the fight against drug crime.</p>

            <p eId="para_3688">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. One of these conditions is that the applicant has had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3689">In the context of determining if an applicant meets the residence requirement for naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State must be excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State; periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.</p>
            <p eId="para_3690">The persons referred to in the Deputy's Question arrived in the State in February 1999 and sought asylum. They subsequently withdrew their applications and sought permission to remain on foot of their parentage of a child born in Ireland in December 1999. Permission to remain in the State was granted to them on this basis in July 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3691">The couple applied for naturalisation in September 2005. The first element of the assessment process for such applications involves determining if the applicant meets the above mentioned statutory residency requirement. It was not possible to ascertain from the documentation submitted with the couple's applications and my official's internal enquiries that they had appropriate permission to reside in the State for the period August 2001 to May 2002. It was determined, therefore, that the couple did not meet the residency requirement at the time of their applications. They were informed of this decision in writing on 16 November 2005. It is important to note in this context that the issue is not whether the couple were actually resident in the State for a total of 5 years, but whether they had appropriate permission to reside here for that period. I understand that the couple now fulfil the residency criteria. If they submit fresh applications at this stage, it will be only necessary to assess those applications against the other statutory criteria for naturalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3692">Since the couple did not meet the statutory requirements for naturalisation when they applied in September 2005, those applications were invalid. I do not consider, therefore, that it would be appropriate to expedite new applications from the couple in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3705">The person in question made an application for permission to remain in the State under the revised arrangements announced by me on 15 January 2005 for the processing of applications from the non-national parents of Irish born children born before 1 January 2005. As stated in my announcement, the closing date for the submission of applications for consideration under the revised arrangements was 31 March 2005. Mr. Nwanko's application was received on 06 May 2005 and therefore, too late for consideration. He was informed on 24 August 2005 that his application for leave to remain could not be considered under the revised arrangements. Judicial Review proceedings were instituted on 28 September 2005 and accordingly, as the matter is sub judice I do not propose to comment further on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_3717">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_3723">I propose to take Questions Nos. 449 and 450 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3724">A Deportation Order issued under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) is an order to the person concerned to leave the State and remain out of it thereafter. It is not, however, an order directing the person concerned to go to any particular third country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3725">As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be most unusual for a person who is illegally resident in this State to be removed to a third country/State where he/she has had no past association or other connection. Before we can remove a person illegally in this State to another jurisdiction, the prior agreement of that other State's authorities is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3726">The effecting of a Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. In the event that a person has to be forced to comply with a Deportation Order, he/she is generally removed to his/her country of origin or to another country, at the election of the person concerned and where that other country is prepared to accept that person onto its territory. It is also possible to remove a person to a country other than the person's country of origin where the authorities of that other country will accept the person concerned on the basis of some past association or other connection, e.g. where his or her spouse resides.</p>
            <p eId="para_3727">It is, of course, also possible that a person being removed to his/her country of origin may have to transit through another State and, on such occasions, assistance may be provided by that State in the transit area of the airport or seaport. It is not the case that this other State in any way carries out the deportation on this State's behalf, particularly in the circumstances cited in the example given in the question.</p>
            <p eId="para_3728">The Deputy might also wish to note the existence of the Dublin II Regulations under which an asylum-seeker can be transferred to another EU Member State, to have the asylum claim processed in that other State, in circumstances where the person concerned first claimed asylum in that other State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3729">The Deputy might wish to note that before making a Deportation Order in any individual case, I must consider that case under all eleven factors specified in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and also have regard for Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. This essentially means that the safety of returning a person to their country of origin, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every individual case. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_3730">The Deputy may be assured that where a Deportation Order is issued in any individual case, this can only happen following a comprehensive examination of all issues relevant to that case, including issues relating to the country of return/country of origin of the person concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_3774">When the draft North Drogheda Environs Local Area Plan was forwarded to my Department by Louth County Council for initial comment on the extent of educational provision required, my Department considered that it would be prudent to plan for 4 primary and 2 post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3775">While only 3 primary school sites are reserved in the Plan itself, my Department is satisfied that further school provision can be made on the Green Belt area to the north of Local Area Plan as the need arises. My Department understands that this land can only be developed for amenity or educational purposes and, therefore, there is no danger that it will not be able to secure additional land for further educational purposes in the area in the future. This includes both primary and post-primary provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3776">Regarding post-primary provision in particular, my Department is in agreement that provision, in the first instance, adjacent to proposed sporting facilities and the transport hub on the north eastern boundary, as envisaged by the local authority, is logical and desirable. This is in accord with the Department's policy regarding sharing community facilities. My Department accepts that it is not necessary to make post-primary site reservations within the plan given that lands adjacent thereto are available with the appropriate zonings. This applies equally to a site reservation for a fourth primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_3777">In summary, my Department is satisfied following consultations with the local authority that there will be sufficient land available to it to develop the requisite number of primary and post-primary schools to meet the needs of the proposed new neighbourhood developments in Drogheda. My Department will be ensuring that access to any new schools in the Green Belt area will take account of all health and safety issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_3790">My Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs including the needs of pupils with autism. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3791">As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3792">At second level, approximately 1,654 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,102 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3793">With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3794">The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3795">The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_3796">—Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level;</p>
            <p eId="para_3797">—Deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_3798">—Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3799">The Department supports the education of individual students with autism in various second level schools throughout the country. The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. In general where a special class for pupils with autism is established by my Department, such classes are staffed by one teacher and two special needs assistants and can cater for a maximum of six pupils though the number in attendance can vary as pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3800">In recent years, my Department has supported the establishment of a number of special classes for pupils with autism in mainstream post primary schools. The organisation of such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education. Special classes are currently in operation in post primary schools in Celbridge, Co. Kildare, Fairview, Co. Dublin, Cashel, Co. Tipperary and Kilcoole, Co. Wicklow. Discussions are ongoing between the NCSE and a number of other post primary schools with a view to establishing further classes of this nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_3801">The NCSE, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_3802">In addition, my Department's Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_3803">My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</p>

            <p eId="para_3809">My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them cater for students with special educational needs transferring from primary level. The supports in question include remedial and resource teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3810">As the Deputy is aware there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_3811">At second level, approximately 1,654 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,102 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNAs) in our second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3812">The general allocation model at primary level is based on the premise that all primary schools have children with learning support or high incidence special educational needs. Early intervention support at primary ensures that many children do not need additional support at second level.</p>
            <p eId="para_3813">The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3814">With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October, 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3815">The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3816">The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_3817">—Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level;</p>
            <p eId="para_3818">—Deciding on applications for special needs assistant hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_3819">—Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3820">Under the new arrangements, the Council, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_3821">My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</p>

            <p eId="para_3827">The post primary school relevant to the Deputy's question is heavily oversubscribed as a result of a significant number of pupils enrolling from outside its catchment area. The cumulative effect of the development of this type of situation over a number of years can impact negatively on pupils from within the catchment area who are entitled, as of right, to a place in a particular school. It also invariably impacts negatively on the school or schools to which these pupils should rightly attend and in which considerable capital investment has been made for this purpose. It is a matter for all school authorities, in the context of their enrolment policies, to limit enrolment to within their catchment areas to ensure that such situations do not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_3828">As a once off exceptional measure, my Department decided that a number of named pupils from outside the catchment area would be allowed to enrol in the post primary school in question for the 2005/2006 school year. This decision was taken because the pupils concerned had an expectation that they would be enrolling in the school and did not have sufficient notice to secure alternative placements. It was made clear to the school authority in July of last year that this arrangement would apply for the 2005/06 school year only. It was made equally clear that the arrangement did not create a precedent and that it would not be repeated in subsequent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3829">I am also satisfied that adequate notice has been given to the particular post primary school concerned to ensure that it implements an appropriate enrolment policy for the 2006/07 school year in the best interests of its own pupils. Indeed, confirmation has been received from the school that it is effecting such an enrolment policy. In all of the circumstances, my Department's position in this matter remains unchanged.</p>

            <p eId="para_3833">Under the terms of the Department's maintenance grants schemes, and in accordance with the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1992, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</p>
            <p eId="para_3834">Under the terms of my Department's 2005 Third Level Student Maintenance Grant Schemes the position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the prescribed conditions with regard to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. A mature student is defined for the purposes of the schemes as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</p>
            <p eId="para_3835">Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents or guardians. An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' or guardians' income or address.</p>
            <p eId="para_3836">When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the means test provision of the scheme specifies that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.</p>
            <p eId="para_3837">It is not proposed, at present, to change the current definition of mature students.</p>

            <p eId="para_3839">Primary schools' running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools. The capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €133.58 with effect from 1st January, 2005 and has been further increased by €12 per pupil with effect from 1st January, 2006 bringing the standard rate to €145.58.

            <p eId="para_3920">This Government is strongly committed to improving participation and achievement at every level of education. We have put the resources and supports in place to ensure that there is a wide range of course options available in the Further Education sector for people who left school with less than upper secondary level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3921">A range of second chance education programmes is available for young people and adults who have either left school early or who need further vocational training to enhance their employment prospects.

            <p eId="para_3922">Within the framework of the priorities identified in the White Paper on Adult Education (2000), the principal objectives of the measures and programmes funded by the Department of Education and Science in the Further and Adult Education area are:</p>

            <p eId="para_3930">A number of access programmes are supported by my Department under special initiatives for disadvantaged second level schools. Financial support is provided for schools in a number of disadvantaged areas, including Ballymun, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Limerick, Blanchardstown and inner-city Dublin. Under these programmes, students can avail of a range of supports such as guidance, mentoring programmes, study skills, and tailored tuition. The programmes also develop strong links with third level institutions to encourage more students to complete senior cycle and progress to third level.</p>
            <p eId="para_3931">My Department does not fund special scholarships for students from areas of significant disadvantage to pursue third level education. My Department does, however, fund three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of Post Leaving Certificate courses:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3932">(a) The Higher Education Grants Scheme</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3933">(b) The Vocational Education Committees' Scholarship Scheme</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3934">(c) The Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3935">(d) Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) Courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_3936">The statutory framework for the Higher Education Grants Schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the Local Authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer this scheme. The Vocational Education Committees' Scholarship Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Scheme for PLC students are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the Vocational Education Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_3937">All four schemes have similar provisions which govern the award of a grant. The position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3938">An application for a grant must be made to the relevant Local Authority or VEC. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3939">The National Development Plan 2000-2006, with assistance from the European Social Fund, provides for a Third Level Access Fund aimed at tackling under-representation by disadvantaged students in third-level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3940">The Third Level Access Fund includes the following initiatives:—</p>
            <p eId="para_3941">—The Special Rates of Maintenance Grant</p>
            <p eId="para_3942">—The ESF aided Fund for Students with Disabilities</p>
            <p eId="para_3943">—The ESF aided Student Assistance Fund</p>
            <p eId="para_3944">—The ESF aided Millennium Partnership Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_3945">Eligibility to the Special Rates of Maintenance Grant is determined by reference to an income threshold and receipt of an approved long-term social welfare payment. To be eligible, applicants must first qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3946">It is estimated that the numbers benefiting under this scheme is approximately 12,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_3947">The Fund for Students with Disabilities aims to assist students with disabilities in third-level institutions and PLC colleges to participate in further and higher education. The purpose of the Fund is to provide students with serious physical and/or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. The Fund operates on a discretionary basis. Applications for funding should be made by the Disability/Access Officer in the Institution, or by the Principal in a PLC college. Students should discuss their particular disability, and equipment or services required, with their Institution/PLC College.</p>
            <p eId="para_3948">In publicly funded third level institutions there is a Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The objective of the SAF is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, because of financial reasons, suffer severe hardship or be unable to continue their third level studies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3949">Applications for funding should be made by the individual student to the Access Officer in their institution. The SAF is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3950">Another initiative under the Third Level Access Fund is the Millennium Partnership Fund for Disadvantage. The objective of this Fund is to support students from disadvantaged areas with regard to retention and participation in further or higher education courses. Partnership Companies and Community Groups manage the fund locally. Pobal manages the fund for the Department of Education and Science. Under the fund, eligible actions may include the following but will be dependent on the individual Partnership or Community Group:</p>
            <p eId="para_3951">—Financial supports to meet student participation costs;</p>
            <p eId="para_3952">—Provision of information, e.g. guidance and mentoring;</p>

            <p eId="para_3958">I should point out that concessionary transport is not guaranteed. Pupils availing of transport on a concessionary basis may only do so if spare seats are available on school buses and this is determined on a term-to-term basis by reference to those who are fully eligible for transport under the terms of the school transport scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3959">The introduction of one-for-one seating arrangements on school transport services operated by Bus Éireann on my Department's behalf does not necessarily mean that concessionary transport will be discontinued. The availability of such transport depends on the number of spare seats available after all other eligible pupils have been accommodated.</p>
            <p eId="para_3960">Parents of pupils should check in advance of the school year to ascertain the position regarding the availability of concessionary transport on school buses.</p>
            <p eId="para_3961">Significant investment has been made by the Government to address capacity shortfalls arising from the phasing out of the three for two seating arrangement on school buses. A programme for Bus Éireann to acquire a number of new and modern second-hand buses is well advanced. In addition, Bus Éireann has hired-in over 220 additional vehicles from the private sector and the situation is being kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3963">The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act was enacted in July 2004. On 14 July 2005 sections 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 44 and 50 to 53 of the Act were commenced. Separate establishment day orders were made in respect of the National Council for Special Education and the Special Education Appeals Board, setting their establishment dates as 1 October 2005 and 3 April 2006 respectively. A further commencement order was signed to commence sections 45 to 49 with effect from 1 October 2005, abolishing the Council established under section 54 of the Education Act 1998 and replacing it with the Council established under the 2004 Act. These sections could not come into effect prior to the establishment of the new Council under section 19 of the 2004 Act.</p>

These cannot come into effect without the Council having an opportunity to present an implementation report to the Minister which it must do before 1 October 2006. On 21 October 2005 the National Council for Special Education published a call for submissions in the national media on the implementation of the Act. The closing date for submissions was 13 January 2006. The Council is now in the process of drawing up its implementation report which it will submit to my Department by 1st October 2006. That report will provide a costed timetable for the implementation of the various provisions of the Act over a 5 year period.</p>

            <p eId="para_3966">All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS and full details of which are available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_3967">NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_3968">Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.</p>
            <p eId="para_3969">In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to educational psychological assessments through the SCPA. Under this Scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_3975">The qualification requirements for appointment to Complementary Therapy teaching posts are set out in my Department's Circular Letter PPT 04/04, which was issued to all Vocational Education Committees and has been published on my Department's website —<i>www.education.ie</i>. The terms of this circular are of general application to all proposed teaching appointments in the area of Complementary Therapy. It is a matter for individual VECs to be satisfied that any proposed appointee is appropriately qualified in accordance with the terms of this circular letter.</p>

            <p eId="para_3977">All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS and full details of which are available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_3978">In addition, NEPS provides a service to every school in the event of a critical incident regardless of whether the school already has a dedicated service from a NEPS psychologist. Also in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for Reasonable Accommodations in Certificate Examinations and responds to queries and requests for assessments in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from the specialist agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3979">NEPS psychologists do not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment in the sense of lists of names that are worked through in order. Each psychologist is responsible for a number of named schools, and visits each on a regular basis. The school authorities provide names of children who are giving cause for concern and discuss the relative urgency of each case during the psychologist's visits. This allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and such children will be seen or referred on in a matter of weeks, if not days. Where cases are less urgent, the NEPS psychologist will, as a preliminary measure, act as a consultant to teachers and parents and offer advice about educational and behavioural plans and monitor progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_3980">Since the establishment of the NEPS in 1999, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 to 122 at present. The Public Appointments Service recently concluded a new recruitment competition for the appointment of Educational Psychologists to NEPS. Regional panels have been established to allow my Department give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need. My Department is currently in the process of recruiting a further 9 psychologists.</p>

            <p eId="para_3988">I am aware of the survey conducted by school principals. My Department intends to undertake a review of all special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools. The initial part of the review involves the gathering and collation of information and views in relation to special schools and classes and is being undertaken by St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra on behalf of the Department. One of the purposes of the review is to examine how we can optimise the role and potential of special schools. My Department is most anxious that the skills and expertise that these schools have accumulated in dealing with children with special educational needs is utilised to best advantage in providing for such children going forward. The second phase of the review will be managed by the National Council for Special Education and will involve wider consultation with the schools and other partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_4002">I understand from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) that the needs of the pupil in question was discussed informally by the school with a NEPS psychologist with a view to the psychologist providing advice and support in the case. I understand that the pupil has not been prioritised by the school for assessment and that he is not attending school at present. Assessment was not an issue for the school. If the pupil returns to school and if he is prioritised for assessment by the school principal, I am advised that he would be seen by a NEPS psychologist early in the next school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4003">My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs including the needs of pupils with autism. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4004">With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4005">The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4006">The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_4007">•Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level;</p>
            <p eId="para_4008">•Deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_4009">•Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4010">The NCSE, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_4011">The Department supports the education of individual students with autism in various second level schools throughout the country. The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_4012">In addition, my Department's Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of postgraduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_4013">My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</p>

     <b>Dr. Upton</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
     his views on the idea of enabling the European Food Safety Authority to consider the long-term health and environmental implications of the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment as part of every licensing application for GMOs; his further views on the fact that none of the GMOs currently approved for production in the EU have been positively approved by the EU Council of Ministers; the reason he does not support a moratorium on all future GM approvals in the EU pending the determination of possible scenarios that might arise from the perceived laxness in the GMO approval system; and his further views on proposals to amend the comotology procedure in order that such approvals in future will have to be made by the EU Council of Ministers.

            <p eId="para_4134">I assume that the Question relates to the implementation of EU Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and the role of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4135">Under the Directive, the national competent authority to which the notification for placing on the market is submitted is charged with leading the examination of the environmental risk assessment; in this connection, the national authority must consult with the competent authorities of the other Member States. This process of examination is designed <i>inter alia</i> to address the possibility of risks in the longer term and provides an opportunity for all Member States to consider such issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_4136">Under Directive 2001/18/EC, EFSA's opinion is obtained by the European Commission on disagreements between the national competent authorities on any scientific matter relating to a notification. In as much as disagreements relate to long-term health and environmental implications, these would in turn fall to be considered by EFSA. The role of EFSA generally in the authorisation process has however been raised by some Member States and is being further examined by the Commission and Member States in prospect of the Environment Council in June 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_4137">The current EU-wide authorisation procedures for GMOs are recognised as among the most stringent in the world and they have been subject to considerable development and refinement. In these circumstances, the case for a moratorium on future approvals is not evident.</p>
            <p eId="para_4138">Finally, the power of initiative in relation to bringing forward proposals to amend the comitology procedure rests with the European Commission. Should any such proposals be developed, they would be examined by the Irish Government on a cross-Departmental basis, bearing in mind the possible implications for issues beyond GMO decision-making also.</p>

            <p eId="para_4144">Local authorities are responsible for the provision of road traffic signs on non-national roads. However, in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government to put in place a new 5 year plan to ensure that non-national roads are properly signposted, my Department introduced a new Regional Roads Signposting Programme for non-national roads in 2003. It is proposed that directional signs on all regional roads throughout the country will be upgraded under the programme. Progress under the scheme and the sequencing of such signposting is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_4145">In 2003, an initial allocation of €5.1 million was provided under the programme and a total sum of €798,378 was drawn down by Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Sligo and Wexford County Councils. In 2004, an initial allocation of €5 million was provided under the programme and a total sum of €1,391,754 was drawn down by Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Sligo, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils. In 2005, an initial allocation of €5 million was provided under the programme and a total sum of €577,668 was drawn down by Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils. Funding not drawn down under the programme was re-allocated to other non-national road projects in each of the years 2003 to 2005. In 2006, an initial allocation of €6.64 million has been provided under the programme to 27 county councils, of which a sum of €68,235 has been drawn down to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_4637">International Biodiversity Day, which was celebrated yesterday, 22 May is an annual event designated by the United Nations with the objective of promoting public awareness across the globe of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. Ireland ratified this convention in 1996.</p>
            <p eId="para_4638">The world relies on biodiversity, which represents the variety of life on earth and is the fruit of billions of years of evolution, for many human needs including food, fuel, shelter, materials, medicines, soil fertility, crop pollination, soil stability, cleansing of waters and climate regulation. The current rate of loss of the world's biodiversity is therefore a matter of serious concern, and International Biodiversity Day provides an opportunity to re-emphasise our shared responsibility to safeguard this precious heritage for future generations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4639">In helping to mark International Biodiversity Day, my Department arranged a series of events and activities in our National Parks and Nature Reserves. These events included guided walks and tours, displays, self-guiding family Biodiversity Packs, and expert talks. While most of these events were focused on International Biodiversity Day itself, Wexford Wildfowl Reserve has arranged a series of nature walks and other events throughout the month of May on the specific theme of biodiversity, while Coole Park Nature Reserve, County Galway, is organising a Biodiversity Week commencing last Sunday, 21 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_4640">My Department also worked closely with the Heritage Council, which operates under my Department's aegis, on the production of a dedicated eight-page Biodiversity Supplement, which was published in one of the national dailies on Wednesday 17 May. The Supplement was specifically published to mark International Biodiversity Day, and emphasised the importance of the conservation and sustainable use of Ireland's rich biodiversity.</p>

            <p eId="para_4642">CE marking provides, in principle, a right to place a product on the market. However, for use in particular building works, such as social housing, the technical information and certified values accompanying the CE marking must be assessed for compliance with requirements pertaining to those works. CE marking does not, of itself, confer any guarantee of acceptability of a product for a particular use.</p>
            <p eId="para_4643">In the case of products bearing CE marking, the need for Agreement certification of such a product should not generally arise. However, CE marking applies to products and not to building works or building systems. It may arise that a product bearing CE marking may be incorporated in building works or a building system that, itself, because of its novel or unconventional nature, may require Agreement certification, or equivalent.</p>
