It gives me an opportunity to describe the service provided by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training, CEPOL, and highlight the benefit it brings to An Garda Síochána. The motion, if passed, will allow Ireland to exercise its right under Protocol No. 21 of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to opt in to the EU regulation on CEPOL. CEPOL, which is the European police college, was established in 2005. It brings together senior police officers from across the EU and aims to encourage cross-border co-operation in the fight against crime and the maintenance of public security and law and order through training and exchange programmes and the sharing of research and best practice. Since 2005, An Garda Síochána has played an important part in CEPOL EU training by organising courses in the Garda college for participants from EU member states to attend. These include training programmes on language development, human rights, community policing, confiscation of assets and counterfeit medicines. The expertise of members of An Garda Síochána has proven beneficial to CEPOL programmes through their involvement in training programmes in other member states on a wide variety of policing topics including management, public order and crowd management, issues regarding the Schengen Agreement, counterfeit goods, organised crime and drugs. In more recent times, CEPOL has provided training programmes to address emerging policing and security issues such as fundamentalism and immigration. As a result, CEPOL has been successful in developing the talents of gardaí and their ability to network and co-operate with other European counterparts. As we can see from the almost daily terrorist attacks that have begun to define the world we live in, terrorism and organised crime are constantly changing forms and means. The sharing of good practice, prevention techniques and use of modern tools to address these threats is vital in our efforts to protect citizens and combat crime. The new CEPOL regulation, which replaced the 2005 council decision, was introduced to enhance CEPOL's operational mandate and reforms its governance in line with general principles laid down in the Lisbon treaty. The general aim of the regulation is to improve EU security through the implementation by CEPOL of a new training approach for EU law enforcement officers consistent with the evolving priorities for operational law enforcement co-operation. Moreover, the regulation has widened the target group of law enforcement officials that CEPOL should serve as well as expanding its research function and association with relevant bodies. The regulation was drafted on the basis of the European Commission’s communication on the law enforcement training scheme, known as LETS. The LETS aims to make the EU’s response to common security challenges more effective, to raise the standard of policing across the EU and to stimulate the development of a common law enforcement culture as a means of enhancing mutual trust and co-operation. In this regard, the regulation identifies and addresses gaps in existing law enforcement training on cross-border matters by supporting and, where appropriate, co-ordinating the delivery of training by European and national centres of excellence. The regulation provides CEPOL with the appropriate legal mandate and necessary resources to implement the training effort envisaged in the communication. In addition, the scope of CEPOL’s mandate is broadened so that it can support, develop, deliver and co-ordinate learning activities for law enforcement officials of all ranks and not only police officers of senior rank, as is the case under the old CEPOL decision, as well as to officers of customs and of other relevant services dealing with cross-border issues. This means that if we opt in, our customs officials will also be able to benefit from the training provided. Perhaps equally as valuable, the regulation ensures that the agency remains network-based, bringing together the network of training institutes of the member states for the law enforcement officials and liaising with a single national unit in each member state. This, as I am sure Deputies will appreciate, will allow An Garda Síochána to continue to build networks of counterparts in other EU jurisdictions which can be used for other operational intelligence sharing outside the CEPOL framework. Furthermore, the core objectives of CEPOL were updated and clarified so that the agency may improve awareness and knowledge of international and EU instruments and the institutions, agencies and bodies of the EU. It will now also encourage the development of regional and bilateral co-operation among the member states and address specific criminal or policing thematic areas where training at EU level can add value, in addition to the national level. In summary, the regulation expands and provides clarity on the role of CEPOL and improves governance in the management, accountability and procedures for the CEPOL secretariat and the member states involved in police training. For all of these reasons, I hope Deputies can agree that Ireland’s participation in the regulation will be of tremendous value to An Garda Síochána and our customs service. It will also send a clear message that Ireland continues to support CEPOL and values the service it provides.As the regulation came into effect on 1 July 2016, it is important to signal our desire to participate as soon as possible to ensure that An Garda Síochána continues to be part of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training, CEPOL, and benefits from the service it provides. Deputies will be mindful of the importance of training for our law enforcement agencies. The Garda Inspectorate, in its report on the future of policing in Ireland from 2007, indicated that, historically, police services have dedicated substantial resources to recruit training but did not invest appropriately in the long-term professional development of personnel. The recently published Garda Síochána Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 identifies training and development as a key requirement in developing a modern, efficient police service. It stresses that training is critical to the success of that modernisation programme and CEPOL can continue to provide a valuable service in this regard. I strongly believe continued participation in CEPOL will provide huge benefit to An Garda Síochána and the Customs at no cost to the Irish Exchequer. Put simply, I can see no reason Ireland would not wish to participate in this regulation. It is clear, from all the reasons I have presented, that CEPOL delivers tangible benefits to our law enforcement agencies and, as such, I invite Deputies to support the motion before them. In so doing, Members will allow our police service to continue to benefit from the invaluable training provided by CEPOL and to learn from and engage with other European partners to assist in the fight against crime.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	1	The 28th amendment to the Constitution approved by the people in October 2009 allowed Ireland to ratify the Lisbon treaty. That amendment changed Article 29 of the Constitution and expressly allowed Ireland to exercise options or discretions under Protocol No. 21 of the European treaty. Protocol No. 21 of the treaty allows Ireland and the United Kingdom to opt out of a number of the treaty's provisions governing security, policing and justice, but to our benefit, Article 4 of Protocol No. 21 allows Ireland to opt into some measures adopted by our European partners in respect of policing, security and justice, without the British so doing. This is what we seek to exercise here today because on 23 November 2015, the Council and European Parliament adopted Regulation (EU) 2015/2219, which enhances the operational mandate of CEPOL and reforms its governance. The general objective of the regulation is to improve EU security through the implementation by CEPOL of a new training approach for EU police and customs officers. The regulation was implemented on 1 July 2016. Under Article 29 of the Constitution, a resolution must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas if we wish to opt into a provision under Protocol No. 21. Fianna Fáil will support the motion before the House, as it will be of benefit to policing both in Ireland and in Europe. It also is worth pointing out that we should be concentrating on the importance of education and improving excellence in our policing service as well as considering how it operates in a European context. Policing has become an extremely complex and difficult profession. If one considers some changes that have taken place in the area of criminality and the issues the Garda must investigate, one will note it has become a difficult and demanding profession. I will give examples of three recent changes that impose great demands on An Garda Síochána and which illustrate why it is so important to have greater training for the Garda and to seek to emphasise the importance of further training and education in An Garda Síochána. I refer first to the increasing complexity of certain financial crimes. It now is apparent that certain white collar crimes are of such financial complexity it is necessary to have great expertise to investigate them. We must have expertise in both forensic accounting and company law to be able to trace some of the alleged white collar crimes that take place. A second example of recent change is the use of the Internet, particularly in crimes against children. This requires great and increased levels of expertise in information technology and in how to examine computers. Finally, historic complaints require understanding on the part of An Garda Síochána that there must be an appreciation of the psychology as to why people legitimately take their time and delay in making complaints because of the impact the offence may have had upon them. All these issues illustrate that policing is a demanding profession, and to improve it, we must place greater emphasis in Ireland on the requirement to improve the educational standards and expertise of An Garda Síochána. This perhaps could be done in three ways and I acknowledge they may be seeking to expand this in Europe and some European countries already allow for this. We first must improve and expand the professional development of An Garda Síochána in order that its members who seek to go on to do third level studies and who obtain third level qualifications are facilitated in so doing and derive benefit from so doing. Second, we must consider graduate recruitment into An Garda Síochána. While graduates are entitled to be recruited into An Garda Síochána, they derive no benefit from being recruited as a graduate. In other countries, there is some fast-track promotion for those who enter at a starting level and who have the benefit of a graduate degree. If a graduate degree is beneficial and useful, it should be of some benefit in a person's promotion up through the force. Third, we must also consider recruitment of people from other police forces, as well as members of the Garda Reserve. Many Irish gardaí went overseas and got jobs in Canadian police forces and a recruitment method is needed whereby they can be taken back in to the force at a sufficiently high level. All these measures emphasise the ongoing importance of education within An Garda Síochána and for this reason, Fianna Fáil will support this motion as we believe the European college of police is essential to improve the development of police forces throughout Europe.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	2	It has long been the position of Sinn Féin to support international co-operation on justice matters within a sovereign framework that ensures human rights compliance. Sinn Féin supports the State's participation in European Union-level and international co-operation in criminal justice matters where this clearly serves the public interest, but not to cede national sovereignty over or democratic oversight of such matters. In particular, we will resist any moves towards establishing exclusive EU competence over any area of justice, including that of police training. That said, Sinn Féin supports the practice of sharing knowledge and experience in an effort to improve standards. We wish to ensure that all EU and international co-operation in criminal justice matters, including when this simply pertains to training, complies fully with human rights standards and that any co-operation or voluntary harmonisation works to enhance human rights. I urge the Minister of State to ensure the Irish delegation and representatives to CEPOL reflect this. As the Minister of State is aware, however, beyond this Sinn Féin has adopted a general policy of critical engagement on EU policies and legislative proposals. This means we are willing to support those we believe will be of benefit to the Irish people and will oppose those we believe will be detrimental. In deciding its position on justice matters, Sinn Féin examines any EU policy proposal against critical engagement criteria I will set out. The first is whether it respects or fundamentally compromises national sovereignty over justice. The second is whether it advances or rolls back human rights protections. The third is whether it respects or compromises the interests of smaller nations or minority groups within those nations. The fourth is whether the proposal was arrived at through democratic dialogue and consultation with civil society and fifth, whether its outworking will be transparent and subject to democratic accountability. Sinn Féin is not alone within the European Union in this regard, as many different countries, political parties and individuals within systems have similar types of approaches to these issues. To be valid, any European Union harmonisation or co-operation measure in the area of justice or training for those engaged in the administration of justice should have as its objective the increased protection of human rights. I seek clarity from the Minister of State as to whether this is the case in this regard. I further ask the Minister of State to stipulate the number of officers who will be assigned to CEPOL as our communities already are suffering from the reduction in policing numbers and resources. Will the Minister of State indicate what resources will be allocated to CEPOL, as per section 4 of Article 6 in Chapter II of the regulation? I further ask the Minister of State to indicate whether the financial irregularities uncovered in CEPOL in the past have been addressed to his satisfaction. At one point, the European Court of Auditors found there had been a high number of breaches of EU administrative and financial rules at CEPOL and I hope the necessary changes have taken place.Sinn Féin is committed to ensuring we have policing that reflects total human rights compliance. We need robust standards and systems to end and prevent into the future the types of systemic human rights abuses that have characterised police forces across this island in the past. Moreover, Sinn Féin believes that there is no inherent conflict between human rights and policing because good policing is the protection of human rights. This should be the core position of any learning activities steered by CEPOL and, ultimately, CEPOL should not be allowed to dictate the training needs of domestic police services. The Irish people alone have the right to determine policy questions and to set the law regarding the administration of justice in Ireland and the training of those who administer it. There should be a greatly increased role in civil society for advising on training matters for An Garda Síochána. For example, there is great scope for increased co-operation between An Garda Síochána and the domestic violence and sexual violence sectors. They are well placed to advise on further training for gardaí. This must be accompanied by appropriate resourcing. Within a human rights based framework Sinn Féin supports international co-operation in the area of justice where this is necessary to fight crime and, in particular, cross-Border trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings and in the interests of child protection. However, we believe it is equally essential to safeguard against the creation of further victims through human rights violations, so such measures must be compatible with human security and reflected in CEPOL training.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	3	The Labour Party supports the adoption of this regulation. CEPOL is the acronym for the European Police College, which continues to be a useful training device for police. In the international world of criminal activity, we need to have the expertise gathered from one nation shared. The European Police College was based in Bramshill in Hampshire up to September 2014, when it was then relocated to Budapest. Efforts were made at the time to have it relocated to Templemore but that did not come to pass and the college is now located in Budapest. It would have been useful to have the centre located here. The European Police College is an important training centre and we support it. The aim of Europol is to share best policing practice. Its close cousin, CEPOL, is not as well known but is also really important as a training element to support the objectives of Europol. The original council proposal was to merge Europol and CEPOL but that was resisted by a number of member states at the time. What we have now is a stand-alone proposal in relation to CEPOL, which is better.  I would like to raise a couple of issues with the Minister of State in relation to how we do this type of business. I am minded by the comments of the two previous speakers. The fact that we are exercising a protocol on the position of the UK and Ireland to opt into a regulation in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice indicates that we were hangers on to a UK position when Article 4 of Protocol 21 was annexed to the Treaty of the European Union. In light of our co-operation with Britain on security matters, it was determined that we should have the same opt-in or opt-out mechanism as the UK. What will be the impact of the British decision to exit the European Union on this protocol, our continued co-operation in police and justice matters on an all-island basis and on an east-west basis with the United Kingdom? Have these issues been explored? I presume we can continue to use the existing protocol for future opt-ins or opt-outs or will it be necessary to modify it subsequent to the exit of the UK from the European Union? All of these things add a complication. My second point relates to the way we do our business. In the United Kingdom, the European Affairs Committee deals with these matters and makes recommendations in the blind of the attitude of Government, such that when the committee brings its proposals to parliament the attitude of Government is not known. If we are to have respect for the new politics, that is the way this business should be done here too. In other words, these matters should in the first instance be referred to the appropriate committee of the Houses for it to shape an opinion, following which the Government can partner in the decision-making.  In regard to the general reforms in An Garda Síochána, training is critical. I strongly endorse the views of my Fianna Fáil colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, in relation to the recruitment area. I have raised this issue many times. The only way a person can join An Garda Síochána is as a new recruit. I was approached by a young man who was a commander in the Singapore police force and has great experience but he is unwilling to return here to join An Garda Síochána as a recruit. There are many people who have years of experience internationally who will not come back here to join An Garda Síochána as a recruit. Even if the age limit allowed for this, it is not the way to go. This issue needs to be examined. I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's views on the status of the protocol post-Brexit, the mechanism for ratification in this jurisdiction and whether we should look to model ourselves in the British system in terms of giving more autonomy to the committees to do this business rather than bring it before the House and on the issue of recruitment.

As well as uncontroversial courses such as language, training and so on, this year CEPOL is holding courses in the following areas: informant handling, undercover operations, radicalisation, social media policing, and the use of passenger name data, etc.. My colleague, Deputy Bríd Smith, will address issues relating to Fortress Europe. I would like to know more about the aforementioned courses. For example, what is covered in the undercover operations course? Presumably, we will be told it deals with terrorism, etc. Many undercover operations in Europe are related not to terrorism, but to social campaigns. I wonder if PC Mark Kennedy of the British Metropolitan Police is being asked to speak at the CEPOL training courses this summer. Mr. Kennedy was involved in undercover operations in this State, including at Rossport with the Shell to Sea campaign, the May Day protest and the anti-war campaigns at Shannon Airport. In January 2011, President Michael D. Higgins said: "It is of grave concern. This type of activity undermines respect for the law and it is very sinister in that it can damage good causes." An MIT research scientist, Harry Halpin, who was spied on by PC Kennedy in a different country at a different time said: "What we are seeing globally is the rise of dangerous new authoritarian secret states, whose architecture of oppression is aimed at suppressing social change."  I would like to speak about Operation Mizen and the manner in which the Irish State used the police to monitor the Facebook and other social media pages of anti-water charge activists, as admitted by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in the House in October, but I want to allow my colleague, Deputy Bríd Smith, to deal with other issues.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	8	When I read through this and all it implies, I realise that if I was running a right-wing State that wanted to batten down the hatches, control workers' rights and stop refugees from receiving the support and shelter they deserve, I would probably be in favour of CEPOL training my police force because it would be watching all of the left-wing and radical people who want to change society and send it in a different direction. In particular, my police force would be trained to support fortress Europe and Frontex, which is a European-wide police force with 1,500 police operatives whose only objective is to stop refugees getting across Europe. We have spoken about this previously in the House. I was in Greece earlier this year and visited many of the refugee camps and the borders where these police forces operate. It is quite sickening to see a group of human beings holding back another desperate group of human beings. There are terrified, traumatised and hungry children who are desperate for safety and security with their families trying to get to the wealthiest part of the planet. The EU is the wealthiest part of the planet, yet we intend participating in Frontex, which does not deal with mass migration but is about resisting a refugee crisis and containing people in the most desperate parts of the world, including Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Mali and beyond. On the grounds that CEPOL would train our police force to contain refugees, I appeal to people in this House to have a bit of humanity and not participate in the sort of Robocop scenes I witnessed in Greece, which involved the police literally holding back desperate populations from receiving the sort of the sanctity and security they deserve under countless international agreements to which we have signed up through the UN and the Geneva Convention. They are all being broken by participation in this police force.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	9	We are talking about updating and expanding the remit of CEPOL, the European police training body. We are told that the measure will succeed in improving EU security through enhanced training and co-operation, particularly in the areas of serious crime and terrorism. The idea of police authorities working across borders to combat serious crime is obviously welcome, but there is a certain irony in that. When we went through the annual pantomime of passing the Emergency Powers Act and the Offences Against the State Act earlier this year, I made the point that the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act, which has been on our Statute Book since 2004, allows the Garda Commissioner to engage in joint policing operations with other members of the EU to combat serious crime, but we have never invoked that measure. Instead, we have repeatedly introduced violations of human rights by signing up to the Offences Against the State Act and so on and have continued to criminalise the victims of drug abuse and poverty. Meanwhile, the people the measures was supposed to target - the big boys - are living it up on the Costa del Sol. Everybody would welcome any measures involving co-operation across borders in dealing with serious crime. However, the reality is that many measures are already there and have not been invoked.  Whatever about a certain legitimacy in the area of serious crime, where such measures really fall down is in areas such as supposedly helping in the fight against terrorism. Trying to fight terrorism through changed policing methods and co-ordination is like holding back the sea with a bucket. If we are really serious about tackling terrorism, we have got to get to the roots of why people end up engaging in terrorist activity. We should start by looking at Europe's seemingly endless supplying of arms to fuel wars around the world. We should stop supporting those wars, stop facilitating the use of Shannon Airport by the US military and so on. We would deal with ghettoisation, social exclusion and State-sanctioned racism. Look at the slaughter unleashed in Iraq over the past two months alone, with 69 people killed in Baghdad in May, 30 in June and 300 in July. The instability exported to all corners of the world through Western intervention is coming home to roost. We have created a monster in that sense. The idea that more police powers will deal with that is simply a failed strategy, and we know that because that is what experience has taught us. The more we try to use the police to fight terrorism, the more terrorists we create, because it is a failed strategy and we are not dealing with the root causes. In that sense, I do not think CEPOL is appropriate at all.  It is a bit ironic that the stated objective is emphasising the protection of human rights. This is talked about a lot in terms of An Garda Síochána, but it is a far cry from the reality of how An Garda Síochána has operated. With regard to the announcement in the past number of days of the barristers' panel commissioned by the Minister for Justice and Equality for the review mechanism for cases of historical malpractice and abuse by members of An Garda Síochána, which was just a whitewash, the damage done to hundreds of Irish citizens because of violations of human rights by members of An Garda Síochána has never been properly tackled. Increasing police powers and surveillance, which gives the State huge powers to invade people's privacy, as the Minister has stated she intends to do, is not the answer to this. We need to deal with proper Garda accountability. Many of the European police forces have had similar or worse problems, so when we sign up to joint co-operation with these bodies, we should be careful what we are signing up to. That said, there are areas from which we can benefit. The incestuous or small-scale nature of An Garda Síochána has been a particular problem, so a breath of fresh air from outside the State would certainly assist in that regard. However, the way in which this motion has been presented is very one-sided and it will not do what it says on the tin.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	10	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this particularly important motion. I strongly support the concept and have done so for many years. National and international crime is becoming very sophisticated and requires a co-ordinated effort on the part of police forces globally. This means that they need to be able to understand and speak to each other and have a common concept of what policing is. Our police need to be up to date on the procedures followed in these situations. Reference has been made to the possibility of transfers between police forces. This is a very good idea that should be taken on board. There is provision under the Good Friday Agreement for transfers up to a certain point between Northern Ireland and here, and this should be extended. There is great scope for people who have experience in other police forces to transfer. I see no reason they cannot transfer right across Europe under this concept. It would benefit the country to which police officers transfer and the country they leave, because provision can be made for an exchange. We need common intelligence. The intelligence methods used by police forces must be standardised. If we do not have a standardised system and similar procedures in every country in the EU and globally, we will not have the same advantage in fighting global crime. White-collar crime is becoming very sophisticated nationally and internationally and we must equip our police force with that in mind.We also need to realise that the question of cybercrime is coming more and more into focus. It cannot be done from one country alone; policing methods in terms of detection need to be standardised. Our police need to be able to recognise and converse knowledgeably with their colleagues right across the globe, not only throughout Europe. This will have a beneficial effect in this country and on the reduction in crime generally.  To go back to the question of police transfers, Deputy Clare Daly made an interesting point that it is no harm to bring in somebody with outside thinking and to have them on board in our territory as well. That is a good idea. The day is gone when everybody put up barriers and remained in their own cosy cocoon. It is no longer acceptable. Particularly in fighting crime we cannot do that and cannot do it effectively. If we look at the extent to which major drug hauls have been identified over the last ten years off our shores, very often police from a long way away track by satellite. This is the kind of sophistication we need to be familiar with, adapt to and adopt for our benefit.  There is also the question of terrorism which is a fact of life nowadays. We have no control over the things that happen outside our jurisdiction but it is no harm to be alert to them and aware of the methods used. If there are issues that are in violation of human rights, of course we need to talk about them and curtail them specifically. The purpose of the exercise is to have a co-ordinated approach in the administration of justice and law and order and to create a stronger force to deal with the criminal elements that are becoming more and more sophisticated in their operations as time goes on. That can only be to the benefit of our society, our police force and global peace. Recent events in France and other countries have shown there is a necessity to be alert to what is happening considerably in advance of it happening. It gives us an insight and a warning. We need to do that. We have always benefited from co-operation with overseas police and that will remain the case.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	11	I thank Deputies for their valuable contributions and comments on the work of CEPOL and the need to have continued representation by An Garda Síochána at CEPOL. CEPOL provides a cost-effective means of upskilling members of An Garda Síochána and customs officials in critical policing areas in times of restricted budgets. It provides a diversity of training courses in areas where An Garda Síochána may not have a national skill base. It also provides an international context for understanding and learning new crime trends in this increasingly transnational crime environment. As I mentioned before, there is no cost to the Exchequer here; CEPOL provides accommodation, flights and meals under the terms of the framework partnership grant system. This allows members of An Garda Síochána to attend training in other European countries without incurring costs. In 2015, CEPOL courses were attended by members of An Garda Síochána and customs officials on such varied issues as cybercrime, urban violence and trafficking in human beings. These courses are reflective of the diverse range of policing topics facilitated by CEPOL, which are not part of the normal training provided in police colleges. Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned three very important areas of finance, crime against children and historic complaints. He also made some very interesting points about the professional development of An Garda Síochána, recruitment into An Garda Síochána from other jurisdictions, graduate recruitment and so on. An Garda Síochána is undergoing a programme of change and modernisation. The establishment of the policing authority will play a key role in future Garda recruitment. Changes will include greater levels of civilian recruitment and specialist staff. There is a modernisation programme under way there. There is also the need for continuous professional development as Deputy O'Callaghan identified.  Deputy Howlin spoke about the referendum in the UK. This is at a very early stage and it has not yet been determined what changes will be needed to the various protocols and agreements during the exit negotiations after Article 50 has been triggered. We are monitoring the situation very closely. Deputy Howlin was also correct when he said that in the normal course of business, motions of this type would be discussed at committee but the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has not been established fully yet. It was important to move on with this motion and get it approved as I hope Deputies will do today before the recess, as this regulation came into effect on 1 July 2016. That was a reason for it. Deputy Cullinane was concerned about human rights. CEPOL regulations confirm all the criteria he mentions. It is not a harmonising instrument and there is no transfer of sovereignty of any sort. Ireland participates as we wish. An Garda Síochána will be represented on the management board and officers will attend courses of interest. To date, more than 50 officials attend training courses each year. The regulation strengthens the governance of CEPOL in relation to the management of its resources and funding. CEPOL is now subject to tighter controls. I want to allay the Deputy's concerns in that regard.  On costs, it might be worth mentioning the Garda College approach to CEPOL. Each year, member states are invited to apply for a grant agreement to facilitate the hosting of various policing training courses. The Garda College is actively engaged in the commitment to European police training and hosted a number of training programmes each year. These have included training programmes on language development, human rights, community policing, confiscation of assets and counterfeit medicines. Staff contribution through the planning and organisation of courses means that the college does not contribute payment directly towards the costs of hosting the programmes. Two programmes will be hosted in the Garda College in 2016. The awarded grant agreements of approximately €65,000 per course provides the payments to local restaurants, transport companies as well as language experts fees to DCU and funding to the Garda College for accommodation and meals.  Deputy Barry, Deputy Daly and others mentioned and had concerns, which I acknowledge, about undercover policing and Frontex and so on. However, I want to make clear that CEPOL is simply a training academy. That is what it does; it is just a training academy. All its courses respect the principles set out in the European charter on human rights. Deputy Daly was also concerned about terrorism. It is vital that police forces across Europe learn from each other and learn the best methods of dealing with any emerging threat. I hope Deputies can support the motion.

In our consideration of the motion before us today, we are preparing the way for the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory authority. This is the new body charged with the oversight of legal practitioners, legal services and a more transparent legal costs regime in the State as provided under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  At its meeting of 13 July 2016, the Government agreed to propose, for consideration under today’s motion, the appointment of named persons to be members of the new authority.Although the Government is the appointing authority for the members of the new regulatory authority under the Act, these appointments must first be approved by resolutions of both Dáil and Seanad. I am today, therefore, seeking the approval of this House for those persons being nominated under this motion to be appointed by the Government as the members of the new authority. The motion before the House today, therefore, follows the similarly required motion that was passed by the Seanad on 19 July. The persons named under today's motion are the nominees of the nominating bodies which are set out by name in the Act. Indeed, this is the sole process whereby these names have been selected. The independence of the statutory nominating process set out in this reforming legislation will speak for itself, as I set it out before the House. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, earlier this week, signed a commencement order in respect of certain provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the 2015 Legal Services Regulation Act. This has been done as necessary to support the start-up of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, including the approval being sought from this House under today's motion. Further parts of the Legal Services Regulation Act will be commenced on a phased basis in the autumn as the new authority gets up and running and ready to take over key areas such as inspections, public complaints and the new legal business models. The sequencing of these further commencements is being planned carefully. Great care will have to be taken to ensure that the various commencements are correctly executed, including in relation to each other, and that the replacement of existing regulatory regimes leaves no unintended gaps. As Deputies will appreciate, the establishment of this new regulatory authority and the assumption by it of regulatory oversight of all legal practitioners in the State, including the handling of complaints against them, and the authority's responsibility to oversee the operation and opening up of the legal services market in Ireland, are historical structural reforms of the regulatory architecture in these areas. Under today's motion it is also being proposed that the relevant appointments to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, once approved, will be with effect from the authority's establishment day. Under section 7 of the Legal Services Regulation Act, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality will shortly make the required order to set 1 October 2016 as the establishment day of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. The setting of 1 October 2016 as establishment day will give momentum to the establishment and coming into operation of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and will trigger a number of specific measures under the Act. It will provide greater focus and depth to the process of modernisation and change that the new regulatory regime is intended to deliver. Rather than considering the nominees for approval under today's motion for appointment to the new regulatory authority in isolation, it is worth recalling the key levers of reform which are contained in the 2015 Act and which will come under its remit. These are a new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for oversight of both solicitors and barristers and an independent complaints system dealing with legal professional misconduct which will provide a first port of call for the public in making complaints independent of the legal professional bodies. There will also be a new and independent legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal to adjudicate on serious misconduct in relation to both solicitors and barristers. Included also is an enhanced legal costs regime bolstered by a set of legal costs principles and which places more extensive obligations on both solicitors and barristers to keep clients informed about the details of their legal costs. Separately, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will assume the role of the existing Office of the Taxing-Master and keep a public register of its legal costs determinations. There is also a framework for new legal business models. These new business structures will include public consultation and the early introduction of legal partnerships between barristers and solicitors or between barristers themselves. Provision is also made for the introduction of limited liability partnerships. Lawyers will now, as a matter of law, be able to avail of the new legal business models and to operate them freely. Of course, the more traditional forms of legal practice will remain available to practitioners but now as a matter of greater choice. A pathway is also provided under the 2015 Act for the introduction, on foot of formal research and public consultations, of multidisciplinary practices whereby services can be provided at a more competitive cost by legal and non-legal service providers together. The new Act also opens up other aspects of legal practice. For example, it allows employed or corporate lawyers to act in proceedings on behalf of their employers and for direct access to barristers on non-contentious business. It also allows barristers sharing a premises to advertise themselves as such. These had all been prevented by existing codes. The aim of opening up these areas is that there will be greater choice in how legal services may be provided and in how they can be accessed by consumers while also on a more competitive basis for all concerned. To underpin the independence of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, the members of the authority are nominated to the Government by ten nominating bodies specified in section 9 of the 2015 Act. These bodies have been purposely set in the legislation to represent a balance between the interests of lawyers and those of consumers and other stakeholders in our regulation of legal services and of legal costs. Membership is also staggered by the drawing of lots at the first meeting of the authority as a result of which there will be four-year members and three-year members. This ensures the continuity of expertise and functions of the new regulatory authority. The authority is to consist of 11 members of whom a majority, that is, six members, including the chairperson, are to be lay persons nominated by the six prescribed non-legal bodies. The remaining five members are nominated by the prescribed legal bodies. Each prescribed body, with the exception of the Law Society which nominates two members, has nominated one person for appointment as members of the new authority. In the case of all the bodies except the Law Society, each body was also required to nominate a substitute nominee of the opposite gender to their primary nominee to facilitate gender balance. The authority must have no fewer than four members who are women and no fewer than four who are men. The Law Society has two nominees reflecting the fact that solicitors outnumber barristers being regulated under the 2015 Act by about five to one. There are around 10,000 practising solicitors compared with around 2,000 practising barristers. The key requirement of the Legal Services Regulation Act is that the nominees must have knowledge and expertise in specified areas, for example, in the provision of legal services, competition, legal training and education, dealing with complaints against members of regulated professions, the needs of consumers of legal services, business and commercial matters and professional standards regulation. The nominees and their associated bodies are: Ms Angela Black, the Citizens Information Board; Dr. Don Thornhill, the Higher Education Authority; Ms Deirdre McHugh, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; Professor Gerry Whyte, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission; Mr. Stephen Fitzpatrick, the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants; Mr. Dermot Jewell, the Consumers Association of Ireland; Mr. David Barniville, the Bar Council; Ms Joan Crawford, the Legal Aid Board; Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, the Honorable Society of King's Inns; and Ms Geraldine Clarke and Mr. James MacGuill, the Law Society. The Government also agreed at its meeting of 13 July 2016 to appoint one of the nominees under today's motion, Dr. Don Thornhill, to be chairperson of the new authority. The power is given to the Government under the 2015 Act to make that appointment but this is, of course, subject to the candidate having been first approved as a member of the authority by a motion of both Houses. Dr. Thornhill is a respected public figure who has successfully held several public leadership roles spanning different sectors. I am confident he will bring much experience, knowledge and clout to the role of chair. He has also led the National Competitiveness Council in its campaign to cut legal costs for consumers and enterprise. I think the House will agree that, with these qualities, he is well placed to provide the inaugural authority with the kind of direction and vision needed to be a successful and highly regarded independent regulator. The nomination and appointment procedures for the regulatory authority, which include seeking the necessary approval under today's motion, are legislatively robust. This is no accident. It is a model that was introduced by Government amendment in direct response to independence concerns that were raised in 2011 on initial publication of the Legal Services Regulation Bill which had only used standard public appointment provisions. Something more was required in this instance. I am delighted that we have now been able to avail of a nominating process in the 2015 Act which draws from a group of prescribed nominating bodies representing the balance of stakeholders concerned. The nominating bodies have been able to put forward, as named for approval under today's motion, a competent team which can make a real contribution in real time to the work of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. I commend the motion to the House and the thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the extra time.

I am a practising barrister and if this motion is passed, I will be regulated by the authority whose membership we are voting on today. I welcome the fact that the Dáil is being given an opportunity, under section 9 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, to vote on the membership of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. Fianna Fáil will be supporting the membership that has been put before the Dáil today under the chairmanship of Dr. Thornhill. We believe it is a well-balanced board that will be suitable in terms of its important role as being the inaugural board to regulate on a statutory basis the solicitor and barrister professions in Ireland. It is also important to look at the history and progress of the legislation as it went through the previous Dáil. There has been a protracted development of this legislation. Part of the reason for the protracted progress of the legislation was because of the initial plan that the previous Government put before the Dáil in terms of the first draft of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. Under that Bill, it was proposed that there would be 11 members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority but that seven of those members would be appointed directly by the Government. That proposal was met by shock by lawyers, not only in Ireland but internationally. Unfortunately, sometimes when lawyers speak out there is a belief that they do so solely out of self-interest. That was not the case in response to the initial proposal put forward by the previous Government. The reason it caused shock was because if the Government was in a position whereby it could appoint the majority of the members of the authority that would regulate lawyers in Ireland, it would hand inordinate power and control over the legal profession to the executive branch of the Oireachtas. The reason that is dangerous is because it would put pressure on lawyers to toe the line in respect of what Government wished. It is a sign of an effective and successful democracy that lawyers are able to take cases against individuals and against the State without having the fear that they may in some respect curry disfavour with the Government of the day. This concern was not exclusively mentioned by lawyers in Ireland. It was also a concern voiced by the International Bar Association, the American Bar Association and the European bar and law societies. In fact, the head of the International Bar Association described the initial proposals put forward by the previous Government in respect of how it proposed to constitute the Legal Services Regulatory Authority as one of the most extensive and far-reaching attempts by an Executive to control the legal profession.He compared the original proposals to legal systems operating in China, Gambia and Vietnam. Fortunately, the previous Government saw the error of its ways and a new system of selecting the membership of the regulatory authority was established. It is an innovative mechanism as under the statutory regime, certain nominating bodies are given the entitlement to nominate individuals through the board of the authority. The benefit is that although the Government ultimately appoints these individuals, we can see a process whereby they are appointed by nominating bodies. It means the Executive branch of government does not have control over the legal profession. It is bad for the Government to have control over the legal profession because it would interfere with and damage the rights of citizens who wish to take cases against the State. The State is a very significant defendant in cases, with citizens taking cases against the State either through judicial review, the criminal process or civil litigation. It would be wrong if the impression was given to the Irish public that prior to the enactment of this legislation there was no regulation or soft-touch regulation in respect of lawyers in Ireland. That is not the case. The Law Society, presided over on a statutory basis by the President of the High Court, has a very vigorous supervisory and disciplining process, which has the effect of bringing solicitors who deviate from good practice to account. Similarly, the Bar Council disciplinary conduct tribunal, which has a majority of lay members, disciplines barristers. The reason there are more public complaints against solicitors is purely because they have access to client funds, something that barristers do not have. We support the motion before the House and we welcome the membership of the board. We wish the board well in its important future task.

After years of delay and fierce resistance from the bodies this legislation is supposed to regulate, and a rewriting of that legislation largely by the bodies, we have finally got to the point of appointing members to the board of the new legal services regulatory authority. Some change is desperately needed and I welcome that fact. To be honest, the role played by the Law Society over the past period has demonstrated it to be an organisation that is absolutely not fit for purpose. It is as bad, if not worse, as all the other organisations that have been set up to regulate and investigate themselves. Even with the best people in the world, that type of system would not work but we know there is a litany of disaster when we consider the Law Society's history. The idea that the Law Society would operate as both a representative and a regulatory body for solicitors is dysfunctional and unacceptable. The new Act from which the body is being set up removes some of the regulatory functions from the Law Society but I argue it is certainly not enough. I am not happy with the amount of power that the Law Society is keeping because of its historic activity. I will deal with one or two cases, and I assure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that where I mention names, they are in the public domain and have been the subject of court cases. They are beyond dispute. People like Mr. Fergus Appelbe are well known. He is a former solicitor, currently practising under supervision, and he was the subject of two "Today Tonight" investigations in the late 1980s because of his conduct. He was ultimately convicted of fraud. The hole left in accounts by this individual and his various companies amount to somewhere between €100 million and €200 million, and that hole will probably have to be filled by the Irish taxpayer, as the Minister of State knows. He is not allowed to be a company director in the North but he has been allowed to continue to practice under supervision here. The Law Society failed utterly to investigate the large and countless claims against him. It protected him and appointed him to its conveyancing committee. An individual who complained about this gentleman was Mr. Colm Murphy. Probably as a result of those complaints - in retaliation, in effect - a process was embarked upon, supported by the Law Society, which saw Mr. Murphy struck off, allegedly for breaching an undertaking he had given in the High Court. A solicitor for the Law Society, Ms Linda Kirwan, swore in an affidavit that she had witnessed him giving this undertaking. After Mr. Murphy was struck off, she acknowledged that she had not even been in court on the day in which the alleged undertaking was given. Not only that but there is no record of any such undertaking anyway. Nevertheless, Ms Kirwan is now head of complaints and client relations at the Law Society and was recently elected by the society to represent complaint handler members on the executive committee, despite her admitting to filing a false affidavit. That is incredibly worrying. We also know the documentation relied upon to strike off Mr. Murphy was a forged document presented by an individual called Mr. Frank Fallon, who subsequently received a seven-year jail term for fraud and forgery. It was alleged and ultimately proven that the document presented in the Murphy case was a forgery and there is evidence to suggest the Law Society was well aware of this but pursued this individual anyway. The point is in this case and others, the Law Society's barristers and external solicitors have deliberately misled the courts. I am not saying it lightly as these are facts. It was done to prevent this individual, Mr. Murphy, from getting a full hearing and redress in his case. Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns in the case spoke about repeated "skullduggery" on the part of the Law Society. The problem I have is that the Law Society has been unaccountable and a law unto itself. It decided to go after this individual but it did not decide to go after many others whose actions will cost the taxpayer dear. The unchecked role of the Law Society is something that should have been challenged before now. I am not happy to say this goes far enough and I am not happy with the role of the nominees being put forward in the process. I am glad the new authority is finally being set up, although it is not as robust or independent as I would like.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	17	The Legal Services Bill lingered around both Houses for quite some time. It changed hands from one justice Minister to another and there were various controversies along the way. We are all well aware of many issues from the time. The process has not been straightforward and the appointment of the board comes at a critical time in its life stages. In 2014, the European Commission wrote to Ireland via the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to notify us that Ireland was in breach of the law by virtue of current regulations regarding the advertising of solicitor and barrister services. In 2014, the Commission outlined in a very detailed list why we were in breach and our Government replied that it would fix the breach in the Legal Services Bill. According to Mr. Ken Murphy's piece in The Sunday Business Post, it transpires that the Law Society of Ireland was never informed that it was breaking the law, despite the Government being advised by the European Commission that this was the case. At a minimum we have had two full years where we have been in breach of the EU legislation. Significantly, the State did not remove consent from the Law Society for the current practices despite knowing about the breach. It is interesting that when it comes to other legislation or European directives there is hell fire and brimstone but this one was not addressed. The illegal advertising regulations have stifled competition in the sector and stopped any realistic option to reduce legal costs, which is a significant factor in the inflated awards we see in the courts, thus driving insurance prices higher and having an impact on the cost of living. There is a direct impact on the individuals practising as solicitors and barristers but there is an indirect but major impact on so many other people in society.It is interesting that the proposed chairperson was involved in the National Competitiveness Council. One of the big issues is the breach, which has not been addressed. It is interesting to note that the EU Commission wrote in recent weeks to the State again about the breach. Is this why we are now seeing this back in the House and why the board is being appointed? Is this why there is a sudden rush to appoint the board? Has practical provision, for example, a premises for board meetings, been made or is that why the establishment date is in October? While the State continues to hold the line until the Legal Services Regulation Act is commenced, all solicitors are in a position of being able to sue the State. More important, we have lost two valuable years during which increased competition in the market may well have driven down the cost of living, for example, insurance costs. On foot of the letter from the Commission and the article in The
Sunday Business Post, will the Minister of State immediately withdraw consent from the current legal regulations in order to promote enhanced competition and move towards compliance with EU regulation? Will the new board commit to acting upon the new regulations to ensure fairness in the market? Are there potential fines for being in breach? Has this methodology been worked through with the European Commission as a response to the letter received in terms of that breach?

I have been asking on the Order of Business and during Question Time when this board would be set up because it is long overdue. I have a list of the names of those to be appointed and I am glad to see it is happening. For too long, we have not had any real regulation. There were promises but it has taken a long time for it to be set up since the legislation was passed through the House. It is the same as many situations regarding the courts. I know there is a separation of duties but we must have some accountability. We had a referendum on the setting up of a Court of Appeal. I, for one, was not clear about what its functions were going to be at the time. It was just a new tier of judges with no indication as to the workload that would be involved or the number of cases to be held. We know there are massive backlogs in the courts and justice delayed is justice denied.  I welcome the setting up of this authority. I do not know how the people were selected. I am sure they are all eminent people but I do not see the names of lay people per se or, as I call them, ordinary folk. In many cases, they would have as much to offer and would bring a different perspective. The members need not all be former or serving public servants or people who held public office. It is important that we have a blend and balance on the board. It is also important that the board would be subject to timelines and have clearly laid out functions and accountability. Above all, it is important that the report to the Oireachtas would show that it is a functioning board and doing what it says on the tin. The need for it was there.  We know that because we do not seem to have any oversight of what goes on in the courts. With all due respect to my eminent colleague on my right - I am not barrister bashing - the courts are a difficult place for ordinary people to get justice. Yesterday, a Deputy asked about the special courts we are meant to set up to deal with the backlog in repossessions. Nothing is happening. There is a dangerous vibe out there and banks, receivers, sheriffs, repossession agents and, God knows, that whole army which has been set up are enjoying a lucrative business. I would also include some county registrars on that list. They are acting behind closed doors with no oversight and, in some cases, are acting appallingly against ordinary people. These are middle class people who tried to house themselves and paid their way. They paid for everything but ran into difficulties. All they want is fair play and respect, a bit of relief and to renegotiate terms. Some of them are dealing with vulture funds. Others are dealing with the so-called pillar banks, the banks we bailed out, but there is no redress. It is a daunting place and very hard for lay litigants to get access to justice in the courts. I hope this new board will have teeth and will take up the cudgels for the ordinary, plain people of Ireland who pass by the Four Courts on the quays and do not know what goes on in there. I have been there and stood with a good few of them. I had to move up from the back of the courtroom by two, three, four or perhaps five or six rows. I could not hear a thing. I sat beside litigants who could not hear what was going on either. I do not know the meaning of that. It is difficult enough to understand the language but it is appalling if we cannot hear what is being said. There must be a radical overhaul of how justice is delivered and how it is seen to be delivered. I have been through the system myself. I have a fair idea of it and I know how prohibitively expensive it is. I know the cost of doing business. I raised that competitiveness issue yesterday. If a person has to go anywhere near the legals, the money clocks up. It is a cash cow and it needs to be regulated. The free legal aid system also needs to be examined. I know of situations where free legal aid was availed of but top-ups were also being paid by those using it. They are in the business of crime and getting away with it using the proceeds of crime. We dealt with the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2016 last night. We need deeper examination of these issues. I wish the board well, but the jury is out on it and how it will perform as far as I am concerned. 
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	19	The Legal Services Regulatory Authority is an independent statutory regulator for all legal practitioners introduced by the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. The first point I will make is that there was a delay in the text of the motion being published. The Minister of State may not be aware of this, but the Business Committee agreed to this motion being tabled on 14 July. However, it took five days to get the text of the motion. The process to appoint members to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been ongoing since last January. Why it took so long for all of this to happen is puzzling. Perhaps the Minister of State, if he is to return to the House later, will inform the House as to why that was the case. That said, we welcome the motion. Other Deputies have given the reasons we are supportive of the authority getting off the ground. We will reserve judgment for the moment on whether the Act and the new regulatory body will be effective in lowering costs for persons accessing the legal system, which is one of the key challenges and tests for this new authority. We wish it well and hope it has the powers and ability to meet that high benchmark and high-level goal. We all believe that to be of value and I hope that will be one of the positive outcomes of this new authority. The responsibility will be on the authority to demonstrate its independence from the legal professions to show that it is effective. We suggest that the Oireachtas justice committee invite the members of the authority to come before it at a later stage to discuss its work. It would be good to have a relationship between the sectoral committee and the authority and I am sure that will happen as a matter of course. However, it should be embedded in the work of both the sectoral committee and the authority itself.  It will be a further two years before the authority is required to report back on its work on its mandate and a midway discussion would be useful in that regard. The more information we as Oireachtas Members get on how the authority is working and functioning, the sooner any positive or negative issues that arise can be addressed.We are hopeful that the new authority will address matters of codes of conflict, admission requirements to the legal professions, conflicts of interest and the long-standing need to address barriers to public interest litigation that exists within this jurisdiction. Conflicts of interest are a massive issue for the public in the case of major firms and we know that one individual, whom I will not name, secured many Government contracts during both the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition and the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition. The same individual is very close to the Fianna Fáil Party, and while there might not be anything wrong in what happened, it is very important that if there are potential conflicts, the authority will be able to capture them in order that people can have confidence when contracts are being put in place. It was this individual who was contracted by the NTMA to draft the NAMA legislation despite many rightly thinking this should be done in-house by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. While this is a step in the right direction, it is abundantly clear that real change to the legal professions will take at least another decade. We will allow the motion to proceed but urge the Minister to heed the concerns which we have and which our justice spokesperson has raised with the Department. We also request that the authority engage on an ongoing basis with the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality.

The motion, along with the similar motion of approval that was agreed before the Seanad on Tuesday, can enable the formal appointment of the 11 nominated members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. Underlying the comments just made, I sense an appreciation of the need to ensure that we will now have an effective new regulatory framework for the legal services sector. It is also important, with the necessary agreement of this House to today's motion, that the members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority be able to set about the early recruitment of a chief executive. Under section 24 of the Legal Services Regulation Act, the holder of this important office will be responsible for implementing the policies and decisions of the authority and the managing and controlling generally of its staff, administration and business while also being responsible to the authority for the performance of his or her functions. To minimise any delay in filling this pivotal role, administrative preparations are being made in support of the public recruitment by the new authority of a suitably qualified person for that post. A start-up support team is also being established and a suitable premises is being identified from which the new authority can commence its operations. Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about that point. These are the initial steps that will enable the chair, members and chief executive of the new regulatory authority to oversee and drive the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory regime and to shape it in the discharge of its powers and functions. It is also planned that the stage we are now entering in the setting up of the new authority will include the phased commencement of parts of the Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the roll of practising barristers and pre-action protocols. Following establishment of the authority, its appointment of a chief executive and the initial commencement of parts of the Act along the lines that I have just mentioned, the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the 2015 Act will be commenced. These deal with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal. The managed roll-out and commencement of these functions is planned for the autumn. This is being done to allow adequate time and preparation to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework. Let us not lose sight of the fact that this new complaints framework will be a regulatory watershed. For the first time in the history of the State and under legislation, members of the public who are aggrieved with the services they have received from a legal practitioner, whether solicitor or barrister, will now make their complaints to the independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority. They will no longer do so through the legal professional bodies as they do at present. The new legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal being established under the 2015 Act will deal with matters of serious misconduct arising in relation to solicitors and to barristers. This single and independent tribunal will, in time, replace the respective and separately operating conduct tribunals that deal with solicitors and barristers at the moment. Both the legal professions and the public who avail of their services will be served objectively by the new authority and tribunal in the event that they come before the new professional conduct and discipline regime. I also emphasise that the new regulatory authority will not be a static entity. The Legal Services Regulation Act has laid out a future path for the new authority which its chair, members and chief executive will have to drive and manage. There is a substantial programme of work
to be undertaken in the initial years of the new authority. This, in turn, can pave the way for future reforms under various provisions of the Act. These reforms cover admission policies of the legal professions, education and training for legal practitioners, unification of the solicitors' and barristers' professions, and public consultations on the operation of legal partnerships and on multidisciplinary practices as I have just mentioned, as well as on barristers holding clients' moneys and on barristers receiving direct instructions from lay clients in contentious matters. By way of responding to the concern that new regulators should be set up in a more sustainable and publicly accountable way, there will be periodic reviews of the operation of the Legal Services Regulation Act. The first of these is to take place 18 months after the establishment of the new regulatory authority to allow it some time to bed down in the discharge of its functions and to meet its early working commitments. This and the subsequent periodic reviews of the Act will be in addition to the normal annual, strategic and business planning obligations of the new body. Moreover, these reviews will include consultation with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, professional bodies and other stakeholders. I think the House will agree that having an inherent review mechanism within the Act should make the new regulatory authority more focused and responsive as an instrument of regulated change and reform. In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant parts of the 2015 Act between now and the end of this year, an allocation of €1 million was made under the Justice and Equality Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new regulatory authority. Any funding advanced from this allocation will be provided on a recoupable basis. Once in operation, the new regulatory regime will be self-funding by means of a levy on the regulated legal professions under the terms set out in Part 7 of the 2015 Act. The essential building blocks are now in place for a modernised and reformed legal services regulatory regime. What we need right now is the team to make that regime come into being. This has been reflected in Members’ contributions just now on this motion to approve for appointment the members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. The Committee on Justice and Equality is independent and will make its own decisions. When I was Chairman of the committee in the previous Dáil, we carried out a comprehensive review of this proposal and held hearings on the subject. Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned the initial draft and the committee intervened in this to allow everyone to have their say, which has had an impact on what is before us now. Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about a couple of matters. Section 218 of the Act will meet some of the concerns when it is commenced. The infringement has not been determined but formally notified and alleged by the European Commission. We have made legislative repairs in the Act. No fines arise and it was not rushed on account of the directive, as might have been thought. In answer to Deputy Clare Daly, the new Act puts far greater distance between the regulatory and representative functions of the Law Society and the Bar Council. It also puts an objective distance between practitioners and consumers. The independent disciplinary tribunal will also allow redress through the High Court. The board will be totally separate from the complaints handling and determination functions, to ensure due process. Deputy Mattie McGrath asked about the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Citizens Information Board and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. These are at the cutting edge of ordinary people's concerns and are all on the authority. They are totally independent bodies and will take note of issues relating to the courts and receivers etc., though this not a courts Act. The courts will be dealt with in other areas of reform in the administration of justice. We have had an election and a change of Government and that has delayed the process but we are now pressing on with the appointment of the authority. With the approval of the House of today's motion there is no barrier to a discussion between members of the committee and the new authority. The enhanced provisions for the oversight of State contracts will continue.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	23	I move amendment No. 1:In page 3, after line 28, to insert the following:
“Amendment of section 3 of Principal Act
3. Section 3 of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following subsection:“(2A) That possession of the substances listed in Part 1 and Part 2 of the Schedule not be subject to prosecution for amounts equating to personal use.”.”.This Bill is designed to criminalise the illegal sale and possession of certain prevalent prescription medicines. We would argue that criminalising those with addictions is simply meting out a further punishment on people who are already victims of the regressive laws surrounding prohibition. As Senator Lynn Ruane pointed out, as happened in Canada, this type of legislation will just move people on to new drugs and new ways of consuming them and when they are outlawed, they will move on to newer ones and so on, sometimes with devastating effect, even more on safe practices and drugs being used in this cycle of misery and punishment. When we debated the Bill a few weeks ago, I spoke at length about the system in place in Switzerland for more than 20 years. They have injection centres for heroin addicts and the state provides clean, safe prescription heroin to those who need it. The Swiss programme has been a fantastic success. It has saved countless lives and undermined and effectively destroyed the power of the drug dealers. The United States has chaos at the heart of its drugs war and has behind bars a higher proportion of its population than any country on the planet. Clearly, it is not working. In Switzerland, the gangs have no power over the addict they addicted because the state is caring for them. The average patient uses the programme for three years, after which 85% have stopped using every day. Crimes committed by those on heroin have plummeted, there are 55% fewer car thefts, and 80% fewer muggings and burglaries. That drop happened almost immediately after the programme started. HIV infections from heroin use have almost entirely disappeared. The Swiss started caring for addicts over 20 years ago by abandoning the American style of a zero tolerance approach and made heroin safe by taking it out of the hands of the criminals. The benefits of the system are crystal clear and the public have overwhelmingly defended the law from conservatives in two national referendums. Last year, the members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality travelled to Portugal to see first hand how the Portuguese decriminalisation system is working and to talk to those involved. In terms of the information the delegation brought back, they were told that 15 years ago, before they started, what was most feared was that this approach would cause drug consumption to increase, the authorities to be more tolerant towards drugs trafficking, allowing it to also increase, that Portugal could become the destiny for drug consumers from throughout Europe but especially from Spain and that the number of crimes directly related to drug addiction would rise, but that did not happen. Fifteen years have passed and drug consumption has not increased. The authorities kept at least the same level of intolerance towards drug trafficking, both internal and international. Portugal did not become a destination for drug consumers and the number of crimes directly related to drug addiction has decreased. At the same time, drug consumers are no longer looked upon or treated as criminals by the authorities but also by society, including their own families. They have become less dependent on traffickers and police discretion, being especially true when it comes to people with fewer resources. There was an end to thousands of criminal cases for drug consumption that cost time and money with absolutely no gain because if it is easier to know who is buying drugs, it is easier to know who is selling them. Why are we passing regressive laws today when nowhere has prohibition been seen to work? Why are we so intent on punishing those who need our care? Nothing but misery and waste will result from criminalising in this manner. Given that we are unlikely to get what we sought when we discussed the Bill a few weeks ago, namely, all prohibition lifted around these drugs, our amendment seeks to challenge the notion of prosecutions for small amounts of drugs for personal use. It is irrational to prosecute people for carrying something that is of a quantity that can only be for personal use. If the Minister intends to continue with her draconian prohibition laws around drugs, she should at least use some commonsense and stop wasting State money on arresting people who are not carrying enough to sell but only enough for their own consumption. It costs €1,700 a week to put someone in prison here. The number of people in prisons for drugs-related offences is ludicrous. It is about time we copped on to ourselves in that regard. Another amendment of ours was ruled out of order because it could cost the State some money. My amendment No. 1 will save the State money and it would be a very good idea for the Minister to accept it.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	24	In supporting the amendment I want to reiterate the points that have been made and say, as I did when the Bill first came before the Dáil, that it is very difficult to understand how a Bill shaped by An Garda Síochána, which is responsible for the area of justice, comes to the Department of Health. If the Department of Health is proposing a measure the Garda believe will help it in the war on crime or stop gangland killings, it should come through the Department of Justice and Equality, but this Bill is coming through the Department of Health. When we consider the holistic approach to drugs in this society, as stated by Deputy Wallace, we are way behind the times when we compare ourselves not just to modern countries like Switzerland and Portugal but also to some of the Third World countries like Uruguay and Paraguay, which have moved to legalise and curtail the amount distributed to each individual who requires it. I will move a Bill later to legalise cannabis for medicinal purposes but this amendment acknowledges that the personal use of drugs is rampant, particularly in impoverished parts of our inner cities. It reflects not just the availability of these drugs but, importantly, the alienation and detachment felt by many people who have no stake in society and who have been brought up to believe they are worthless. They failed in education and in employment, so why not fail at everything else? They are on a housing list but they will never get a home. When they seek to use the services that are put into communities for projects that will help their addiction and help them live better lives with their families, they find that the funding for those projects has been cut. The message those people get all the time is that they are pretty much worthless, and the pain and historical baggage they have in their lives is often inured by taking drugs, many of which until now have been illegal. We are now introducing a Bill to make it illegal to carry drugs that are available on prescription. This Bill will make the problem implode rather than address it because it is being approached from a criminal rather than a health point of view. As has been said, if we had our way we would be costing the State money. We would say that, at the very least, the Government should reverse all the nasty cuts the previous Government imposed on the drugs projects, the family projects and the youth projects throughout the inner city. At the very least it should provide a decent number of detoxification beds and facilities for people who have issues with addiction. If the Minister will not do that, she should stop criminalising those who have a health problem and no way out of that other than through the use of drugs, which takes their minds off the horrible lives they live.The amendment is important because it provides that those who carry prescription drugs for personal use are not criminalised. If they are not criminalised, then resources are freed because the courts and prisons will not be so choked up, as well as Garda time. It is quite a positive amendment in that regard. I would throw the whole Bill out if I had my way, but clearly this is what we have to live with. I will urge people to support this amendment later.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	25	I stand here today on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien who, unfortunately, is unable to attend the House. We support both amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 2. The treatment of addicts and users is first and foremost a health issue and not a criminal justice issue. I have articulated this on many occasions. Our focus in regard to the criminal justice system and drug misuse must be concentrated on suppliers and dealers. That is the area that needs to be addressed. I sincerely hope that we will proceed with the pilot injection centres, but it is a simple point of fact that if we are to proceed successfully then we must adopt this approach in law. To give credit where it is due, injection centres were championed by the last Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, the former Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, in the previous Dáil. I commend him on his openness and innovation and his correct stance on this matter. I commend the second amendment in the name of my colleague, Sinn Féin's justice spokesperson, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien. I will be moving amendment No. 2, which is an addendum to page 3 of the Bill. It proposes to amend section 4 of the principal Act by inserting a new subsection (4) stating: "It shall be lawful for any person, or a person of a class or description specified in regulations under this section, to have in his or her possession a reasonable amount of a controlled drug specified therein, provided that it is for personal use." This is a very reasonable position, as is the first amendment which is being tabled in the names of colleagues, two of whom have already spoken regarding their amendment. The amendments largely reflect a similar position. With regard to the purpose behind the legislation now under our address, I refer back to the last occasion on which such amending legislation was presented, in March 2015. I stated then and I reiterate now that we are on a hiding to nowhere if we address this particular matter in this way. We are endeavouring to catch up with the addition of different substances in the hope that we will get to the point at which the legislation is on a par with the criminal chemists. We are never going to be able to catch up with the criminal chemists. They will always be that one step - and many more steps - ahead of the system. I do not want to be a party to criminalising unfortunate people who find themselves caught up in dependency and what is called substance abuse. I have seen the tragedies in my own community, with the loss of two young lives in my home town. With regard to dependency on synthetic cannabinoids such as "clockwork orange" and all the other little packs I have seen strewn on the paths of my home town as if they were cigarette butts, it is a frightening situation. As I have said on previous occasions, two deaths is two too many. We also face the prospect of further lives being lost, such is the grip that this cohort of drugs is taking in my community. It is a very serious problem indeed, which needs more than just a criminal justice response. That applies to those who are the suppliers and dealers. However, people who are using on a daily basis and, because they are extremely addictive, become dependent upon these drugs, need a very different response from us, from society and from the State. There may be some merit in taking a look at the most recent British legislation regarding how they address this matter. I have not had the opportunity to properly evaluate it, as it is only relatively recent in terms of its enactment. I believe the focus should not be on trying to catch up with the criminal chemists. We should be looking at addressing the impact or effect of the substances. It should not be the Garda or the law enforcement agencies, be they on this island or on the neighbouring island, who must always try to establish what in heaven's name is involved in these substances at any given time. We should be focusing wholly and solely on the suppliers and the dealers and, if we are lucky internationally, with the criminal chemists and those who are making huge profits from this most unacceptable business. For those in my own community who I know are users and are dependent, I hope I am representing their voices. On their behalf and to offer some hope of a change of course by these Houses at some point in the not too distant future, I will be supporting both amendments as tabled. I will also be supporting the final passage of the legislation.
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	26	Fianna Fáil supports the Bill, and while I respect Deputy Wallace's arguments, I believe we do need to examine broader drug reform and what has worked elsewhere. Making a specific legislative amendment will not change the problem and will not improve the lives of many users. We have seen the impact of these drugs throughout our country. In fairness to the Garda and to others who have called for this legislation, I believe it is more of an interim measure to actually tackle the dealers and, necessarily, the users. It applies to dealers who are carrying very small amounts of a drug. They abuse users by carrying such small quantities and selling the drug on. Under the current legal situation the Garda is powerless to tackle dealers.That is what the Minister of State is trying to do here. We need to examine the Stanton report and see what has worked well in other countries. The UK Public Health Agency recently issued a report on reform and how to deal with this as a health matter. I spoke at the Oireachtas Committee on Health about prevention and education. Many young people who take various gateway drugs and increase their consumption over years equate cannabis with tobacco although it has a worse health outcome. Prevention, education and a more holistic approach are important. As part of the next national drugs strategy we need to focus on those pillars and not punish end users. We also need to focus on treatment. If this is to be addressed as a health matter, it has to be properly addressed as such. Given the crisis in the health service and the way it deals with many problems, I have no confidence that it can manage many of the users who are vulnerable and need that intervention. We also need to help those who are in prison by offering them the opportunity to be rehabilitated. I have read widely in this area and the problem of abuse of prescription medicines will not be solved by regulation alone. It is a fair interim measure that will address a lacuna in our legislation. The Garda has tried to deal with this by punishing dealers. I would not like to see any vulnerable user punished under this legislation. In the current situation, hundreds of users have wide access to these drugs on the basis that the Garda can do nothing to intervene with the dealers. It was reported in some newspapers and gardaí have stated that the dealers asked for the drugs back because the legal situation was so uncertain. This is a necessary measure. It is not the only measure. We do need to consider this from a legal perspective and also address it as a health matter but that cannot be done with a simplistic amendment that will not help many of the users who cannot access treatment, or future users who do not receive the education in schools. It does not exist in the social and personal health education and other modules in our schools. It is important to focus on that as part of the next national drugs strategy and consider this as a broader problem. I thank the Minister of State and the other speakers. I respect their sentiments and their arguments but it is not appropriate to accept the amendment.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	27	We have to consider this amendment in the context of the discussions and the very thorough work done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality last year on the drugs issue. It is never acceptable to say this is only now and we will come back and look at the bigger picture and change our approach in the future. Everybody has improved their understanding of this issue dramatically. The committee strongly recommended the introduction of a harm reduction and rehabilitative approach and said the possession of small amounts of illegal drugs should be dealt with by a civil and administrative approach rather than a criminal justice one. That was a cross-party view based on substantial work undertaken by the members of the committee, many of whom made a personal journey in their understanding of this issue. Why have committees if the Minister then recommends what is in essence the opposite of what the committee said? Our amendment is completely in keeping with the committee’s analysis. If we are saying it is a health issue and needs to be dealt with in that way we must view it as such because of the dislocating impact on those who become the victims of a criminal justice approach. There are people in prison who have desperately sought to have treatment made available to them but the resources are not there to access that. I appreciate Deputy Chambers’ point that it is only the dealers but we are dealing with Garda discretion against the backdrop of many problems inside An Garda Síochána. The Garda already has powers of arrest for possession of other unlawful substances and it is not just the dealers who are targeted in this situation. It would not necessarily be the case under this legislation, although I understand the very specific circumstances in the inner city areas that have led the Government to introduce this Bill. I know many in the communities support it but it is a knee-jerk response, probably for the best of intentions. Unfortunately, when we do this it can have the most far-reaching unintended consequences and therefore our amendment is tabled to cut across that, and to ensure it would not happen and that people we do not want to victimise would not be victimised. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is put forward. 
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	28	I thank all the Deputies who have spoken on the amendment. The proposed amendments, if accepted, would mean that a person in possession of certain controlled drugs could not be prosecuted under the misuse of drugs legislation where the amount could be thought to be for personal use. I fully understand and appreciate the intent behind the proposed amendment. However, overnight, it would become effectively legal to possess NBOMes, legal highs or any of the other drugs which were re-controlled by emergency legislation last year. In effect, it would mean that Ireland would be open for business for persons from Ireland and abroad wishing to buy and use drugs for personal use. We can all remember the national and international headlines from last year such as Ireland accidentally legalises drugs. We do not want to go back to that.  I have said many times that I also do not want to criminalise addicts. I have met many of them and have dealt with them all my life through my community work. As I have also said, however, the development of any policy to provide an alternative to criminalisation has to be carefully thought through. We have heard many speak during the debate about the Portuguese model. In Portugal, it is an offence to possess a small quantity of drugs for personal use. It is not a criminal offence, but it is nevertheless still an offence. There are other forms of sanctions which can be applied, as well as referral to addiction programmes.  This amendment removes the offence of possession and replaces it with nothing. It becomes a free for all. This amendment would mean that no matter how many times a person is apprehended with a quantity of drugs for personal use, that person cannot be prosecuted. What does for “personal use” mean? Is it for personal use today, for a week or a month? A person could possess a significant quantity of a substance, but argue that this is for his or her sole use. I cannot, therefore, accept this amendment. Legislation has to be carefully crafted to ensure that no unintended and undesirable consequences occur. A change to our legislation on such an important matter requires careful consideration. I believe that a decriminalisation model in Ireland must be one that suits the Irish context and is evidence-based. I also believe that this kind of approach will only work if it is accompanied by timely treatment and harm reduction services, backed up by wrap-around supports which foster recovery.  An examination of the approach to drugs policy and practice in other jurisdictions will help to identify any additional evidence-based approaches which might be considered in an Irish context. The development of the national drugs strategy is the vehicle for doing this. I encourage every Deputy who has contributed to this debate in this House and in the Seanad to contribute to the consultation process which I will launch in September.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	29	Last week, the CSO published a report that showed Ireland's growth rate surging to 26.3% in 2015. It made a mockery of Ireland and was described as leprechaun economics by the Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman. The publication of this report makes no sense, in particular because of the reputational damage it has caused. Last week, Deputy Micheál Martin called for the data collection methods to be changed and for a proper and fair assessment to be carried out to prevent something like this ever happening again. Is the Government taking that request on board?  The growth rate of 26.3% shows us having a growth rate four times that of China and comes only weeks after the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said in his summer economic statement that the growth rate this year would be between 5% and 6%. We have to acknowledge that there is economic growth, but it is still very much a two-tier recovery. Large parts of the country have seen no recovery and many people watching today have not felt the benefit of any economic recovery. We now face the extra challenge of Brexit. The UK has already announced its plans to reduce corporation tax to 15%, and today's newspapers refer to the UK abolishing corporation tax when it is outside of the EU. That the extra €280 million obligation comes on the back of a report that bore no relation to Ireland's economic growth is absolutely galling. Public services are stretched beyond all limits. The country still has 2,100 children and their families who are without homes and are staying in hostels. Home help hours have been slashed. People with disabilities cannot get access to personal assistants. It is mind-boggling, to say the least, that this report was published. It was compared to the works of James Joyce and Flann O'Brien in the Financial Times. As a result of this, it would appear that Ireland now has to increase its net contributions to the EU in the form of an extra €280 million. This was confirmed yesterday by the Minister for Finance in reply to a parliamentary question to my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath. The €280 million requirement could have been spent on housing, health, education or justice. It is real cash and will have to be found in 2017. What impact will it have on our services? What budget will have to account for it?

It is important to remember that the CSO is independent and has commented on its figures and some processes it intends to examine further. We regularly discuss the independence of bodies in the House when they report on various issues. The CSO is an independent body that reports on figures. The GDP figures released were affected by exceptional factors, which shows the complexity and difficulty of interpreting Irish macroeconomic data. Further work needs to be done on the interpretation of those figures. As a small economy, changes made by very large multinationals can have a dramatic affect on our headline statistics. As those statistics were one-off and exceptional in nature, we will not make economic policy on that basis. We will set policy on the basis of the more normal growth rates, such as those projected by the Department of Finance, in the region of 3.5% to 4%. The Deputy used the word "slash". Nothing is being slashed. The Deputy mentioned home care and services for children. There is increased investment in every single area. We cannot deal overnight with some of the demands that exist, whether in the health services or other areas, but ongoing and detailed investment is now happening given the growth rates in the economy. More jobs are being announced almost every day. Of course the recovery has not reached everyone in the country, but let us reflect on the fact that the macroeconomic figures are good for the country. Despite the challenge of Brexit and other potential shocks, if we can keep that going the investment will continue. The EU budget for 2017 has not been finalised. The European Commission presented a draft EU budget for 2017 in late June, but negotiations will continue until mid-November. The Minister confirmed the figure that may be owed, but all member states, including Ireland, benefit from the programmes funded through the EU budget. Ireland has been a net beneficiary in the order of more than €40 billion from the EU over the years. The summer economic statement sets the fiscal space. The available resources for 2017 are about €1 billion. That position remains the same, as it is fixed each spring. All EU member states do this in order that planning can begin for the budget without having to wait for the most up-to-date figures. In terms of planning for services, they will not be impacted by the situation in which we find ourselves based on the CSO figures, which were exceptional. There is ongoing economic growth. There are improvements in the taxes that are being collected. We stick by the fiscal space that is available for investment in services and reductions in tax.

We had enough of that with the CSO report. Even the Governor of the Central Bank did not accept the report. I again ask whether the Government will accede to the request of Deputy Martin last week to change how data are collected and have a proper assessment of the figures. Is the Tánaiste saying that this money will not have to be paid to the EU? Is she contradicting what her colleague, the Minister for Finance, said in reply to a parliamentary question? I refer to services. The Tánaiste must not have heard "Morning Ireland" today. A woman spoke on the programme about how both her parents suffer from dementia but their home help hours were cut from 20 to four. That is a fact. I have provided the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities copious examples of people who are living in their own homes and for whom home care packages have been sanctioned, yet who have been informed that the necessary resources are not in place to deliver services. Longford-Westmeath is one example. If a person dies and his or her home help hours are returned, only 25% of the hours are relocated. In any person's terms, that is a cut in services. What impact will the €280 million obligation have on services for the people we are honoured to represent in the House?

That is partly driven by the agreement between the Department of Health, the HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies, which represented a combined investment of €27.5 million. Just some weeks ago a total of €500 million was agreed in extra investment in the health service and part of that is intended to support further home care packages. That is laid out very clearly. The Minister for Health and the Ministers of State in the Department of Health have indicated that home care packages will be increased but it will take time to roll out the process. I heard the story on "Morning Ireland" this morning. I am sure the Minister will investigate what precisely has happened in that situation, given the needs of the woman in question.

Yesterday, the coroner's court held an inquest into the death by suicide of a young man in November 2014, Ryan Dempsey from the Liberties. He was in his early 20s and he had his full life ahead of him. He was clearly a young man at risk. He had been discharged five times from accident and emergency units in the six-month period before his death. On one occasion when he took an overdose he was brought to the accident and emergency unit and discharged on the same day. Another time he was found hanging and brought to the accident and emergency unit and discharged 12 hours later. The following day he tried to throw himself out of a window and again he was brought to the accident and emergency unit and he was discharged within hours. On the final occasion he presented himself to the accident and emergency unit where he expressed suicidal feelings. He was left in a room by himself where he attempted to cut himself twice. He was then transferred to a ward and left on his own again. Ryan hung himself and died. How hard it was for his loving family to see their son suffer like that. The family suffered too as they desperately tried to get the help and support Ryan so urgently needed. They are still suffering the loss of their son and brother. At this particularly difficult time I acknowledge the presence of Ryan’s father, Fran, who is in the Gallery, and members of his courageous family. We failed Ryan. The health system failed Ryan. How different it might have been if Ryan was provided with the proper follow-up care on his first presentation. His family believe that he was not assessed properly, he was not observed properly and his care was inappropriate and inadequate right up until the time he took his life. Ryan was failed by a mental health service which simply does not function at the times when people need it. Accident and emergency units are not the right place for people in acute mental distress. We must fund the delivery of community and early intervention services, as was promised in A Vision for Change ten years ago. Ten years on, we still do not have a 24-7 crisis intervention service, not a single crisis house has been established and at present there are just 15 suicide crisis intervention nurses in the State. People in distress are presenting to the Garda and accident and emergency units, places where overstretched and sometimes inappropriately trained staff struggle and do their best but they are not capable of providing the appropriate care. Today, a shocking report issued by the ISPCC further underlined the desperate needs in this area. The report states that children can wait for up to four weeks for an emergency mental health nurse and it takes 18 months to see a child psychologist. I am sure the Minister will agree that is not acceptable. The Tánaiste is not new to government. She sat at the Cabinet table for the past five years. We still lack 24-7 crisis intervention and appropriate support services. When will young people like Ryan be served and not failed by the mental health system?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	38	As Deputy McDonald recounted that individual story, everyone's thoughts in this House are with the family of the young man who lost his life so tragically. Mental health is a priority. We all know it has not been a priority in this country for decades but there is increased investment to ensure that young men and women get the kind of services they need at times of acute psychological distress. There is no excuse, however, for poor professional practice. If a person turns up at a centre, it is clear that proper risk assessments must be made and appropriate action taken. Next week the Minister of State in the Department of Health will present a memo for information to the Cabinet on the establishment of a youth mental health task force to ensure there is an even greater focus on this area. That is part of the process of enhancing services and raising the national conversation to ensure greater awareness of mental health issues. The investment the Government is providing in both adult and children’s psychiatric services will ensure that the kind of risk assessment that is needed is done and that services are available both locally and nationally. Deputy McDonald is aware that health funding has increased by 5.2% or €41 million and €35 million has been ring-fenced for the mental health area. We have much work to do in the area of mental health to ensure there is a consistent service throughout the country and that young people who turn up at accident and emergency units are referred and have the appropriate crisis service. As a former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I am very familiar with the area of children’s services where there has been a significant improvement. We now have 67 child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams around the country. As the Deputy is aware there have been recruitment difficulties but those services provide a range of specialist services for young people. Very often it is the 18 to 25 year age group that have had difficulties as they fall between the children’s services and appropriate adult services but I assure the House that there is a greater focus on the area. The Minister of State will focus her attention on it and once the task force is established then a variety of actions will be taken to ensure that the mental health services continue to develop to meet the needs of young men such as the one described by Deputy McDonald who so tragically lost his life. There is increased investment. The agreed HSE service plan for 2016 highlights the priorities such as the development of counselling services, increased Jigsaw centres that reach out to particularly vulnerable young people in communities across the country and community mental health facilities, to which Deputy McDonald specifically referred, as well as better liaison between acute hospitals and mental health services. That is where the priorities lie. I expect that those services will continue to develop in the coming months because the funding is in place and the political will exists to make sure that we have the kind of mental health services people need.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	39	Ten years ago A Vision for Change held out the promise of a modern, responsive, resourced service for people in crisis and with mental illness, including those with suicidal ideation and who are in acute danger. Ten years on that promise has been broken. That is a fact. All of the talk of political will and priority only serves to highlight the fact that for the past ten years mental health has not been a political priority and that there has not been the political will to ensure that young men such as Ryan, or anyone else in a state of deep and profound distress and crisis, is not left in accident and emergency units for eight hours or longer, because that is the common experience. It is wrong for people in that level of distress to be in accident and emergency units, which as we know are overrun and overburdened as it is.The Tánaiste mentioned CAMHS. That is a fantastic service but it also has a disgraceful waiting list. The Tánaiste knows that. What I want from the Tánaiste today, and what I know the Dempsey family and others want, is to hear that when the budget comes in October, all of this political will of which the Tánaiste speaks will translate itself in real terms into funds, staff and a plan which, unlike A Vision for Change, will be delivered. If we are to remember and offer sympathy to the family of Ryan Dempsey, surely the only solace and comfort we can offer is that we fix the system and ensure that the political will is more than simple rhetoric.

It is borne out by the action plans that have been put in place already. Obviously, we all hear what the Deputy is saying about the particular situation in relation to Ryan and the tragedy that that is. However, make no mistake: we have a Minister of State for the Department of Health focusing on mental health issues and bringing forward plans. We have increased investment. I have said there is difficulty in recruiting staff but every effort is being made to recruit the appropriate staff. That is seen in the huge growth in the CAMHS throughout the country. There are 67 CAMHS teams. Keeping in mind the economic situation that we have faced, if we look back just a number of years, we had nothing like 67 CAMHS teams operating around the country. Some services see people quickly. There are arrangements in place for emergencies. One would hope that young men like Ryan would have been able to access those services. However, we all know that there is further work to be done. The investment is there. I take the Deputy's point about the upcoming budget and the need to continue to prioritise this area in order that people receive help in an appropriate way and that the services link effectively with one another, especially accident and emergency departments and mental health services.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	41	What plans does the Government have and what arrangements are being made within the Estimates to address the appalling conditions of our rural roads network? We had an election six months ago. Prior to that election, the big parties conducted their research, had their focus groups, were taking soundings as to what the issues were and were sending people to America and the UK. I am surprised that the big parties, particularly Fine Gael, did not consult their councillors. The one message they would have received from rural Ireland is that there is a massive neglect of the rural road network. As a result of councillors losing touch with their constituents, the Fine Gael Party and other big parties suffered a loss of support. I have to say that I felt sorry for many Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors who canvassed rural areas and came back and said that they were ashamed and embarrassed to be asking people for votes from laneways, byroads and side roads that were simply inaccessible. According to a recent report, there are 91,000 km of regional and local roads in Ireland which account for 94% of the country's road network and carry 54% of all the traffic on our roads. That same report highlights that when the condition of those roads was examined, over 75% of them were in urgent need of repair and maintenance. At the same time, we have an additional 75,000 cars travelling on Irish roads since 2010. That has increased the annual income from road tax by €17 million. While that money was coming into the Exchequer, at the same time there was a decrease in the funding for our national roads programme. In my own constituency, the national roads fund decreased from €608 million in 2008 to the current figure of €294 million. My county of Tipperary was allocated a total of €45 million for roads in 2011. By 2015, that had fallen to €28 million. In the current year, it has fallen by a further €3 million. In other words, within five years, we have lost €25 million worth of funding for our road network. The unacceptable quality of the rural road network is having a negative impact on the social and economic well-being of rural communities. There are school buses, ambulances and buses that are collecting people to take them to day care centres on these roads. I am aware of a situation in which an ambulance was taken out of service for three weeks due to damage that was done when bringing a patient from one of these side roads. Every day, my office receives countless complaints of dangerous situations in which people are forced to drive erratically to avoid potholes. Vehicles have been damaged, tyres have been ripped off and the steering, wheels and suspension of cars have been damaged seriously. These rural dwellers pay the same car tax as urban dwellers but are at a complete disadvantage.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	42	I acknowledge and am very aware, as are all Fine Gael councillors and Deputies, that the capital budget for local and regional roads is still recovering. There is a huge amount of work to be done. It is still recovering after the economic crash. That is why the new partnership Government will increase the budget for this infrastructure very dramatically by 50% in the years ahead and as the national finances improve. That is the reality of the commitment that has been made. As the Deputy will be aware, the capital plan provides €6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with €4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing and extensive networking throughout the country. A sum of €1.6 billion has been earmarked for new projects. Clearly, there is an acceptance of the point that the Deputy is making and a reflection of that in the capital budget for the coming year and the years ahead. Some of the funding has been announced already. The approach has been to include a mix of projects throughout the country to address particular constraints, including bottlenecks and port connectivity. The transport element of the capital plan is based on a gradual build-up in capital funding for the road network from - I agree with the Deputy - what is currently a relatively low base towards the levels needed to carry out the kind of maintenance and improvement works the Deputy refers to. It is well recognised at Government level that there are serious problems. The money is being invested. In Tipperary, I take the Deputy's point that there were reductions over the years. We have to remember why. It was because we were in the middle of an economic crash and recession. However, in January this year, for example, regional and local allocations were announced. A sum of €15.9 million was allocated to Tipperary County Council to deal with some of the issues the Deputy has mentioned. Clearly, further investment is needed. It has been allocated in the capital fund and will address a range of issues in an ongoing manner in the period ahead.

They feel ignored, forgotten and abandoned. I am not at all happy that, effectively, what the Tánaiste is telling me is that the Government recognises that there is a serious problem but that it cannot do anything about it until 2019. Can the Tánaiste be more specific? I welcome the fact that there will be additional funds available. Could the Tánaiste be more specific about whether we are going to get an increased capital allowance for each of the council areas, including Tipperary, in the budget and in the current Estimates that will be under discussion in September? We cannot wait for another two years. Our roads are in an appalling condition. People are extremely angry and agitated. There are rural communities such as the farming community that have situations such as milk collection tanks that will not go down some of these roads. We have people who are refusing to do business with small farmers because of the fear of damage to their property while entering those farms. This is a serious issue that needs urgent redress. We need a co-ordinated programme throughout the country to ensure we have a five-year programme that gives us value for money and a return on investment and that is properly managed in order that people in rural areas can see a visible improvement in the road network.

I will bring to his attention once again the points the Deputy has made today. Clearly, as people begin to see the kind of investment that now is possible because of the recovery, they will not - as the Deputy described - feel abandoned. They will see improvements in their local and national roads and the Government is committed to an increase in funding in 2017, 2018, 2019 and onwards. Hopefully, as the economic situation improves, it is an area for critical investment. I make the point that as Members are aware, last winter's flooding caused great damage and an additional €106 million was allocated nationwide to deal with the additional damage done. Clearly however, more is needed, as I have acknowledged and in respect of capital infrastructure, the Government has begun the allocations precisely to deal with the problems the Deputy has outlined. I also remind the Deputy there will be a review of the capital plan next year. I certainly have no doubt but that the Minister will consider the points the Deputy made in the context of this year's budget.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	45	It was announced yesterday that June was the hottest month in recorded history. It broke the record set in June 2015, which is not surprising because May also was the hottest May ever in history, as was the case in respect of April, March, February, January, December and pretty much every month for the past 14 months. What is happening to the planet is beyond comparison with anything even the most strident scientists thought would happen in respect of global warming starting to take effect. It also is clear that Ireland is not living up to the call made earlier this week by the former President, Mary Robinson, which is that the wealthy industrialised countries must act first and strongest when faced by that scientific reality and the scale of the challenge. Ireland has the third highest per capita emissions in Europe. Ireland is one of only two countries in Europe that will not meet the international commitments we made to cut our emissions by 2020. We will not get next or near them and will be lucky to get halfway there. I reiterate we are one of only two countries in Europe that has managed that, as all the other countries have managed to meet the targets they have set. This is not a surprise because it largely is due to a lack of political will. It is due to the halving of budgets on retrofitting buildings in the term of the previous Government and our lack of smart meters, which every other advanced country is now putting in place. Moreover, much as we need roads, we need public transport more and the previous Government pulled all the major public transport projects. Ireland's transport emissions are now expected to grow by 16% between now and 2020. Similarly, because of the policies the Government has set in agriculture, Ireland's emissions in that sector are due to increase by 7% between now and 2020. I could go through every sector in which action must be taken; no action is being taken. If one talks to anyone in Brussels, one will be told the only political response from the outgoing Government was to expend all the political capital Ireland gained in Europe over the past five years to try to achieve one thing, which it achieved yesterday, that is, to get Ireland off the hook and not to have a firm commitment to take further action. The facts in this regard are clear. Ireland's 2020 target was to cut its emissions by 20% whereas its 2030 target is to cut its emissions - effectively when one includes all the buyouts we have secured - by 20.4%. As a result of what was agreed yesterday, we have a 0.4% increase in our ambition. This will cost us all dearly because some of the buyouts we secured will require us to buy ourselves out. Moreover, some of the science to which we are looking to try to get out of taking any further effort is highly questionable, may not hold up and may leave us being obliged to make much more significant strides in later years. My question to the Tánaiste is why has the Government spent all its political capital to define Ireland as a country that wants to fiddle while the rest of the world burns? Surely it is not in our interests to place Ireland at the bottom of the league on climate, which is what the Government is doing. Furthermore, we will miss out on the economic opportunity that will come to those countries that lead. Why does the Government insist on trying to turn this green country brown?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	46	Ireland is committed to achieving the transition to a competitive low-carbon climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy and as the Deputy stated, it makes sense to so do. Access to secure, clean, affordable energy is essential to our future economic growth and our ability to attract and retain investment to Ireland and to build Irish enterprise depends on our ability to guarantee a reliable supply of energy, for example, at a competitive cost. We must lessen our dependence on fossil fuels and must reduce our emissions and the Government has engaged in detailed discussions with the Commission, as the Deputy is aware, to highlight some particular issues in respect of Ireland. As the Deputy noted, there is a package of measures and I reiterate to him there has been extensive engagement with the Commission on the issue to date. As the Deputy is aware, it will be a challenge for the agriculture sector to meet the targets. That point has been made and there has been highly detailed discussion on that, on the implications for Ireland and on how we best manage the targets. Those discussions were held in that context, that is, it was necessary to have detailed discussions on the agriculture and forestry industries. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has engaged with the Commission for some years to ensure this clear understanding of the agriculture and forestry sectors in Ireland, as well as to seek consistency between European Union agrifood and climate policies. While the Government is committed, there are particular issues it was necessary to discuss. The Government wanted to make sure that whatever we agree is consistent with those fundamental principles and proposals from the Council the Deputy has outlined. The Government is committed to moving forward. It has made the case regarding particular sectors of the economy in which particular difficulties arise but the Government is committed. Moreover, the Deputy should note the Government is committed to public transport. That programme and the capital moneys that are available now are committed to the development of proper public transport infrastructure nationwide.

How can one say the Government is committed when, if one examines what was agreed yesterday, the neighbouring countries of Britain, Germany, Denmark, Finland and Sweden - the countries with which we should be comparing ourselves - are twice as committed? As I stated, Ireland effectively is going for a 20% target for 2030 whereas they effectively are going for 40%. The Tánaiste is correct; the Government did engage with the Commission in Brussels and was highly successful. It basically used all of Ireland's political capital to state Ireland should be counted out. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who is sitting beside the Tánaiste, should have real concerns about this because the rest of the world not just in Europe, but in America and in Asia, is starting to take this issue seriously because they can see the world burning and want to play their part. Moreover, they think economic opportunities will come from it. The real risk is that in holding Ireland back and in stating it should be counted out, as it will not play its part, we will miss the economic opportunity that comes for those who lead. I note the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is speaking. In the debate last night on the Energy Bill, he recognised that not only are we falling behind on our emissions targets, but we are also falling behind in our renewables targets. As the Minister stated last night, every percentage point that we are below our targets in that area will cost us €150 million per year and as the Minister for Finance recognised in the spring economic statement, our failure to meet even those low targets we now are setting for 2020 will cost us further hundreds of millions of euro. To conclude, if we are serious, we will need a quadrupling of the money the Minister, Deputy Naughten, gets. We will need a tripling of the public transport budget and will need to make some tough and strong political decisions, rather than stating we are committed, only to then do the exact opposite in the international arena.

I never thought I would see the day when Deputy Naughten was standing in for the Taoiseach. I would like to raise a serious issue that has been brought to my attention with regard to the Enniscorthy joint venture and the awarding of the contract for that critical piece of infrastructure. I understand the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland have been made aware that a contract awarded has subsequently been subcontracted to a European company that is proposing to bring in its own workers and accommodation and to pay its workers substantially less than the minimum wage. If allowed to proceed, this will have negative consequences. What is the Government doing to ensure that we do not have another GAMA on our hands?

I wish to raise with the Tánaiste the issue of rent certainty. The housing action plan commits to the introduction of legislation on tenancy arrangements in the private rental sector and to a strategy for the private rental sector. The plan is high on promises but low on delivery, particularly on the issue of rent certainty. The Tánaiste will recall that Sinn Féin brought an initiative to the Dáil to deliver rent certainty by linking rent inflation to the Consumer Price Index and to give people some comfort - people who, as we all know, are being fleeced with average rents of €1,500 per month in Dublin, for example. When does the Government propose to legislate for rent certainty? I remind our colleagues in Fianna Fáil that the Fianna Fáil Party knocked back a proposal that would have given people rent certainty on a promise of something that has not materialised and that is not missed by people who are under pressure.

Pillar 4 of that plan focuses on improvements in the rental sector. The Minister is committed to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector by quarter 4 of 2016. Work is beginning immediately on the strategy for the rental sector. It will contain a range of actions focused on four key areas: security, or providing greater certainty to landlords and tenants; supply, by maintaining the existing levels of rental stock; an examination of standards, which are important; and a broadening of the powers of the Residential Tenancies Board to enable it to provide its services more effectively. As I said, work is beginning immediately on developing the actions that are needed, legislative and otherwise, for the rental sector.

The ISPCC published its annual report today, the details of which I will not go into now. It makes for harrowing reading to learn that some children are waiting 18 months for referral to a child psychologist. I did not hear the Tánaiste's response to Deputy McDonald in relation to the detailed chapter in the programme in the Government which sets out when some of these actions will occur. Perhaps she will tell the House specifically when the task force on youth mental health will be set up. In that regard, the Tánaiste referenced something that will happen next week. What specifically will happen next week and, as the Dáil will not be in session then, how will people be brought up to speed in that regard? On the issue of building capacity-----

The task force will bring together all of the different services, including community services, public and private, to develop a programme that can be applied to every community. Work in that regard is under way. A memo will be brought to Cabinet next week. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will inform every Member of the House about the series of actions that will arise from that, including the protocols needed and practise guidelines for the interaction, as Deputy McDonald highlighted, between accident and emergency departments and specialist CAMHS.

This arises from the fact that native Irish capitalism is so weak that it has to prostrate itself in front of multinational corporations and allow them to pay virtually nothing in this State. The Government boasts that €1.5 million is being given to the north inner city. Meanwhile, we have to hand over €280 million for no other reason than to spare the blushes of this Government. We are constantly threatened with fines by Europe with regard to public housing initiatives and water charges. We have now been fined by Europe because of a fake growth rate of 26% arising from the slavish attitude of this State to multinationals. It allows them to locate brass-plate operations in the State, showing fake profits. The Government ought to be ashamed.

The Government will continue to act on the projections made by the Department of Finance. One must understand why those figures were what they were. There were specific reasons, and the budget negotiations continue with the EU.

I pursued the matter in 2014 and during the past fortnight. Sadly, it was confirmed to me through a Parliamentary Question yesterday that there are 382 patients awaiting orthodontic treatment in north Tipperary and similar numbers in south Tipperary, with only two people employed to look after those patients. This is very telling and very sad for the families involved. Could the Tánaiste implement this independent review, if it has been completed by the HSE, or ask the Minister for Health to deal with it?

Up to 8,000 children in west Dublin who have had their broken bones treated in Tallaght Hospital will not be able to have their cases reviewed in the hospital. The hospital has said that the service was being delivered by a locum consultant whose contract has now ceased. Despite the best efforts of hospital management, it not proved possible to maintain the service in the short term due to recruitment challenges. This is a consultant in Tallaght Hospital servicing children's broken bones. This service will be moved to Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin. Why was the consultant not replaced to deal with this issue in the short term? We urgently need to ensure that these children in Tallaght will not be forced to travel to Crumlin, thereby putting more pressure on scarce resources there.

As the new national hospital for children develops, there are strong plans in place to ensure there will be a very good service in Tallaght for children in respect of a range of services. The Deputy is making a point about a specific consultant. There is a question mark over who will replace that person. There has been difficulty in recruiting staff for the hospital services. This issue also arose recently in respect of a particular service at St. Vincent's University Hospital. This has been resolved by the action of the Minister and arrangements have been made for that service, so I will ask the Minister to contact the Deputy about the circumstances in Tallaght as I am not familiar with them.

I received a reply to a Parliamentary Question on a similar issue in the past few weeks that was very interesting. It concerned the number of children from primary schools, particularly boys, who have been repeatedly referred to accident and emergency departments having self-harmed. To what extent will the programme for Government be able to deal with that issue? Care after the event is a difficult issue, particularly when the same child is repeatedly referred to accident and emergency departments having self-harmed.

The transport strategy for the greater Dublin area for 2016 to 2035 was published earlier this year. It is underpinned by the Government's capital programme, which sees a scaled-back metro north, the abandonment of metro west and no immediate timeline for a Luas strategy for Lucan. The programme for Government specifically commits to instigating a full review of public transport policy to ensure services are sustainable into the future and meet the needs of a modern economy. What will be that review's format and when will it be conducted, in light of the omissions from these plans?

In light of the GDP figures, what will the Government do in respect of the facilities it has enabled within the tax code? An example is the use of section 110 companies by aircraft leasing firms, which means they are tax-neutral. The Tánaiste knows that the GDP figures have been boosted primarily as a result of the aircraft leasing sector. Despite her claims that this creates so many jobs, the number of direct jobs provided is 700, despite the fact that these firms lease more than half of all aircraft throughout the world.This is what is happening here. It should not be about blaming the CSO, which is the referee in this. It is about whether the Government will ensure the assets taken onshore by these companies will be taxed appropriately so we get the benefit of them. This is something that has happened every single year. In 2014, our EU contribution went up by €16 million. In 2013 it was about €55 million and in 2012 it went up again. We have been a lone voice in this House raising this issue year on year. Given the CSO readjustment, it is time for the Government to take decisive action and close some of the loopholes that exist.

In my constituency, as my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, would know, we have a number of people who use the tagging system. That is where one goes to a shop, buys a tag and puts it onto the bag. That system is gone. We managed, as part of the agreement with the Government, to come to an arrangement to suspend charges on people with bins. A considerable number of people in this country have been left in limbo. They are now being charged to register plus pay-by-weight. They are the only people who now have to pay by weight. Will the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who sympathised with me on this issue, go back to the refuse company and tell it to give these people a break and treat them like everybody else?

In my capacity as Fianna Fáil equality spokesperson I am sponsoring it with my colleague, Deputy Margaret Murphy-O'Mahony, who is our party spokesperson on disability. This Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016 proposes that when an offence occurs and is aggravated by prejudice relating to colour, ethnic origin, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity of the person against whom the offence is committed and when it is stated in either an indictment or complaint or both that an offence is aggravated by prejudice then on conviction the court shall find that the offence is aggravated by prejudice relating to race, colour or ethnic origin. The court shall also record the conviction in a manner that demonstrates it is an offence aggravated by prejudice and will take this into account when determining the sentence. When the sentence in respect of the offence is different from that which the court would have imposed if the offence was not aggravated, the court will state the extent of and reasons for that difference. The effect of this Bill would be that the courts would have to consider an offender's prejudice or hatred towards these groups and sentence the offender accordingly. Ireland does not have specific hate crime laws and it is necessary that we should have. Such legislation will make it very clear that such prejudice and hatred will not be countenanced or tolerated. Furthermore, such a law would enable us to keep better track of such incidents. Similar legislation is in place in Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales: it is time we had it too. With my colleague, Deputy Murphy-O'Mahony, I look forward to taking this Bill further when we return after the recess. I commend the Bill to the House.

It is demand-led by a number of very specific groups of ill-health sufferers. We met with a society that represents people suffering with Dravet syndrome. For those who do not know what it is, the syndrome is a form of very severe epilepsy which generally manifests itself in children. Cannabis oil can help a great deal to prevent fitting and seizures. The second group that uses it quite frequently are those with multiple sclerosis. I know from living in Ballyfermot that many MS sufferers already obtain cannabis oil to give them relief; cannabis alleviates the nausea, muscle spasms and pain that go with multiple sclerosis. Those two groups are quite significant groups of people with bad health in society and should be considered. There is anecdotal if not scientific evidence to show it provides pain relief to people who suffer from various forms of cancer. We are trying to facilitate the use of cannabis and cannabis-related products for medicinal purposes but these would be ones that have already been experimented on and would clearly have to be prescribed by a medical practitioner or consultant. To do this, we are proposing to establish a cannabis regulation authority which would bear the costs that may be incurred by the State as a result rather than the State bearing the cost. Anybody who holds this cannabis-related product or cannabis for distribution through prescription would have to be licensed to do so. There would be restrictions on selling it, holding it and only people with scripts could obtain it. There are further issues in the Bill on labelling, testing, advertising and having due regard for the needs of users of this product and to promote awareness and an understanding more broadly of cannabis and its effects.

I assure Deputies, Deputy Wallace in particular, that I intend bringing legislation to the Dáil regarding clean injection facilities. This legislation will be ready for the autumn term. I understand the frustration behind Deputy Ó Caoláin's argument. On Committee Stage, Deputy Louise O'Reilly of Sinn Féin said that the Bill was only a small part of a jigsaw and I agree with her entirely. It is only the first, very small part and we will continue to build on it as we go and incorporate some of the issues raised. I thank Deputy Jack Chambers for his support and his response around suboxone. I will revert back to the Deputy on that issue in the near future. However, I will not accept the amendments Nos. 1 and 2.

We will also give them a second monkey, as it were, by telling them it is not a health issue, that we are not offering the services or even offering to give them back the services the previous Government slashed to bits, and that all we offer is the prospect of being arrested and possibly jailed or heavily fined for being addicted to prescription drugs which they should not possess. Deputy Wallace is right. If we wish to pursue this, the Bill must be amended to say that those carrying the drugs for personal use should not be subject to the criminalisation the Bill proposes.

I hope the points made are being properly noted. It goes without saying that the passage of this legislation will not change very much in the way the serious matter of synthetic cannabinoids is addressed. I make no apology for specifying them. It is very important that legislation such as this is not employed as a means of compounding the already difficult lives of those who have developed a dependency on drugs. We believe the focus has to be legislation that would address seriously the suppliers and dealers. We want to see that. I welcome that the Minister of State has indicated that legislation is being prepared to facilitate the introduction of the pilot injection centres. It is an important and very welcome proposal. I hope this calendar year will not pass without that legislation having been successfully advanced here and the project established. Amendment No. 2, in tandem with amendment No. 1, makes an important point and merits the support of the House. While I am recording my colleague's and party’s wish that this be supported and accepted, I have indicated that we will not oppose the passage of the Bill. I do, however, believe it is an inadequate response to a critical need and, not even tongue in cheek, I refer the Minister of State and her colleagues to the most recent legislation passed in the House of Commons at Westminster. That approach merits consideration.

Two of them were accepted and this is one of the amendments that was not accepted and which I have re-tabled for Report Stage. The amendment seeks that the powers that will be conferred on the Minister would not extend to any alterations of the Schedule or the loan agreement. I note the Minister has brought forward amendment No. 2, which has the effect that while the Minister would have the power to alter them, the Dáil would for the first time have the power to annul the changes to the loan facility agreement. For me, that is an acceptable compromise and on that basis I withdraw the amendment.

The terms in writing of any decision (other than a decision referred to in section 4(2)) to vary the terms of the Loan Facility Agreement shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after the decision is made and, if a resolution annulling the decision is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after its terms have been laid before it, the decision shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.”.As outlined by Deputy Doherty, amendment No. 2 inserts a new section 3 into the Bill which provides that any variance to the loan facility agreement shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as possible and that, if either House resolves to annul this decision within 21 days, it shall be annulled accordingly.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	153	I move amendment No. 3:In page 4, line 13, to delete “Minister” and substitute “Oireachtas, should Dáil Éireann be dissolved approval shall be made by a decision of the government and approval of Seanad Éireann”.The effect of the amendment means a vote would be required in the Oireachtas rather than simply a decision of the Minister for the money to be extended and the loan of €1.85 billion to be made. The Minister of State raised the point on the Committee Stage debate as to what would happen if the Dáil were dissolved. In our opinion, the amendment provides the best possible safeguards in that scenario, whereby it would have to be done by the Government acting collectively as opposed to the Minister. It would also involve the Seanad, as the Seanad could obviously be recalled and the parties would be represented in the Seanad, so it could also play a role. The broader point is that we are against the whole process of setting up this massive bank bailout fund and we will presumably be against the extension of the money in such a circumstance. We think there should be a democratic right of the Dáil to have a say in this. Events in Italy, even in the time since we discussed this on Committee Stage, demonstrate the point in terms of some of the fundamental weaknesses of the overall European approach to the banking crisis and the scale of the crisis that could be coming down the line. I have read that, in Italy, there is now a phrase, le sofferenze, which means "the suffering". It does not refer to the people but to the debts that simply cannot be paid. The amount of bad debt held by the banks in Italy is estimated at €360 billion. The idea that the State - the public purse - in Ireland and ordinary people would be on the hook for another significant round of bank bailouts is obviously something we are against. Therefore, we would seek to have a mechanism for a democratic vote on this before any money is extended. We understand that it is a loan, but nonetheless the point stands.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	154	Amendment No. 3 is similar to amendment No. 4, which I have tabled and which is a variation of the amendment I put forward on Committee Stage. Obviously, the change is in regard to the lengthy discussion in committee where the Minister of State raised the issue of a situation where there was an election and the House was not sitting. That is why the amendment now reflects that it should be the Oireachtas that sanctions or gives approval for such a drawdown of this loan, or the Minister as per Article 28.11.2° of the Constitution, which is the article that refers to Ministers continuing to hold office during an election, when the Dáil has been dissolved. I do not want to rehash the debate we had on Committee Stage except to say it is an important issue in that it should be for the Oireachtas to give the final sanction on all of these matters.I understand the logic behind it if the Government wanted pre-approval in the case of an eventuality which the Minister has said he does not envisage arising. There is a pre-approval process. However, the best democratic control over this process would be to refer back to the Oireachtas at all times, where possible. I cannot envisage a scenario where that would not be possible outside the point the Minister of State raised about the Dáil being dissolved and candidates being the middle of an election, a point now dealt with in the amendment. We need to think of what would have to happen to trigger this section or for it to be invoked. A bank would have to fail or be on the brink of failing for the bail-in mechanism to be triggered. It would then have to go through the waterfall and then we would see the disbursement from the State to the fund of a certain amount of money. The Minister of State has made the point time and again that this would have to happen swiftly, within four days. I cannot see any scenario where the Oireachtas would not be recalled where a bank failed in this country, especially if it required the State to put its hand in its pockets to provide money for the ailing bank. There is no such scenario whatsoever. Given the history and what we have gone through in the past ten years, I do not care where we are, whether we are on holidays or whether it is before New Year's Eve, there is no scenario in my mind whereby Members would sit at home and decide that it is okay and does not really require them to act. Regardless of whether it was to give authority or permission for this provision to be invoked, we would be in the House anyway discussing the matter. Otherwise, we would not be doing our job as legislators. We would not have the best interests of the country at heart if we did not recall the Dáil and Seanad to deal with these matters. I took on board the points of the Minister of State in respect of the elections, but in respect of all others scenarios I do not think it would be sensible or a factor to be unable to recall the Dáil within four days of a bank needing the support of the taxpayer again. If we could not do that, then we are doing something altogether wrong. The Minister of State should accept amendment No. 4 for the reasons I have outlined. It does not alter the substance of the Bill. It simply reinforces the democratic control, that is to say, it would rest within the Parliament and the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. While we are giving pre-approval, it is important that final approval would be given by the same Members with the full information and knowledge of the particular issue at a given point in time.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	155	I thank the Deputies for their amendments. The issue was debated at length on Committee Stage. Deputy Doherty should note that it is not a question of the risk that we might be sitting at home unwilling or unable to come to the Chamber to make such a decision. It is about giving a higher degree of certainty now that in such an eventuality the funds could be released in a timely fashion, with the Minister being the final check. As I made clear on Committee Stage, the Minister cannot accept the amendment. During a resolution event, it would be of paramount importance that funding be made available quickly. The loan facility agreement states that 50% of the moneys must be available within four days and that in exceptional circumstances all the money must be made available in that timeframe. A rapid response to such a request is crucial to prevent contagion in the rest of the banking system, since the whole resolution process could occur over the course of a weekend. Therefore, it could significantly delay a resolution where it was necessary that the Dáil or Seanad be reconvened to make such an approval. On Committee Stage we discussed the problems in the event that the Dáil has been dissolved for an election. The Deputy aimed to deal with this issue in amendment No. 3. However, we could still have a situation where both the Seanad and the Dáil have been dissolved, in which case it would be impossible to recall either. Therefore, this amendment could result in delays in providing a loan to the Single Resolution Fund due to having to recall the Dáil and the Seanad or waiting for elections to be completed. This adds more uncertainly to the market which may lead to ordinary depositors and small businesses being negatively impacted in such an event. Although we discussed it on Committee Stage, it is worth recalling that at least 8% of eligible liabilities would have to have been written down, the national compartment of the Single Resolution Fund exhausted and the mutualised parts of the other member states' funds exhausted before this loan facility agreement could be called upon by the single resolution board. The Minister would then be in place to be the final check. Furthermore, the use of the credit line is only a temporary arrangement while waiting for the fund to grow in size by contributions from the European banking sector and the putting in place of a common backstop by 2024. The amount the Minister for Finance can approve is capped at €1.815 billion. Any increase in this amount would have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Moreover, amendment No. 2, proposed by the Government, ensures that any changes to the loan facility agreement can be annulled by either House. That amendment has been accepted by the Minister. Thus, the Minister believes there are sufficient protections and oversights in place in the Bill without adding more. More conditionality could result in adding greater uncertainty in a difficult situation and potentially impacting retail depositors and small businesses negatively. For similar reasons, amendment No. 4 from Deputy Doherty cannot be accepted by the Minister. I wish to refer to amendment No. 5 briefly because it is grouped as well. On Committee Stage I accepted an amendment from Deputy Doherty which provides that the Houses of the Oireachtas must approve any variance of the sum contained in the loan facility agreement. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel recommended that some technical drafting amendments be made to the text which do not materially affect the purpose of the section. The details of amendment No. 6 were previously discussed and agreed. I trust amendment No. 2 facilitates the aim of Deputy Murphy's amendment on the issue pertaining to the changes in the loan facility agreement.

The same phrase was used on Committee Stage, that is, the reference to the need for a high degree of certainty now. We thrashed out the point but there is still no certainty because it is still a decision of a Minister. Who knows what government could be in place at that stage? It is not possible to give 100% certainty to our so-called European partners that the money would be paid in. It depends on what government we had in place. There could be a left government or Minister in place who does not agree to it. What the phrase means is that democracy or coming back to the Dáil adds a degree of uncertainty. It is problematic if this is the Government approach. It is problematic if we have to be able to tell our European partners that the money will go, they need not worry and the banks will have it because the Government does not have to go back to the Dáil. The Minister of State is not now making the case that the Dáil cannot come back and we could not have it done in time. If the issue is more a question of whether the Dáil would agree to it, then it is somewhat problematic democratically.

There is a concern about both the Dáil and the Seanad not sitting because an election has been called and, therefore, it is not possible to recall either. That point still maintains.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	158	That is fine, but that point was raised and taken on board by both Deputy Doherty and myself in different ways with regard to how the amendments are written. That point has been taken on board. If it is not a question of the Dáil sitting but a danger that the Dáil might vote against it, then that is democratically problematic. Will the Minister of State outline the situation when the two Houses are dissolved? Article 18.9 of the Constitution details how Senators hold their seats until the day of the next Seanad election. Therefore, a circumstance where the two are dissolved does not seem to be possible. That could be a reference point.

In a way, amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are similar but different at the same time. The Minister of State made a point and I imagine he will respond to Deputy Murphy on the question he posed in terms of the Dáil and Seanad being dissolved at the same time. The Minister of State has said it is not an issue in terms of the Oireachtas changing its mind. He said it is not a question of certainty about that, but it would be an issue if the two Houses were dissolved at the same time. However, my amendment does not deal with that scenario. Deputy Murphy's amendment does reference approval by Seanad Éireann, but my amendment does not. My amendment basically refers to the approval of the Oireachtas or the Minister, in the case where Article 28.11.2o of the Constitution applies, in other words, when the Houses are dissolved. The main issue the Minister of State has articulated does not stand and the Minister of State should accept amendment No. 4. I will comment on the other amendments in this group. Amendment No. 5 is a re-phrasing of my amendment that was accepted on Committee Stage. That is acceptable to me and I am pleased the Minister of State accepted it at the time.Amendment No. 6 is not required given the safeguards we have put in place through the amendments I have already tabled that have been passed. The power to ensure any amendment to the loan is annulled and to prevent the fund being increased now rests with the Houses of the Oireachtas.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	160	In response to Deputy Paul Murphy, 100% certainty is not possible, but in the unlikely scenario that the funds need to be approved within four days because of the risk to depositors and small businesses, there is a greater degree of certainty in having the Minister as the final check. This is the approval by the Oireachtas. This is the Single Resolution Fund, which we have signed up to. This is a temporary loan facility until 2024, when the fund comes into effect and a backstop will be in place. Within that period, the waterfall of resolution will come into effect. The Minister will be the final check for 50% of the funds. That amount could not be increased without legislation from this Dáil and changes to the terms of the agreement could be annulled by the Dáil within 21 days. Neither the Dáil nor the Seanad might be sitting. Article 16.4.2° of the Constitution calls for the Dáil to sit within 60 days of the calling of an election and the Seanad election must take place within 90 days of the dissolution of the Dáil, so it is possible that an overlap would exist. Therefore, the Government can accept neither amendment No. 3 nor amendment No. 4. I have already spoken on amendments Nos. 5 and 6.

We can debate it further. It may be an obscure question. I will use my time to speak more about amendment No. 6. Amendment No. 2 deals with it in part. It is a preferable situation. We dealt with this on Committee Stage and it is clear that amendments can be made to the loan facility agreement. In theory, substantial amendments could be made if all member states were to agree to them. There is a basic democratic need for a vote in the Oireachtas before such a change would take place. It would be preferable for a vote to take place beforehand rather than the retrospective check provided for by amendment No. 2.

Since its establishment in 2014, Tusla has been engaged in an extensive programme of reform which includes the ongoing development of an ICT system to support social workers in their work. Currently, each of the 17 Tusla administrative areas has its own referral system. I want Tusla to move to the planned national child care information system, which will provide centralised referrals and ensure every social work department has a user-friendly technology solution to record the case history of every child who is the subject of a child protection or welfare concern.This will apply from the point of initial referral to case closure. The system will also have the capacity to facilitate the integration and sharing of information on child protection and welfare cases between Tusla areas. The capital provision available to Tusla in 2016 includes full provision for the 2016 costs associated with the continued roll-out of the national child care information system. The total expenditure on it is estimated at €1.8 million. The system has already been piloted in Tusla’s mid-west region - north Tipperary, Clare and Limerick. Tusla intends to roll out the system nationally over the coming year and I will continue to support it as a key priority.

Hearing the amount from the Minister, I find it disappointing. With the current capital funding, is the Minister making a commitment to see ICT rolled out in its entirety by the end of the year or early next year?

I am concerned about some of the key issues that were identified. There were some improvements demonstrated in that review but particularly in ICT systems which is the subject of the Deputy's question. An ICT system has been developed in that particular area to track all cases within child protection and welfare services. Necessary ICT equipment has been provided to all the staff but these are temporary measures until the roll-out of the national child care information system. On the Deputy's question on resources and money spent, I agree this is a critical issue. The money is there and Tusla is going to spend it: by next August all 17 areas will have the initial roll out. There still needs to be some tweaking done but I am told it will be fully operational by 2018.

The primary function of the commission is to provide a factual account of what happened to vulnerable women and children in these institutions during the period 1922-98, a 76-year period. The commission will thoroughly examine the experience of residents in 14 named mother and baby homes and a representative sample of county homes. The commission is required to address specific concerns relating to the care, welfare, entry arrangements and exit pathways for the women and children who were residents of these institutions. It is my hope that this commission will help us all come to a better understanding of how society treated mothers and children in these homes and how attitudes, policy and legislation changed over the period.  There have been various calls to extend the commission's terms of reference. However, it is important to note that the commission itself can, under its existing terms of reference, bring any matters to the Government's attention where it believes this to be warranted in the public interest. As an independent statutory inquiry, the commission has scope to examine a broad range of public concerns, to decide on their importance to the commission's work and to make recommendations on them as it sees fit. I recently met with the chair of the commission to discuss progress on the work to date and I will report back to Government next week. Out of courtesy to former residents, I want to inform representative groups of developments before making any public announcement. I hope to do this next week after I have reported to my Government colleagues.

Mar is eol don Aire, tá cuid mhaith de na daoine a bhí sna háiteanna seo fágtha ar an imeall, gan ghuth agus gan ghlór, le tamall maith anuas. Many of the victims of these institutions have passed away since the commencement of the commission. The commission must go as far as including all those deemed to be affected. It is important to deal with those victims on an age priority basis where possible to ensure those who deserve justice see it in their lifetime. I refer to the brief the Minister got on her first day which notes the date as 17 February 2018. Is that date still considered to be an appropriate time? The Minister notes the 27 homes that are not included and refers to a representative sample but it is difficult to say what is representative or not in the context of time and age. While the commission can, in the public interest, draw attention to issues at this moment in time, people from additional homes are not in a position to give testimony. That is a difficulty.

As I have already indicated, the commission is a statutory independent inquiry. We discussed a number of things and I will bring that report to Government next week. In terms of the wide range of issues that were discussed, we reviewed the terms of reference. It is up to the commission to identify changes to the terms of reference; whether it is to extend its powers or the scope of its investigation. It is up to the commission and not up to me to second guess that. The other thing to note on some of the issues the Deputy identified is that I will be in contact with representative groups. The commission has until February 2018 to report. I am satisfied from my meetings that it is on target for that date.

Many of the stories they told me were absolutely harrowing. They have a number of concerns particularly about the centres or locations that are not included. Many of them are discommoded that they do not have access to their personal testimony subsequent to giving it. This is something that is very traumatic and difficult for them to do. The fact they do not subsequently have access to those records is something that upsets them. The Minister said the commission has the ability to make up its own mind. Can the Minister clarify that it is in a position to hear testimony from victims of other centres? At this moment in time it would require it to go back to the Government to seek a review of the terms of reference. I say it is within the Minister's gift to widen the terms of reference if she believes it is appropriate and important that the victims of those additional centres are heard.

The vast majority of such complaints relate to sexual abuse. The Garda is always informed of these complaints and its role is to carry out a criminal investigation into the complaint. Tusla's job is to try to establish if the alleged abuser poses a risk to children currently, and if so, to put in place protective measures in relation to identified children. The sharing of information by Tusla with third parties must follow fair procedure with the exception of cases where there is an immediate risk to children. In terms of overall strategy, retrospective allegations are dealt with by Tusla under its national policy for handling allegations of abuse. The strategy, named Policy and Procedures for Responding to Allegations of Child Abuse and Neglect, has been in place since 2014. I am aware of the complexities of such cases and raised this issue at my meeting with the chair of the board and the CEO of Tusla in June. I emphasised the importance of dealing with cases as soon as possible, while recognising the practical difficulties that can often arise in relation to alleged events of many years ago. I have asked to meet senior officials in Tusla next week to be updated on the steps they are taking to deal nationally with these cases, and on cases currently before the courts which may impact on Tusla's practice in these matters. Tusla's policy is informed by both child protection principles and fair procedures and sets out the specific steps for Tusla social workers to take in carrying out a risk assessment of an adult where an allegation of abuse has been made against him or her. As Tusla is not a policing body, it does not have such powers of investigation. It cannot compel co-operation with individuals against whom an allegation has been made, or the person making the allegation, and must proceed on the basis of fair procedure and due process. As such, Tusla works closely with the Garda in such cases.

Contrary to what the Minister stated, it is my understanding that there is no policy or strategy from Tusla on how to deal with adult disclosure cases or so-called section 3 referrals. While, as the Minister mentioned, a September 2014 draft policy exists, this policy is not published and it is my belief it is legally inaccurate. Specifically, at section 14.4, where it proposes that adult survivors should be informed that they may be liable to prosecution where they do not engage with an investigation, the current guidelines on dealing with adult disclosure cases by social workers' offices are not fit for purpose. The guidelines do not take cognisance of the effects of abuse on adults coming forward to disclose. HIQA's assessment of the north Lee and south-west services in 2015 stated that the system in place to manage concerns of a retrospective nature needed significant improvement while a recent HIQA assessment of Dublin south-east and Wicklow found a high number of retrospective referrals remained unassessed, with potential risk to children not yet determined.

It certainly should be published. I want Deputy Rabbitte to know that I do have concerns in relation to dealing with adult disclosure cases or retrospective cases. I would like to see timelines on when they have been allocated. Those are some questions that I will be raising with Tusla representatives when I meet them next week. As Deputy Rabbitte will be aware, Tusla conducted a national review of cases awaiting allocation which included information on a number of retrospective cases. The review showed, at February 2015, that of the 8,865 cases awaiting allocation nationally, there were 1,204 cases of retrospective abuse disclosure. The review indicated that of these 1,204 retrospective case, 27% were a high priority, 46% medium priority and 20% low priority.

However, as is well known, often survivors of the most extreme child sexual abuse do not summon up the courage to come forward until they are in adulthood. The research has well-established that a large proportion of people who experience child sexual abuse delay disclosure. What is more, the cases should not be described as retrospective as many adult disclosures could involve a risk of child abuse. I welcome that the Minister will talk with Tusla next week. I ask that the draft policy would become a working tool document. We need to address the matter right across the country because in the HIQA report from the midlands it is highlighted as a significant risk. In fact, although we are addressing it, we are not doing so fast enough because an adult making a disclosure was once a child and the abuser is more than likely still at large, and we need to protect other children. That is where I am coming from.

I take Deputy Rabbitte's point. I hear her saying particularly that it is one matter to ensure the retrospective cases and adult disclosure are managed properly and efficiently, but I also take from what she is identifying there that to come to disclose, even when one is an adult, can be a significant and difficult matter and it may be the case that such adults could require more support in doing that. That is a helpful suggestion and I will raise that with Tusla as well.

I welcome the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness which we published on Tuesday. It is the Government's ambition that within a year's time we will not be reliant on emergency accommodation to house children and families. The plan also seeks to ensure that families and children are supported as much as possible while they are in the emergency accommodation. To this end, the action plan includes additional measures to assist families in emergency homeless accommodation to mitigate the challenges they face. Additional dedicated child support workers will be appointed in an initiative by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. My Department will ask the city and county child care committees to liaise with homeless families and assist them in accessing early years services. A new specific scheme will also be designed for the purpose from existing resources. Home-school-community liaison and school completion staff will assist children and families experiencing homelessness to maintain regular school attendance and prioritise them within the school completion programme. A pilot project will be introduced to support the family functioning of homeless families currently in emergency accommodation. The nutritional needs of families and children will be reviewed and solutions proposed. Tusla will provide additional emergency refuge accommodation spaces so that victims of domestic violence forced to leave the family home do not find themselves homeless. A new facility with accommodation for pregnant women who are homeless will be provided by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, with my Department and Tusla supporting the service.I will work closely with my colleagues in the Government and all relevant agencies to ensure we address this issue as a matter of importance.

The psychological damage that these children are subjected to is predictable and avoidable. Not being able to have a normal life, which we would all have taken for granted growing up, is very hard to imagine. It is about not having a safe place or address to call their own, in which children can develop and grow, anchoring them in the community. It is about not having a place they can share with their friends and truly be themselves. It is about not being able to sit at a family table and enjoy a home-cooked meal. These are the psychologically damaging deficiencies that these children are subjected to. Will the Minister consider having child homelessness as her number one priority for children under her care?

The actions I identified will be helpful and I hope they will enable in a very significant way the children in homeless and emergency accommodation to find ways to move towards a sense of normality, in spite of the fact they are homeless or in emergency accommodation. It is a significant part not only of our plan but of our movement towards taking away any sense of homelessness for children. That is the part of the plan within my brief. Outside the brief there are a huge number of actions within a number of other settings of the plan to help reduce the child homelessness spoken of by the Deputy.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	199	There will be 47,000 new social houses provided under the housing action plan. By providing 2% of those, 1,000 families with children in homelessness could be taken out of that condition. It is quite unbelievable that in Ireland in 2016, the number of homeless children is increasing month after month, now exceeding 2,200. Homelessness is a deeply unhealthy state, particularly for children, and it is completely unacceptable in a modern society that this should be the case. Child homelessness is a social and political failure. This Government's response to child homelessness should be the issue on which this Government stands or dies, not water or bin charges, which pale into insignificance when compared with not having a home at all. I request that the Minister devote her time and energy to eliminating child homelessness before Christmas.

I thought it critical to identify a number of short-term measures to ensure homeless children do not experience lasting damage. Having listed some of those key actions that I will be driving to implement, I expect the Deputy to agree that they may help to provide a more normal or better experience while they are in that position. As a member of the Government sitting around the Cabinet table, working with all my colleagues to ensure the plan is implementable, regardless of whether it is inside or outside the brief, our ambition is to have no children dependent on emergency accommodation within a year. It is a high ambition. If we can implement these actions with the support of all our colleagues and others outside the Chamber, we will take care of the problem of child homelessness.

Will she outline the steps she is taking to address the deficiencies in the information technology system that is supposed to support the work of the social work service?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	202	I strongly support Tusla's Survival to Sustainability plan. This is a three-year plan that includes provision of extra staffing to meet critical service concerns. This includes addressing children with no allocated social worker. The plan involves increasing overall staffing levels in Tusla by 323 whole-time equivalents, with an investment of €19.4 million over the period 2016 to 2018. We allocated €6.1 million for this purpose in 2016 for unallocated cases. This will fund a net increase of 168 social workers by the end of this year. It will be important to recruit other grades also to ensure an efficient service with the right mix of staffing, including family support staff and administrative support. At the time of devising the plan in September 2015, this meant Tusla needed to recruit more than 500 social workers by end 2016 when account is taken of the fact that it was carrying approximately 200 vacancies and that an average of 12 people leave each month due to retirement and other reasons. Tusla has been proactive in its efforts to meet its recruitment targets in a competitive environment. At the end of May 2016, there were 1,512 social work whole-time equivalents in place. Approximately 100 of these relate to the strategic decision by Tusla to convert temporary agency posts into three-year fixed-term contracts to improve stability and workforce allocation. Therefore, Tusla still needs to recruit 300 social workers between now and the end of 2016 to reach its very challenging target. In this regard, Tusla ran a recent graduate campaign to attract new graduates and this resulted in over 300 graduate applications. Interviews are currently under way. I have spoken about the need for Tusla to invest in information and communications technology, ICT, infrastructure in order to support staff in their work. I am committed to the roll-out of a national child care information system.

Budget allocations and recruitment campaigns, etc., are very welcome but there is a fundamental problem within our social work services, as we find it very difficult to recruit and retain staff. In the recent past, vast amounts of money have been spent in international recruitment, which is unsatisfactory, by and large. There are many very young social workers coming here from abroad and there may well be cultural differences in that regard. These people are on their world tour, more or less. We cannot really staff an importance service like social work on that basis. Does the Minister accept that there is a problem in the lack of support being provided to young graduate social workers coming into the service?

At the same time, social work recruitment from existing panels continues. The graduate campaign has been very well received and planning for a 2017 campaign has commenced and will include colleges in Ireland and the UK. Tusla intends to work with third level colleges with a view to increasing the number of social work places from the current 200 to 250 places in the Republic of Ireland. This is a medium-term strategy, as it would take a number of years for the impact to be felt. Retention was also mentioned by the Deputy. Tusla is developing an employee assistance programme in order to support the management of caseloads. It is also ensuring that staff have appropriate ICT equipment and infrastructure to support the work they are doing.

The key problems for children in care, in particular, include the high turnover of social workers. Further, there are 464 children currently in care who do not have an allocated social worker. Will the Minister give her urgent attention to a number of measures to recruit and retain staff? One of those is to restructure the social work teams in place and to restore the senior practitioner role which was taken away. Another measure is to provide investment. Rather than international recruitment, which is so expensive, will she invest in some incentives for social workers to stay, such as paid extended leave? The other area is ensuring there is a proper career structure so that we can hold onto social workers and they are not going off abroad.

The level of funding provided in 2016 demonstrates the Government's support for child and family services around the country. There are currently 108 communities supported through the family resource centre programme funded by Tusla. In 2016, Tusla is providing €13.5 million in core funding to the family resource centre programme, an increase of €422,000 over 2015. In addition, Tusla is providing funding of €595,000 to 75 family resource centres for low-cost counselling services under the agency's counselling grants scheme. This is an increase of €45,000 over the 2015 provision. Family resource centres are also supported by two regional support agencies, which are funded by Tusla. These support agencies play a key role in promoting good practice and providing technical support, advice and training to family resource centres. Tusla also provides funding to the Family Resource Centre National Forum, which is a support network working with all the family resource centres throughout Ireland and providing networking and training opportunities, information and support. Tusla intends to build on the strengths of the family resource centre programme in the years ahead in meeting its mandate for community-based early intervention and family support. I strongly agree with this approach.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	225	I heard all that the Minister has said but, every year over the past number of years, and particularly since 2011, there has been a budgetary cut of 5% and this has had an impact on family resource centres. Last year a family resource centre in Duagh in County Kerry got €108 from Tusla. I could not believe it when I read it. That is one of those in the statistics; that is one of our 108 family resource centres. It received €108. It does not have a family resource worker, although it is looking for one. It is running a service. This does not form part of the question, but I am trying to give the Minister a broad idea of the spectrum of requirements of rural areas. That is an example of rural isolation: a family resource centre receives €108 from Tusla. I do not think it is in this day and age quite adequate by any manner or means.

I have identified some of the ways in which Tusla has increased resources for the family resource centres. I visited a couple of them, including one in Roscommon, in the past few weeks of my Ministry and it is true to say that we are investing in those that have a focus on child care, including the provision of early childhood care and education. This supports the overall viability of family resource centres and their operations. The additional 2016 Tusla funding provided a pilot family resource project in Bandon, County Cork, and extra funding to family resource centres throughout the country, which is being disbursed on the basis of financial need.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	227	I agree with the Minister, which is why I found this very hard. My understanding is that Tusla was focusing on early intervention. Believe it or not, the particular resource centre I spoke about has 97 children in it and receives €108. However, I do not wish to dwell on that. Have we a vision in Tusla to bring in a counsellor to each of the family resource centres so that there is a counsellor on-site or based in the community? That would assist with early intervention and family support. The dots would be joined up in a community. They would be part of and working in the community and they would be instantly accessible. Is there a plan for the Ministry to develop that in family resource centres?

I hear the Deputy's suggestion on the provision of a counsellor in each one. I will raise and discuss that matter with Tusla over the next while to see if it is an efficient way to utilise resources in light of the other projects and programmes it is implementing.

It is fairly straightforward and the result of a serious funding issue for Women's Aid which has threatened its national helpline for women who are at serious risk and need urgent help and attention. In many cases, these women are under threat in their homes. The Taoiseach gave a commitment five weeks ago on 15 June to seek funding for it. Will the Minister update the House on the matter?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	233	I am aware of the Taoiseach's comments in the House on 15 June during his interaction with Deputy Howlin on this important issue. Tusla has allocated funding of €20.6 million in 2016 to support front-line services dealing with domestic, sexual and gender-based abuse. This includes additional funding of €200,000, requested by Tusla, to implement the provisions of the Istanbul Convention, which deals with violence against women and domestic violence. There is an obligation under the Istanbul Convention to have a dedicated free 24-hour national helpline in place for contact regarding domestic violence.  I recognise the valuable work undertaken by Women’s Aid in the provision of national helpline services for domestic violence and the work of other specialist domestic violence service provider organisations that operate helpline contact.Tusla is currently working with these organisations, as part of a commissioning process, to support the availability of a co-ordinated, accessible national helpline service that can provide both initial contact points and facilitate integrated responses to victims of domestic violence. Tusla intends to introduce the commissioning approach for the domestic violence helpline from 2017 and will be engaging formally with providers, including Women's Aid, around this process in the coming months. The issue of costs as well as service specifications is being considered as part of the helpline commissioning process. It will be developed in the fourth quarter. I was delighted to note that the Women's Aid helpline became a 24-7 service in recent months and I look forward to launching it formally in September. It certainly has my support.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	234	As the Minister said, there is a duty under the Istanbul Convention to have that kind of service available. More important, though, there are a number of women around the country who need the service as a lifeline. If they are in a situation of immediate danger, they need to be able to call somebody on a 24-7 basis. I worry when I hear about commissioning processes. What is the timeline for the commissioning process? What we really need is to ensure the service is maintained. The Minister said she would be launching the helpline in September but I gather that Women's Aid will have to tender along with others so will she clarify that? Above all, will she give us an assurance that there will not be any gap in the service because of a problem with funding or the length of time the commissioning process might take?

I fully support the Women's Aid helpline but there are other national helplines and Tusla is developing the commissioning of a service which could mean a number of helplines. It will take a look at the best way to provide a proper service and ensure that, as well as value for money, we get quality too because this is integral to such a project. It is consulting with Women's Aid as well as others who provide helplines and with this extensive review we will find a better way to provide the service for the women who need it.

The Minister said there were a number of helplines around the country but what people need is immediate access and to know that, when they are in a particular situation, they can ring a number and get somebody at the other end of the line. Will the Minister ensure there is no confusion with different helplines?

People need access and it needs to be clear. We need to have enough capacity and it needs to be done right.

I envisage that my Department will tender for independent expertise to conduct the review in the autumn with a view to commencing it later this year. The report will need to be finalised by the second quarter of next year and will be published. This commitment will be progressed in the context of broader policy work on the design and development of a new single affordable child care scheme. Work is well under way on the development of policy proposals for the new affordable child care scheme which will greatly simplify the four current child care programmes for low-income families. These are administratively complex and not easy to understand. As part of the review, my officials are examining previous published research and analysis on the cost of child care provision. They are also assessing available data sources and scoping the precise requirements for the independent review.  I believe that the work we are now undertaking presents a real opportunity to develop much improved supports for affordable, high-quality child care. The review of costs will examine average costs, variations between regions and the reason for the differences. It will also deal with the links between costs and quality of child care supports.  I am committed to evidence-based future investment in high-quality child care programmes, including the existing ECCE scheme and the planned single affordable child care scheme. I look forward to working with all interested parties as this work proceeds.

A significant amount of funding was put into the second ECCE year but the process needs to continue and we will be behind the Minister in fighting for funding for this when budget time comes. I also ask that the commitments be to direct subsidy rather than tax breaks, of which the Minister has said she is in favour. Direct subsidy is a much more proactive way to do it. Is the Minister aware that some ECCE providers are concerned that they will have affordability difficulties with the contract they have been asked to sign? Correspondence from providers of child care services suggests that the expansion of the ECCE scheme will not be cost-effective for them, because of the fact that it does not involve all-year funding.

The challenges are to invest to ensure they are properly paid and so that we can expand as we need to. We also need to invest to provide the resources for ongoing learning. There are different aspects to the matter of looking for additional moneys.

The Minister said lately that funding for domestic violence services is being protected to the same level as that in 2015. I assure her that will not be nearly good enough for a deprived county like Wexford where the problem is particularly acute. Will the Government see fit to examine more closely the needs in such areas with a view to increasing funding?

At all times my priority and that of Tusla is to ensure that the needs of women and children fleeing domestic violence are being met in the best way possible. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, allocates funding for a network of 60 organisations that provide services to victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in Ireland. This includes 20 services that provide emergency refuge accommodation to women and children and 24 community-based domestic violence services. In 2016, funding for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services is €20.6 million, including €12 million for emergency refuge and support services, €4.6 million for other community-based domestic violence support services and €4 million to support rape crisis centres. Tusla is engaging with service provider organisations and other stakeholders to identify and prioritise future needs, including the provision of additional emergency accommodation spaces. Since the beginning of 2016, eight additional units of emergency accommodation have become operational and are supported by Tusla. Domestic violence support services are provided through integrated community-based responses, with emergency refuge accommodation as one component of service delivery. Tusla’s primary focus is on achieving the optimum use of emergency shelter accommodation and focusing on prevention and effective community-based services to avoid in so far as possible the need for use of refuges by vulnerable women and families. We all recognise that there are challenges to be addressed in ensuring that there is appropriate and safe crisis accommodation available to all women and children who require immediate shelter because of violent family relationships. I am committed to continuing our support for these vital services.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	248	There is one women's refuge centre in Wexford with four family bedrooms serving the entire county. In 2014, it turned away 338 women and 259 children. The figures for 2015 are not yet collated but we are told they are as bad if not worse than those for 2014. Recently, the women's refuge centre in Wexford submitted, for the second time, a comprehensive funding application through the capital assistance scheme to buy a property that would be converted into 12 self-contained rooms which would allow it operate its emergency accommodation in line with international best practice. The second application was submitted a year ago along with plans, full costing and all the relevant documentation, but it has disappeared. The centre has been on to its local government representatives, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and other Departments but it seems it is being ignored by central government. It is finding it impossible to get feedback even about the status of its application. I do not know if the Minister knows anything about this but I appeal to her to address that. We can only imagine where the 338 women who were turned away by the centre went that night. The State must take a serious look at this area.

We have the highest suicide rate in the country and the third highest rate of teenage pregnancy. We probably have a few more problems than most counties, and I do not deny that there are problems throughout the country. The housing crisis has a direct impact in this area also. It is mainly women and children who end up homeless from a combination of domestic violence and the housing crisis. Recently, we had the launch of the plan to deal with the challenge that is our housing crisis. Regardless of what one thinks of its merits, it is a start. It will not have a serious impact for at least two years but organisations like the Wexford Women's Refuge centre need help now. Too many people will fall through the cracks in the next two years if the problem is not addressed in an active fashion.

The action plan was very important to me and I was keen to ensure that within the context of the action plan we did something about the fact that some of the people who are moving into homelessness are fleeing their homes because of domestic violence. I have identified an action to provide additional emergency refuge accommodation places for victims of domestic violence and to provide a policy and guidance to housing authorities on the role they can play to assist victims of domestic violence in securing new independent tenancies. Additional emergency accommodation places will be provided in the context of that plan.

This issue seems to have fallen off the Government's agenda but it is one of the most serious issues for young families. We have the highest child care costs in the European Union. It is a second mortgage for many families. A crèche place in Dublin, for example, can cost €998 a month compared with €280 in Finland, Norway, France, Spain, Belgium and Germany. The reason for this problem is the lack of investment.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	253	Reducing the cost of child care is a key priority for me and for the Government. We have a number of commitments in the programme for Government relating to enabling access to high-quality and affordable child care, including subvention of child care for nine to 36 month old children. I am determined to deliver on these commitments. From September 2016, the extension of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme will make free preschool available for 15 hours per week, 38 weeks per annum, to all children from the time they turn three until they go to school. Children can enter at three points in the year: September, January and April. On average, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from the current provision of 38 weeks. Access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE can reduce the cost of child care by €4,000 per child. The current ECCE programme is accommodating 67,000 children, and this figure will increase to 127,000 next year. We have also provided an extra €16 million in 2016 to create an additional 3,200 full-time equivalent community child care subvention, CCS, child care places, or approximately 8,000 places based on average uptake. My Department also extended the terms of this programme in March so that it could be provided by private child care providers across the country as well as community and not-for-profit providers. This was to ensure that eligible families, regardless of where they live, can access this important child care subvention. The full rate of CCS will reduce child care costs by €95 per week and is available to parents in receipt of social welfare payments including the one-parent family payment or family income supplement.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	254	As with the previous Government, every time the issue of child care costs is raised the Government trots out the subject of the free preschool year. That scheme benefits parents who have children from the ages of three to five. Unfortunately it does not benefit anybody else. Children need care for more than 61 weeks of their childhood. The scheme offers to cover three hours' child care per day, so if a parent is working, he or she must still pay for the remainder of the day's care. There is a reason child care costs in Ireland are so high. It is because the State spends only one fifth of the OECD recommendation of 1% of GDP on child care. Ireland spends 0.2% of GDP. Only the UK is worse for child care costs than Ireland - obviously we have learned from them - and even the United States has cheaper child care costs. Ireland is the worst in Europe for child care costs. An Irish family with young children pays an average of 34% of its household income on child care. In Europe it is less than 17%. When one considers the cost of rent and mortgages right now, there are people who are absolutely crippled in paying for huge rent and child care. This is unsustainable.

I identified those statistics and numbers again because that investment is reducing the costs of child care. Clearly that is not enough and I absolutely agree with the Deputy on that point. I agree that the scheme works for families with children from the ages of three to five and who are entering school age, but they are making the savings at that stage of their child's life. For those families who are on low incomes, the subvention allows them to save money on the costs of child care. That is what is happening. In addition to that measure, there is the after-school child care programme which provides care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks. Eligibility is determined by the Department of Social Protection. The after-school programme provides €40 per week towards an after-school place or €80 per week in situations where the child care service provides a pick-up service from the schools. These are the other ways in which the provision of child care services does save families money. I accept that it is not enough.

After that provision is made, families still have to pay huge amounts in child care costs. Ironically, the Government spends approximately €260 million per year on child care. This is about the same amount that Ireland will be paying to the EU for our leprechaun economic statistics. When one considers the figure in that context, it is very little money. There is a huge amount of untapped and untaxed wealth and resources in the State that could be used to subsidise child care. For example, if there were a progressive tax system, billions of euro could be raised to invest in child care. The richest 300 people in Ireland hold a combined wealth of €84 billion. This is an area that could be taxed. The corporation tax rate could be reviewed which would allow for €2 billion extra fiscal space in the economy this year. Those are the kinds of measures that are required. It makes a huge difference to children if they receive quality child care rather than what is available at the moment dependent upon parents' resources.

I would be very interested in taking a further look at them with her. We are both agreed on the need to invest more. How to do that is a complicated process of identifying the best way to deliver access to quality and affordable child care for every child but especially for children from birth to six years of age and for a diversity of families. While it is important to reduce the costs of child care, it is also important to ensure that people who work in the sector receive a living wage. We must also ensure the scale and coverage of delivery of child care. It is true that more money needs to be provided. I have acknowledged this in my reply with regard to the children who are not yet publicly subsidised, that is, children under three years of age.

The transfer of files, which we were told would take between one year and 18 months, has actually taken three years. For the record, will the Minister clarify why this has taken so long?

I have been advised by Tusla that the records of Saint Patrick’s Guild Adoption Society transferred to Tusla on 25 May 2016. The records transferred include details of adoption and fostering arrangements of children from 1910 onwards. Tusla received in excess of 13,000 records from Saint Patrick’s Guild, which Tusla has advised are well maintained and in good physical condition. Tusla has established a dedicated team which is reviewing and cataloguing the files so that Tusla can provide an information and tracing service for anyone whose information was held by Saint Patrick’s Guild. Tusla does not propose to undertake a full audit of these files at this time, but the agency will respond to requests from adopted persons who are seeking information. It is important that birth parents, adopted persons and relatives who are seeking either information on or contact with persons from whom they were separated as a result of the adoption, or both, are provided with a service as soon as possible. Saint Patrick’s Guild was established in 1910 by the Sisters of Charity and is, historically, one of the largest agencies in the country involved in the facilitation of the placement of children for adoption. The guild was an accredited agency under the Adoption Acts 1952 and 2010 for the provision of information and tracing services. The guild advised the Adoption Authority of Ireland of its intention to cease operations from 31 December 2014. Tusla was in discussions with Saint Patrick’s Guild regarding finances, legal issues and logistics for a period of time before the transfer of records could be completed. Saint Patrick’s Guild has maintained a waiting list of applications from persons seeking information and contact. This information has also been forwarded to Tusla. Tusla will be contacting everyone who has submitted an information and tracing request in respect of the adoption records of Saint Patrick’s Guild with a response to their request as soon as possible.

Perhaps the Minister would let the House know how many staff will be allocated? In the Bessborough situation, once the files were transferred, people were being told that they were in a queue and the process was not in place for staff to give that information. Will the Minister tell us, and I know that indemnity against legal action arose in the case of the Bessborough files which were transferred, whether she has given indemnity to Saint Patrick's Guild against any future legal cases that might arise? Was this the reason for the delay? Potentially we are dealing with some criminal matters. We know that Saint Patrick's Guild was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the sale of babies to America years ago, having a quarter of those with definitely falsified records and illegal practices. A number of those victims are still alive who would be desperately seeking to access that information. Will the Minister clarify if indemnity is an issue and how access to the files will be dealt with?

I assure the Deputy that I will commit to investigating the matter of indemnity. With regard to the importance of the work of the investigations and how Tusla is managing the process, the agency has informed me that it now has a designated records storage facility in Dublin for the long-term storage of the adoption records. The Saint Patrick's Guild files have been transferred to the facility and a dedicated team is reviewing and cataloguing the files so they will be able to provide an information and tracing service for anyone whose information was held at Saint Patrick's Guild. Priority is being given to individual cases having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, including the age and the health of the individual concerned.

I am not blaming her for not knowing but it is critical for the survivors. In making those inquiries, could she deal with whether the Garda will be called in if any irregularities are unearthed because potentially serious criminal matters may be uncovered? If there was any question of Saint Patrick’s Guild being indemnified against that or the State’s being liable we need to know. Some of the victims of the crimes that happened in that institution need to know that as well. Would the Minister be open to meeting a delegation from the Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors, many of the members of which were involved with Saint Patrick’s Guild? They would give the Minister invaluable assistance on the protections that need to be put in place to deal with a historical record of people’s identity. It is so important for those involved, many of whom are ageing. The clientele is dying out and they have a right to know, as much as anybody else, where they came from and who they are.

She is probably browned off answering questions about child care schemes and the various ways of funding them. My question is specifically about the after-school child care scheme that was introduced when the previous Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection cut the one-parent family payment to ribbons on the premise that this would put lone parents back to work and take them out of the so-called social welfare trap. She did so on the basis of providing excellent Scandinavian-style child care, which, I am afraid, still only exists in Scandinavia. Could the Minister comment on this scheme and the progress relating to it?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	265	As of 18 July 2016, there were 739 children availing of the after-school child care programme. This equates to 318 after-school places. Of the 450 parents who are registered for ASCC this year, 29 have used their 52-week maximum allowance. For parents who have used their maximum allowance, the community child care subvention programme and the community child care subvention programme, private, may be options. Both of these provide funding to child care services to enable them to provide quality child care, including after-school care, at reduced rates to low-income working parents. Parents qualify as disadvantaged or being on low incomes on the basis of means-tested entitlements. Further details of these programmes are available through the city and county child care committees. The after-school child care programme has a budget of €1.5 million for the 2015-2016 academic year and has capacity to provide 340 whole-time equivalent after-school places annually. Each eligible parent is given a maximum allowance of 52 weeks of ASCC. This allocation does not have to be used consecutively but when it is exhausted, the parent's eligibility ceases. ASCC child care places are subject to availability and are allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. The programme pays child care services €40 per week for an after-school place or €80 per week in situations where the child care service provides a pick-up service that collects or brings the child to and from school. The programme also provides a full day-care rate of €105 per week, for a maximum of ten weeks, to cater for school holiday periods. In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is €15 per week per child.

They are the people I mentioned who suffered badly due to the cuts in the one-parent family payment. There is a back-to-work family dividend, which has been gradually cut when they have gone back to work. Is the Minister aware that in June of this year 8,100 lone parents lost €14.90 per week, per child because of the cut in that back-to-work family dividend? Coincidentally, many of them would have exhausted their 52 weeks' after-school child care just as the summer holidays kicked in and the schools closed, which is creating hardship upon hardship for quite a significant cohort of lone parents. Will the Minister comment please?

I was not aware of those statistics. I am distressed to hear that. I would be very committed to looking for ways to ensure that as they move on to different ways of providing public support the lone parents and their families get back what they may have lost through previous cuts. I have identified some of the ways to do that within the programme for Government. The child care places are a concern of mine. The way to move forward and correct that is to look across the board, particularly at after-school places. Are they in the appropriate locations? Are they available for women and men who as single parents have specific needs for their children because of their working arrangements? I think this is why some of the schemes in the past have not supported them. A cross-departmental group has been established to deal with after-school care. I promise to bring the concerns the Deputy has identified to the work of that group.

Several other members of the Government, such as the Ministers for Social Protection, Finance and Education and Skills, should be involved. There has to be a much more holistic approach to child care than the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, answering the questions about where the money is divvied out. One of the groups that lobbied us during the election campaign - and one of those I was most impressed with for its presentation and ambition - is Start Strong, which advocates early childhood education. It makes the obvious point very well that the greater the investment in young children, the bigger the return as they go through life. There is less chance of them falling into addiction, going to prison or experiencing any other problems. It reckons €1 billion is required to get this right. Somebody, it could have been the Minister or Deputy Coppinger, quoted a sum of approximately €300 million earlier. That is a third of what is required to get this right in our small little country. Perhaps we could chat with other Ministers about the need to address this. It is not just a problem for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

I am trying to voice that to them. I am in complete agreement with what the Deputy says. This goes across the board. We need to ensure that those who govern the nation can see this. I think they understand the development of the arguments about the importance of prevention and early intervention to save money later. If one accepts and understands that, one has to invest earlier during that period. I accept what the Deputy is saying and I welcome her comments.

It concerns a commitment on timing for the publication of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill. It is intended to publish it before the end of the year. Is there a more precise date? Has any consideration been given to incorporating this particular element into the adoption Bill that has passed Second Stage? That might speed up the process, rather than having two parallel Bills.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	271	Work on drafting the adoption (information and tracing) Bill is under way and I am committed to publishing it as early as possible after the summer recess. The heads and general scheme of the Bill were published in July 2015. It was then referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for pre-legislative scrutiny, and the committee published its report in November 2015, as I know the Deputy is aware. Following consideration of the report, a revised scheme was developed which amended the previous suite of measures to balance the right to identity of the adopted person with the right of the birth parent to privacy and to be left alone. The Government approved the drafting of this Bill, taking account of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme and heads of the Bill in December 2015. As the Deputy will be aware, the Bill is intended to facilitate access to adoption information and operates on the basis of presumption in favour of disclosing information, in so far as is legally constitutionally possible, for domestic and inter-country adoptions. The Bill will, for the first time, provide a statutory basis for the provision of information related to past and future adoptions. It will provide clarity around the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided. One of the key provisions in the Bill is to give an adopted person aged 18 years or over who was adopted prior to commencement a statutory entitlement to the information required to apply for his or her birth certificate, subject to certain conditions. The Bill also provides that an adopted person whose adoption was effected after the commencement of the Bill will be given his or her birth certificate at 18 years of age.

This is a really important issue for many people who for years have tried to get this kind of information and have gone to all kinds of lengths. The rest of us take for granted having our birth certificates and knowing about our origins, yet there are people who still have not been able to get that information. That is why I am persisting with this issue. I hope the Minister will be able to publish the Bill as soon as possible after the summer recess. She may be able to publish it before then. We need to pass this legislation as quickly as possible. I ask that consideration be given to dealing with the tracing and information aspects within the Bill that has passed Second Stage. Getting Dáil time, bringing a Bill before the Seanad and so on takes time. Passing two Bills presents challenges in terms of getting time within the two Chambers. Getting this done is a priority. There will be questions around balance, but it is important that the presumption is in favour of disclosure. I wish the Minister well with the Bill but I want to make sure it is published.

I very much appreciate that the Deputy has consistently asked questions that help me to maintain pressure in terms of the work of the Department. I hope to publish the Bill as soon as possible after the summer recess. We are waiting for a redraft of the Bill from the Office of the Attorney General and I hope that will be with us tomorrow. I checked that information before coming to the Chamber. When we receive it, we will go through it again. As the Deputy knows, there may be challenges in terms of reviewing the Bill and dealing with any outstanding policy issues. The Bill is an absolute priority for me. The Deputy is correct; there are two Bills. In that regard, they are some of the primary Bills on which the Department is working. I understand the Department does not have a significant workload in terms of other aspects of legislation.

We are not particularly overloaded with legislation in the Chamber, and I do not know how overloaded we will be in the autumn.

I take on board that the Minister has answered many of my questions on the absence of a central IT system, but I would like to hear her views on how that is impacting on social workers who are trying to make referrals through a central system.

This question is very similar to one that was asked earlier. The Deputy specifically focused on how important ICT is for the work of social workers. It is absolutely critical, as the current HIQA report and others have indicated. When the ICT system is rolled out, it will ensure a much better service for social workers in the 17 Tusla administrative areas. Each administrative area has put in place, to the best of its ability, supports to ensure the ICT system is as good as it can be in the context of where they are working. One aspect of the national child care information system we would particularly welcome is that not only would it be more efficient and supportive of social workers in particular administrative areas, but there would be a way of connecting that across the board throughout the country in terms of finding information on particular children no matter where they are. As I indicated previously, the system has been piloted in Tusla's mid-west region. It intends to roll out the system nationally over the coming year, and I will continue to support it as a key priority.

If a child in Galway moves to Dublin, social workers cannot access the relevant data. That is where things are falling down. I welcome what the Minister said earlier. If we have the correct IT system in place in 2017 and money is ring-fenced from capital funding, that will go a long way towards helping families and, most importantly, children. It will enable social workers to do their jobs, communicate, prevent abuse and protect children in future.

I hope this will be one of the best systems that are possible. A lot of time was spent on consultation throughout the country with users and providers to design a particular system. In light of that, I hope and expect that the new system will considerably increase the capacity of social workers to work and, therefore, be supportive of the ability of Tusla to retain its employees.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	279	Autism has been in the news frequently. Last week, a report from the National Council for Special Education stated one in every 65 schoolchildren in the State has a diagnosis of autism, a figure that is much higher than the one-in-100 estimate just three years ago. Despite that, it seems to be increasingly difficult for some children to get the services they need. That has certainly been the experience I have come across in Waterford and the south east. I was recently contacted by several parents whose children have autism and access a specialist cross-functional autism spectrum disorder team based in Waterford. They have learned, to their utter disbelief and shock, that the team is about to be disbanded.I will read from an e-mail I received.I met with my son's speech and language therapist yesterday who told me she’s not allowed to see him anymore as the autism team has been disbanded. There is now no autism-trained speech therapist or occupational therapist that is allowed to see the autistic kids anymore. His speech therapist... has been given a different job that’s not autism related, as has his occupational therapist. Basically, kids with autism have all been put under the same section as all other disabilities. You will be seen according to where you live. Each area has only one speech therapist and that therapist is not autism trained and my son now has to go into her waiting list to see her. More waiting lists! I was told it could be longer than a year before he sees her. The therapists from the autism team are extremely unhappy as they believe that autistic kids need specific help in communication and occupational therapy to help them for their future. How can they learn to communicate if their therapist doesn't understand the way they think and communicate in their own ways? You need to know how to get them out of their little shells which a general therapist will not know how to do. The autism spectrum disorder team in Waterford have been working miracles with the little resources that are available to them. This specialist approach with cross functional teams working together has shown great results. In addition to the children’s normal sessions this team run training courses for parents which include Early Bird and the Hanen programme. The ASD team also run a number of workshops such as feeding, visuals, sensory processing and sleeping. These training courses and information sessions have been tremendously useful to the parents and are invaluable in relation to supporting parents. It’s not easy to hear the news that your child has autism, and realise that your life will be utterly different than you had expected it to be. Daily life with a special-needs child presents many unique challenges. How do you come to terms with the fact that your child has autism? How do you cope once you get over the initial shock? This team in Waterford has filled the void and the support they are giving to the children with autism and their parents and guardians cannot be underestimated.I also have a constituent who has a daughter aged 11 with autism. She had been advised in December that her daughter’s case was considered urgent and to have a psychological review undertaken. She has been trying to arrange that for her daughter and when she spoke to someone in the HSE recently, she was told that those services have been cut for children aged between six and 18 years of age. She was also advised that there is no alternative available nor are there plans to have a suitable resource replacement. Could the Minister of State explain what is going on? Why are the services being cut back? How can that be considered fair?
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	280	I thank Deputy Mary Butler for raising the issue. I am pleased to take this opportunity to update the Deputy on the provision of supports for children with autism in the south east and in particular the services available in Waterford. The programme for a partnership Government commits the Government to improving services and increasing supports for people with disabilities, particularly for early assessment and intervention for children with special needs. Since 2014, the roll-out of the HSE’s progressing disability services for children and young people from zero to 18 programme has entailed targeted investment of €14 million and the provision of 275 additional therapy staff to increase services for children with all disabilities, including children with autism. This national project is currently under way with the aim of providing services to children with all disabilities to be delivered by the children’s disability network teams. They will be based in the community and each child will be allocated to the team nearest their home address. Services will be needs-led rather than diagnosis-led. That is to ensure equity of access across Waterford and throughout community health care organisation, CHO, 5 and also across the country. It will also provide a standardised holistic, family-centred service to children and their families. The autism spectrum disorder, ASD, specialists will be assigned to the children’s disability network teams and will work from within the teams, rather than as a standalone service. That will mean children will continue to receive the intervention required, even when wait-listed for ASD diagnosis. Children with autism spectrum disorder will continue to receive intervention and families may avail of parenting workshops as appropriate from the network teams. A small cohort of children with autism and complex needs may require one-to-one intervention and that will be delivered by the ASD specialists. In future, there will be only two pathways for all children, including those with autism, through primary care services or through the children’s disability network teams. The HSE provides a range of services for children with autism which may include the following: assessment diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, nursing support, respite services and home support services. Access to service is based on the referral criteria, prioritisation and the particular service model within each discipline required, for example, psychiatry, psychology, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and social work services. They are the issues on which we need to focus. In addition, the HSE may provide grant aid funding to voluntary groups and autism support groups. Support can come from other parents or guardians who have children with ASD and from autism support groups. The key objective is to achieve equity of access and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live or go to school or the nature of the individual child’s difficulties. I am confident that the additional resources being invested in both primary and disability services will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services to all children with disabilities, including autism, and those who may currently be on waiting lists. I accept Deputy Butler's point that there is a problem in that regard and I will deal with that later. There are waiting lists to access therapy inputs not just in the south east, but across the country.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	281	The Minister of State said that the autism spectrum disorder specialists will be assigned to the children's disability network teams and they will work from within the teams. I am sure he is well aware that children with ASD have considerable difficulty with change. They take a long time to get know people, places and routines. Anything that upsets that makes the challenge they face even more difficult. The parents are shocked that the HSE has adopted such an approach knowing the damage it can and will do. Everyone knows that resources are limited. However, there is a dedicated team that is getting great results which supports children and parents on an ongoing basis. The question is why consistency is being replaced with disruption and why specialist skills are being replaced with general skills. Could the Minister of State clarify whether there will be longer waiting lists if the children change to children's disability network teams and that the children will not have to go back to the start again? There is considerable concern in Waterford among parents about the potential effect on their children. What effect will the change have on the children? Is the approach being taken best practice? Could the Minister of State ensure that if services are reconfigured, no child will lose out, even temporarily?

This morning, I met with Irish Autism Action and many of the same points were made to me. I gave a commitment that I would go back to the HSE and the various Ministers within the sector to deal with the issue. I have an open mind on it. I accept what was said by the Deputy. I do not say this lightly, because I know the facts about the situation in Waterford. There was an excellent team there of one speech and language therapist, one occupational therapist, one liaison worker and three psychologists but there was a problem within the system due to a number of circumstances, including HR issues such as extended leave and maternity leave, and the service was unable to function at full capacity for several years. That resulted in a reduction in the service's ability to provide one-to-one intervention and to carry out ASD assessment and diagnosis. Instead, the remaining therapists provided training and support workshops for parents. I accept there is an internal HR problem that must be addressed. I share Deputy Butler's concerns about the overall issue. There must be investment. The reality is that services for children with disabilities, and autism in particular, have suffered in recent years. What we are attempting to do is to reinvest and build up the services. However, the services must suit the child and be available, strong and functional. On the broader issue, I want to focus on ability and not disability. I want to reduce the stigma around autism. I want to include everybody and ensure that children and young people with autism are not discriminated against. We can all then make a difference. We need to invest in the services and that investment has started. I guarantee the Deputy that, in respect of the Estimates, we are going to be working on it over the summer, starting this morning. Autism is a very high priority on my list.
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	283	I am raising a matter which I consider to be extremely important and which impacts on patients who are waiting for a cardiac procedure called a transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This procedure involves the replacement of an aortic valve in a less interventionist way than by means of open heart surgery. The aortic valve is replaced by a cardiologist rather than a cardiac surgeon. The valve is replaced through a femoral or other artery instead of via open heart surgery, as I have stated. The reason patients require this type of cardiac intervention is that open heart surgery has been medically assessed as being inappropriate due to the underlying medical conditions of the patients involved. For example, some of them have quite severe cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, arterial disease, underlying respiratory issues or even haematological issues. They cannot get the required treatment via open heart surgery, which was the historic means to make a cardiac intervention. That is impossible for many patients. This transcatheter aortic valve is the solution for the patients in question. Many of them, as I have discovered through constituency representations, are not getting the intervention they need and deserve. The situation, as it currently stands, at the Mater Hospital is an illustration of total and complete management dysfunction. It is an illustration of the complete dysfunction of the Ireland east hospital group and the short-sighted, irrational and clinically dangerous allocation of resources within our health service. The information I have received is that there are up to 18 patients who are clinically unwell and sick. They are not clinically able for open heart surgery. They are assessed as needing this valve replacement in the Mater Hospital. They have complex medical and cardiac needs and time is absolutely of the essence. The barrier, however, to them getting their required intervention is not a staffing issue, an issue with theatres or an issue of bed capacity. We have the doctors, the nurses, the theatres, the hospital and the beds. We do not have one thing: the State, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Ministers will not provide funding for more than two valves per month. The consequence of that for many patients is that they are becoming clinically unwell and sicker. Their lives are at risk as a result of an unfair management practice. The HSE - and, by extension, the Department and its Ministers - is refusing to fund more than two of these procedures per month within the hospital because of the cost of the valve. Patients are left lingering for months, with their lives at risk and their health deteriorating. A rigorous, irrational and completely unreasonable budgetary approach to transcatherter aortic valves means that medical and health teams that are already in place cannot make the intervention they are paid to make. Why? It is because neither the Ministers nor the HSE, as the service provider, will provide funding for the necessary equipment. As a consequence, many of these patients are in our hospitals being managed medically because their underlying symptoms are worsening and they cannot get the valve. It is the most unreasonable and irrational method of allocating funds. I accept that the valve costs more than open heart surgery. However, it is regressive, in the context of our health policy, to limit the quantity of valves when we have the teams in place. We have spoken about recruitment issues in our health service. That is not an issue in this case. The staff are there to perform the procedures and have been telling the patients that they will perform them. They have the theatres but the HSE will not provide funding. I urge the Minister of State to address this issue.
#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	284	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, who has asked me to extend his apologies to the Deputy as he is unavoidably occupied elsewhere. The debate gives me the opportunity to update the House on the transcatheter aortic valve implant, TAVI, procedures at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, as raised by Deputy Chambers. Aortic stenosis is the most prevalent valvular heart disease and the third most common cardiovascular condition after coronary artery disease and hypertension. Many patients with advanced aortic valve disease are too high a risk for traditional treatment, such as open chest surgery, due to advanced age or co-existing medical conditions. Catheter-based techniques such as TAVI are, therefore, hugely important as they provide an alternative method for treating aortic stenosis in patients with unacceptably high surgical risks. TAVI procedures are a relatively new development in Ireland, with the first case performed in 2008. In addition to the Mater, TAVI services are now provided at St. James’s Hospital, Galway University Hospital and Cork University Hospital. I understand that funding arrangements to date facilitate a limited number of these procedures to be undertaken each year. The HSE has advised that, so far in 2016, at least 19 TAVI procedures have been completed at the Mater. The HSE has also told me that the Mater manages waiting lists with due regard to the complexity and urgency of the cases presented. Further development of the TAVI service will need to be considered as part of the 2017 Estimates process now underway, in the context of overall competing priorities and demands for health service funding. In the context of waiting lists for this service and for all health services, I wish to emphasise that improving waiting lists for scheduled care is a key priority for the Government. The emphasis in the programme for a partnership Government on the need for sustained commitment and funding to improve waiting times for patients is evidence of this. However, I am aware that waiting list data for June 2016 shows that the numbers of those on lists increased nationally in the first half of the year. The Minister, Deputy Harris, met the HSE national director for acute hospitals on Friday last, 15 July, regarding proposed measures to tackle waiting lists. He has asked the HSE to submit an action plan setting out the specific measures it proposes to implement with hospitals within current resources between now and the end of 2016 in order to achieve tangible improvements in waiting list management. The action plan will focus on measures to improve hospitals' processes in managing waiting lists, to validate all waiting lists and to target the specialties and hospitals with the highest numbers of patients waiting. I want to emphasise the Government’s determination to address undue waiting times for all those in need of our health services, including TAVI procedures, and I am confident that good and steady progress on waiting lists overall can be achieved in the months ahead.

She has reiterated what I told her about the issue around aortic stenosis and the medical complexities involved. She then mentioned how the Government funds some of the procedures and how there is limited funding for them. Finally, she provided a summary from some manager about what they are apparently doing to address the waiting list numbers, which have rocketed this year. She did not address the specific question around these TAVI procedures at the Mater Hospital. That was all management lingo. She spoke about the 2017 Estimates. That will do nothing for the 18 patients who are waiting today for this procedure. They do not have the six months to the end of the year to survive. That is being realistic about it. She has given no commitment to address the current chronic issue of not funding the piece of equipment needed. Let me give an example. There is one patient in my constituency who has been in the Mater Hospital for a month. The cost of a bed is €1,000 per day. He is going to be there for more than two months. That could equate to a cost of €60,000 to the State. The valve costs €22,000 and there are negligible staff costs because we already fund them. The problem we have in this health service is that we see the bed capacity issue as a fixed cost. He can stay in the bed. Managers are not necessarily concerned with his medical outcome because if he gets the clinical outcome and procedure, someone else will replace him.There is no incentive within management to see clinical progress for patients and to cut the waiting list. They do not care whether he is in the bed any longer, because they have left him there and have focused on the estimates and the costs. The clinical outcome could be much improved for him and for others if they were given the valve and the procedure. They then would be discharged from the beds for the benefit of someone else. Instead, he is being left in the bed, which is a cost to the State, to the detriment of his health and to the detriment of the health service overall. The 2017 Estimates and the management lingo about what the Government is doing regarding action plans about waiting times is nonsense. It will not address this specific issue in the Mater Hospital, which is rigid and irrational management procedure regarding the funding of a basic piece of equipment when all the additional costs already are being funded. The Government must tackle management to stop this and I urge the Minister of State to do it now.

The extent to which he is exercised by this important topic is evident. I also am exercised and any Minister in the Department of Health obviously would like to see the €14 billion of taxpayers' money allocated to the Health Service Executive, HSE, is being well spent. This is why the Government is taking waiting lists, including this particular one, so seriously. The Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Department are engaging with the HSE to establish how these waiting lists can be reduced. It is interesting to see the kind of numbers that are being dealt with overall. For example, there are 3.2 million outpatient attendances at hospitals.

I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this issue. I believe a topical issue was withdrawn earlier, albeit not this one, which probably is what caused the confusion. As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan cannot make it, I will raise the matter by myself. Five families have been told they must leave Lynam's Hotel on O'Connell Street in Dublin by Saturday, as the hotel has gone into receivership and the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, has appointed receivers to the hotel. I acknowledge Dublin City Council is in negotiations to try to get more time for these families but this system is broken and all the city council can offer families is more of the same inadequate, insecure accommodation for short periods and I believe the Government must now intervene in this particular case. It is important to portray the reality of the situation and I will outline the circumstances of some of the families who are in Lynam's Hotel. Annette, who is 26 years old, is staying in Lynam's Hotel with her 18 month old daughter, Kayleigh. They were made homeless in March of this year and since then have been on the move between hotels and bed and breakfasts. This is completely inappropriate for a young child, as they live in a single room with no way of getting bottles heated or storing milk and the family is obliged to rely on fast food. Annette has been on the housing list since 2009. She was in private rental accommodation until her landlord decided to sell and gave her 28 days' notice to quit. She was asked to leave the hotel today and has been told she can go to the Gresham Hotel for 40 days but that if it gets busy, she will be obliged to leave there as well and be moved on somewhere else. Another family - Anna, her husband and five children - have been living in separate rooms in Lynam's Hotel and when schools are open, she must bring her kids back out to Dublin 15 each morning to attend school. Anna had a baby in February. She works part-time and is a participant in a community employment scheme. Her husband works full-time on a zero-hour contract. This family has no cooking or laundry facilities and no security. They are being offered another hotel miles away in Newlands Cross, again with no facilities and no guarantee that they will even get adjoining rooms for the children. They have been on the housing list for eight years. They have been obliged to put many of their belongings into storage and into the homes of family and friends and even were required to sell off some of their furniture because they had nowhere to keep it. Leanne Heffernan is another resident there who is in the Gallery today. She has two children and has been treated despicably by the State for a long time. Leanne was a 12 year old victim in what became known as the Mr. A case in 2006, when there was public outrage after gaping holes in the law led to the release of her attacker. At the time, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, described the then Government as a "headless gang of bunglers" for letting down this young victim. Today, she is being victimised again by the State by what one could describe as a different Government of bunglers. These families are being destroyed. They currently are living hour to hour with very little information, no support and no key worker from the council, which they were promised ten days ago. They seek some form of secure accommodation in order that they can work on getting themselves permanent homes. This is impossible for them under the circumstances as at present it takes all their energy to try to find ways to wash clothes, get decent meals for the children, get them to school and worry about where they will be next week. This system has broken down completely and is letting these families down badly. Moreover, as I have outlined, for some it is by no means the first time they have been let down by the State. I acknowledge that Dublin City Council is in negotiations currently with the receivers to try to get more time and find adequate alternatives but if the Minister of State is serious about dealing with this problem - the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has stated he wishes to end hotel accommodation within the next year - this is an opportunity to do something positive. The Government should intervene today in those negotiations with the receiver, who is acting on behalf of NAMA, and instruct the receiver to lease the building to Dublin City Council.It is not adequate accommodation, we all know that, but these families would at least have some sense of security and would be able to work on getting themselves out of their situations of homelessness. We must ensure that Dublin City Council leases the property so that we can give them that sense of security. That is the very least we can do to ensure these families are not shunted around between hotels and bed and breakfast establishments across the city.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	316	I thank Deputy Pringle for raising this issue and I apologise for being late. As the Deputy will be aware, the housing action plan, Rebuilding Ireland, which was launched this week, sets out what we are trying to do in this area. We are trying to end the type of situations highlighted by the Deputy. I understand that the Deputy wants an urgent solution to the issue he highlighted but what we are trying to do in terms of the plan is deal with housing issues for everybody so that we can prevent homelessness into the future. It is widely acknowledged that accommodating families in commercial hotels is inappropriate for anything other than a short period. This is not acceptable and we must do all we can to prevent it. One of the many objectives of the Government's new action plan for housing and homelessness launched earlier this week is that by mid-2017 hotels will only be used for emergency accommodation in very limited circumstances and not at all, if possible. The intention is to move the existing group of families out of hotels as quickly as possible and to limit the extent to which such accommodation is used for new presentations. The plan provides for early solutions to address this challenge, including the provision of 1,500 rapid-delivery units, some 1,600 vacant units to be sourced by the Housing Agency and the transition of homeless households from emergency into independent tenancies through the Dublin region pilot of the housing assistance payment. Some 550 tenancies are to be delivered in 2016 and 1,200 in 2017. The plan also contains a range of additional services and supports which will be put in place for families in emergency accommodation, such as the families mentioned by Deputy Pringle, including dedicated workers, home-school community liaison, free public transport for family outings and for journeys to school, access to crèches and advice on cooking and nutrition. Ultimately, however, the key to addressing family homelessness is to supply more houses.  In forming the current Government, we were determined that this challenge would be addressed, fully and finally, and so it was positioned as a key element in the programme for a partnership Government. The publication this week of Rebuilding Ireland, well within the timeframe of 100 days set out in the Government programme, underpins our commitment to ending the housing shortage and addressing homelessness. My Department's role in respect of homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. In accordance with section 37(2) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, statutory responsibility for the provision of homeless services, including accommodation, rests with individual housing authorities. All housing authorities have wide and flexible statutory powers to assist or make arrangements for the accommodation of homeless persons. This means that operational issues, such as those raised by Deputy Pringle, are a matter for the relevant housing authority, in this case, Dublin City Council. I am informed by Dublin City Council that the hotel in question is but one of many being utilised to provide emergency accommodation to homeless families. I also understand that the hotel in question is, as pointed out by Deputy Pringle, in receivership and that vacant possession is being sought by the receiver as part of that process. I am informed that Dublin City Council is seeking to negotiate an extension of the date for vacant possession with the receiver. This would allow the Dublin Region Homeless Executive additional time to put appropriate alternative arrangements in place for the affected households. These arrangements include sourcing alternative accommodation and support services for the families, such as key workers, which as Deputy Pringle said were promised but have not been delivered. I will make inquiries with regard to that matter and will communicate with the Deputy tomorrow. I am hopeful that these discussions will reach a favourable conclusion shortly. I am conscious that Saturday is the deadline for some of the families and I have asked Dublin City Council to keep me informed of developments in the matter.  On the Deputy's proposal that the hotel be leased, I will discuss that with my departmental officials later this evening. There is logic to the idea. We are trying to look at all available solutions in the weeks and months ahead. While we are confident that we can deal with this issue and have everybody out of hotel accommodation in a year, the latter is 12 months away. We need to find other solutions. I will inquire if the Deputy's proposal is an option. I am not sure if it is but I will raise it. It is certainly worth checking out. As I said, I will communicate with the Deputy tomorrow in respect of the key workers and so on.

It is important he does so. While the earlier part of the Minister of State's contribution gave a nice overview of what the plan and strategy seeks to achieve, for these families the strategy will fail unless we act now to ensure that this hotel is leased to Dublin City Council. The onus is on us to do that. NAMA is a State agency. The receiver was appointed by NAMA. That the receiver can demand vacant possession and families will have no choice but to vacate is a disgrace. This cannot be allowed to continue. I urge the Minister of State to contact NAMA this evening and encourage it to address this issue immediately. Some families have been told they have to leave the hotel today and others have been told they must do so by Saturday. We should be sending a clear message to those families to stay where they are, that this issue is going to be resolved and that the hotel will be leased to Dublin City Council. This will at least provide them with some form of stability for a while during which time they might be able to source alternative accommodation or it will give the new plan time to work so that such issues can be resolved for families. I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State tomorrow. I hope the news will be positive. If NAMA fails to agree to lease this hotel, we should tell these families not to leave in any event. We need to put it up to NAMA. We cannot allow this to happen.

Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an deis an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach sa Teach seo tráthnóna inniu. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé déanach sa lá agus déanach sa téarma ach, ag an am céanna, táim fíorbhuíoch as an deis é a phlé ar aon nós. I welcome the opportunity to bring this Bill before the House. This is the last item of business to be transacted in this Dáil session. It is right to say that in the context of the atmosphere around here recently, school is definitely out. This Bill is focused on schools and it is timely that I can refocus us on education before we formally declare that school is out for a while. The purpose of the Bill is to establish an ombudsman for education, provide an appeal mechanism for decisions of boards of education concerning the decisions of teachers and grievances against schools, provide for the investigation and reporting by the ombudsman for education of various matters pertaining to this Act, amend the Education Act 1998 and provide for related matters. In terms of the current system, our schools are run by boards of management. The latter operate on a voluntary basis and they do a wonderful job. Many of the people involved give of their time in a voluntary capacity, which is very much appreciated by all stakeholders across the education sector, by society as a whole and by us as representatives of the people. I would not like the opportunity to pass without extending my appreciation to people for the contribution they have made to boards of management throughout the years. I thank them for their selfless sacrifice and time, all of which are given free, which is of enormous and immense value to the entire education system. The difficulty I have come across - I am sure numerous of my colleagues will have encountered this issue in their roles as public representatives - is to whom people go when things go wrong. Thankfully, it is only a small fraction of our school boards that are not functioning properly. Currently, when parents have a legitimate grievance and they lodge that with the board of management, the board of management can refuse to even acknowledge it. I have come across many such cases where boards of management have refused to acknowledge a letter or correspondence, which can be very frustrating. When one gets a parking fine one can appeal it. In this day and age there are avenues to appeal everything in the interests of fairness, transparency, openness and accountability. Within the education sector, however, which is the sector to which we hand over our most precious asset - our children - each school day, there is no such mechanism.There is a board of management that is responsible for what happens within that school on a given day. If something goes wrong and someone takes it up with the board of management - in some cases the principal effectively is the board of management and there is no functioning board - the principal will tell the board that there is nothing here and to move on and the board will go along with it. I am trying to highlight the fact that if someone wants to appeal that and go to a higher authority and have it assessed, there is nowhere to go. The Department takes a very "hands-off" approach to dealing with complaints from parents. I have been unable to get the number of complaints it has received over the years but I know the response it gives, namely, that the boards are constituted in such a way that they are autonomous and are not accountable to the Department. If someone goes to the patron or any of the other bodies involved in the education sector, they will tell them that it is a matter for the board of management. Effectively, when something goes wrong, it can be impenetrable and one cannot get through or beyond it or get someone to hold to account. This is why I want to see an education ombudsman established so that where we feel decisions taken that affect our children daily in schools are wrong and that our child has been aggrieved in some way, we have an avenue through which to voice that grievance to a competent, qualified and independent authority such as an education ombudsman. The role and functions of the ombudsman will be debated through committees but I have outlined a number of them in the Bill. They include advising the Minister and the Government as may be appropriate; encouraging schools to develop policies, practices and procedures; collecting and disseminating information on matters relating to the education of children; promoting awareness among schools and members of the public regarding matters relating to the education of children; highlighting issues relating to the education of children; exchanging information and co-operating with the ombudsman for education in other states; and monitoring and reviewing generally the operation of legislation concerning matters relating to the education of children. In other words, if an ombudsman for education was in existence right now, this Bill would be sent to them for their views and they would outline what they feel. The education sector is a massive sector of enormous importance and we are always very good at paying lip service to Ireland as the isle of saints and scholars. In the region of €8 billion is spent on education yet we have no ombudsman with an overarching responsibility for it. We spend about €2.1 billion on policing and we have a Garda ombudsman, a Garda inspectorate and a policing authority. We have lots of bodies holding that system to account and people with grievances can appeal to them but there is no such avenue within education. There is no competent person who is dedicated solely to education matters and who will make a judgment on issues like this. We have an ombudsman for pensions and an ombudsman for the Defence Forces but we do not have an ombudsman for education, which I find very strange. We have an unusual system of governance vis-à-vis boards of management. These boards are voluntary and independent and are separate from the Department, which is suitable on many fronts. The very same Department would be held accountable by this ombudsman, were it to be established. This is why I am putting this Bill forward. The Ombudsman for Children is an obvious point for people to make complaints to if they have any complaints relating to the education sector. A total of 47% of complaints received by the Ombudsman for Children relate to education. He has received more than 4,000 of them over the past ten years. I have seen too many responses, have studied test cases and have been involved in cases where I have prompted parents to write to the Ombudsman for Children and solicited responses. In too many cases, the response is "I have no role or remit in this particular issue". To put it very basically, unless someone's child is slapped or their overall welfare is impacted, the Ombudsman for Children does not have any remit. My issue is educational welfare, which is separate from general welfare. If as a result of an administrative decision taken by the board of management, someone's child is in an overcrowded classroom of 43 or 44 junior and senior infants, contrary to the circular issued by the Department stipulating that the lower numbers should be kept in the lower classes and higher numbers should be kept in the higher classes, and the parent wants to appeal, the Ombudsman for Children will tell them that he has no role or function in respect of it because it is educational welfare we are talking about. That is what I am trying to get across here. We need somebody who will stand up for educational welfare. Where a grievance concerning the system or a decision that has negatively impacted the educational welfare of anyone's child exists, we should have a competent authority that would investigate that. The ombudsman would have a much broader role. It is not just about grievances. I would stress the responsibility of the ombudsman for education in respect of theorising on the issues pertaining to education. There are many debates raging vis-à-vis special needs education, access to schools and third-level fees. There are numerous issues in the education sector that are very contentious and if we had a dedicated ombudsman for education who was completely immersed in the education sector and fully briefed and versed in the law and language of education, they would have a very significant contribution to make to the various debates. They would also be a huge asset to this House and individual Members of this House. If a parent came to a Deputy to tell them that their Johnny or Mary is being bullied in school and that they went to the teacher who did nothing about it, that Deputy would automatically have a point of contact straight away because there would be an ombudsman for education who would be familiar with and competent in that area and the Deputy could suggest to the parent that they write to the ombudsman. This ombudsman would have a very strong role in our deliberations on legislation in terms of assisting, advising and suggesting. Section 28 of the Education Act 1998 has not been activated. There are numerous aspirations out there that are just not happening and an education ombudsman would play a particular role in lobbying and ensuring that the attention of this House is focused on solutions for these issues. Another argument one could come across is that there is no education ombudsman in most of our European neighbours. Most European countries do not have an education system like our system. They do not have our history. Ireland was first with the smoking ban and marriage equality through a referendum. This is another area in which Ireland can lead the way as an island that is proud of our saints and scholars. I do not know how relevant the saints are anymore but I hope we are still relatively scholarly and put a value on our education system. I would like to see us be the first country in Europe to lead the way on this. I think there is an ombudsman for education in some US states and I know the Australian Parliament has been debating the establishment of an education ombudsman for some time. A member of the Australian Parliament has a similar obsession to mine in terms of trying to establish an education ombudsman. There are differing education models in various countries. The issue of children with special educational needs is close to all our hearts. I taught in primary and secondary schools and was a principal of a primary school so I am a poacher turned gamekeeper or vice versa because I have seen it from both sides and have been on boards of management. As a principal, I have seen how the board can protect a principal when they need it and how the principal can use the board very efficiently to protect them from any outside criticism if they so wish. I have sat on numerous boards of management at second level because I was a member of the VEC and chaired many section 29 appeals so I have a certain knowledge in the education sphere and knowledge of things that are very difficult to get to the bottom of when they go wrong. I am very anxious that we do not continue with the charade of pretending that the Ombudsman for Children is dealing with these complaints because he is not. He is concerned with the welfare of the child. If they are hungry, cold or injured, the Ombudsman for Children has a role. We have two separate Departments - the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Department of Education and Skills. Why can we not have an ombudsman for education in the same way we have an Ombudsman for Children? I referred to children with special needs. This is a huge area of concern. I have received support from parents of children with special needs since I first mooted this Bill back in 2015. I see the worry, concern, pressure and stress involved in trying to ensure they can get the necessary resources for their child and know the security they would feel from knowing that there was an education ombudsman out there who was on their side and who would make suggestions. I am not hung up on the compellability aspect of the ombudsman because I believe the Ombudsman's direction was only ignored once in 27 years. I am not hung up on compellability. I just think that if an ombudsman for education was there and told a school that it should do something, the school would have the wherewithal and decency to go along with it.It is the comfort and security it would give to parents who have enough stresses in their lives. If their children have special learning needs, it really is an education ombudsman that is necessary and not the Ombudsman for Children. This is not a them-or-us situation; I am not passing any criticism on the children's Ombudsman. I published legislation in the previous Dáil to try to widen the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to deal specifically with education issues. That legislation was not accepted by the Government and the Department at the time so I went about trying to get this legislation together to have a separate ombudsman for education specifically to deal with the issues I have been highlighting for some time. That is it in a nutshell.  I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to bring this before the House and I look forward to the contributions of other Members in respect of it.

That is a sign of the broad support in the Dáil for this. I agree with Deputy Jim Daly. Parents who have had particularly bad experiences with the education system have contacted us urging us to support the Bill. Thankfully, they are in a minority but in those cases they found that their grievances or issues, particularly with bullying, were not satisfactorily dealt with by boards of management. At that point they discovered, as Deputy Jim Daly pointed out, that there was no avenue open to them and no ombudsman to approach. Deputy Jim Daly is right to highlight the fact that section 28 of the Education Act 1998 has never really been implemented. That is a problem. The Bill tries to put flesh on the bones of section 28. It is effectively an appeals mechanism against boards of management. There are many issues that have to be dealt with in this context. We are dealing with a publicly funded education system and, as a result, people have a right to certain standards and fair procedures when they are dealing with publicly funded schools. It is a publicly funded system which, at board of management level, is run entirely by volunteers. That is the other side of the equation. Such a proposal will require resources for it to be implemented. Already we hear from schools about section 29 appeals under the Education Act. Those appeals take up a considerable amount of time and effort - and, in some cases, money - to defend. This Bill, as Deputy Jim Daly says, provides for appeals against decisions of boards of management. It provides a period of 28 days for making a complaint to the proposed ombudsman for education. It would give power to the latter to direct any person to take remedial action in respect of the appeal and to specify the time for doing so. Under the Bill, the proposed ombudsman would be given quite considerable powers over the actions of boards of management. I mentioned the voluntary nature of boards of management. Some people who now sit on them may baulk at the prospect of this Bill but we have community national schools that are being run by education and training boards, ETBs. I wonder would that be a place to start this because those schools are fully and effectively run by the State by means of the ETB system. It might be the place to start if one were to begin with a pilot programme. I am not particularly suggesting that but the fact that they do not have the issues with voluntary boards of management means they should have procedures there because they are wholly funded by the State. We in Fianna Fáil - certainly those of us who are members of the education and skills committee - look forward to the Committee Stage debate that will take place in September or October if the Bill passes Second Stage this evening. We expect that to happen. We will not be standing in the way of it happening. We support the Bill. We want to ensure that those who feel they have been badly treated by the education system have recourse. That is really key. It is notable that Deputy Jim Daly, who has considerable experience in primary schools and with the VEC and the ETB in Cork, has brought this Bill forward. One might feel that someone in his position might be defensive about this type of arrangement. I welcome his views on it and welcome that it is not being imposed from the outside but coming from someone with the Deputy's experience. We will facilitate the Bill and allow it to pass but there are detailed issues that need to be dealt with by the select committee. We look forward to dealing with them. We look forward to hearing from the Ombudsman for Children because the latter has expressed concerns. They are concerns to which we will listen but, ultimately, the Dáil and the Seanad make the decisions on these matters. I will certainly be interested to hear the views of boards of management. Some of them might be invited to appear before the committee or to make written submissions. We look forward to that and to discovering what their experience has been. I am interested in talking to parents. Other Members might do the same, although perhaps privately because it might not be appropriate to hear, at a public forum, from parents who have had particularly bad experiences with the education system and their lack of a comeback after a board of management has made a decision. I would like to hear from them and I am sure other Members would too.  I would also like to hear the Minister's views on section 28 and whether he has any plans on it? It does not provide the same avenue; it certainly provides recourse but it has never actually been allowed to operate. The Minister's views on that would be most welcome. It might be a way to step forward alongside this Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Party thanks Deputy Jim Daly for bringing this forward and we look forward to the select committee's hearings in September or October.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	321	Ní bheidh mé ag tógáil an deich nóiméad go léir. Sinn Féin is not opposed, in principle, to the establishment of an ombudsman for education. As a primary school principal for three years and somebody who spent 12 years in the sector between special education, mainstream education and as a principal, this is not the way forward to address the problem. There are a lot of gaps and there are many parts of the Education Act 1998 which have not been fulfilled, particularly in regard to special education. I hope that our admissions Bill will address the issue of access for children with special needs. I will outline our position. We recognise that there are gaps within the education sector. We also recognise that this Bill is an attempt to address those gaps but we are not convinced that it will address those gaps. It is flawed legislation. The Bill provides that decisions of the ombudsman would be legally binding. I am not sure this has been thought through thoroughly. Making the decisions of an ombudsman legally binding would lead to the involvement of lawyers in these types of disputes. This would prove costly for parents and schools but, more importantly, our children would pay the price. Let us just consider the impact of such legislation. Another legal layer would be added to our education system. It is a system that is already troubled and overloaded in many ways, with lots of issues to be addressed. The cost of accessing the ombudsman would reach into the thousands and it might take years to obtain a decision. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds would most likely find themselves unable to access the system due to legal fees. Empowering an ombudsman with the right to make legally binding decisions is not in keeping with the traditional spirit of an ombudsman role. The spirit of the ombudsman is to provide an alternative to court proceedings and work on the element of encouragement to resolve complaints. A decision of an ombudsman is often highly respected and valued by all sides of a dispute and can be a very effective way of resolving a complaint. Overall, our party would not be in favour of granting legally binding powers to an ombudsman in the absence of any clear evidence of the need for such powers and an assessment of the potential impact on children from special needs and disadvantaged backgrounds. Another question arises on the purpose of an ombudsman for education. There are clear gaps for parents and children in respect of complaints procedures. I am very aware of those. One has to wonder if this Bill truly addresses these issues. I am informed that there is no such office for an ombudsman for education in European countries and this legislation puts forward quite a unique proposition. Some would argue that there are more effective mechanisms for dealing with complaints, such as implementing the relevant provisions of the Education Act and the Teaching Council Act. In a recent submission the Ombudsman for Children's office states that the Minister for Education and Skills has made a commitment to introduce procedures for schools to deal with complaints effectively but this has not happened. It seems bizarre that we are proposing the establishment of a separate office with legally binding powers instead of taking relatively simple measures to tackle these problems. No one can doubt that the Ombudsman for Children does an excellent job. The fact that 47% of complaints in that office relate to education is of concern.However, the Ombudsman for Children has a wide remit and can investigate all aspects of a complaint, including those that cross over into a range of areas such as health, education and social welfare. This holistic approach serves to achieve the best possible outcome for the child and one would wonder if such an approach would be achievable by an ombudsman for education. It could be argued that the best approach would be to widen the remit of the current Ombudsman for Children. Alternatively, is it possible to establish an ombudsman for education within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children in order to relieve some of the pressure on that office? If we are thinking about co-ordinating services, in many cases the services are completely disjointed. In terms of joined-up thinking and co-ordination, it might be a possible solution. It is not clear whether third-level students or mature students would be catered for under this Bill, which is an oversight. All in all, I believe this Bill is quite flawed. It does not provide the most effective solution to the problems identified and my party will not be supporting it.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	322	At the outset, as this is the final speech I will be making in this session of the Dáil, I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the staff of his office for their kindness and efficiency in making my job as a TD so enjoyable in this first term. I would be grateful if the Ceann Comhairle could pass those sentiments on to them. I am grateful to Deputy Jim Daly for bringing forward this Bill. It is a provocative Bill and some of the points that Deputy Carol Nolan made and some of the questions that she raised are extremely valid and need to be teased out at the next Stage. Rather than going over any of the ground that my colleague, my party's spokesperson on education, Deputy Thomas Byrne, raises, there are only a few other matters I would like to raise. A question that was going through my mind as Deputy Jim Daly was talking about this was whether this was an ombudsman for schools or an ombudsman for education because most of the buttons he pressed were related to the performance management and some aspects of primary and post-primary schools. That is one question that would need to be addressed. As the House will be aware, the existing Ombudsman's office covers some aspects of education and, as the previous speaker mentioned, the office of the Ombudsman for Children covers many of these aspects too. Therefore, there is much to tease out on it. I note too there is a much more democratic voice in some of the evolving school models. Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned the education and training boards, ETB, model which is a very democratic model. I served for two years on the board of the old vocational education committee, VEC, and was really impressed at the manner in which those boards were run, in which meetings were run and in which business was taken. As Deputy Jim Daly will be aware, the difference between those and the traditional board of management of a religious-run secondary school is that as a last resort parents have recourse to a public representative who is sitting on the board, at least, to bring those issues forward, but ultimately must take the final word of the chief executive also, which is a kind of weakness in the system. Third-level colleges are already covered by one of the ombudsmen but to what degree, whether it is a comprehensive coverage or what are the issues, I am not quite sure. Deputy Jim Daly correctly pointed out, as did Deputy Thomas Byrne, that we need to pay tribute to the boards of management because it is a completely voluntary service that parents and members of the community have provided for generations, and it is not Deputy Jim Daly's intention to override this. Parents give of their time and in many cases their expertise with absolutely no reward. That is becoming a more pressurised position for parents who volunteer for these boards. The last thing we want - it is a fear I have about this - is to discourage those who might otherwise be interested in giving such service to school boards. It might dissuade them from doing it on the basis of the legal requirements or the onerous nature of the position. In 99% of cases, school boards of management are effective. Historically, they have done a good job. However, there are exceptions and that is what Deputy Jim Daly is attempting to address in the Bill and I commend the Bill for that. I have served on interview boards. Deputy Jim Daly made comments, not in the Chamber but in a preamble, about this. Whatever about the traditional school board model, I have served on interview boards of the former VEC and they were run efficiently. I have seen their appeals mechanism work and I have seen all the administrative machinery implemented in particular cases. I have been really impressed with that. I have come away from that in the full knowledge that everybody was served well, justly and fairly. Not everybody may have been happy with the responses or with the outcome, but at least they know the procedure was fair. Deputy Jim Daly mentioned correctly - I suppose we all use search engines - that there is a precedent in Australia and some of the areas that they cover. As public representatives we all have come across parents who have felt frustrated and aggrieved. One of the reasons I would be broadly supportive of this going to another Stage and being teased out line by line in committee is where parents feel aggrieved, frustrated and have no avenue of last resort to go to. Either the school or the patron is the last resort. Of course, this is one consequence of the State keeping education at arm's length for generations. Deputy Carol Nolan raised the point, which I had noted too, that in all the work the Minister is doing on such issues as admissions policies there may be crossover here. Deputy Jim Daly mentioned in his overview that it would take it in. One issue I have come across quite often is the question of the local school's admissions policy or frustrated parents whose children did not gain admission and feel they are meeting a road block. Those are parents, not parents of children with special needs or anything like that. Often it could be a geographical issue. What kind of crossover here is there with what the Minister has planned? That is a big area for the Minister currently. It is a minefield. What role would the Minister envisage an Ombudsman having in that? As for issues where someone has done something wrong in a school or where a parent perceives that the school has done something wrong or failed to do something it should have done, or where people feel a staff member or management through a decision acted unfairly, that absolutely needs to be addressed. I do not know whether Deputy Jim Daly envisages an ombudsman covering the kind of services a school offers. What role is there for an ombudsman if a parent chooses recourse because the school is not offering a particular facility, service, course or subject? Is that a role for the ombudsman? This could get bigger and bigger. That is what is going through my head. That is not a political point; it is merely a reasonable point I am making to Deputy Jim Daly. Some of the grounds of complaints in different jurisdictions relate to whether a decision taken was unreasonable or unjust and whether it was contrary to law. What we do not want is considerable crossover and confusion. In my view, it would be a kind of one-stop-shop that deals with issues that merely are not being addressed currently. What one does not want is an ombudsman dealing with thousands of petty grievances. While the Ombudsman for Children may say that thousands of its complaints relate to education or children in education, we have no idea of the substance of those complaints. I agree with Deputy Jim Daly about the existing ombudsmen in a variety of fields. As Deputy Carol Nolan said, it might be worth looking at whether any of the existing ombudsmen can take on some of these functions, whether those functions can be shared or whether an ombudsman for education would absorb some of the educational functions of the existing ombudsmen. I do not know whether Deputy Jim Daly has considered that. I have some questions to conclude. There is very definitely a need for an appeals mechanism, as has been correctly identified by the Deputy. This is his legislative attempt to overcome that. It is a very valuable service and people will welcome it. There is the issue of how we go from here. Is this meant to serve teachers as well or is it just aimed at parents? There are teachers who have found themselves over the years in particular circumstances in schools and who may have felt frustrated or aggrieved. Their unions or associations may have taken the case and they may have still felt frustrated. These are some of the questions. Is it just about the rights of parents and children or will teachers come into this as well? If it is the latter, the autumn will be interesting as the Deputy will certainly have attracted the attention of teachers, management and administrative structures, as well as trade unions, teacher organisations and diocesan authorities throughout the country. I am sure they will be sitting up. The Department will have a strong view because for years it has been able to deflect queries and complaints back to the patron or the boards of management, meaning it has been a very frustrating experience for parents. I am delighted Deputy Jim Daly has raised the issue and there are many questions for him to consider over the recess. Like my colleague, I look forward to seeing this on Committee Stage. I thank him for bringing it forward.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23139	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	323	I congratulate and thank Deputy Jim Daly for bringing the Bill forward, as I know the issue is something he has persisted with over a long period, drawing on his own experience. I will support the Bill, although that is not to say it is perfect in all respects. It needs the sort of discussion that Deputy Thomas Byrne and others spoke about. At the centre of our programme for Government we are trying to make life a bit easier for people in every walk of life and particularly the education system. There is no doubt that citizens have higher expectations than they had before and we in the political and public service system must move to respond to those expectations. One of those is that where there are legitimate grievances, they get an outlet and there is a port of call where the grievances may be aired and dealt with. It is a very important principle that Deputy Daly's Bill enshrines. In response to some of the points from Deputies Byrne, Nolan and Lahart, we do not want to pretend we can shift to an ombudsman the proper role of schools and boards. We are very keen that we move to have a proper parents' charter, where the expectation of parents from the education system is clearly set out, meaning that in 99% of cases, grievances will be managed within a school on the good principle of subsidiarity and dealing with a case at a proper level. As Deputy Daly noted, I am aware that such a system will only work and be robust if at the end of the day there is recourse to appeal to some other higher authority where an issue may be teased out. Like Deputy Lahart, I recognise the voluntary nature of boards, although they play a very important role in our most valuable asset, as Deputy Daly noted. It is important that their commitment is underpinned by the sort of professionalism that accountability offers. That is important in this Bill. Deputy Nolan argued that we should - and we will - seek in parallel with Deputy Daly's Bill to furnish the proper procedures in section 28 that have been dormant, as noted by Deputy Byrne. We will bring forward a parents' charter in a legislative head that will go to the committee at the same time as it will consider the ombudsman issue. We will see what principles we expect a school to operate with respect to a parents' charter. The principles will include elements of information, respect, dealing with grievances and so on. Guidelines will be provided by the Minister for Education and Skills and there will be powers for the Minister in cases where a charter has not been put in place. In reference to what Deputy Daly is providing, there will be recourse, where the charter is not respected, and one will be able to go to an ombudsman. It is an important principle we should seek to enshrine that is complementary to Deputy Daly's Bill. As Deputy Byrne noted, a sort of vacuum was left in that the provision was dormant and was never properly dealt with. I intend to go to Government as soon as we return and be in a position when the committee considers this to furnish it with the heads for a provision dealing with the matter. Deputy Nolan is right that we must look again at the notion of making this legally binding, taking in compellability. Deputy Daly acknowledged that in his contribution. The power of an ombudsman over the years has come from an authority rather than a directive power or recourse to the District Court to enforce a power. That would be a very significant change of direction from what we conceive as an ombudsman, so we need to consider such a provision very closely on Committee Stage. One of the powers of an ombudsman service is they are independently appointed, with a constitutional independence. Their accountability is not to a Minister but to the Dáil. It is a very important element of what an ombudsman is, giving a strength that no agency under the control of the Minister would have. It is a valuable and powerful authority. As Deputy Daly acknowledged, only in one case has a body failed to acknowledge and respond to an ombudsman. There is an issue that has been correctly raised as to whether there should be a Children's Ombudsman and an ombudsman for education, or whether they should be separate institutions. It is something we will have to examine. I have come from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, where we set up a Workplace Relations Commission. Adjudicators there hear cases, sometimes under the equality pillar of the legislation and sometimes under the employment rights pillar. They are different but there are no problems. The same service of adjudication may occur in each section. There is potential to establish an education ombudsman but have it administered by the same personage as the children's Ombudsman. There can be a separate provision. Deputy Daly is accurate in saying that in a considerable number of cases that go to the children's Ombudsman coming from the education sphere, there are three barriers of proving adverse effect, showing inappropriate administration and the issue being solely related to administrative purposes. They can prevent some cases being heard. If we can furnish on Committee Stage a route to an ombudsman that is not hampered in such a way, we could see the cases that concern Deputy Daly reaching a satisfactory resolution with this legislation. This does not deal with third-level education and it does not purport to do so. Section 28 concerns schools and third-level issues are not addressed in the Bill. I do not propose that we seek to address them on Committee Stage as they raise a different set of legislative principles. We are dealing with the Education Act 1998. Deputy Micheál Martin steered it through and I was on the Opposition benches at the time, so I remember it well. I am conscious of the time. It is important to consider the scope of the Bill and Deputy Lahart asked if it will deal with teachers.The ordinary Ombudsman does not deal with public servants and the many grievances they might have with their employer. It is not intended to be that sort of provision and I do not think we are seeking to break into ground of that nature.  It is also important to note, as Deputy Jim Daly has made clear, that this is about ensuring that schools and boards deal with complaints in a proper way. It does not mean that the ombudsman tries the substance of the complaint. However, he or she must seek assurance that the complaint has been dealt with in a proper way and in accordance with the circulars, directions or policy framework of the day. It is not for the ombudsman to reinvent a policy framework but to ensure that parents or their children are properly heard in respect of their complaints. It is important to understand the limitations. This is not moving into the territory of directing a Minister to provide more resources in X or Y areas; that is not the remit of an ombudsman. It is important that we understand that difference.  This is valuable legislation. Deputy Jim Daly has established clearly that there is a large body of complaints in this area, with some 47% of the cases going to the Ombudsman for Children relating to education, and there is a level of dissatisfaction with how such complaints can be dealt with currently.  We have scope in this Bill to complement the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which will be dealing with a particular part of what parents can expect from a school but not the whole. That is what Deputy Daly is trying to broaden. The admissions policy will have directive power in respect of certain elements of admissions and we will debate that on Committee Stage in due course.  I am pleased to support the Bill. I hope Deputy Carol Nolan, who has raised legitimate concerns, will see that we can deal with some of the weaknesses about which she is rightly concerned on Committee Stage. Deputy Daly has acknowledged that the Bill may need modification. I hope that together we can create legislation that will be effective and helpful and that will improve the capacity of parents and children to get the best from the education system while providing the highly professional and committed people within our education system with the knowledge that there is the underpinning, accountability and assurance that access to an ombudsman will give our education services.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-07-21 00:00:00	European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training: Motion	324	I thank all the Deputies who have contributed constructively to the debate. It was a very interesting - Deputy John Lahart used the word "provocative" - debate and it certainly is so on a number of levels. These issues are not the easiest to deal with. We all probably agree what are the problems but we need to identify how we can solve them and put forward a solution. This Bill was before the last Oireachtas education committee. We had good debate on it and there was cross-party support on that occasion for the concept of an ombudsman for education. Notwithstanding that, Deputy Carol Nolan has rightly identified some issues and I referred to some of them myself in my initial contribution. While it is provided for in the Bill, there is an issue with the compellability aspect and the involvement of the courts. I absolutely accept that to be so and look forward to dealing with it on Committee Stage. I would be happy to delete the compellability element, which is not necessary. I take on board Deputy Nolan's concern in that regard.  Perhaps I am referring to these matters in mixed order, but Deputy Lahart asked if this was meant to serve teachers as well. Ideally, it would. This is about procedures. I would not see the ombudsman being judge and jury in all complaints. For example, if I were to say Ms McCarthy is not a good teacher and not teaching my son John well enough, is the ombudsman to come in and review her teaching standards and make judgment? Absolutely not. Does the ombudsman examine how my complaint was dealt with if I went to the principal and said Ms McCarthy is not teaching my son well? The principal should tell me that I am to refer my complaint to the Teaching Council under the current legislation. Perhaps the principal just tells me that Ms McCarthy is a great teacher and to go away and not be annoying him. The ombudsman would examine the procedures followed as opposed to dealing with the substantive complaint. Could the teacher avail of the service? I see no reason why not. This is not a case of teachers versus students. A teacher could be a victim of bullying in the school and go to the board of management, say he or she is being bullied, only for the board of management to do nothing about it. I see no reason teachers could not have the procedures that were followed examined, but the ombudsman would not get involved in the substantive issue. I hope that brings clarity to the Deputy's question. We can get lost in the terminology used. We float things like "section 28" and "Part 5", but parents who are struggling daily with the pressures of life do not have time to understand the admissions Bill and what it does or anything like that. This is why I consider an education ombudsman an attractive proposition. It would be a one-stop shop for parents. They would get competent and efficient advice steeped in the education aspect of the law. The education sphere is huge, which is why I believe there should be an ombudsman dealing solely with the area. How many children are attending school on any one day in Ireland? They all have parents and grandparents. The education sector has a huge impact on and reach in society and it is high time we acknowledged that fact.  I endorse what was said about boards of management being voluntary and the good work they do. There was a question about where the role of the ombudsman would end. I have addressed that already. The role deals with procedures - that is the beginning, middle and end of it - and not the substantive element of complaints.  Is there crossover with the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill and the charter? The charter is an aspiration. We all aspire to parents having a say in their children's education. The admissions Bill sets out how things should be done. In the event that someone has a grievance with how it is done, that is where the ombudsman would come in. The ombudsman would be an enforcer that provides oversight. It would provide oversight - it would not be an enforcer - of all these aspirations laid down in various charters. Circulars, for example, are often issued by the Department. They are just advisory. If a principal chooses to ignore a circular, one can go to the board of management, but it can say, "Sorry, there is nothing here. Move on." If the person goes to the Department, it will say it has no role in the matter, that it cannot get involved and that it is a matter for the board of management. I want an ombudsman that can ensure circulars are being adhered to.  Would it discourage volunteerism? That is a worry, but many would be happier to go on a board knowing it is not steeped in what can be a clandestine arrangement, that is, that it is being kept in-house. I do not think people would have an issue with accountability, openness and transparency. Many parents would love to be more involved in the education of their children and much happier to give time on boards but do not get the chance. A parent complained to me recently that he has never been notified of the election of parents to the board of management. The principal tells someone to go on and stay on it. This is perhaps a one-off, isolated case. I am not suggesting it is widespread, but it is an issue. Many parents would love to be contributing what skills and time they have to the better education of their children and a more robust board of management would be more attractive to them. I hope this Bill would not discourage people from volunteering to be on the boards.  An interesting point was made about education and training boards, ETBs, formerly vocational education committees. I would hope someone from Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, would make a presentation to the committee. The ETBs have a much more robust appeals system and are much more transparent. Deputy Lahart made a good point about public representatives being on their boards. I was on the Cork county VEC board for long enough and learned much. They have a system I would aspire to see being transposed into other systems. I would look forward to a delegation from ETBI attending our committee and giving us some of their knowledge of operating boards and dealing with complaints and grievances, etc. I agree with the concept of having a more democratic model of governance.  Deputy Nolan raised the legally-binding aspect. I have addressed it already. It is not my intention that this would ever be legally binding. As I stated initially, and the Minister referred to it as well, the Ombudsman has said that his advice has only once been ignored. I am happy to have the provision removed on Committee Stage. I certainly do not want to be entering into the legal domain. I saw in The Irish Times today that the Ombudsman for Children commented that he would see this as leading to increased legal fees and so on. I would not accept such a situation and will remove the provision from the Bill if there was any issue in that regard.  Deputy Nolan stated there was no such office in Europe. We have a different model of education in this country and a historical model of governance. Why should Ireland not be a first? That it is not happening somewhere else in Europe is all the more reason for us to be leaders as opposed to followers in the area. Deputy Nolan also spoke about widening the remit of the Ombudsman for Children. I addressed that in my initial contribution. My first port of call in the last Dáil was to widen the remit of the Ombudsman for Children and I published legislation to that effect but it was not accepted by the Ombudsman for Children or the Government at the time.I do not know where that Bill went. I guess it went to wherever these Bills go to die. That was my starting point but I do not think that is the solution any more. We have to look at an educationally-driven ombudsman. We spent €2.1 billion on special needs education and €2.1 billion on policing, the latter for oversight in the form of the Garda Inspectorate and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, but we do not have the same oversight for our education sector on which we have spent a total of €8 billion. I would not envisage that third level would be part of this but an ombudsman for schools would be fair. It is more than that, and I spoke earlier about the wider issues in education. It has been a very useful debate and I have listened and learned. I thank all Members for their contributions. We will have a big job of work in the committee to tease out the finer detail. We will have hearings first and then go onto Committee Stage, line by line. I hope the hearings will start in the first week of October. The education committee met today and decided we would bring in various people, including the Ombudsman for Children and anybody else who has issues to be addressed. This is a partnership approach. Everybody in the committee was in agreement and that is the way I hope we can continue.

Those people who understand politics know how exhausted Members are at present. It has been an extremely difficult and demanding year so I hope Members avail of the opportunity over the summer for some downtime and some family time because it is richly deserved. I also thank Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General, and all the staff of the Houses for their superb support. I include in that our Superintendent, Paul Conway, and senior usher, Colm O'Rourke, because we have to be conscious of the huge hours and dedication they have shown in the service of the Houses over the past year.
