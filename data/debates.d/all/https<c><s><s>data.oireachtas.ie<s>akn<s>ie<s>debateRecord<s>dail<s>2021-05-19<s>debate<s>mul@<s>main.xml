            <p eId="para_4">I thank the Minister of State for his attendance. This story is not finished but the catchcry of "Are we there yet?" is one that is very well known to Irish people. Bóthar would be perceived as one of the more earthy charities. It is one to which I have contributed myself over the years because there was always a tangible output, or at least that was the perception. Instead of just sending money, there was a tangible result from the contributions the public made, namely, the charitable contribution of live animals and other agricultural produce and materials to developing countries. The premise on which the charity was founded, and on which it succeeded and caught the public's imagination, is that Irish people could finance the sending of a cow, a sheep or a goat and that it would make a manifest difference and impact on the lives of local communities in developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> We have been here before with charities like Console. We thought that that was the end of it, that corruption within the charitable sector was over and would never again be tolerated, that it would be much easier to root out and that charities would be subject to much more intensive interrogation, oversight and regulation. However, we find ourselves back at the same point again, not due to the corporate outlook or objectives of an organisation but because of the greed of a few. The Government must give some response to try to reassure the public. As we know, it is often those with the least who give most and over the years people have donated small, or sometimes significant, amounts to such charities. They did so with the best will in the world, as part of an ethos in this country that goes back to our connection to suffering and hardship and our empathy for those who have to endure the same kind of suffering and hardship. It is a crushing blow to people to discover that when they made that gesture and gave to people in countries less developed and less well off than our own, the organisation mediating those funds had within it corrupt and greedy people who would go to great lengths to corrupt the funds, and to cover their tracks in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> The issue itself has been well publicised in the newspapers, including the secreting away of significant funds by members of Bóthar and the payment of bonuses to staff. I would like to know what contributions the State made to this charity, whether through the Minister of State's Department or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, over the years. I look forward to his statement on the matter.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development (Deputy Joe O'Brien)<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T09:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter. The Charities Regulator, under the aegis of my Department, is the State organisation responsible for registering and regulating all of Ireland's charities, with a mandate to promote good governance practices. It is important to note that the regulator is fully independent in the performance of its statutory functions, including investigations into the activities and conduct of charities. All registered charities in Ireland and their trustees are subject to the provisions of the Charities Act 2009. This Act sets out comprehensive legal obligations surrounding the definition of charities and their operations and reporting requirements. Concerns relating to charities may be raised with the regulator and I am assured by it that all such concerns are addressed. Members of the public can also search the Register of Charities to obtain information on registered charities.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">Where breaches of charity legislation are identified, the charity is contacted with a view to addressing such breaches. In serious cases, the regulator may appoint investigators to carry out a statutory investigation, as happened in the case of Bóthar.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> The Charities Regulator has been engaging with Bóthar since early 2020 on foot of concerns which were raised about the charity. In October 2020, the regulator determined that a statutory investigation into the charity was warranted and appointed inspectors to commence this investigation. It is important to note that the commencement of such an investigation is not a finding of wrongdoing. As the Deputy may be aware, however, a criminal investigation is now under way into activities at Bóthar.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> At the request of An Garda Síochána, the Charity Regulator's statutory investigation into the affairs of Bóthar has been temporarily paused until such time as the criminal investigation is complete, at which time the regulator's investigation will resume.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> It would not be appropriate for me, the regulator or my Department to comment further on what is an ongoing criminal investigation. I remind the Deputy that the programme for Government includes a commitment to update legislative provisions with the Charities Regulator to ensure it has the necessary powers to increase trust and confidence in the management and administration of charities.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> There is ongoing liaison between officials in my Department and the Charities Regulator to review the operation of the legislation to ensure that it is operating effectively, and to consider amendments to the Charities Act 2009. This work is at an advanced stage and it is intended to bring proposals to Government in the very near future to progress the legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">The Minister of State's response was fairly general. I understand the circumstances in which it perhaps might be general. Can he comment on whether this particular charity is engaging in fundraising activities at the moment? That is the first point. Has it been engaging in fundraising activities since the launch of the investigation?</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> The Minister of State said the Charities Regulator had been engaging with Bóthar since early 2020 on foot of concerns raised about the charity. Can he explain what engagement means? What is the difference between engagement and investigation by the Charities Regulator? What powers does the Charities Regulator have with regard to this engagement?</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> Does that charity continue to fundraise? Is the Minister of State aware of any State grants or State funding that has gone to Bóthar? I am making an assumption that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would be involved but I could be wrong. I am just making the connection because livestock are involved but I refer to any Department. Has any funding continued since the Charities Regulator began to engage with Bóthar in 2020? Has the Minister of State's Department provided any funding to that charity since engagement with the Charities Regulator began in 2020?</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> Can the Minister of State give us a little bit more granular detail? There is an awful lot more in the press and in the public domain than was contained in his statement this morning. The statement was quite disappointing given the extensive coverage in the print media over the last three or four months, and particularly in the last few weeks because of particular circumstances. There is significantly more detail in the national media than what was presented in the Minister of State's statement, which was disappointing. That is not a comment on him but on the information he has been given despite what is available to the public through the media. Responsible broadsheet print media have covered this extensively.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">My statement is defined by the fact that there is a criminal investigation. I am obviously limited in terms of the detail I can give. Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2009, however, the Charities Regulator works closely with other regulatory bodies and organisations to uphold the integrity of charitable organisations and trusts.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> In late 2018, the Charities Regulator introduced the charities governance code, which sets out the minimum standards that charity trustees should ensure are met within their charities to manage and control effectively their operations. This includes core standards pertaining to the responsible management of a charity's resources and principles of accountability and transparency.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> From 2020, the charities governance code became mandatory for charities, and as of 2021 charities will be expected to report directly to the Charities Regulator on their compliance with the code. This is an important step forward in strengthening governance in the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> In addition, work is ongoing in my Department on amendments to the 2009 Act. As I mentioned earlier, this is at an advanced stage. It is vital that these developments take place with the input and co-operation of the charities sector. My Department and the regulator continue to work together in this regard to improve public trust in the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> I can confirm that the Department of Rural and Community Development has not funded Bóthar in the past. I will also say that in this instance, the system worked. A report was made and the Charities Regulator started to investigate. Informal investigations were then launched, which has brought us to this stage. Much of what is essentially white-collar crime can be difficult to detect and, as with much other crime, we are dependent on the public to assist the Garda in detecting instances like this. In this case, however, the system worked and the regulator did its job, notwithstanding the accounts we are hearing in the media at the moment.</p>

            <p eId="para_22">I have raised this issue many times. I basically seek the Government to put in place a waiver for families with disabilities or where there are long-term illnesses, for example, where incontinence pads or pull-ups are required in the case of children or young adults, so that the cost of refuse is defrayed or reduced. This would be by virtue of the introduction of a national waiver, which would be sanctioned by Government and would provide a measure of financial alleviation for many hard-pressed families, in particular working families with children with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> I raised this issue, about which I feel very strongly, on a number of occasions with three Ministers. What is of little cost to the Exchequer could have a massive impact on the annual expenses of families who rely on incontinence pads or where there are significant medical issues, particularly families with children who have a requirement, either in childhood or young adulthood and onwards, for pull-ups or other such mechanisms or measures that are necessary in dealing with their particular conditions or illnesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Ministers, including the Minister, Deputy Ryan, have told me that there is, in essence, a price monitoring group. He said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_25">In an effort to see how best to support persons with long-term incontinence with respect to the disposal of medical incontinence wear</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_26">[...]</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_27">... [His] Department ... [had] been examining this issue in detail for some time and has engaged with relevant stakeholders, including representative organisations and the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> I merely wish to know whether the Government is giving active consideration to this. In anticipation of the Minister of State's response, I would say please do not come back to me with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, response or the sensitive medical data response. The Minister of State has responsibility for that area. It has been thrown up as a red herring in respect of not dealing with this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> One cannot expect a family to dispose of this type of matter through recycling or through the compost bin. That is self-evident. It must be done through residual waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> In parts of the country with a weight-based system, bills are as high as €400. I have seen examples of €400, €500 and €600 per annum. It is a significant cost. For what would be a small, barely measurable dent in Exchequer funding, this could have a massive impact for families, and it can be done. People yield up sensitive medical information to the Department of Social Protection when applying for an invalidity pension, a disability allowance or an illness benefit. A similar scheme could be devised for these families where sensitive medical data could be yielded up in a safe, responsible and secure way.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">It would have a massive impact on thousands of families throughout the State who are bearing a massive financial burden.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_32">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I am answering this matter because the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, recently delegated authority over waste policy and the circular economy to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> I appreciate that the Deputy has had a long series of engagements on this issue and that it is not yet resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> The waste management market in Ireland is serviced by private companies on a side-by-side competition basis. Prices in the market are matters between those companies and their customers subject to compliance with all applicable legislation, including contract and consumer legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, published A Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy in September of last year. The plan includes more than 200 measures and will shift the focus away from waste disposal and looks instead to how we can preserve resources by creating a circular economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> In June 2017, the Government decided to phase out flat-fee or flat-rate charges for residual kerbside household waste collection to deliver on national policy and to ensure that Ireland meets current and future waste targets as well as to ease the pressure being placed on our capacity to manage residual municipal waste. The Government decision also envisaged "the provision of a financial support to persons with lifelong/long-term medical incontinence to help meet the cost of disposal of medical incontinence wear".</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> Since mid-2017, a range of charging options have operated, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste. This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Mandatory per-kilogramme pay-by-weight charging was not introduced. A price monitoring group, PMG, was established in mid-2017 to monitor the ongoing cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the flat-rate structure was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend has been relative price stability. Results from the PMG are available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> Since the 2017 decision to phase out flat-rate fees, the Department has examined a number of proposals to deliver the proposed support for incontinence waste, including through detailed engagement with the HSE, Department of Social Protection, National Waste Collection Permit Office, Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and relevant non-governmental organisations in an effort to find a workable scheme for the delivery of such a support. Unfortunately, these efforts have not been successful to date, including due to the absence of a list of persons who are in receipt of free medical incontinence wear from the HSE. However, general data protection regulation, GDPR, issues arising, including consent and the principle of data minimisation, and procurement issues and administrative costs if a private third party were to deliver the support on behalf of my Department, were also contributing factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> My officials are continuing to review these efforts to establish what further actions, if any, can be taken pending the availability of the list of recipients of free medical incontinence wear from the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> It should be noted that there has never been a national waiver scheme for household waste collection. During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual local authorities offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria. As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators that took on the local authorities' customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for only a limited time.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste. Waste collection is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the range of services and fees offered vary among providers and across the country. In that regard, it is apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">The Minister of State said there was a Government decision envisaging "the provision of a financial support to persons with lifelong/long-term medical incontinence to help meet the cost of disposal of medical incontinence wear". What he has told us is that they have no intention of doing this. Minister after Minister has been talking around and telling me the same thing for nearly four years.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> We either look after vulnerable people in this society or we do not. On the suggestion to families that this is a market solution and that they should go to their local provider, I can tell the Minister of State that I have heard from a family with two children - their parents are John and Neasa - a five-year-old and a 15-year-old, both on pull-ups. Their cost is €400 per year. A working family with a mortgage trying to do their best, they know that they will have to deal with this as a long-term issue for their children. They went to their local provider but the market will not sort them out because their local provider, which is a significant collector of waste in the north Cork area and provides an excellent service, has said that this is a matter for Government. There is a Government decision on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> I was hopeful, dare I say it, that a Green Minister with responsibility for this would come to me with an answer that would at least see some progression of the issue. I ask the Minister of State not to throw the market issue or the price monitoring group at us and to bring in all the providers and get it done if at all possible. So many families throughout the country would be so grateful that some Government finally would have dealt significantly with this issue. For a small cost to the Exchequer, it would be so meaningful for so many families.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">The Deputy is correct that there is a Government decision from 2017. I am restating that. It is a problem that needs to be solved.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> My Department has been examining this issue in detail for some time and has engaged with relevant stakeholders, including representative organisations and the HSE, in an effort to see how best to support persons with long-term incontinence with respect to the disposal of medical incontinence wear. However, there are complex issues at play in this area which are understandable given the sensitive nature of the medical data in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> The delays in establishing a suitable scheme are primarily due to the absence of a list of persons who are in receipt of free medical incontinence wear from the HSE. However, GDPR issues arising such as consent and the principle of data minimisation, and procurement issues and administrative costs are also contributing factors. One can see that there is a concern if we are asking the HSE to provide a list of people with long-term incontinence problems to waste providers. It is not an insurmountable problem but there is a genuine issue there.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> My officials are continuing to review these efforts to establish what further actions can be taken. These efforts will continue, focusing particularly on pricing trends. Since mid-2017, a range of charging options have operated, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste. This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop different offerings that suit different households. Mandatory pay-by-weight charging was not introduced. A PMG was established in mid-2017 to monitor the ongoing cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the flat-rate structure was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service have been observed, the overall trend has been relative stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> In September, I launched a new national waste policy for the period 2020 to 2025, A Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy. This plan contains a range of measures to empower households to enhance consumer protection requirements. It also envisages an enhanced monitoring of the market to ensure that no changes occur in relative price stability.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">There is a grave injustice being done to the 149 pupils who attend Knockmore Junior School in Killinarden and a similar injustice being done to 91 other schools and the children who go there. These are schools that applied for the hot school meal programme because they need it and they lost out on the basis of a lottery. It is completely unfair.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> There is plenty of academic evidence, not that we really need it, to show the importance of good nutrition and the difference that it makes in the education children get, how attentive they are in class and how healthy they are.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> These 149 students, as it stands, will lose out when many of their brothers and sisters who are slightly older and going to other primary schools in the area would be able to access it. Faith told Kitty Holland from <i>The Irish Times</i>:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_53">I have a big sister and she will be getting hot lunches. It's just not fair.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">It is also not fair on the parents in those situations. I am seeking a commitment from the Minister of State today that Knockmore Junior School will be given access to hot school lunches.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> I would also make the broader point that this is not just about Knockmore Junior School but about the 91 other unsuccessful schools, all the DEIS schools and, potentially, all the schools in the country. Why on earth should some children not get what they need because of a lottery? We are not talking about a lot of money in the greater scheme of things. It costs €370 per child who accesses this scheme. Does the Minister of State agree that the scheme should be rolled out initially to all DEIS schools and then expanded out from there?</p>

          <speech by="#BridSmith" eId="spk_12">
            <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_56">I have a question about Mary Queen of Angels Schools 1 and 2 in Ballyfermot, which share the same campus. Both applied for the hot meals scheme. One school was successful but the other was not. The fear of the boards of management and the principals is that there will be a preference among parents to enrol their children in the school that provides the hot meals and that the other school will be left behind.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> I concur with the points made by Deputy Murphy about the inequality of the system and the unfairness of running hot meals on a lottery rather than on where they are needed. That must be questioned in the wider scheme of things in terms of the need for this programme. The Minister for Social Protection, in her response to my parliamentary questions, acknowledges that this is a good thing. As has been said, proper nutrition, particularly for younger children, is hugely important. There is a problem with obesity in children throughout the country but particularly in areas of low income and disadvantage. Rolling out a proper hot meals school programme is not radical but is really just catching up with where the rest of Europe has been for many decades. Hot meals are given out in schools in Britain and there is no question of a lottery. In fact, there is not a question of it not happening and the same is true in France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Finland, Lithuania, Slovakia and Cyprus, to name but a few. This has been normal practice in Europe where if one works in a large factory, one expects to have a decent canteen and when one goes to school, one also expects to have a decent canteen providing hot meals. Telling us that providing cold meals is good enough is unacceptable. I was getting sandwiches and milk in school when I was a kid and that is a long time ago. We need to move on and provide hot meals to all children.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection (Deputy Joe O'Brien)<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_58">I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,506 schools and organisations benefiting 230,000 children. The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children to enable them to take full advantage of the education provided to them. The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> The Government has provided €65 million for the school meals programme this year. As part of budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019 providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of €1 million for 2019 and €2.5 million in 2020. The pilot involves 37 schools benefiting 6,744 students for the 2019-20 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no on-site cooking facilities. The extension of the hot school meals programme was a priority for the Minister and me and as part of budget 2021 we announced that an additional €5.5 million would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children who were, at the time, in receipt of the cold lunch option. That represents a sixfold increase in the number of pupils receiving hot school meals.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> The Department issued invitations for expressions of interest to 705 primary schools in November 2020 and a total of 281 expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,000 children. The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area, based on the number of children applied for by local authority area as a percentage of the total number. A minimum of one school for each local authority area was selected. As a result of this process, 189 of the 281 schools that submitted an expression of interest were selected.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> The Minister and I are absolutely committed to continuing to grow the hot school meals element and building further on the significant extension announced as part of the recent budget. I have spoken to the Minister and know she is actively working to find a solution so that it is possible to include those schools that were unsuccessful in a hot school meals programme this year. The Minister and I are absolutely committed to the school meals programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> It is important to mention that over the course of the pandemic, the Minister has continued to support schools and children with the continued availability of school meals. In addition to the provision of meals during the school term, the Minister also extended the funding so that meals could be provided during the summer period last year, as well as during Christmas, Easter and other periods of school closure. I assure Deputies that everything is being done to ensure that we can support as many schools as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> Again, I thank Deputies for raising this important matter. I have a particular interest in this issue as I oversee the roadmap for social inclusion. We recently decided to establish a working group on food poverty. That working group will meet soon and hot school meals will certainly be on its agenda. On the question of the lottery, demand outstripped the budget allocation for the programme. Unfortunately, the best way that we could find for allocating limited resources was a lottery system, which I accept is inadequate. We need to meet the demand that exists for the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">To start with the point about the lottery system, it is good that the Minister of State recognises that it is inadequate. Frankly, it is sick that in 2021 pupils are relying on a lottery to determine whether they get a hot meal in school. Either the programme is necessary, which the evidence suggests is clearly the case, or it is not but it is not acceptable in this day and age that students would be relying on winning a lottery.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> A lot of the Minister of State's answer is the same as the answer that has been given for the last couple of months. The new element is the fact that the Minister is working to see if it will be possible to include the schools that were unsuccessful in the hot school meals programme this year. I hope that is translated into a solution for Knockmore Junior School and the other schools that missed out. If it is not, I have no doubt that the principal, pupils and the parents, who have done a great job of speaking out and campaigning, will continue their campaign until the hot school meal programme is provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">I accept the Minister of State's bona fides in terms of this being an important issue about which he feels passionate. The more improvements we can make to the programme, the better. The anomalies must be addressed, however, particularly the situation where one campus is shared by two schools in Ballyfermot, Mary Queen of Angels, and one school gets the hot meals while the other does not. That creates tensions, divisions and problems, particularly as some members of the same family are getting fed in school while others are not.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> In reply to my parliamentary question, the Minister says that the objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to the lack of good-quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them. I would argue that the provision of nutritious, regular and good-quality food to children should not just apply to those who are unable to be fed at home. It should be standard practice to provide for everybody. If that were the case, the question of a lottery and of inequality in the delivery of such provision would not arise. As I said earlier, we would just be catching up with the rest of Europe.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe O'Brien<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_68">I appreciate the disappointment and frustration for the 92 schools that submitted an expression of interest in accessing the hot school meals programme and were not selected, including the schools referred to by Deputies Murphy and Smith. The level of demand for the programme is a clear sign of the need for its expansion and that is something to which the Minister and I are committed. Since the start of the pandemic we have worked with our colleagues in the Government to ensure that funding continued to be provided for the school meals programme, including when schools were closed over the holiday periods. We remain committed to extending the provision of hot school meals and building on what has been achieved to date. As I have already said, the Minister is actively exploring options for the possible inclusion of schools that were unsuccessful in their applications in the hot school meals programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> Specifically on the Mary Queen of the Angels schools, the two schools have separate roll numbers so the Department identified them as separate entities. This partially explains why one was chosen and the other was not.</p>
            <p eId="para_70">I go back to the fact that the programme was piloted in 2019 and it worked well. It was difficult to read the demand because of Covid but it was clear the demand was there. It was increased fivefold and we are committed to expanding the programme so we do not have these situations where there are schools that clearly want it and need it but cannot access it. We want to rectify that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas Gould<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_71">There are approximately 92,712 vacant homes throughout the State. This does not include homes on the derelict sites register. This is a shocking statistic and it is clearly a very serious problem. The Government has committed to tackling vacant homes, as did its predecessor. Yet, there are only three full-time vacant homes officers across the entire State. This is nothing short of scandalous. How can the Minister of State stand over this?</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> When I asked how a part-time vacant homes officer is meant to tackle this issue in somewhere like Cork city, where there are 8,880 vacant homes, he told me that staffing is an issue for the local authority. That is all very well and good except that these officers are there under a Government initiative. The councils did not establish the role of vacant homes officers. They did not establish the buy and renew or repair and lease schemes. They did not welcome vulture funds into this State with open arms like the Government and its best friends in Fine Gael did. It is, therefore, not a council issue; it is a Government issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> The Government has missed by 70% the targets set under the vacant homes scheme. A promise was made that 5,600 homes would be returned. However, not even 1,700 were returned. The Minister of State came into this role full of bluster and guff that he was going to achieve things, but he has not delivered. These vacant homes are still lying idle. These vacant homes should be filled with young families and people instead of lying idle right across the State. The Minister of State is nearly a year into the job and he is jumping from blunder to blunder, having torn apart the hopes and dreams of young families across the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> With almost 9,000 vacant homes in Cork city, we could nearly clear the social housing waiting lists by getting young families and their children into these homes. Instead, we must tell these young families that their children will be teenagers before the family can have a home of their own. How is this acceptable?</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> Currently, these vacant houses are magnets for antisocial behaviour, dumping, vermin and gangs. They are an eyesore and can cause problems in their communities. Instead of dreaming about owning their own homes and fixing them up, what can people in the constituency I represent dream about under this Government? An affordable home costing €400,000. The Minister has promised houses priced between €160,000 and €250,000. He said that people should not pay more than 35% of their income on their mortgage. Somehow, somewhere along the line the Minister and the Minister of State seemed to realise where their priorities lay. These priorities did not lie with the ordinary people of Cork North-Central who are locked out of the housing market.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> I put the simple question to the Minister of State: does he want to solve the housing crisis? Yes or no? I do not believe that he does. If the Government wanted to solve the crisis, it would fund local authorities to have full-time vacant homes officers in place to deliver the 92,000 homes that are there, so families and people can get the homes they need.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_77">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the position of vacant homes officers in our local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> The national vacant housing reuse strategy was published by my Department in 2018 and since then my Department has provided funding to each local authority of €50,000 per annum. This funding is to support the work of a vacant homes office, including a vacant homes officer, for each local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> It is important to say that the allocation of staff within a local authority is an executive matter for the chief executive of that local authority. Each of the 31 local authorities has a vacant homes office, but currently only three local authorities have one person working in a full-time capacity as a vacant homes officer. In the remaining 28 local authorities the officer appointed as a vacant homes officer carries out additional duties in their planning and housing divisions. In some authorities, more than one part-time officer carries out the duties of the vacant homes officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> In some local authorities, with restrictions that were imposed due to Covid-19, vacant homes officers were not in a position to carry out all the duties that would normally be assigned to them. For example, travel around a local authority area to carry out inspections of vacant properties has not always been possible. As a result, some of the vacant homes officers were assigned alternative duties within the councils that they were able to carry out while the restrictions were in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> The activities of vacant homes officers are comprehensive with their main focus being bringing vacant properties back into use throughout the country. The vacant homes officers provide assistance to property owners on how best to utilise available supports such as the repair and lease, buy and renew and long-term leasing schemes. The role and range of duties of the vacant homes office and officers within each local authority includes, but is not limited to, tasks that support the implementation of local authority vacant homes action plans; undertaking initial vacancy assessment exercises and drilling into available CSO and GeoDirectory data; carrying out or co-ordinating visual inspections and assessments of residential properties in their administrative area; identifying and contacting the registered owners of the properties deemed to be vacant from inspection; serving as a contact point for dissemination of advice, assistance and information on residential vacancy to members of the public, including landlords; and the collation and timely provision of vacant homes data to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> Each of the 31 local authorities has prepared a vacant homes action plan for its administrative area. The vacant homes action plan identifies the scale of vacant homes in their jurisdiction and sets ambitious but realistic targets for the number of vacant homes that can ultimately be brought back into use. To support this work, my Department has facilitated a number of seminars to allow the network of vacant homes officers meet with relevant departmental officials, ensuring that information on reactivating vacant homes into liveable housing stock is made available to both the Department and to all vacant homes officers in the 31 local authorities</p>

            <p eId="para_87">There are 31 local authorities, with three full-time vacant homes officers and the rest work part-time. The Minister of State is telling us that many of these part-time officers have multiple roles. They can be the derelict sites officers, they can organise housing maintenance or they may be involved in allocations and planning. They are overseeing adaption grants and tenant purchase schemes. They can also be involved in processing Rebuilding Ireland home loans. The Minister of State said staffing is a council issue and the funding is in place. I have no doubt that somewhere like Cork City Council, with almost 9,000 vacant homes, would jump at the chance of a full-time vacant homes officer. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have stripped local authorities of their power and funding over the decades. Councils are no longer able to provide the services expected of them because the individuals working in them are expected to do multiple jobs. It is unbelievable that we are here today, listening to a Minister of State describing how a vacant homes officer is quadruple-jobbing. We have 92,000 vacant homes. I asked him a straightforward and simple question. Does he want to solve the housing crisis? Organising seminars and failing to provide funding is not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">I ask the Minister of State a straightforward question. Does he believe that the part-time vacant homes officers in the 28 local authorities will get the 92,000 vacant homes returned? I do not think they will. In fact, I know they will not. It is not acceptable that a Minister of State would come to the House and talk about vacant homes and providing funding when the staff are part-time. It just does not make sense.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">They have the funding. As I said, every local authority has €50,000 in place to support the vacant homes officer. It is a matter for the local authority to adjudicate on how staff are assigned.

            <p eId="para_95"> The Department's role is to drive and co-ordinate actions in central government to support local authorities in their actions to tackle vacancy in local areas. There has been great success in bringing back vacant properties into productive use throughout the country. For example, since the introduction of the repair and lease scheme, 234 homes have been brought back into use and tenanted. The buy and renew scheme has also facilitated local authorities to purchase 670 vacant properties for social housing purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> Finally, since its introduction in 2017 and up to the end of 2020, the revolving acquisitions fund, managed by the Housing Agency, has facilitated the purchase of 878 properties, which have been made available to approved housing bodies and local authorities and accommodate households who need social housing support.</p>
            <p eId="para_97"> The Department is committed to tackling vacancy and will continue to do this work with local authorities over the coming weeks and months.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_112">— implement a development lead infrastructure scheme to fast track infrastructural development in our towns and villages to create balanced development; and </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_113">— put in place a transparent cost structure for new, and extensions to existing, water and wastewater treatment infrastructure.”</p>
          <p eId="para_114">I am sharing time with four colleagues. I thank my colleagues in the Regional Group for putting together the motion. It is important to note that this is not an attack of Irish Water, rather a cry for help from the Government on its behalf. As we know, many towns and villages do not have the services they require. People live in communities where nobody takes charge of the sewage treatment and an environmental time bomb is ready to explode in our towns and villages. The motion also refers to housing and how we can address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> In Athenry, a town the Minister of State probably knows well, which is located next to a motorway crossroads, features a railway and is within shouting distance of Galway city, no more new homes are allowed to be built until 2025. Craughwell, which is also a growth centre for Galway, is not allowed to build any more houses. The same is true of Corofin and Abbeyknockmoy. They are just four examples of growth centres attached to the motorway, with connectivity into the city, and they cannot build houses. The simple reason is that Galway County Council will not give planning permission without there being a municipal treatment plant, while An Bord Pleanála has refused on the same basis and stated that any development in these towns and villages will be premature until the infrastructure is in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> Prior to Irish Water being formed, Galway County Council earmarked sites for wastewater treatment in all these places and carried out feasibility studies. It had identified a site for the east Galway wastewater treatment plant and was moving ahead with that. When Irish Water was brought into being, it was intended that it would take over that role. Every one of the projects I have mentioned, however, is now off the agenda and there is no specific plan. In Athenry, for instance, money was found to extend the plant and get it ready, but now the money that is needed to complete the network is not available and it will not be done until 2025, pending funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> This cannot continue. I ask the Minister of State and the Government to put in place a fund for Irish Water in order that it can carry out the works it is charged to do. There have been so many discussions about housing. Why we are not building houses seems to have become a mystery, but some of that mystery relates to the fact that we cannot build houses in the towns and villages where we want. We do not want reviews or working groups. We do not need any more of them. I know from my time in government that there is pushback from within the permanent government on these matters. We need to give the money to Irish Water. It has the expertise. I have worked with many people from Irish Water over the past five years and they are very good people, but they too are frustrated because they have to prioritise environmental issues and highly populated places where serviced land may need to be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> There is a complete stagnation of development in rural Ireland, and on top of that, there is pushback against once-off rural housing. People in the regions are being told they cannot build in the countryside and have to move to the towns and villages. They are told that towns and villages will be designated for them, but they cannot build there either. We do not need to wait for county development plans to be prepared to get this infrastructure in place. There are housing estates where the sewage is running out of the wastewater treatment plants, for which nobody is taking responsibility. It is a disgrace in this day and age. We charge the same households local property tax and give them nothing back to help them solve these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> I implore the Minister of State to get to the nub of this issue and provide funding to Irish Water. If Irish Water does not have the capacity within its resources, it can designate it to the local authorities, which will put in the infrastructure and let Irish Water take charge afterwards. We need to do this now. We cannot wait any longer for more reviews. Even if the money was provided today, as the Minister of State will be aware, it would take perhaps three years before a new wastewater treatment plant was operational. We talk about remote working, but how can we work remotely in rural areas if we do not have housing?</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_120">I thank my colleagues in the Regional Group for tabling the motion. It is clear that Irish Water's delivery of new wastewater treatment plants is simply not working. We need a clear strategic plan to make regional development a reality by investing in water and wastewater infrastructure in our towns and villages. That is a must.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> The latest report of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has shown that many towns and villages simply do not have adequate water and wastewater treatment services. The report is also highly critical of Irish Water's delivery of new treatment plants. It highlights that 19 large towns and cities did not treat wastewater to a European standard in 2019, and notes that 35 areas continued to discharge raw sewage, including Omeath in my county of Louth. It goes on to state that 48 areas were under significant threat to inland and coastal water pollution as a result of wastewater discharge. Of these 48 areas, a number of areas in County Louth were identified, including Dundalk, Blackrock, Castlebellingham, Dunleer and Tallanstown. The report also notes 13 areas where wastewater discharge must immediately be improved to protect endangered freshwater pearl mussels and again two areas in County Louth were identified, Carlingford and Omeath.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> The report gives a grim overview of both Irish Water and the delivery of treatment plants. It is clear that action is needed, which is why we in the Regional Group call on the Government to take action immediately. The motion calls on the Government to recognise that many towns and villages do not have water and wastewater treatment services. We need people living in communities in order to develop growth centres </p>
          <p eId="para_123">Our towns and villages need investment to provide the necessary infrastructure to attract young families to live in the area and raise their children. We also want the Government to recognise that clean water and wastewater systems are essential components to grow communities and that excessive cost to the homeowner for the provision of water and wastewater treatment services is a barrier to providing homes. </p>
          <p eId="para_124"> We have also called on the Government to acknowledge that regional development will provide the catalyst for economic recovery post Covid-19 and Brexit, particularly for Border areas such as Louth. It should also acknowledge that the provision of housing for all is a national economic and social imperative and that infrastructural costs for the provision of water and wastewater treatment cannot be the sole responsibility of the house buyer.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> In tabling the motion, we call on the Government to take the following action: to create a strategic plan to make regional development a reality by investing in water and wastewater infrastructure in our towns and villages; to implement a development-led infrastructure system to fast-track infrastructure development in our towns and villages to create a balanced development; and to put in place a transparent cost structure for new, and extensions to existing, water and wastewater treatment services.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> The EPA has clearly identified the failure of Irish Water to deliver adequate wastewater treatment plants. It has also highlighted the consequences of not taking action. We must take action now and the Government must step up now and provide the resources. We cannot ignore this report. The many areas around the country that have been identified as being at risk is alarming. In my constituency of Louth a large number of areas have been identified as requiring immediate action, including Dundalk, Omeath, Carlingford, Blackrock, Castlebellingham, Tallanstown and Dunleer. Louth is the smallest county in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> We in the Regional Group seek cross-party support for the motion. We appeal to the Government to take immediate action. What is needed now is action, not empty words. As I have said previously, we need the Government to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure in our towns and villages. I come from the smallest county in the country and the Minister of State can appreciate the serious problems we have. I appeal to him for his help.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_128">I thank my colleagues and particularly Cáit, our administrator, for bringing forward this motion regarding Irish Water. I recall when Irish Water was set up it sparked off one of the most controversial debates we had in this House for many years. I sat on the committee established to try to find a solution and an all-party agreement on the best way to move forward with the establishment of Irish Water. The outcome of the committee’s deliberation was that there should be no water charges, which effectively left the full cost of Irish Water to be borne by the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> There is much debate in the House on housing and lack of supply, particularly for first-time buyers. I want to particularly congratulate the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, on the tremendous work he is doing to bring forward the affordable housing Bill and on his efforts to find a solution to the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> Many town and villages around the country cannot be developed and cannot move forward due to the lack of infrastructure, particularly sewage treatment plants and water supply schemes. Unless this issue is dealt with there will always be a crisis in rural Ireland regarding housing supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> A matter demanding immediate action, on which my colleague, Deputy Canney, touched, is the quality of sewage treatment plants provided by some developers building smaller schemes of houses. Currently, too many problems are arising from plants not properly built. We must have closer monitoring of the construction of these plants in the future. Irish Water needs to be involved from the start and ensure the treatment plants are built to a proper standard and specification and it should supervise the operation until completion, eventually taking them over and maintaining them. That is the way forward to increase housing supply in rural Ireland. I ask that this be seriously examined. </p>
          <p eId="para_132"> On the outskirts of Galway city there is a major pumping station at Merlin Park, which pumps effluent from Oranmore and the east side of the city to the main Mutton Island treatment plant in Galway Bay. This pumping station is now at full capacity, resulting in development being held up on the east side of the city and in the wider Oranmore area. The new county development plan, which will be going on display shortly, proposes a new town centre at Gurraun and a major development at Ardaun, with more than 500 houses being proposed in the lifetime of the new plan. None of this development will take place until this pumping station is upgraded. </p>
          <p eId="para_133"> Galway County Council in recent years has proposed a new wastewater treatment system, which would cater for the major growth of the east side of the city, as Mutton Island is nearing capacity. This is another issue on which Deputy Canney touched. This treatment plant would cost in excess of €100 million but there has been no movement from Irish Water to progress this plant, which will take a long number of years to bring to fruition. Unless there is movement on this plant, no growth will be possible on the east side of the city, particularly in Oranmore, Athenry and surrounding areas for a few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> Another issue I want to raise is the cost of group water schemes. I have been working on a scheme on the outskirts of the city that would cater for approximately five houses. We secured approval and a grant from the Minister of State’s Department, for which I am thankful, to cover some of the costs of the scheme. To keep the costs down, we got agreement from a landowner that the pipe can be laid inside the wall and a way leave provided so as not to have to dig up the road. This would drastically reduce the cost of the scheme but, unfortunately, Irish Water is insisting it does the contract for this scheme and the pipe must be laid on the roadway, which would drastically increase the cost, possibly making it unviable. By laying the pipe inside the wall, the cost would be in the region of €35,000 with the householder only having to pay a contribution of approximately €800 each. However, if the pipe were put down under the road, as insisted by Irish Water, the cost would be in excess of €100,000 and each household would have to pay in the region of €7,000, which is not realistic. This issue has to be examined to ensure we get a proper water supply to local residents at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer and the householders.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> Another issue that has been raised in my constituency office is the time it takes to get approval from Irish Water for a connection agreement in order that an applicant can apply for planning permission. It is taking up to five months before an agreement is reached and an applicant can lodge a planning application. This backlog needs to be dealt with. It is holding up development and housing. I ask the Minister of State to examine that.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> Unless proper funding is put in place to construct infrastructure that is needed in our rural towns and villages, we will always have a housing shortage in rural Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#CathalBerry" eId="spk_32">
          <from>Deputy Cathal Berry<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_137">I am delighted to support the motion on investing in our public water and wastewater treatment infrastructure. As a proud member of the Regional Group, I am very much in favour of balanced regional development across regional, rural and even coastal Ireland. It is not that I am particularly biased towards living in the countryside; I am just biased towards progress. Living in regional Ireland and supporting the move towards regional Ireland has major benefits to pay for the entire country. It will reduce gridlock, congestion and pressure on services in our main cities. It will also reduce the cost of living because it is much cheaper to live in the countryside. It will further reduce our carbon footprint because we will not have to commute as much. Most importantly and crucially, it will improve our quality of life because we will get to spend much more time with our families and children. We will have a healthier lifestyle and a cheaper cost of living in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> I am completely sold on the idea of balanced regional development. To be fair to the public, they are ahead of the Parliament. There has been a major and even a macro trend towards moving towards the countryside, particularly in the past 15 months as a result of the pandemic. As a result of that shift, the Government should not just allow it to happen but encourage and support it to happen and even capitalise on this trend. The best way to do that is to make up for the chronic lack of investment in water services, water treatment and other facilities in rural Ireland. I welcome the publication of the recent strategy, Our Rural Future. There is much good context in that strategy document. I accept there have been at least some improvements in road infrastructure and the broadband roll-out is at least accelerating. We are not there yet but it is improving. Water services and water treatment infrastructure are always the poor relation. I am not sure why that is the case. They may be just not deemed to be as sexy, glamorous or cool as the other technical utilities or it may be the fact that water pipes are under the ground and that because they are invisible it is a case of out of sight, out of mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">A major infrastructural improvement is required in terms of water treatment facilities. In my constituency in Portarlington, the taps were dry for three weeks last summer. I know it was a dry summer but the main reason is leakage. There is a huge amount of leakage. Many of the pipes in the country date back to the Victorian era. We need to improve the piping in our regional towns. There is also a lack of boreholes and wells. There is huge room for improvement from a water facilitation point of view, particularly in a growing town such as Portarlington. Many of the regional towns are rapidly expanding and we cannot rapidly expand unless we provide the facilities required.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> I accept there has been improvement and some investment in water treatment facilities, but there has also been a few overflow incidents on both the east and west coasts in the past few months. That is unacceptable. I accept that these water treatment facilities are built to EU standards, but we should recognise that these EU standards are minimum standards. There is nothing stopping us increasing the spec and the standard of construction to ensure those treatment plants are customised specifically for the Irish environment. Some of those overflow incidents are threatening and compromising the blue flag status of some of our beaches. It is an area we have to improve on.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> We need to invest heavily and urgently in our water facilities for a number of reasons. The first is from a climate change point of view. Climate change will bring big changes to our weather patterns. We will have drier summers and wetter winters. We also need to reduce the waste of potable water and the amount of pollution from a wastewater perspective. Our population is increasing and the trends are obvious from that perspective. The more people we have, the more water we will need.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> Money is cheap now. It is almost free. What better time to invest in our water facilities, be it water treatment plants or water facilitation? It should be done as soon as possible to encourage regional development, build houses and invest in our future.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterBurke" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Housing,_Local_Government_and_Heritage" eId="spk_33">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_143">I thank the members of the Regional Group for their motion and Deputies Canney, Fitzpatrick, Grealish and Berry for their opening contributions and the constructive nature of the motion. It is timely as we go about reviewing our national development plan. They have highlighted the pressure points that Irish Water, as a public utility, is facing. I welcome the views of other Deputies on this important area as we outline plans and actions the Government intends to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> Our Shared Future, the programme for Government, sets a high level of ambition around sustainable water management and contains more than 30 commitments specific to water matters. These commitments are directed towards overcoming the deficits in our water infrastructure which impact on the provision of safe and secure drinking supplies and, as mentioned by Deputies, strive towards achieving sustainable development, including housing provision, in both rural and urban Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> Significant progress has been achieved over the past decade on institutional reform in the approach to the delivery of water services in Ireland, including on the overall governance and practice of water protection. The work continues. A number of significant and complex challenges remain for our water services. Irish Water, backed by record Government investment in water infrastructure, is well placed to develop the systems and services Ireland needs to serve our citizens in the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> Irish Water continues to evolve on its journey to becoming a world-class water utility. A modern, effective, environmentally compliant and efficiently delivered water service system is central to all our national interests. Working together since 2014, Irish Water and our local authorities have made real progress in implementing nationwide systems to provide a coherent approach to water services. Irish Water has become firmly imbedded as a national public water utility with strength, delivery and management of water services and investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> Irish Water delivers its services in accordance with the statutory water services strategic plan, which was published in October 2015. This sets out a high-level strategy over 25 years to ensure the provision of clean and safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for economic and social development. In turn, Irish Water's strategic funding plan 2019 to 2024 outlines its multi-annual strategic business planning funding requirement of €11 billion, which comprises €6.1 billion of planned investment in infrastructure and assets and €4.9 billion in operating costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Robust governance, accountability and oversight are in place, with economic regulation of Irish Water by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and environmental regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, while An Fóram Uisce and the water advisory board have specific roles to oversee the performance of Irish Water.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> I acknowledge we have a way to go to ensuring our water and wastewater infrastructure, including the distribution and collection networks, is fit for purpose. Water and wastewater infrastructure in Ireland has suffered years of underinvestment, and the condition of the national asset base was deteriorating faster than the investment could keep up. These underpinned interventions require Irish Water, as a national public utility, to rebalance periodically its investment portfolio to ensure it is maintaining existing levels of service and supporting growth capacity, while addressing the compliance and capacity challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> The cost of the provision of domestic water services provided by Irish Water is met by the Exchequer from my Department's Vote, with more than €1.3 billion being provided in 2021. The Government's substantial and sustained investment is vital to address the existing infrastructure deficits, ensure compliance with EU directives, accommodate population growth and build resilience in the face of climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Maintaining a high level of investment in the water sector over the future investment cycles is vital in order to achieve greater environmental compliance; overcome challenges in water and wastewater treatment infrastructure; address unacceptably high water leakage rates; service future housing and development needs; and ensure security of supply across our country, all of which, to be fair, have been raised by the Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Significant reforms are still required. At the end of February, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, published a paper agreed by Government, entitled Irish Water - Towards a National, Publicly-Owned, Regulated Water Services Utility. The policy paper sets out the Government's expectations on the next steps of the water sector transformation. This transformation will ensure Irish Water plays an effective and efficient role in underpinning the implementation of Project Ireland 2040, including our objectives under the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> Continued high levels of investment in our water services will be a priority for Government under the revised national development plan, which is in preparation. This motion is key in setting out the priorities which we need to bring into that development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> In terms of alignment with the national planning framework, the second leg of Project Ireland 2040, Irish Water takes account of and supports ongoing work on the implementation of the framework, including the regional spatial and economic strategies. It liaises closely with local authorities to inform ongoing reviews of county development plans, local area plans and its wastewater capacity registers, which help ensure that the right development is supported in the right place.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> A key programme is Irish Water's small towns and villages growth programme 2020 to 2024. This will support the growth in smaller towns and villages through an investment fund of €100 million, with the approval of its economic regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. Irish Water recently announced details of 13 wastewater treatment plants across 12 counties, which have been selected for upgrade under this programme. These projects are now commencing design; thus, investment under the programme will now begin to deliver and accelerate.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> The engagement of relevant local authorities will ensure timely delivery of these badly needed upgrades around the country. An increase in the supply of housing, the need for which is agreed on by all sides of this House, is critically dependant on the provision of supporting water services. This growth programme will now begin to deliver the necessary capacity in small towns and villages to support broadly needed housing development in the right place for all our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> It is important to acknowledge the vital role played by the rural water sector in delivering high-quality water services to areas outside the public water system. Nearly one fifth of Ireland's population gets its water from private supplies consisting of private group water schemes or private household wells. Just under 200,000 people are served by almost 400 private group water schemes throughout the country. More than 170,000 rural households depend on their own private wells for their domestic water needs. Group water schemes provide an invaluable service to families, farms and businesses in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> This Government is committed to supporting the rural water sector by providing equity of treatment and financial supports, equivalent to the public water sector. For capital investment needs, the multi-annual rural water programme provides funding certainty for the continuous improvement of water services. The programme has provided more than €70 million over its current three-year cycle, which runs to the end of 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">An annual subsidy also provides funding towards the operational costs for group water schemes and the supplying of water for domestic use.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I have set out in broad terms the Government's water services policy programme, focusing on the water sector transformation and the significant funding for domestic water services, including the relevant programmes and supports for our rural water sector. Our sustained investment in infrastructure is required to ensure continued supply of good-quality drinking water and appropriate treatment of water to ensure continued social and domestic development. We have made demonstrable progress in addressing the huge challenges we face as a Government and will continue delivering strongly on the commitments made in the programme for Government, particularly those underpinning housing development.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> A number of Deputies have raised the infrastructure needed to unlock so much potential in our towns and villages up and down the country. Deputy Canney made a point on our rural housing policy. As Minister of State with responsibility for planning, and coming from a large rural constituency, I really understand and appreciate how important rural planning is because it consistently takes up 25% of our output of housing. We are currently reviewing the sustainable rural communities document, which has not been revised since 2005. That will be an important key to ensuring that delivery is protected and that those who live in rural areas can continue to do so in a sustainable way. That is very important and I am acutely aware of it because of the constituency I occupy. As I said at the outset, the Government is not opposing this motion. We look forward to working with our colleagues to try to improve water services for all, both rural and urban, and to unlock the key potential inherent in our towns and villages to ensure that this national development plan review will again support Irish Water in the delivery and working with this key public utility.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_34">
          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_162">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. The objective behind it is that we would have a strategic plan for regional development and make it a reality by investing in our water and wastewater infrastructure in towns and villages across the country. I welcome the contribution by the Aire Stáit, who is accepting the core principle behind our motion and the motion itself. The reality is that local employment opportunities are being stalled as a result of the failure to upgrade and provide wastewater treatment facilities across our country. Our towns and villages need this investment, this necessary infrastructure, to provide for clean water and wastewater treatment facilities to attract families to live, work and raise their children in these rural communities across the country. This infrastructure is an essential part of growing these particular communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> The latest EPA report is highly critical of Irish Water's delivery of new wastewater treatment plants. The report highlights 35 towns and villages that continue to discharge raw sewage into nearby waters. Sadly, in the part of the country I represent, east Galway, we actually have raw sewage running in the streets of villages because of the lack of wastewater treatment facilities. It is going to be very hard to bring investment into those villages and those communities when that is what visitors to them can experience, and it should not happen in the current society.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The lack of this basic infrastructure is being compounded by measures within county development plans right across the country which effectively ban the construction of one-off rural housing. The new county development plans will prioritise cluster developments near existing settlements with wastewater treatment facilities. This will decimate existing communities where people cannot build on their own land and now cannot live in their own parish because they have no serviced lands. There is no point talking about planning for future housing needs in regional growth centres like Athlone, the town shared by the Minister of State and me, if we do not have the basic infrastructure in place. I will give a practical example of what I am talking about. Monksland, the community on the County Roscommon side of Athlone, requires a new network upgrade and a new treatment plant in order to cater for increased demand. The Government has designated that community, as well as the rest of Athlone, as a major growth centre that will see substantial growth in the years ahead. However, half the town cannot expand because we do not have those facilities. The two closest villages to Monksland, Brideswell and Curraghboy, do not have any wastewater treatment facilities and there are no plans to provide any. Where then are the young people of south Roscommon going to live? Irish Water needs to publish a five-year sewerage plan for every single county across the country because that type of strategic plan is not there.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> As bad as the situation is in south Roscommon, it is absolutely deplorable in east Galway. Villages like Kiltormer, Aughrim, Kilreekil, New Inn, Kilconnell, Ballymacward, Caltra, Castleblakeney and Menlough have no wastewater treatment facilities. All those communities will not be able to retain their own existing young populations unless they have access to that basic infrastructure. We then turn to the mother and father of all challenges, Mountbellew, which is the biggest town in County Galway outside Ballinasloe and has a massive hinterland. The design for the wastewater treatment facility there has been completed and a site identified for it but there is no funding to proceed with construction of the project. We are therefore saying to communities right across east Galway that they must either live in Ballinasloe or migrate to Galway or Dublin. How is that going to solve the housing and congestion challenges we have in those cities? We cannot even provide young couples with serviced sites.</p>

        <speech by="#VeronaMurphy" eId="spk_35">
          <from>Deputy Verona Murphy<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_166">I am delighted to be able to propose and speak on this motion as part of the Regional Group. I concur with everything my colleagues have said on the floor.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> We all know the importance of top-quality water infrastructure. Unfortunately, much of our water infrastructure needs upgrading. This presents us with an opportunity to plan carefully; to fast-track infrastructural development in our towns and villages to create balanced development; to create a strategic plan for water investment; and to put in place a transparent cost structure for new, and extensions to existing, water and wastewater treatment infrastructure. To put it in one sentence, it is an opportunity to get it right. We need to take this opportunity because we cannot allow any town or village to be in a position where there is inadequate water infrastructure to support development. We have a housing crisis, which means we need to build houses. We cannot leave ourselves in a position where housing or business developments could be rejected because of a lack of water infrastructure. That would amount to State-sponsored negligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> Business development will be key to a post-Covid recovery, and building houses will be key to solving the housing crisis. We need to ensure that we have the infrastructure in place to do both in all parts of Ireland. Many businesses of certain kinds will have seen benefits to working from home. There has been less unproductive time sitting in traffic or on a long commute and more time with the family and the ability to work in a comfortable environment. Of course, it is not for everyone or every business but it is likely that we shall see working from home or working from community hubs become more commonplace. All these things need water infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> It is not just about throwing money hand over fist at the problem either. It is about a sensible, workable strategy. We currently have a lack of joined-up thinking when it comes to the upgrading of water services. I will give an example from my home area. A €13 million wastewater treatment facility is being developed in Arthurstown, County Wexford, to service the Arthurstown, Duncannon and Ballyhack areas. This is, of course, badly needed and very welcome. However, the lack of joined-up thinking is shown by an exchange that took place in 2019 between Wexford County Council's director of services, Mr. Eamonn Hore, and the head of asset management in Irish Water.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Mr. Hore wrote to ask Irish Water to investigate the connection of the village of Ramsgrange to the new water treatment plant at Arthurstown. He wrote that most of Ramsgrange village was, at that time, served by poorly operated private discharge plants that discharge into the stream that runs through the village and into Duncannon beach, about 3 km away. For those Members who are not familiar with Ramsgrange, rather unusually for a rural village, it has a secondary school of almost 600 pupils, a national school, a pub, a supermarket and a variety of houses. The village is only 3 km away from the new €13 million facility where Wexford County Council has identified not only bad water infrastructure, but also obvious environmental issues. The lack of a strategic plan or joined-up thinking means that Ramsgrange will not be included in this new scheme, even though it is in need of it. It should be included in the scheme, as a practical measure, because it will be cheaper to do so now.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> This is just one example that I happen to be familiar with, as it is almost on my doorstep, but there are similar anomalies right across the country. We cannot continue to deal with our water on a patchwork quilt-type basis, which is why I, as part of the Regional Group, am calling on Deputies on all sides of the House to support this motion. Let us have a strategic plan, ensure we protect our environment and create the conditions to allow rural Ireland to recover and thrive.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Our local beach, Duncannon, has, unfortunately, lost its blue flag, which is pertinent to the situation I have just described. I ask the Minister to consider the fact that the loss of that blue flag will have an impact on tourism in the south County Wexford area. The measures we have proposed must be taken seriously and put into practice as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EoinOBroin" eId="spk_36">
          <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_173">I thank the Regional Group for introducing this important motion, which Sinn Féin is more than happy to support enthusiastically. Let me start by saying that the provision of genuinely affordable homes for working people in our towns and villages should be a priority for Government. It is absolutely essential not only for the revitalisation of those towns and villages but also for balanced regional development and, crucially, to tackle the challenge of climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> For that to happen, we need increased investment by Government in tackling vacancy and dereliction, a quick and cheaper source of good-quality family homes in every county, particularly in every town and village across the State. We must also tackle decades of underinvestment in water and, in particular, wastewater infrastructure. Before we can rise to the challenge of providing new wastewater treatment infrastructure, we must deal with the fact that there are thousands of families living in recently built developments that are still not connected to the public water system. The Minister will know that we have approximately 566 developments, in predominantly rural areas, across the State that were built with developer-provided wastewater treatment infrastructure, the intention of which was to connect them to the public system. None of them have been connected to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> This is a legacy issue of planning permission provided during the Celtic tiger, delays because of the crash, changes in policies and improvement in standards in wastewater treatment infrastructure developed under the auspices of Irish Water. The difficulty, of course, is that there are thousands of hard-working people who bought homes, predominantly in rural Ireland, and are now at risk of carrying not only the cost of the maintenance of what should be part of the public water system but also the cost if something goes wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> We must be honest and say that, in some cases, the developers did not build these wastewater treatment plants sufficiently. In other cases, they built them exactly according to the planning permission that was provided by the local authority at the time. It seems that there is a slight shifting of the blame between central government, local government and Irish Water, with, of course, the homeowner stuck in the middle and unsure of what may happen in the future. The Government has allocated funding to the amount of €3.6 million so far this year to remediate the infrastructure in 26 of those estates but that is a fraction of what is required. We need to hear from the Government the timeline within which all these developments will be brought in charge and their wastewater treatment plants brought up to scratch.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Speaking more generally, we hear a lot of backbench Government Deputies bemoan in this House the lack of affordable accommodation in our rural towns and villages and the lack of infrastructure. Of course, the reason those things are the case is because the Government is failing to invest. The level of investment, for example, in ensuring local authorities can bring vacant homes back into stock is derisory. All of the targets under Rebuilding Ireland for tackling vacancy, particularly in our rural towns and villages, have been badly missed. Those targets were themselves very modest. The Government two years ago cut the capital investment programme for Irish Water, crucially limiting its capacity to tackle the kinds of problems that Deputy Naughten rightly raised in terms of those 35 agglomerations that not only are pouring raw sewage into rivers, lakes and seas, but also currently are subject to European Court of Justice and European Commission enforcement which will result in the State paying millions of euro in fines. If the Government wants to tackle this problem, the key is that it must invest in the affordable homes working people, particularly in rural Ireland, need. It must also, and crucially, invest in the wastewater treatment facilities to bring our existing infrastructure up to scratch and in charge, as well as provide additional capacity, particularly in those towns in which we want to see greater regional development to take the strain off Dublin and Cork cities, and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> The homeowners living in those 566 developments need action, clarity and certainty. This is not a problem of the Minister's making; it is one he has inherited. I urge him to sit down with the local authorities, Irish Water and his Department to come up with a plan in order that the people will know when their estate will be upgraded, when it will be connected to the public system and when they will no longer have the fear and uncertainty of having to foot the bill if something goes wrong with wastewater treatment plants that, through no fault of their own, cannot currently be taken in charge.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_179">I met with Irish Water, along with my colleagues, Councillors Terry Crossan and Gerry McMonagle, about our concerns over the south Inishowen water supply from the Eddie Fullerton Dam and the development of Letterkenny, the major gateway town in the county. I left that meeting with a clear view that Irish Water is utterly under-resourced. There is clearly no plan in place to address how Irish Water meets its responsibilities to our communities across this State. In the case of south Inishowen, an inadequate pipe infrastructure that has burst repeatedly was put in place. This is the main trunk line from the Eddie Fullerton Dam to thousands of homes that are regularly impacted by water bursts. Those pipes were to be replaced a number of years ago. I was given a guarantee to that effect in a meeting with Irish Water but Irish Water is now saying that that will not be done any time soon because there are even worse cases across the county. What a mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Letterkenny town is the major gateway and magnet for investment in the county. Irish Water is now stating that the situation there will have to be developer-led. That is a mess that has impacted Letterkenny in the past. The infrastructure needs to be put in place and building can then occur around it. There are concerns over both water and wastewater. Councillors in Letterkenny have a vision to extend the town southward. That is their vision. They want to develop lands for wastewater and water but Irish Water cannot do it. There is a whole area, as one approaches the town from the direction of Buncrana and Derry, containing businesses and houses that are not connected to a state-of-the-art sewerage treatment plant because the investment is not there. I give the Minister of State those examples of the mess we are facing and the need for a plan and resourcing. That is why this motion is so important.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">I too welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter. I will start with a bit of positive news by welcoming the upgrades in Mallow, Cobh and Youghal. The environmental impact is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">As many Deputies have said, we have major issues with capacity in other areas, particularly in my town of Midleton and in Mitchelstown. It is slowing down the building of homes. I know it has sometimes been mooted that it is not desirable to have people from the cities coming into the towns and jamming the place up, but this is about having locals living locally, supporting local businesses and giving both an opportunity to grow. The capacity issue has been raised with me on numerous occasions and it is one of the stumbling blocks for local and regional development when it comes to housing. I also find it difficult to get replies from Irish Water when it comes to freedom of information requests. I remember sitting on Cork County Council discussing a county development plan a number of years ago for 2,000 homes where Irish Water refused to service a site and that development fell.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> I would like to mention another issue with regard to capacity in a number of areas. The proposed treatment plant at White Bay Beach seems to be very small. I wonder if Irish Water plans ahead when it comes to capacity in this because this treated sewage will be going into the bay there. I welcome that Ballycotton sewerage scheme is in its infancy but we need maximum investment in our sewerage and water systems. I worked in it for 20 years so I know how the system works. If we do not get this right, the impact will outweigh the environmental pluses. It goes back to the point that we do not want to start emptying out our towns and villages. There is great frustration that people cannot even build one-off houses because of capacity issues. I would like the Minister of State to address that.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">I thank the Regional Group for tabling this motion, which I wholeheartedly support. It is nothing short of disgraceful that people must still fight for water 100 years after the State was formed. The motion being debated states that "clean water and wastewater systems are essential components to grow communities" and that it is essential that we invest in "the infrastructure necessary to attract families to live, work and raise their families". It is shameful that this basic infrastructure is still denied to many in this State. Too many households do not even have access to group water schemes. I commend all of the volunteers across the country who have provided water and worked so hard in their communities over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> In my constituency of Mayo, people are still fighting to access clean running water through community water schemes. It is wrong that they have been forced to fight tooth and nail for the most basic infrastructure requirement but it is even worse that some are being denied access to group water schemes. Downpatrick Head community water scheme thought it would finally see progress after 20 years of campaigning in June of last year when it received grant approval. However, the goalposts were then moved. The group was told that there was an additional cost of €18,000 and that it needed to find another nine houses for the scheme. This community had funding pulled from it back in 2008 and it is scared that the same thing will happen again. It is scared that all its hard work will have been in vain.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> The Murrisk water scheme has been campaigning for a clean water supply in that area for over 20 years. There are 600 households there without a clean water supply in 2021. It has still not even been allocated funding yet. If it were successful, the community would have to pay 15% up front. With every election that comes around there is always an announcement that things will happen and then nothing happens. There seems to be no understanding that some families simply cannot afford to make the payment up front.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> In the middle of a global pandemic, Achill Island was left without water for months last year. The fact is that the treatment plant does not have the capacity to meet the needs of the population. I welcome that some works have been done there in recent times but we want a permanent solution to the problem of water on Achill Island. I got correspondence from Irish Water today and in that correspondence Irish Water stated that it hopes it does not happen this year and that it has put some works in place but that if it does happen it will supply water through tankers. That is not good enough for rural Ireland or Achill Island.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">We support this motion. It is an important issue for most of us who live in rural Ireland and we understand the importance of having infrastructure in place. The particular change happened when Irish Water came onto the scene. Towns and small villages that had group water schemes in place for many years suddenly found there was a change in policy and attitude towards what was being done. That is something that rings out clearly throughout the whole country. We need to see the investment go in and we need to see co-operation between the local authorities, communities on the ground and Irish Water to ensure that investment is put in place straight away.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> The example that comes to my mind is the area known as Hartley, in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim. A lot of houses in that area have their own septic tank systems, some of which work well and some of which do not. They are upstream of the River Shannon, from where the water goes in for the treatment plant, which provides drinking water for most of the county. The idea was that a scheme would be put in place in order that they would get a group sewerage scheme which would pump into the scheme that is there in the town. However, after the local community coming together and working hard for a couple of years, even going around and collecting the money from the people in the area, the next thing was that when they had all that done Irish Water turned its back on it and stated that it would not go ahead with it. That is the type of situation we see all over the country. We need to have a change in policy and attitude from Irish Water to understand that small communities up and down the country need to have the infrastructure in place as a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> The other issue which comes straight to mind is that of one-off rural housing and the big problems that are there. That is something I have spoken to the Minister about as well. We have a serious issue in many areas where people who want to build a one-off rural house are being refused the right to do so, which means they cannot sustain their local communities. We are told it is about the septic tanks and the sewerage situation. The reality is that technology has long overcome that problem. The single house sewerage treatment systems that are available treat the sewage to up to two or three times a better standard than the town sewerage systems. It is not an argument any longer. That argument needs to be put to bed and we need to get back to being able to develop houses and giving people a place to live in their local areas where they can send their children to the school they went to themselves.</p>

          <from>Deputy Violet-Anne Wynne<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_191">It is an indictment of this Government and successive Governments that many of our towns and villages do not have wastewater treatment services in 2021 and that those that do most often need a serious upgrade as they have been operating over their capacity, causing all sorts of issues and disruptions for the community. Recently, I received a response from the relevant Department advising that Irish Water has no wastewater infrastructure in towns and villages in Clare such as O'Briensbridge, Broadford, Cooraclare, Spanish Point and Carrigaholt. I know that, for example, Carrigaholt has been campaigning extensively for nearly 50 years for this treatment service. According to Irish Water, it has no remit or responsibility to fund such schemes under Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, funding rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The wastewater collection and treatment facility in Milltown Malbay, for example, is maintained by Clare County Council on behalf of Irish Water under a service level agreement. Although Irish Water acknowledges that there is a need for an upgrade, it has still not stated when this will be possible. No timeline whatsoever has been provided. This is the same dead end that many treatment plants are at. They are awaiting feasibility studies with no clear answer as to when they will be upgraded. It is quite unbelievable that this was allowed to happen. The Government has clearly left these towns and villages behind, so far removed from the much-needed solution. The Government needs to acknowledge and address this issue immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> There cannot be talk of rural investment and regeneration unless there is commitment and action, which speaks much louder than words. The Government also needs to respond to the fact that we know that many families and individuals have had to review their lifestyle choices and have chosen to relocate to these rural communities because of the Covid pandemic in particular. We have seen, experienced and survived the slashing of rural services time and again. Just this year, Bank of Ireland branches and post offices across the county, including the post office in Broadford, closed. Even last week, the restricted route 51 Bus Éireann service, which is an essential service, was slashed. This needs to stop and these areas and communities need to be prioritised.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I wish to support this motion and I thank the Deputies from the Regional Group for bringing it forward. Some 50% of my constituency is rural and the lack of water and wastewater infrastructure there is an important issue. We are in the middle of the worst housing crisis in the history of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Without investment by the Government in water and wastewater infrastructure, how will houses be built in villages, towns and rural areas? The Government must invest. One-off housing is being blocked because of a lack of infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> In my constituency, in the middle of a densely residential area, there are four waste management facilities. Two of these have been licensed by Cork City Council and two by the Environmental Protection Agency. In January last year, the existence of ammonia, nitrogen and sulphate was recorded in the groundwater in the Ashgrove facility, which is licensed by the EPA. This means that liquid ammonia was in the groundwater. Some of the symptoms of ammonia poisoning are severe chest pains, vomiting and blindness, and people are advised to go straight to an emergency department if they come into contact with it. What were the consequences of this for the Ashgrove waste management facility, which is surrounded by houses full of elderly people and young families and sports facilities? When ammonia was found in the groundwater, there were absolutely no consequences and nothing to answer for. The EPA has told me it cannot temporarily close facilities while an investigation is taking place. It has only ever once shut a facility. Reports from Country Clean in 2018 showed it has never passed a fire inspection. As of 1 August 2018, maintenance of fire detection systems had not taken place since 2014. The EPA waited months before it notified the local authority. Today we are discussing water and wastewater infrastructure. Does the Minister think it is right that people in my constituency have serious issues with the water going into the ground? It is not right and there needs to be investment and action now. These waste facilities should be shut down.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I am delighted to have the privilege of being the first speaker on her watch.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> I support the motion. I want to speak specifically about my constituency, which includes north and east Cork. In the first instance, I will speak for Mitchelstown. I have had engagement for quite some time with Cork County Council, Irish Water and local business interests in respect of the need to ensure the planned wastewater treatment plant upgrade will take place as soon as possible and, in the absence of this taking place within the next one to three years, the need for an interim solution to find capacity within the existing infrastructure so that planning and development can take place in Mitchelstown.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> It is vital that Irish Water, Cork County Council and local industry interests, which are also vital to the community, come together to ensure an interim solution can be found so we can begin building houses again. If capacity could be found within the existing infrastructure, either by increasing the capacity of the existing wastewater treatment plant or by looking at the licensing arrangement on the outflow pipe, we could start to develop housing, residential properties and homes for people in towns such as Mitchelstown, which so badly needs them.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I am happy to say the quality of my engagement with Irish Water, Cork County Council and local business leaders has intensified in recent months. I am hopeful that, short of building the new wastewater treatment plant, an interim solution using the existing infrastructure can, in the short term, result in an agreement between all the vital stakeholders, including Irish Water, Cork County Council, Dairygold, Ornua and the big industrial complexes vital to the future of Mitchelstown. I hope a way forward can be found under the existing infrastructure, resulting in the development of housing so that people can get on the housing ladder, footfall can be created in the town, businesses can continue to flourish and operate and more school places can be developed. If the town is to develop, it needs an upgrade of the existing plant as an interim solution prior to the next investment coming down the track. If this can be done as a short-term measure, it would provide massive alleviation to the people of Mitchelstown. It would also allow businesses to keep going and local developers to develop and build houses. This is what we want to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> I am happy a solution is being worked on and it is a live process. I am hopeful there will be a positive outcome in the coming weeks that will at least allow business activity to start and allow developers to start turning sods and reignite planning applications. It would give them cover to be able to do so. If they are to flourish, towns such as Mitchelstown need an influx of new housing, new people and new generations to be created to ensure their future viability. I hope something can be done, and we are actively working on finding an interim solution. I am devoting a lot of my time and energy towards giving effect to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> I also want to speak about Glanworth. I welcome the engagement I have had so far with Irish Water in respect of the 2.3 km of water main that has been identified for rehabilitation. It is important that we acknowledge the €160,000 that has been allocated for 2021. I ask Irish Water to prioritise Glanworth. It is another important area that has been the subject of many breaks and leakages over recent years. While the citizens of Glanworth welcome the investment of €160,000, they want to see the upgrade of the 2.3 km of water main so this issue can be finally solved and put to bed. I continue to implore, ask and lobby in every way I can to ensure Glanworth is also seen to.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> I also welcome the fact that works are taking place in Mallow. They will go a long way towards alleviating the sewerage issues in my home town. They will also ensure Mallow is given a chance to develop in a way that ensures no impediment is put in the way of future housing development. It is vital that towns such as Mallow, which is designated in the national planning framework, are given a chance to develop. As with Mitchelstown and all the towns in my constituency, we want to see responsible development. We want to see proper capacity being built to ensure that towns can flourish, local businesses and schools all benefit and we have the intergenerational flow that is vital and checks the balance of regional development against everything flowing towards the eastern seaboard. If towns such as Mallow are to flourish, it is vital that they have the infrastructure to go with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> I continue to work on a solution for Mitchelstown with Irish Water, Cork County Council and the other stakeholders. I hope we can find an interim solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">It is vital that the licence is looked at in some way, shape or form in the future with a view to increasing the outflow capacity, so that when the new treatment plant is built there are no further issues down the line regarding outflow. We must ensure that there is development in Mitchelstown, that we can build houses there and that local, intergenerational, family-run businesses are given a fighting change. We must ensure that young people who want to buy homes where they have grown up, work, live and have family links are not impeded in any way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_208">I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this most important motion, which the Social Democrats fully support.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> The final draft of the Cork county development plan is open for consultation at the moment. Its section on water services is a stark warning of the investment needed in our drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure. Out of 42 towns and villages, 22 are listed as having no capacity to process wastewater, three have some capacity and six may have capacity, depending on the Irish Water investment plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> It is not just an issue for small villages with limited treatment plants. Major towns are classified as having a strategic infrastructure deficit. Kinsale, with a population of more than 5,000 and plans for 2,000 more people, has no capacity. There have been problems with discharges from the Dunmanway wastewater treatment plant and overflows from the pumping station going back years. In addition, future developments in Bandon, Bantry and Skibbereen are dependent on works on water treatment facilities and Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> Drinking water is also a significant issue. Clonakilty is facing considerable challenges in meeting its current water supply needs, without taking into consideration the estimated 800 new homes it needs to meet population growth. The town's population was impacted by a drought in 2018, a weather event that will only increase in occurrence with climate change. Castletownbere is also affected. The main source of water, Glenbeg Lough, is in a special area of conservation, limiting the supply, and the water treatment works have leakages and are in poor condition. The county development plan highlights this as a significant barrier to new developments in the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> This is a snapshot of one constituency but, as my fellow rural Deputies have outlined, it is a major challenge which impacts many communities and restricts planned developments. The motion forwarded by the Regional Group rightly calls for a strategic plan to make regional development a reality by investing in water and wastewater infrastructure in our towns and villages.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> I have repeatedly brought up the need for greater investment in our water services in this House. In particular, I have highlighted the disgraceful conditions in Belgooly and Shannonvale. Malodours from the wastewater treatment plant in Belgooly are so bad that at times people have to keep their windows closed and cannot let their children out to play. Many want to move, but the smell has lowered the value of their homes. In Shannonvale, there is a green space that used to be the heart of the village. Now it is unsafe and unusable because of a wastewater plant that floods the area. This has been going on for so long that it is almost an intergenerational problem. The council and Irish Water have introduced stop-gap measures, but when temporary responses stretch over years and generations, it is time for action.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I have had extensive and very productive meetings with Irish Water, which has highlighted the need for more investment. It rightly has to prioritise the most pressing wastewater treatment projects, but this means that the likes of Shannonvale are overlooked time and again. We need the type of strategic investment that this motion calls for to ensure that all communities receive the safe and effective services to which they are entitled. From an environmental and health perspective, the very least people should expect is the proper treatment of wastewater and household sewage. However, years of underinvestment in water infrastructure have left communities and areas exposed to discharges and malodour. </p>
          <p eId="para_215"> The EPA's Water Quality in Ireland 2013-2018 report found that almost half of our rivers, lakes, and estuaries are ecologically unsatisfactory. Waste water discharge is listed as one of the main causes of this deterioration, after agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Proper investment in water infrastructure is essential to human and environmental health, and it is a fundamental factor in determining the development of our rural communities. We need sufficient safe drinking water. We need to be assured that our wastewater is being treated properly. We need the Government to act now.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_217">I thank the Regional Group for bringing this most important motion forward. It reflects the underinvestment in this important sector over the lifetime of many governments and over generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> In 2019, the European Court of Justice found that Ireland had failed to uphold EU law in respect of almost 30 wastewater treatment schemes across the country, including in Arklow in my home county of Wicklow. A report by the EPA in 2019 found that raw sewage was flowing into rivers and seas in 33 places across Ireland. That is the equivalent of wastewater coming from 78,000 people across the country. As a result, Ireland was threatened with heavy fines for breaching EU rules on sewage treatment. Out of that came a commitment from Government and Irish Water to put in place a wastewater treatment plan across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Arklow was then identified by the EPA as an area where wastewater is discharged into the Avoca River without any treatment, which is causing untold environmental damage to the surrounding area. As recently as last night, I was sent some images from a resident in Arklow that showed absolutely awful conditions in the river. The images showed brown scum floating down the river, which really should be a central feature of Arklow. The river is the jewel in the town's crown and we are treating it like it is a sewer. It is completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The Government and Irish Water committed to funding the construction of a wastewater treatment plant, something that local residents were delighted to hear after a 30-year battle to address the problem. Anyone who has been to Arklow will note the huge potential of the area. There is a lot of work under way in the town. There are many large-scale infrastructures being developed, including an offshore wind park, the flood relief scheme and remediation works being carried out at the Avoca mines, as well as the long-awaited, much-needed wastewater treatment plant. Arklow was also recently chosen as Wicklow's decarbonisation zone in recognition of its potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Leading in large-scale development and climate action, Arklow has a lot going for it. However, this rests on the timely construction of this wastewater treatment plant. Housing development, environmental protection and decarbonisation all require that water pollution is managed sustainably. It is also important that it is done as quickly as possible. In that context, I have been very vocal about the concerns that ministerial consent has still not been provided for this fundamental project, despite the need for it. Irish Water applied for this ministerial consent in November 2020 and the plan is sitting on the Minister's desk for approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> I welcome the Minister's assertions that he is conducting due diligence on this plan. We all expect that to happen. We know that the plan and the consent is under active consideration. However, there are a lot of steps that need to be taken before work can start on this wastewater treatment plant. These steps need to be taken as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> With so much uncertainty in recent years about this project, it is important that there are no additional delays and that certainty and clarity is provided to the residents who are to benefit from this project. While I am conscious that this is a large-scale project that requires ministerial sign-off on all aspects of it and I believe that it is necessary for the Minister to stand over it, I hope the Minister will give this project the priority it deserves. The project needs to be delivered in a transparent manner, with continued communication with the local residents in Arklow so that they know what to expect and when to expect it.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> I would also like to acknowledge other Irish Water investment in our wastewater treatment infrastructure, including the recent announcement of an upgrade to Aughrim's wastewater treatment plant, as well as in other small towns and villages across the county. Blessington will also get a much-needed upgrade. I welcome the work that Irish Water is doing in respect of some parts of the infrastructure in County Wicklow. However, the work must be expedited. Focus should be placed on areas of the project that are within our control. In respect of the issue of ministerial consent, the Minister should focus on it, expedite it and make sure that Arklow gets its wastewater treatment plant as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">I thank the Regional Group for putting forward this motion. We need to go back a few years to the major row that occurred in this country between the Government and the population over water charges. What came out of that was a vote in this Chamber in 2017 which fudged the whole issue. The main fudging was in respect of the question of public ownership of water utilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">There is a Bill before the House to provide for a referendum on the public ownership of water to avoid, forever, the possibility of the privatisation of water services, but that has been left sitting on a shelf.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> Here is the root of a big mistake by the Government. After a major campaign to defeat water charges and the election to this House of a number of Deputies, including me, by the communities we represented during that campaign, the Government just let it sit. Now, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage wants to rush through the ending of service level agreements for workers, which were guaranteed until 2025. He wants to end them by the beginning of next year and transfer all local authority workers to Irish Water as a single utility. It is not going to happen. I have never seen as much sentiment in resistance to being forcibly moved from a public sector job to a private utility. I will quote the workers at the recent Fórsa conference: "If workers are forced to transfer to Irish Water against their will, their anger and alienation will create a failed entity, a mortally-wounded service, and a public policy debacle to dwarf previous protests over water charges."</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> That follows hot on the heels of an OECD report, which states that the Government has to consider the reintroduction of water charges. Interestingly, the same OECD report also recommended, with regard to the environment, that the Government set a specific target to reduce biomethane associated with the size of the livestock herd in this country. That is not mentioned at all. All the Government mentions is the reintroduction of water charges because, yet again, it wants to make ordinary people pay through the nose so it can privatise this utility. Therein lies the problem. There is a tension between outsourcing to private entities the work that must be done on wastewater and the provision of water services throughout the country and running it through the local authorities. The local authorities have been stripped of their power and their funding. To give Members an idea of what that means, the EU average spend on local authority funding is 22% of government budgets, while in Ireland it is 8%. They should think about that the next time they see smelly water running down the streets of Arklow, Cahersiveen or anywhere else. It is deliberately underfunding the local authorities in order to privatise.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">There have been decades of underinvestment in our water infrastructure. That underinvestment continues, and the danger is that it will be used as another excuse to try to introduce water charges, which still will not resolve the underinvestment. Last week, the OECD called for the reintroduction of water charges in Ireland. In case the Government gets the wrong idea, it must be put on notice that any attempt to reintroduce water charges will be met with a massive campaign of boycott and people power that will bring the Government down. People know that water charges have nothing to do with conservation and everything to do with privatisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> When the Labour Party and Fine Gael attempted to introduce this austerity tax, they managed to waste hundreds of millions of euro on PR, consultants and unnecessary water meters. That money would have been much better spent on fixing the creaking water network and installing district meters to detect leaks. Instead of austerity charges on working people, we must tackle the big business water wasters, including the data centres, which can use up to 4.5 million litres of water per day. Instead of greenwashing austerity, we should tax the billionaires who have profited from the Covid-19 crisis and invest that money in a green jobs programme, including upgrading the water network.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> There is a question to be posed. Why is the Government refusing to hold a referendum to prohibit privatisation of our water services? This was a major demand of the movement five years ago. It was something the Government at the time said it had no problem with and supported, yet five years later it still has not been done. It poses the question of whether the Government and right-wing parties are still harbouring pipe dreams of selling the water network in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Now the Government is facing serious industrial action by water workers, as it attempts to force them out of their current jobs in the councils into the Irish Water semi-State body. These workers, correctly, have major fears about the long-term impact of this on their rights and conditions at work and a continuing fear that Irish Water could be sold to Denis O'Brien, Veolia or some other private company down the road. The Government should drop this hare-brained scheme, keep the workers where they are, protect their terms and conditions and, finally, hold the referendum to prohibit privatisation of our water services and invest in fixing our water infrastructure.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">When the OECD said recently that Ireland should reintroduce water charges, the Taoiseach was very quick out of the traps to say he ruled it out categorically. He did that for a couple of reasons. First, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had their fingers badly burned in the past decade when there was a mass movement against water charges. Second, I believe and hope there is an understanding that the reintroduction of water charges in the 2020s would make what happened in the past decade look like a tea party.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> However, I wish to warn the Taoiseach and the Government on two matters. First, the excessive use charge can amount to a charge of €500 on a household. It also has the potential to be a water charge for large numbers of people through the back door if the thresholds are pushed downward. I can guarantee that any attempt by the Government to take that road will meet with a major reaction. Second, the OECD report did not just refer to water charges; it also called for increased waste charges and carbon tax, for people to be made to pay for their parking at work and so forth. Again, I warn the Government that any attempt to make working people carry the can for the environmental crisis that has fundamentally been caused by the big business polluters will not wash and will meet with a reaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Our water and water treatment services must be in public ownership. That referendum must go forward. If the local authority workers take industrial action to defend their jobs and to stay in a council, as opposed to being pushed into Irish Water, a company that could be privatised, they will have my full support and, I am confident, the support of the working people of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> In conclusion, we need a Covid-19 wealth tax. That would be the source of increased funding in water and water treatment services, not water charges on the backs of ordinary people.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">I thank the Regional Group for tabling this important motion. It states that 35 towns and villages across the State continue to discharge raw sewage into nearby waters, according to a recent EPA report. That figure is far lower than I expected because many towns in my constituency of Cork South-West are suffering that sad fate. Obviously, the politicians on the ground, be they Deputies or Senators, have made a great deal of noise that something will be done, but decades later nothing has happened in some of these towns and villages.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> I have serious concerns about places such as Castletownshend in west Cork. It is a beautiful place in which to live permanently or to holiday. There are lovely outlets and beautiful pubs. People love taking holidays there. However, its sewerage system is a disgrace and has not been upgraded. It is the same in my home town of Goleen. It is a stunning place to visit, but the raw sewage going into the sea is an outrageous situation, despite the efforts made by the community in Goleen and the community council. We spent fortunes and brought home people who had property there to try to work towards a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Communities are seeking solutions. It is the same in Ballinspittle, and I note that somebody is willing to work on the solution in that area. I do not know who is in charge in Irish Water as the impression I am given is that nobody is in charge. I cannot present a solution to Irish Water, despite the fact that it will cost very little. Only a little co-operation is required so everybody can work together in a place like Ballinspittle, where there is a need for extra housing and a proper solution. Nothing is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> I am also worried about water supplies in Clonakilty, a thriving town with building ongoing. I see that if we had a very dry summer, the town could run out of water. It is scandalous that something like this could happen in one of the biggest towns in the country, leaving it on a wing and a prayer, hoping everything goes right. We must have a system that works and if communities are willing to work with Irish Water, they should be pushed up the ladder in getting water and sewerage systems in place. The motion is about raising that awareness and I appreciate that. I thank the Regional Group for allowing us the opportunity to speak to it today.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">I also thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this very important motion. It is time we got our act together on this, as we need to do with housing. I have been involved with this a long time and have seen schemes like Skeheenarinky, where delivery took 50 years. It was so slow the county sent a report to the relevant Department and it had to wait six months for a reply. The process of going up and down continued, taking six months each time. It is tomfoolery and now Irish Water has been introduced into the mix. It is a merry-go-round and the process has got slower.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> There is a figure in the motion and there is a similar number in Tipperary. Sewage is destroying rivers and farmers are then accused of doing this, when the vast majority of them do their very best. They are good in dealing with the environment and nurture it. They resent being blackguarded. I have seen people from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, standing on my bridge in Newcastle, and I told them to go 400 yd below the plant, where raw sewage is going into the river. Along with Newcastle there is Burncourt, Golden, Donaskeagh, Mullinahone and Grangemockler. I could stay naming them all day. They might have a septic tank, perhaps bigger than that of a domestic house, but where 200 houses may have to go. There may be no sewage treatment at all and it goes straight into rivers. It is criminal and the EPA will not challenge the county councils. Its personnel come out quickly to anybody else if there is an accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> I resent a previous speaker talking about smelly water running through a village. Does she know about it? She does not. The people in rural areas are being stigmatised. It was the same with septic tank charges that were introduced. Most people I know of want to keep their septic tanks working right but the arms of the State are incompetent and too unwieldy or slow. There is another plank with Irish Water.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Public private partnerships were good and delivered schemes in my area, including in Ardfinnan, Clogheen and Ballyporeen, as well as Cahir town, but they are at capacity and we cannot build another house in those villages. We need to look seriously at this. We must get real and have departmental officials cutting out half the red tape. There are multiple stages and Government politicians announce each of them but nothing is happening. People have been so frustrated but they want to pay their way. All the private houses must pay for their water, particularly if they have pumps and their own septic tank systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> The idea that water is free is a myth because we know it is so hard to get it treated and pumped. Now we have the madness of taking water from the Shannon through Tipperary and many other counties to Dublin, which will destroy the environment. There is 50% leakage in Dublin. Kindergarten children would not put up with this.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I thank the Regional Group and Deputy Naughten for giving us the opportunity to speak about this very important matter. At the outset I will contradict a comment made by Deputy Bríd Smith to the effect that smelly water is running down the streets of Cahersiveen. She can look after her constituency and I will look after the people of Cahersiveen.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> Irish Water is only obliged to keep current schemes up to standard and nothing compels it to build new schemes. Irish Water has said it does not have the money to do it. We were promised a scheme for Kilcummin and after 22 years we will get part of it. There is no scheme in Currow, Scartaglen, Caherdaniel, Beaufort or Cromane. Several schemes must be extended and improved, including Castleisland, Brosna, Kenmare and Fenit. Commercial and housing developments are all held up because of a lack of proper infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> Water is a basic human right in a civilised world. People who want to get water through a group scheme can end up paying anything up to €13,000 and that is after getting the grant. There is a scheme in east Kerry and each house in it must pay €10,692 to Kerry County Council. Lo and behold, Irish Water is now looking for €2,262 on top of that. We are talking about water but this is what the people must pay in a group water scheme. There are five schemes in mid Kerry, east Kerry, north Kerry and even south Kerry. They are all over the county. We must look at how these people are being charged on the double because it is not fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> There are antiquated water systems in other places, with pipes breaking day after day. If not for Mr. Freddie Bartlett and his team working day and night to restore water in these places, there would be no water in mid Kerry in places like the board of works road, Pallas and Faha. We welcome that 1.2 km of pipework will be replaced on the board of works road but another kilometre must be done and we must get funding for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> These are very serious matters and I ask the Minister to take this to the Cabinet to ensure infrastructure in Kerry is brought up to standard. The people in Kerry are entitled to good clean water from an uninterrupted source the very same way as the people in Dublin 4 are.</p>

          <p eId="para_253">I thank the Acting Chairman and wish her good luck in her new role. As a Member of the European Parliament, I received a constant stream of complaints from all over 15 counties about a totally inadequate system of water and wastewater provision. Ireland was dragged kicking and screaming to the European Court of Justice and heavily fined for basically allowing its own people to be poisoned. Subsequently we handed over a seriously underfunded and wholly inadequate water and wastewater system to Irish Water, which does not have adequate resources to upgrade these systems. In that context, I fully support the proposal in this motion that the Government must put in place a transparent cost structure for new and extensions to existing water and wastewater treatment plants.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> Another crucial matter for so many people is the provision of wastewater systems for rural one-off houses. In many parts of the constituency I represent we have the march of Sitka spruce across the horizon. In County Leitrim in particular, it is virtually impossible to get planning for a one-off rural house. Almost 87% of the soil in Leitrim fails to meet the accepted percolation tests required by the EPA. The number of one-off houses being built in Leitrim could be counted on one hand. As Deputy Martin Kenny mentioned earlier, outside Carrick-on-Shannon, there is a case of raw sewage entering the Shannon from a housing development.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> A football club in south Leitrim, Ballinaglera, has issued a stark warning about the future of rural clubs in Leitrim. It has said the current position is sucking the lifeblood from communities like Ballinaglera and its analysis indicates the number of clubs in the county could halve in the near future. There is an initiative under way that is being pushed by Leitrim County Council and all four Oireachtas Members representing the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">We met the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, who was in the House earlier, to explore the unacceptable situation in Leitrim where basically no one-off housing can be built. The proposal is to look at a fresh design of the willow-based evapotranspiration system to solve the problem. He expressed his willingness to work with us and to share costs. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, to convey to the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, that this matter is of the utmost urgency. An EPA research programme must be put in place immediately, along with a pilot programme for homeowners to start building. This would be a minimal step forward, but at least if that were happening now people would have something to hold on to. This has been one of the most important issues for County Leitrim for the past 20 years. If the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, were here, I would ask him to be the person to bring forward finally a workable solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">I thank the Regional Group for the opportunity to contribute on this issue and for putting the spotlight on sustainable development for our regional and rural areas. I will start from the motion's last sentence, just as Deputy Harkin did, which calls on the Government "to put in place a transparent cost structure for new, and extensions to existing, water and waste water treatment infrastructure". It is an absolute necessity and it must be done urgently. I support the motion in general, although if I have time I will return to one part where there is a call for "a development lead infrastructure scheme to fast track infrastructural development in our towns and villages". I may come back to that aspect, although I have only four minutes. I express caution as to what that term means. If I read it in a benign way, it is excellent. However, if I interpret it differently, it is to get around a planning process, and I would have serious concerns in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Turning to Irish Water and the comments made in that regard, I proudly co-signed a Bill in November 2016 to ensure that water was owned by the people of Ireland. That and subsequent Bills have gone nowhere, but that will be the first step in creating confidence and trust. If the Minister of State has any influence, it would be a wonderful legacy if we had a constitutional amendment stating we own the water. It belongs to all of us, and it is as essential as air and we cannot live without it. We have all quoted the EPA. I am ashamed that we are still quoting the EPA. In my town, raw sewage is released into our waters every day from 35 towns and villages, including Spiddal, Carrowroe, Roundstone, etc. Progress has been made in some places but not in others. Treatment at 19 of the State's 172 large urban areas failed the EU's mandatory standards set to protect the environment. Those 19 plants generate more than half of Ireland's sewage. We could go on. </p>
          <p eId="para_259"> What has happened? First, we should not have a kind of ground-zero memory. We should go back and realise that development was going in a particular direction, one which was unsustainable and has had detrimental effects on our country. We must learn from the pandemic to go a different way. We talk about transformative change and, indeed, we are now hearing that we are working from home and we have gteics all over Connemara and other rural areas. Those are very welcome, but with that we need a commitment from the Government for balanced regional and rural development, which is not evident on the ground. It is certainly not evident in Connemara or in Kilmaine and Shrule, south Mayo, which is part of the Galway West constituency. </p>
          <p eId="para_260"> I am tired of the blame being attached to Irish Water. It should never have been created. Now that it has, we must ensure that the water is owned by the people of Ireland. If Irish Water is going to manage it, then so be it. It must have transparency so that it comes under the auspices of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General. There is no monitoring of Irish Water now. It was set up so that it could be distant from us and we could blame it. We ran down the local authorities. County Galway has the local authority with the lowest level of funding in the country. It has no manager but has had an acting manager for years. There is no one to lead. That is what we have done to our local authority system. We have handed over to Irish Water all the expertise and memory that existed, and we are now left with a mess. </p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Therefore, I support this motion. I hope it is the start of a frank and open discussion and not the demonisation of those people and organisations that make submissions in respect of planning applications, such as An Taisce, for example. The planning system has worked, as long as it is resourced and adequately funded. Everybody, including An Taisce and me, is entitled to make submissions on any planning permission application. The planning system should be so robust that it will be capable of dealing with those submissions in a timely manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">I thank the Acting Chairman and I wish her all the best in her role. It is great to see a constituency colleague taking the Chair.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> I will address some of the issues raised since I took over this part of the debate. Deputies Sherlock, Whitmore and Cairns commented on specific deficits in Mitchelstown, Arklow and Kinsale. Those points are noted. Deputies Connolly and Bríd Smith raised the issue of the public ownership of Irish Water. Certainly, Irish Water is a public utility. The issue of a referendum will hopefully be dealt with in the context of the programme for Government. Once the electoral commission is established later this year, it will be tasked with considering the various referendums scheduled in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Issues were also raised regarding the situation in Clonakilty by Deputy Michael Collins and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae. Deputy Healy-Rae is correct, and I hope we will meet with that body soon. Deputy Harkin then brought up the matter of one-off rural housing, specifically in County Leitrim. The preference should be to cluster housing developments around village settlements where they will be connected to sustainable water and wastewater infrastructure. A pilot for that willow-based evapotranspiration system is being considered. Those are some of the issues which have been raised since I joined the debate. </p>
          <p eId="para_265"> I thank the Deputies for providing their insights on water and wastewater services, particularly in the context of supporting the sustainable growth of towns and villages. Secure, resilient drinking water supplies and sustainable wastewater treatment for households and businesses are not just critical to public health, the environment, economic output, biodiversity and quality of life; they are also fundamental to underpinning the growth of sustainable communities. The availability of water and wastewater services is a basic necessity. It facilitates growth and development, the successful delivery of housing and the protection of water and our environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> Since its establishment in 2014, Irish Water has developed long-term approaches to address strategically the deficiencies in the public wastewater system. It is optimising investment decisions to ensure that it utilises capital efficiently by making investments that deliver the best possible improvements for communities. Building water treatments plants and upgrading or building necessary sewerage networks will require significant and intensive long-term investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> The programme for Government commits to funding Irish Water's capital investment plan for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis and to deliver the €8.5 billion funding package that was committed to for water investment in Project Ireland 2040. Ensuring substantial and sustained investment by Irish Water over several investment cycles is important in respect of addressing existing infrastructural deficits, accommodating population growth and building resilience in the face of climate change. It is also critical if we are to ensure compliance with relevant EU directives, which is an area where Ireland has struggled. I am determined to steer Ireland on a more sustainable path in that regard, and I know we are eager as a people to get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> The Government's second-cycle River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021 set out new measures and implementation structures to improve water quality in our groundwater, rivers, lakes and estuarine and coastal waters. The new revised third-cycle river basin management plan in 2022 must ensure strengthened protection for Ireland's water quality and that we have a well protected environment and vibrant communities for future generations. By working coherently, we can achieve better environmental outcomes together.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> Having adequate water and wastewater infrastructure that is properly maintained and enhanced on an ongoing basis is an essential component of delivering sustainable housing for all, as set out in the programme for Government. By ensuring that the right water and wastewater infrastructure is in place at the right time, we can meet the housing objectives of the programme for Government. Irish Water is continuing to work closely with local authorities across the country, ensuring that investment supports the growth of identified settlements, where these are prioritised in line with local authority development plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The significance of the small towns and villages growth programme is that it is led by local authorities from the ground up. This is a key element of the programme because the local authorities have the expert knowledge of the local areas and, more importantly, the elected members decide on how they are strategically planning for the local areas through the development planning process. I know the role of local authorities has been raised. I believe this is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> Irish Water intends to make further announcements as it continues its analysis of projects submitted by local authorities. Importantly, Irish Water will also be proposing a continuation of this programme to the CRU for the next regulatory control period, from 2025 to 2029. There is, therefore, a funding plan for progressive upgrades to wastewater treatment plants in small towns and villages.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> The Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025, published by my Department, provides clear direction to strategic planning and decision-making on water and wastewater services in Ireland. The statement's three thematic objectives of quality, conservation and future-proofing are aligned with the national development plan, the national planning framework and the river basin management plan for Ireland. Irish Water's investment plans are framed in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> The national planning framework 2018 to 2040 supports proportionate growth of rural towns and a programme for new homes in small towns and villages, with local authorities and public infrastructure agencies providing the serviced sites with appropriate infrastructure, to attract people to build their own homes and live in these areas. Ensuring funding for the provision of water services under the national development plan to the end of this decade will be key in realising both the national planning objectives and strategic outcomes of the national planning framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> As mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, my Department is responsible for the formulation and delivery of funding for the rural water programme. This programme, through Exchequer funding, delivers improvements to private domestic water and wastewater services in areas of rural Ireland where there are no public water or wastewater services. A total of €75 million in capital funding has been committed for the programme under the national development plan. This supports significant capital investment to support group water schemes in rural areas, a grant scheme to support rural communities to link the public drinking water and wastewater network and financial support in respect of domestic wastewater treatment systems and domestic wells.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> Under Our Rural Future - Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, my Department has committed to "Review the situation in relation to water services for towns and villages that are not currently on the Irish Water network". The Department is currently preparing a report on this topic for submission to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, later this year. The report will include an analysis of the results of a survey which is currently being completed by all rural local authorities. The purpose of the survey is to establish the numbers, size, national distribution and other environmental impacts for villages and smaller settlements that do not have wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure provided by Irish Water. These rural towns and villages are vital hubs for local commercial and social activity and are a part of the wider fabric of Ireland's unique settlement pattern. The Department's initiative is significant in the context of the important work currently under way to finalise the review of the national development plan.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_277">First, I want to give full credit to the Regional Group and Ms Cáit Nic Amhlaoibh for developing and bringing this really important Private Members' motion to the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> Water is a building block of life and the provision of adequate water infrastructure is the building block of a functional society. Wastewater treatment services are vital for nearly every part of Irish society. The political heat has obviously gone out of water since the days of the Fine Gael and Labour Party water tax but it is still incredibly relevant for many people's lives. I was chair of the Meath water rights campaign back in the day and I echo the call for funding for water infrastructure to come from central government and not from water taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> Ireland is in a housing crisis, yet significant housing developments in many parts of the country are being held up by the lack of water services. A significant portion of housebuilding is not happening right across towns and villages in Ireland due to the lack of water services. This is particularly acute in rural and regional Ireland. People also forget that investment in infrastructure is significantly dependent on a functional water infrastructure. Vast swathes of regional and rural Ireland simply do not have that infrastructure, and therefore, do not have the necessary investment in jobs and development. It is often an invisible reason for the lack of jobs going into regional and rural Ireland but it is a significant element of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> Even the housing estates that are built are still waiting for connections to the water infrastructure. More than 500 estates are currently waiting for connections to public water mains. Ireland is developing into a city state. We have had significantly lopsided development in Ireland for the last 20 or 30 years. Some 50% of the population, and more than 50% of the industrial output of this country, will actually come from the greater Dublin region soon. Much of Ireland is being turned into a commuter belt. Unless we get real with regard to the provision of water services around the country, this will continue to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> The existing water services are creaking at the seams. It is shocking that 35 towns and villages have raw sewage flowing into rivers, lakes and coastal waters. Another 78 treatment plants are currently overloaded and regularly discharge into the system. Some 40% of the water in Dublin is leaking out of the pipes at the moment. The Government's unbelievably crazy solution to that is bringing water from the Shannon river basin right across the country into Dublin. Mark my words: it will be a children's hospital mark 2 with regard to runaway budgets into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> In my county of Meath, unbelievably, a meat factory is currently seeking to discharge waste into the River Boyne. Even though the river is a source of water for approximately 25,000 homes in east Meath, this factory is seeking to discharge its waste into it. The river is also a wonderful centre of wildlife. I have been campaigning for approximately 13 years for it to be created into a heritage greenway. Can anybody imagine the damage that putting further pollution into the river would do? I thank Mr. Peter Whelan, the Slane Aontú representative, for his work against that particular proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> I recently tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, and perhaps the Minister of State might help with this, on whether the effluent being discharged from Tara Mines into the River Boyne daily is within the public health limits. Tara Mines is a really important source of jobs for our county but we need to make sure its impact into the water system does not negatively affect people living around it.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> My town of Navan was for years known as "Alice Springs" because every year we could be guaranteed that water mains would burst, streets would be closed and houses would be flooded. Aontú's Trim representative, Mr. Jack Lynch, and I have been in contact with Irish Water on several occasions because the whole of south Meath is under major pressure with regard to water. Ballivor was without water for much of the winter and Trim was the same. Incredibly, when we contacted and met with Irish Water, it told us the reason there is so little water is that people are working from home and there is a 15% increase in demand for water in homes. This was at the same time that the River Boyne - the source of the water - was bursting its banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Investment in water infrastructure is often ignored, especially coming up to elections. Capital investment in infrastructure is massively important for the development of our country in the future, however. It should not take second place in the debates or in the Government's focus. I support wholeheartedly the Regional Group's call for this Government to get real with regard to investment in water.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">I thank all Members of the House and all political parties this morning for supporting this motion, and the Government for agreeing to accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Will the Ministers of State, Deputies Noonan and Peter Burke, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, facilitate a meeting with the Regional Group further to this motion where we might be given an unvarnished and unbiased assessment of Irish Water and how we might help?</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> The past 15 months have proved challenging for the country. Covid has exposed many national vulnerabilities. One of the burning issues that were topical in the pre-Covid economy was water. It is now back on the agenda. Global warming advances the value of water as a national resource. In Ireland, we have had a casual relationship with water, believing that it falls from the sky and just meanders into our faucets, but that is not the case. Water is a resource and it needs to be managed and paid for. We need not make a scientific conundrum of the issue, but we nevertheless must not think of it as a simple activity that can be achieved for nothing. Water and its supply, filtration and treatment have significant implications for the future economic well-being of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> We have an overburdened water supply and sewerage infrastructure that is creaking at the seams. We have continuing problems in trying to manage water hygiene for domestic and commercial purposes as well as providing efficient wastewater capture and treatment. All these activities require ongoing investment. The adequate provision of clean water and the associated management of wastewater treatment is having a significant effect on the budgets and development plans of our local authorities. Water and wastewater services provision is now dictating housing location, housing densities and housing affordability and is having a detrimental impact on rural planning and development, as new regulations are significantly adding to the cost of building houses, including one-off developments. I am aware of a builder in my constituency of Waterford who was asked to pay a connection fee of €30,000 per unit by Irish Water to add extra housing to an existing developed site. The reason given was the cost of upgrading sewerage piping. When the developer told Irish Water that this would make the development unviable, he was told that Irish Water's remit was only to recover the costs of its project. This scenario is playing out in every county and is having a significant effect on regional planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> I do not fully understand the cost structures that exist within Irish Water, but I understand that there is a cost price after which the value of something has to be questioned and often cannot be justified. Water provision is not a luxury purchase in this country. Rather, it is a necessity and its competitive provision is directly related to our economic competitiveness nationally, particularly as an exporting nation. We need adequate water treatment and its provision to be economically competitive and socially sustainable. We need a transparent cost structure in Irish Water that underpins water service provision regardless of in which part of the country one lives. We must never privatise our national water services, but we must utilise all of the learned efficiencies and intersect with private sector contractors to ensure that the State gets maximum value for money in the provision and development of water and wastewater services.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> In regional and rural Ireland, we need planning authority acceptance of private water schemes and private effluent treatment systems and a willingness to incorporate reed bed filtration as a suitable effluent treatment for small housing clusters. "Homeworking" is the new buzzword in the economy, but we cannot have suitable homeworking without addressing many of the country's infrastructural gaps. The provision of water and wastewater services is a significant such gap. We need to reassess the importance of adequate and well-managed water systems in our towns, villages and communities. We need the Government to reassess the investment it is willing to make in this precious commodity such that the commodity can deliver the greatest financial and social benefits to the people of Ireland regardless of where they live. This is the basis of the Regional Group's motion. I thank all Members for respectfully accepting it and I look forward to engaging with the Government and Regional Group colleagues on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I will make a final comment. Two thousand years ago, the Romans had an efficient wastewater and water supply management system. Surely with all the technology now available to us, we can achieve the same outcome.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_294">The Government had two options last night - to propose a meaningful plan to stop cuckoo funds snapping up family homes and pushing ordinary homebuyers out of the market or to tinker around the edges with measures that would have no real impact on the funds and not fix the problem faced by people desperately seeking to put an affordable roof over their heads. The Government made its choice, and we again see that wealthy investment funds and big developers always come out on top with Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> People had low expectations of what the Government would do last night, given that it has supported these funds for years, but it has defied even those low expectations. It has done the bare minimum. The proposal to pitch stamp duty at 10% is too low. These wealthy investment funds will easily absorb that additional cost across their long-term investments. Stamp duty is the only tax measure the Government has touched. Some of these funds are the largest residential landlords in the State, yet they do not pay a cent on their rental incomes. One fund, IRES, paid zero in tax on the €75 million that it generated in rents last year, yet the Government will still allow such funds to get away with that while they charge our people extortionate, eye-watering rents. It is little wonder that IRES's share price rose by 2.6% overnight following the Government's announcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> The Government has excluded homes that are not houses. Apartments have been left out. That is half of all homes built in Dublin last year and six out of seven homes in the city overall. It is open season on those. The Government has essentially waved the white flag of surrender and abandoned people in the cities and suburbs to the extortionate rents of these investor funds, not just here in Dublin, but in other places such as the Taoiseach's city of Cork. Even where the Government has introduced so-called controls, they have no retrospective effect, meaning they will not make a blind bit of difference to the 80,000 planning permissions already under way. That is another 80,000 houses that homebuyers should have been able to make a pitch for, but they will now lose out to the funds. The cuckoo funds breathed a sigh of relief last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> What the Government has proposed is a recipe for failure. The Taoiseach knows that these measures will not work because they are designed not to work. There is an acid test for the Government's proposal. First, will it reduce the rip-off rents that people pay? The answer is "No". Second, will it reduce house prices? The answer is "No". Third, will it stop investment cuckoo funds buying up family homes? The answer is "No". People expected their Government to step in and stop these funds in their tracks. Instead, what they got was a cop-out. The Government may try to play people who are struggling to buy a home for fools, but they will not be taken in by this.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> Last night, the Government had the opportunity to do the right thing, but it wasted that opportunity. I am asking it to do the right thing today. Do what will work, end all of the tax advantages for these funds, include apartments in these measures, and ensure that measures can be applied retrospectively to stop cuckoos snapping up the 80,000 homes that should and must go to ordinary homebuyers.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_299">I think the Deputy's response is now the typical Sinn Féin response - oppose everything, prevaricate, delay and endeavour to exploit the housing crisis for its own political ends and electoral gain as opposed to coming up with real solutions that matter out there. Our fundamental concern is with young purchasers and other people to enable them to be in a position to buy houses at affordable rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Last night's measures will be effective in that regard. The stamp duty going to 10% is much broader and more effective than the UK situation that Sinn Féin has cited, which, of course, applies to houses that are valued at more than £500,000. That illustrates the lack of detail and attempt to obfuscate, which is now part and parcel of the Sinn Féin presentation on housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> It is remarkable that for the past number of months, the Sinn Féin leader has come in here and attacked investment funds and, week after week, attacked developers and so on, saying that it is all developer-led. What happened last evening? Her party's housing spokesman was on "Prime Time" appealing to all and sundry and saying the party wants more developers. "I welcome developers", he said, and he acknowledged there was a role for investment funds. Sinn Féin is having it each and every way. Which is it, Deputy McDonald? What is the true nature of Sinn Féin housing policy? There are gaps everywhere in the policy and she is not strong on the detail of it. She keeps coming out with big figures for this and that but they are not really grounded in reality in terms of providing housing for people on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> Let us take the scheme the Minister launched this morning in Clondalkin, involving more than 1,200 houses. Sinn Féin held that up for a long time on the basis that it wanted 100% public housing on public lands. The party is very weak on the role of the private sector in getting houses built. It is very weak on the supply question. Its proposals would damage supply in housing and reduce the number of units available to people. The reality is that we are not building enough houses and apartments in this country. Just announcing a figure, as Sinn Féin does, and saying, "Oh, we will do 40,000 this year, just like that", is not grounded in reality, as Deputy McDonald knows. However, that does not matter because her party is not about solving the crisis. It is about exploiting the crisis. That is its agenda at council level and national level and in public discourse.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> Sinn Féin opposes everything. It opposed the help to buy scheme, which has helped 22,000 ordinary people to buy houses. It opposed the Land Development Agency Bill on some narrow ideological basis, even though it will give us the engine and the leverage to get houses built in this country. It opposed the shared equity scheme. It opposed 16 out of 21 development motions on Dublin City Council. The list goes on. Where is the constructive engagement? Where are the real policies from Sinn Féin? I do not see them. What it is proposing in terms of an alternative proposal to the one the Government came up with last night, presented by the Ministers, Deputy Darragh O'Brien and Donohoe, would reduce supply. There are issues in terms of apartments and we acknowledge that. There are issues around financing developments and builders. We need private builders building housing estates and apartments. This is just one measure. The measure is about enabling people to buy houses and duplexes on housing estates and the funds will not compete with them. It is a good structured measure that people feel is sensible and will not have the negative consequence of reducing the supply of apartments in cities, which we need.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">Let me give the Taoiseach some detail and move from the general to the specific to illustrate how flawed the Government's approach is. There is a sale happening as we speak that will see the largest private rental sector portfolio ever put to the market go to sale. It is being developed by Marlet and represents 2,000 homes across six locations here in Dublin: in Harold's Cross, Howth, Dundrum and Lime Street and on the south side docks at Grand Canal. These 2,000 homes will go to private investors. The process is under way. The Government introduced nothing to ensure that young first-time buyers or other homebuyers can get access to purchasing and owning these houses. The Taoiseach says he is for homeownership, yet everything the Government does either locks people out of access to homes because of affordability or locks them into an endless cycle of extortionate rack-renting from international funds.</p>

We need affordable houses and more social houses. Last night is just one measure in regard to one area. The Government is coming up with a range of initiatives in housing, the most important being substantial allocation of funding for the largest ever social housing programme over the next five years. We want to provide 50,000 social houses. The Government has provided €690 million in the 2021 budget for affordability, including for the first national cost rental scheme, which will provide homes at 25% below market price. Those are the kinds of positive measures we are introducing and the Deputy is voting against. Why is she voting against good measures that will provide affordable housing to ordinary people? The affordable housing Bill will do just that. It will introduce the first scheme of direct State-built affordable houses. A total of €310 million has been allocated for the serviced sites fund to deliver approximately 6,200 homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">It is five days since the ransomware attack was revealed. This is escalating into a pretty serious national security crisis and I am not sure it is on the radar to the level it should be. This morning when I was driving up to Dublin, one of my local GPs got in touch. One of his patients had been contacted by a medical organisation from outside the State with all his details as regards a procedure he needed and his medical history. This organisation knew, in effect, exactly what he required medically and was offering, in a short period, to be able to provide the operation he needed because it could see he was not going to get it for some time as a public patient. The family contacted their GP and An Garda Síochána and, in fairness to the GP, he contacted An Garda Síochána. I am not going to get into the details and I do not want to know the details of the individual. If this is happening on any scale throughout the country, we have a big problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> The <i>Financial Times</i> has revealed, and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said he believes the report to be accurate, that 27 files relating to 12 people, including laboratory results, admission records, etc., have been published on the Dark Web. This seems to align very much with the story I heard this morning from the local GP in my county. I want to know what is the plan in this regard and I do not want a generic answer. I say this with a sense of deep worry. As probably the only Deputy in Leinster House who asked about the security of the IT systems in the HSE over a number of years, including, last December, in regard to Windows 7 on 37,000 machines, I want to know what the plan is.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> I have a number of specific questions. There is a duty of care to the tens of thousands of staff of the HSE regarding their personal data. What is the plan in this regard? How should people who are going to be contacted similarly to the person I described be advised in respect of what they should do? Is An Garda Síochána ramped up on this scale or the Data Protection Commissioner? What advice should be given to people? What is being done in regard to the prioritisation of bringing back services? What is the priority list, so that we can give some comfort to people as regards when they can expect services to be back? How do we ensure that the scaling up that is going to be done to deal with this issue is an investment for the future as well, given that I estimate the costs could run to more than €100 million?</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Finally, when will we be able to give guidance to the public as to what to do when they see that potentially their medical information-----</p>

          <p eId="para_320">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I acknowledge his consistency on it. I will say what I have said consistently since this attack. It is a despicable thing to do to attack a health service and to engage in theft of people's personal medical records. This is a criminal enterprise and this is what criminals do in situations like this. We have to be very clear on two things. First, people should contact the Garda if situations such as those the Deputy has outlined arise. The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau is dealing with this issue on the criminal side and from an investigative perspective. The national cybersecurity team is dealing with external support and hundreds of people are working on this right now, and have been since the weekend, with a view to restoring services. The objective is to get services resumed as quickly and as safely as we possibly can. That involves a strongly co-ordinated effort across government and I assure the Deputy that that is happening in co-operation with specialist private sector contractors. That work is under way. We want to get systems, including radiology, diagnostics, maternity services, infant care and radiation oncology, back online. Regarding some of the voluntary hospitals, work is progressing. Vaccination and Covid test and trace are operating without the GP referral system for testing, and people with symptoms may attend test centres without an appointment. The HSE is providing ongoing updates on service availability on its website. We are not engaged, and as a State we cannot become engaged, in rewarding and funding this kind of criminality.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">I take an interest in this. Before I was in politics, I worked as a manager in IT services. I asked those questions about Windows 7, working with some other people, purely because there was a huge risk. Following through on that risk, I understand exactly what the Taoiseach is saying about the volume of information he can give. As for the public's comfort, however, I am sorry but there is not enough information out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> I have two questions. First, will the Taoiseach give some sort of indicative timeframe or a prioritisation order, perhaps not today but this week, as to when services can come back? Most importantly, for people whose information could be online or who could receive it in other formats, what are they meant to do? Not everybody knows how to ring up various organisations, so surely two things should be done. First, details should be put up online so people know where to go and, second, there should be two helplines, one for the public who have concerns about this and one for the staff of the HSE internally.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">Again, every effort is being made. The HSE is communicating internally with staff about this on an ongoing basis. It is very difficult for the HSE at all levels and for all workers on the front line. The frustrations are enormous. This is a very serious attack on our health service, and the overriding priority is to get the systems back up and running as quickly and as safely as we can in line with the advice we are getting. The Deputy has worked in IT. My understanding is that the restoration is slow and has to be methodical and definite, so it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe right now.</p>

          <p eId="para_343">The Government's announced proposals to deal with the activities of the vulture and cuckoo funds are hopelessly inadequate, completely pathetic and not a serious attempt to deal with these cuckoo funds at all. In reality, the Government is beholden to these funds and deeply implicated in having brought them into the housing market. The 10% stamp duty will not act as a disincentive. These firms have the funds at their disposal to outbid ordinary working people. The provisions will not apply to apartments, which is where most of these funds are active. The planning regulations, similarly, will not apply to apartments or to all the strategic housing development planning permissions that are in play, a flood of which have gone through recently. These proposals are therefore not a serious attempt to deal with this issue and, to use a phrase the Taoiseach often uses, they will not deliver one extra affordable house for working people or make the unaffordable rents in the housing sector affordable. Neither will they deal with the scandal that was revealed at the weekend. The explanation for the Government's not taking serious action against the vultures and cuckoos is that the State is up to its neck in investing in these cuckoos through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, formerly called the National Pensions Reserve Fund. I have just discovered that this includes investment in Bartra's co-living proposal in Dún Laoghaire. The State is building box apartments with Bartra. It is investing in short-stay aparthotels. This is unbelievable. Then in many cases these properties will be leased back to local authorities or they will fund the profits of these investors through HAP payments, 40% of the revenue from which goes into the pockets of corporate landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> The paper I am holding shows what these funds are saying about the profits they can make through leasing deals with the local authorities. The crowd behind this paper is called Housing Together. It boasts of Government-backed leases of ten to 25 years, unrivalled covenant strength, net initial rental yield of 5%, being ideal for investors seeking high income at low risk, the opportunity to lock in rents linked to inflation, no management of tenants, no rental collections or chasing arrears, no internal maintenance, no voids, no letting fees, no advertising costs and no ongoing refurbishment costs. Why? Because the local authority will pay for all that and at the end of the 25 years, the vulture fund, not the State, will own the property. We are, therefore, paying for this, the vulture funds and the cuckoos are running off with the profits and we have nothing at the end - no security, no affordability and no affordable rents. It is a scam and a swindle of Mafia-style proportions. Why are we not paying to build our own stock that is actually affordable for ordinary working families?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_101">

          <p eId="para_346">The Deputy is wrong in his assessment of last night's measures because they will have an impact, both on the planning side and in respect of stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">The stamp duty will have an impact, much broader than just the funds. The stamp duty disincentivises multiple buying of houses or duplexes and gives the advantage back to first-time buyers and owner-occupiers. It is a much broader measure than the Deputy, Sinn Féin or anyone else on the far left anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> The Deputy's response is the expected one. As I have said, the Government has allocated about €3.3 billion to housing this year. That is State money, separate altogether from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, or anything like that. That €3.3 billion includes a very significant allocation to social housing, with significant initiatives on affordable housing and a national cost-rental scheme which would provide houses to rent at 25% below market rate. The Deputy ignores all that every time he gets up to speak about housing. He narrows it down to one area and implies that is the broader picture of housing in this country, which it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> The fundamental issue with housing is supply. We are simply not building enough houses or apartments in this country. On the apartment front, there is an affordability and viability issue that needs to be dealt with. Hence the funds are in the marketplace particularly for apartments, as the Deputy just said. Many of those apartments would not have been built if it were not for the presence of funds, given that the banks are essentially out of housing to large intents and purposes and are not funding at the level that they would have been in previous times. The State is now the big provider of social and affordable housing through the variety of initiatives we have taken, including the affordable legislation the Minister is bringing in, which will provide directly State-supported affordable homes that the State will be active in providing as well as social houses for people. </p>
          <p eId="para_350"> The Deputy knows the Government does not get involved in any of the decision-making of ISIF. Its objective is to try to leverage to get projects off the ground. Fundamentally, the ultimate solution is to increase supply. The State needs to play its part with very large social housing provision and very strong support as well as providing affordable homes and affordable rental projects. There will also be a need for the private sector. I know the Deputy does not agree with that. I think his view is that every house, perhaps, should be built by the State. That seems to be his position. I do not believe that is doable or feasible in the coming years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_351">I think the private sector should look after itself. The Taoiseach is absolutely right: the State is the main mover in the housing market. While it is spending €3 billion, the problem is it is spending it on lining the pockets of the vulture funds, the cuckoos and the speculators. The vast majority of the money the State is putting in, which the Taoiseach just described, is going on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, housing assistance payment, HAP, and leasing payments. It is not going into building our own stock of public housing because the State only managed to build 2,000 of its own local authority houses, while there were 15,000 new HAP tenancies last year with more on RAS and leasing arrangements. Now it gets even worse; the State is working with private developers to deliver the tenements of the 21st century, co-living, which the Government claims it has banned, but the State is investing with these private developers in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> If we are paying for it anyway through tax breaks, through RAS, HAPs and leasing, and through investment from the strategic investment fund, we should cut out the bloodsuckers, cut out the middlemen and invest in providing our own stock of public and affordable housing. By the way, as the Government has not built a single affordable house, the Taoiseach should not peddle that myth.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">The Government has now been in office for ten or 11 months. Over that time, we have made it very clear that we would have a broad suite of initiatives for housing, the key part being social housing and the building of 50,000 houses over the next five years. The Deputy keeps ignoring that. That is part of the €3.3 billion. The €3.3 billion has nothing to do with ISIF. HAP has been there since 2012 or 2013 to facilitate people on the social housing list to get housing. I would prefer, and we are moving towards, direct construction of social housing and affordable homes and to get more affordable homes for people at prices they can afford and also new initiatives on the cost-rental schemes and bringing back every available opportunity we have, such as voids, for example, through an initiative the Minister took in July 2020. We provided the funding and brought 2,500 units back into social housing last year and we will be committing to another 3,000 this year. We are sparing no effort to get houses up so that people can get opportunities. We are simply not building enough at the moment in this country. The Deputy's proposals would actually reduce supply not increase supply.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">Data centre security and its impact on patients has rightly dominated the headlines this week. I want to focus on the related issue of data storage. We have taken a strategic decision to ensure that Ireland has become one of the key global centres for data storage. This has the potential to create and maintain long-term high-value jobs in the Irish economy. These jobs can be located in the most isolated house in Ireland. I fully support this strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> However, these data centres have significant demands for electricity and by 2030, 70% of this will come from renewable sources at a cost estimate of more than €9 billion, based on an Irish Academy of Engineering analysis. If this additional cost of data centres continues to be applied to all electricity customers and if we use the public service obligation distribution model across all customers, Irish families would pay an extra €123 per year just for the electricity going directly into data centres. </p>
          <p eId="para_356"> There is no doubt that electricity will increase in cost over the medium term to meet our renewable electricity target of 70% by 2030. In tandem with that we must actively support the retrofitting of every home in Ireland, including the homes of those who are reliant on social welfare, those who are working and those who are renting, to ease this burden. </p>
          <p eId="para_357"> Research commissioned by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has shown that 43% of people reported experiencing at least one form of financial strain due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A quarter of them have cut back on food or utilities and 14% are behind in paying bills, such as electricity. While I support strategic data centre development, we cannot have Irish families subsidising the cost of their electricity on top of the additional cost of green electricity being supplied directly to their homes. This view is supported by the Government in a decision taken in June 2018, set out in the Government statement on the role of data centres in Ireland's economic policy to ensure that Irish families are not forced to subsidise the cost of data centre electricity supplies. However, this is yet to be implemented. </p>
          <p eId="para_358"> As we increase the level of electricity grid investment and renewable electricity to meet the needs of data centres, we must ensure that they pay for the cost of this additional investment.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_105">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_359">I thank the Deputy for raising what is a very important issue. Without question, the expansion of data centres in Ireland has led, and will continue to lead, to a large increase in electricity demand, concentrated in the Dublin area, which raises challenges for the energy system. One needs to consider data centres more broadly, in terms of both the FDI situation and the digital economy and the digital transformation that we are undertaking along with other member states across the European Union. The European Union next generation funding majors on two key themes: the green economy and digital transformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> Data centres are part of the core infrastructure of the digital economy. They have become increasingly important for remote working as we have seen during the pandemic. They also support high-quality jobs and some of the companies involved are offsetting the impact through investment in either wind farms and other renewable energy or forestry carbon sinks.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">That said however, the issue needs to be planned and we need a strategic approach. In order to manage data centres in a planned manner specific energy-related actions are required, including for EirGrid and ESB Networks to work closely and innovatively with data centre developers to maximise the capability of the network to support timely connection and operation of data centres. In 2020 data centres represented approximately 11% of the total electricity used in Ireland. EirGrid’s generation capacity statement of 2020 to 2029 projects that demand from data centres could account for 27% of all demand in Ireland by 2029. In that context, EirGrid has launched Shaping Our Electricity Future, which is a comprehensive public consultation, and I invite the Deputy to contribute to that. Its aim is to make the grid stronger and more flexible in order that it can carry significantly more renewable generation and manage increasing demand from high-volume energy users such as data centres. One of the approaches in EirGrid's Shaping Our Electricity Future consultation focuses on a more plan-led approach to data centre development limiting further development in Dublin while other options revolve around major grid reinforcement projects and power generation technologies. The consultation on this strategy will open on 14 June 2021. EirGrid is the key agency involved here with data centres connections and related energy costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> I take the Deputy’s point on fuel poverty. We have measures in place in the context of allocation of some carbon tax fund revenues towards alleviating fuel poverty more generally and to support people in difficult situations. This is an issue that is topical and requires ongoing strategic engagement.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">Real climate action is about encouraging people along the climate journey in a constructive and positive way with the aim of achieving the goal that we all want, which is a long-term sustainable planet for our children and for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> The new Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill can provide the legal tools needed to bring this about but in the rush to get things done families are being needlessly sacrificed when there are alternative approaches which could be taken to achieve the exact same goal. We must be honest and upfront with people about the costs involved and the sacrifices that will have to be made by everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> Can the Taoiseach give a commitment that before Dáil Éireann passes the new Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill he will ensure that the McKinsey report on the cost of decarbonisation up to 2050 is published so that all of the options can be fully considered by Members before the enactment of that legislation?</p>

          <p eId="para_366">I cannot give that commitment but I will talk to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about that. We know that more demand will mean a higher level of renewable energy on the grid to meet Ireland’s 2030 renewable targets. The Government is now developing projects and policies to encourage the development of renewable energy by the data centre sector to meet its demand and to meet the target of 15% of electricity demand from corporate power purchase agreements by 2030.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland recently conducted a public consultation on options to deliver on this target. There have been some very encouraging signs and recent developments in the sector, with large multinationals concluding power purchase agreements, as I said earlier, directly from wind farms which will not be paid for by electricity consumers. That is the model that we need to progress, namely, that these companies would conclude power purchase agreements directly from the wind farms and that all electricity users, including data centres, will pay their fair share.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">Yesterday, the mid west suffered another hammer blow with the decision of Aer Lingus to close its Shannon base. This has the potential to be catastrophic for the mid-west region. The Shannon-London-Heathrow connection, and these onward connections are vital to the people of the mid west and businesses in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> Sinn Féin vigorously opposed the privatisation of Aer Lingus in 2015 and we said at the time that it would leave the State at a strategic disadvantage and could cost jobs. The decision to sell off this key State asset now severely weakens the Government’s hand in this situation. We warned at the time that Aer Lingus was of such strategic importance to the State and to the mid-west region that it must be kept in State ownership. My thoughts are with the families and workers today. The Minister for Transport has taken a hands-off approach to aviation for too long and aviation workers are paying the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> Yesterday the Taoiseach washed his hands of the problem by blaming it on the pandemic. The anger from staff and their families is palpable. This cannot be blamed on the pandemic alone. The real problem is the Government’s lack of planning. We have a crisis in aviation and jobs are being lost, many of which will not be replaced. We need direct intervention from the Taoiseach as the Minister for Transport is not up to the task.</p>

          <p eId="para_372">First of all, the Government is deeply concerned about the decision of Aer Lingus yesterday. We are not blaming anyone but are seeking to do something about it. Government has been supporting both the airlines and the airports from the beginning of the pandemic, which I say without contradiction, through the means of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the various other schemes and the capital supports to the airports in capital and through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, to support Aer Lingus. ISIF was condemned earlier but it has helped in terms of the liquidity of Aer Lingus, in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> I am acutely aware of the devastating impact that the Covid-19 restrictions have had on travel and aviation. This, unfortunately, cannot be denied. This is not to blame anyone; it is a reality. The virus has killed travel for the past year but we are determined to reopen aviation and we will work with the interests and workers in Shannon to see if we can get the situation changed.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">I also raise the issue of Shannon. I live very close to it in my corner of Tipperary. The fact of the matter is that the baseline of traffic growth in Ireland and the volumes, taking 2013 as a baseline, is that 96% of all growth has been in Dublin. That is the real issue here. I have two questions for the Taoiseach. As to the €150 million ISIF loan, all other countries which gave state aid to airlines put conditions on this funding to protect workers and jobs. What conditions were put on this €150 million to protect jobs and can the Taoiseach outline these to the House?</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> Second, why in the name of God has the chairmanship of Shannon Airport been left vacant? When it came to this decision this week Aer Lingus had no one to talk to. I have asked this question of the Minister on multiple occasions. There has been no chairperson for the guts of a year. This is ridiculous.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">How can anyone who lives in urban centres, such as my constituency of Dublin Central, see the Taoiseach’s announcement yesterday to exempt apartments from stamp duty and planning as anything other than an abandonment of our city centres as a place in which to live or to aspire to own an apartment and raise a family? I cannot for the life of me understand why we can have one particular set of rules for suburbia and another for city centres. This was an abandonment and a white flag was raised by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and it must be tackled.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">Page 46 of the programme for Government pledges to invest in healthcare. In Wexford, we have no MRI scanner despite having raised €250,000 towards the project. There are 791 children who have been on the orthodontic waiting list for more than 48 months. We have two applicants for a psychologist position which is to be filled to serve the 40 children on the waiting list for child and adolescent mental health services. We cannot get those applications pulled out to receive a letter of offer. I am asking the Taoiseach to intervene on that issue. We cannot continue to allow these children to suffer. The 791 children on the orthodontic waiting list will ultimately end up with mental health problems. It is not so long ago that the Taoiseach and I were teenagers and we know how important teeth are. We know how important they are to children's confidence. Equally, it is important that children are seen by psychologists at an opportune time, not when it is too late. Early intervention is key.

          <p eId="para_416">I am very concerned by the leaks from the Cabinet yesterday regarding the extension of the emergency powers for another six months. I honestly believe that the Taoiseach and his Government have become an existential threat to our democracy. That the Government is trying to push this in here to control people, deny them their rights and freedoms and literally destroy their will to live is shocking. It is being done without any debate in this House. The Taoiseach has not met Opposition party leaders or group leaders since November. He is stonewalling everything. Stonewalling is his new mantra. He stonewalls when a question is asked and then he puts it back on the person asking the question or gives them a lecture. He will probably give me a lecture now in a minute. It is outrageous that the Government could contemplate extending the powers for a further six months. We are meant to be coming out of the crisis and we are meant to be opening up but this is what the Government is at. It is all about control. That happened in Germany in 1933 and that is how it started there.</p>

The legislative framework is required to enable Government to take those initiatives and it will be debated in the House. I ask the Deputy to refrain from using that kind of language. It is wrong.

          <p eId="para_426">I wish to raise the issue of tenants in receipt of homeless HAP. Several people have contacted me recently on this issue. I will refer to two of them. I was contacted by a young woman who is in receipt of homeless HAP. In 2018 she was paying €1,500 and getting the cap of €990 under the homeless HAP, which meant she was paying €510 as a top-up. Several years later, she has now received a rent review which is to be implemented on 6 June. Her rent is being increased to €1,730.22. That is €740 extra in the context of the top-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> A couple with a child who are living in a two-bedroom apartment were initially paying a rent of €1,900 in 2018. They had a HAP top-up of €1,875, which is the maximum level. Their rent has been increased several times and they are now facing a rent of €2,096. That is an increase in the top-up to €221, from €25 several years ago. I raised this with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive. It stated that it has seen this issue raising its head, as has Threshold.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">I refer to the devastating news that was delivered yesterday to 81 Aer Lingus cabin crew. The proposed move will have a devastating impact on the mid-west region. Connectivity is key to the recovery of the economy, for business and for tourism. Shannon Airport is a driver of economic activity in the mid-west region and it is a massive part of balanced regional development. The Government has dragged its feet on publishing a plan for the restoration of international air travel. It is critical that this plan is published as soon as possible and that the Taoiseach intervenes directly with Aer Lingus and asks it to reverse this decision. There is an opportunity here because Aer Lingus is in talks with the Government about a cash injection. It is crucial that we stitch into that deal that the Aer Lingus base in Shannon is protected, that the Shannon-New York and Shannon-Boston routes are protected-----</p>

We will also engage with the airlines. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, are meeting Aer Lingus today and I certainly will be engaging on this at the highest level also.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">I refer to the proposed new 170 km pipeline to bring water from the River Shannon into Dublin. It is proposed to pump 330 million l per day from the River Shannon into the pipe infrastructure in Dublin, which is leaking half its water. There is significant unease in the northern part of my constituency of Tipperary about this. The landowners along the route have already suffered as a result of a motorway going through their lands.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">We are seriously questioning Irish Water's use of its capital. Many of our towns need investment in wastewater treatment plants. Some towns and villages have not even got a wastewater treatment plant. Ironically, Ballina, on the River Shannon in Tipperary, needs serious investment in its waste water treatment plant, the lack of which is seriously damaging its potential to expand its tourism and business infrastructure. I ask that Irish Water examines its use of capital. Does it make sense to pump this amount of water from the Shannon throughout the country when the pipe infrastructure in Dublin is leaking half its water? This should be examined.</p>

Since it was originally mooted and given the go-ahead, it has faced many challenges and hurdles. On the broader point, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has allocated very significant extra funding to Irish Water to provide wastewater treatment plants throughout the country. We are very keen to improve the water infrastructure all over the country and, in particular, to get schemes going in Ballina and other areas the Deputy identified. We will follow through on particular projects, some of which the Deputy has identified, with the Minister. On the bigger project, my understanding is that Irish Water is engaging with the landowners, or will be, so we will see how that unfolds.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the crisis in the public provision of dental healthcare. Many people from all over Kerry have contacted my office. They cannot even get an appointment to be seen, never mind receive dental treatment. The treatment service scheme is not fit for purpose. It has not been amended or improved for ten years. It is uneconomic for dentists to participate in the scheme and dentists actually lose money if they take on new medical card patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> People have contacted me to say dentists receive only €33 for a basic examination, which includes X-rays. For dentures, by the time dentists pay dental technicians, they receive only €20 per hour. It is not feasible to run a practice on that. Dentists feel ignored by the Department - they did not receive personal protective equipment, PPE, or grants and do not get a pension. There is an excellent new facility in Tralee but it needs more staff and more dentists.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> The public dental facility must also be restored to Listowel and north Kerry. It is a basic healthcare need. People's rights are being denied. No wonder members of our diaspora are reluctant to return when they see this is the service they will get.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">I will bring the Taoiseach back to what, in my view, is the totally disproportionate decision by Aer Lingus management yesterday to effectively sack 126 cabin crew and ground staff. Is there a full realisation in Government of the potential consequences of this for regional imbalance, tourism and investment generally in the region? What, if any, communication has been made with Aer Lingus management to ask it to reverse or at least review that decision, in view of the fact it was linked to quarantine, which, I am told, is due to end shortly? Can the Taoiseach confirm that quarantine will end shortly? Has the Government received any assurance from Aer Lingus regarding the valuable Shannon routes, particularly to Heathrow and to several American destinations?</p>

          <p eId="para_445">I call on Aer Lingus to review and change its decision. The Ministers will meet with Aer Lingus management today. The entire thrust of Government policy is to create proper regional development and balance in the economic development of this country. Airports, including Shannon and Cork Airports, are key to that. As was said earlier, over the years the volume of traffic has been concentrated in the Dublin area so we need to build up regional cities, such as Limerick, Cork and many others. That is why the largest infrastructural investment has been put into those cities. On the specifics, there is a realisation in Government of the seriousness of this matter. No effort will be spared to get international travel back. Next week, we will have proposals around the entire area of international travel as we emerge from the pandemic.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">I have been contacted by the residents of Mountnugent in County Cavan, who are shocked and concerned by plans by Eir to erect a 12 m mast in the centre of the village. There has been no communication or consultation with local people. Mountnugent is a beautiful village, but if a mast is constructed there it will totally dominate it. As one local said to me, it will become known as the village with the mast.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Eir was refused planning permission for a mast on this site around 20 years ago. It is now trying to install a mast at this location ensuring it is under the height required for planning permission. However, the reasons planning was refused 20 years ago still apply. A mast that is 12 m or 40 ft high will be a total eyesore in the village. People also have health concerns about a structure like this being so close to residential areas and a school. There is already a telecommunications mast belonging to another company about a mile out the road, which provides good coverage for the community. Eir has the option to see if it could also use that mast, or whether there is enough open space in the vicinity of the village to erect a mast which will not impose an effect on it. Can masts in the centre of villages and towns be banned? </p>

          <p eId="para_448">The overall development plan is a matter for the local county council. Obviously, the streetscape and aesthetic quality of any town or village is important. That should be reflected in the local area development plan. I do not know the specifics of this case, but one needs to balance the necessity for communications and people who want connectivity, with the aesthetics, streetscape and how a village or town looks.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">Our programme for Government contains some very significant commitments to rural transport and sustainable rural mobility. It commits to developing and implementing a sustainable rural mobility plan and to protecting and expanding regional connectivity and connectivity between towns and villages in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> Unfortunately, what is happening in rural Ireland right now to public transport is the exact opposite. A slow but steady erosion of public transport options is occurring. Just two years ago, Bus Éireann decided to remove a number of towns and villages from the route connecting Dublin city to Galway. Last week, Bus Éireann decided to effectively end the evening and night-time service from Galway city to Gort and all the interconnecting villages between. From now, the services at 6.55 p.m., 8.55 p.m. and 9.55 p.m. have all been cancelled, without any consultation with those availing of them. We urgently need to engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Bus Éireann to ensure this erosion is stopped in its tracks and people have access, as they should have right now, to sustainable rural mobility options.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">Adam Higgins has written a story published in today's newspaper about a young woman named Lauren. She is now waiting five months for her housing assistance payment, HAP, application to be processed. She is one of thousands. The people processing it in Fingal County Council have been advised by management in a message sent to staff and seen by <i>The Sun</i>:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_453">Citizens requesting an update on their HAP application should not be advised that it is taking [x] number of months or weeks. Nor should they be advised what month we are currently processing. The advice should be that we are dealing with a large volume of applications and it is simply not possible to indicate when they may be processed.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">It is really hard to find a landlord who will take HAP. It is €2,000 a month for rent. Factor in a deposit, plus five months' waiting, and that is €12,000. With the greatest of respect, if Lauren had €12,000 she would not need HAP. </p>
          <p eId="para_455"> I ask the Taoiseach to do two very simple things. Will he engage with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to see if additional staff can be provided to Fingal County Council? I have already written to the Minister; he is well aware of this situation as it is in his constituency. Will the Taoiseach instruct the Department of Social Protection to give people the money they will need, pending their applications being resolved?</p>

          <p eId="para_458">I raise the issue following the resignation of a permanent GP from the general medical services, GMS, practice in Kiltimagh, County Mayo. The handling of the situation by the HSE has been hugely disappointing. There has been no stakeholder engagement with the local community or public representatives in assisting to fill the permanent GP position. Little or no clarification is available from the HSE about efforts to recruit a locum GP or about why this has not been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Elderly people were shocked to be informed last Friday by the HSE that they were required to find new GPs before 31 May. The HSE has indicated it has advertised for the medical card scheme on only two occasions. This will have a knock-on effect on the provision of GP services in Kiltimagh, with only one remaining GP in the town. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to intervene, seek clarification from the HSE on this matter and request that the HSE re-advertise for a locum until a permanent GP is recruited and that the existing GMS panel be temporarily transferred.</p>

Will the Taoiseach redouble his efforts to ensure there is total consistency throughout the country for every woman and her partner as they journey through pregnancy?</p>

          <p eId="para_470">I appreciate the question, which is in good faith and on a very serious issue. I have spoken to the CEO of the HSE and the Minister, who have assured me that consistency will be applied. This issue was raised last week and the week before in the House. I think the Deputy raised it last week. We were told that the vast majority had complied with the new clinical guidance nationally. I am surprised there are inconsistencies and I will follow through on that.</p>

        <heading>Dáil (All-Ireland Representation) Bill 2021: First Stage<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:10:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#PeadarToibin" eId="spk_193">
          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_471">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_472">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to enable Members of the Parliament of Britain and the north of Ireland elected in respect of any part of the north of Ireland to sit, pose questions and speak in the Dáil; and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> Two and a half years ago, I had a conversation with Francie Brolly about building a new all-Ireland movement. We decided we wanted to build a common-sense movement that would help unite Ireland, North and South, and the people, North and South. We discussed the need not just to call for referendums or hold white line pickets along the road but to take practical steps towards a convergence, North and South, and incrementally erase the border in people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> Francie Brolly was an Irish republican, musician, teacher and Gael. He was an MLA in Stormont for his beloved County Derry and Dungiven. He was a founding member of Aontú and a proud father. He sadly passed away just over a year ago and I proudly dedicate this Bill to Francie's memory. </p>
          <p eId="para_475"> The discussion on Irish unity has gathered significant pace in recent years. Brexit has convinced many in the North that London is not interested in their future. Many in the South understand that it is illogical that, 100 years after the War of Independence, the Tories still determine what happens in Ireland. Demographics are changing apace, political unionism is now in the minority and Scotland is edging towards the British departure lounge. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael talk positively about Irish unity but, like St. Augustine, they ask the Lord to make us united but not yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Some within the establishment parties in the South have tried to hide behind economics but London treats the North as an economic backwater. At partition, 80% of Ireland’s industrial output was from the North, specifically the counties that surround Belfast. Belfast was the largest city in Ireland and the North was by far the richest part of Ireland. The North has been impoverished by London’s lack of interest in the 20th century in the same way the South was impoverished by that lack of interest in the 19th century. The key economic difference between the two jurisdictions is that the South can self-determine economically but London’s focus is on the English Home Counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> Unity is the key to unlocking Ireland’s potential. Economies of scale, efficiencies in public service delivery, increased market size and larger EU representation are all obvious advantages. There is also the question of justice. The founders of this State recognised that there was an inherent justice in all-Ireland self-determination and independence. That justice is as real today as it was 100 years ago. </p>
          <p eId="para_478"> Many supporters of Fianna Fáil are heartbroken by their current leadership's desire to wear the clothes of the party's founding fathers but detach themselves from the objectives of those men and women. The political establishment continuously says there is nothing we can do and the DUP in London holds a veto but there is plenty we can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">We can start the process of North-South service convergence now. This would save money and ensure more efficient and effective public services throughout the island of Ireland. We can create a new Ireland forum now, inviting civic and political society to the table to discuss, first, how to ameliorate the worst aspects of Brexit and then to start to discuss how to bring about convergence towards a united Ireland. Also, it is in our gift right now to allow for MPs elected in the North of Ireland to sit on all the committees in the South. There is no law stopping it. All that has to be changed is a Standing Order. I have written to you, a Cheann Comhairle, seeking that we would start the process of changing Standing Orders to allow MPs elected in the North of Ireland to participate in all the committees in the South.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> It is also in our gift to allow Irish citizens in the North of Ireland, who are MPs, to attend the Dáil. We should think about that. There is no impediment on this Dáil to, in large part, realise the objectives of the First Dáil peacefully and without any cost. Why are we not doing it? If there is nothing stopping us taking that step, why is this Dáil refusing to do it? This Aontú Bill simply enables MPs elected to constituencies in the North of Ireland to sit, pose questions and speak in the Dáil on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as any other Member of the Dáil. It does not go as far as seeking voting rights for those MPs, because that may be a bridge too far for the Government currently, but it does go a long way in allowing for MPs in the North of Ireland to be able to represent Irish people in the North of Ireland in an Irish Parliament. Some day, we in Aontú want to see Deputies from west Tyrone, west Belfast, Newry and Armagh attend this Dáil but, in the interim, let us start the process where we can, where it is fully legal, where it costs nothing and where it is peaceful, to bring Ireland together North and South.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_492">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_493"> I joined European Union leaders at the Porto social summit on 7 to 8 May, which was also attended by Commission President von der Leyen. This included a high-level conference on 7 May organised by the Portuguese Presidency, which discussed work and employment, skills and innovation, and welfare and social protection. Along with a number of other leaders and representatives of social partners, I participated in a workshop on skills and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_494"> Leaders of the Union's three main institutions - the Council, the Commission and the Parliament - joined with social partners in endorsing three targets to be achieved by 2030. These are that we should ensure that at least 78% of people across Europe aged 20 to 64 should be in employment; at least 60% of all adults should participate in training every year; and the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion should be reduced by at least 15 million, including at least 5 million children.</p>
            <p eId="para_495"> That evening I attended a working dinner where our discussion focused on the Covid-19 situation, including production and distribution of vaccines, progress toward digital green certificates, and international solidarity.</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> At our informal meeting on 8 May we adopted the Porto declaration, which makes clear that our shared European ideal is first and foremost about improving the lives of our citizens. We also welcomed the new EU headline targets on jobs, skills and poverty reduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> Members of the European Council also attended an EU-India meeting with Prime Minister Modi on 8 May. Due to the pandemic, and the extremely serious situation in India in this regard, Prime Minister Modi joined the meeting virtually. In our meeting, we agreed to reinforce the EU-India strategic partnership, which is underpinned by the shared values of democracy, freedom, rule of law and respect for human rights. We agreed to resume free trade negotiations and to start negotiations on two additional trade agreements. A free trade agreement is likely to take some considerable time to deliver, so we also asked officials to ensure progress on market access issues that currently act as a barrier to smooth trade between us.</p>
            <p eId="para_498"> I regularly interact with the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on a range of issues, including matters relating to Covid-19 and economic recovery. We are very much like-minded on the need to work with pharmaceutical companies to increase the supply of vaccines at global level as rapidly as we can, and to support the work of COVAX in making vaccines available throughout the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> I also regularly brief the President on the situation in Ireland and in Northern Ireland. Since the beginning of the year, President von der Leyen and I have participated in videoconferences of EU leaders convened by the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, on 21 January, 25 to 26 February and 25 March.</p>

            <p eId="para_501">Has the Taoiseach discussed the crisis in the Middle East with Ursula von der Leyen? We are all deeply concerned. I see that she put out a tweet saying that she was very concerned about the situation in Israel and Gaza. It stated: "I condemn indiscriminate attacks by Hamas on Israel. Civilians on all sides must be protected. Violence must end now." There was no mention, however, of the horrendous acts being carried out by Israel, which is killing so many innocent children in Gaza, children who do not have anywhere to flee. She does not seem to mention that in her communication or the efforts to evict Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem. We know Israel does not really care about condemnation. Unfortunately, words from the Irish Government have very little impact. Has the Taoiseach discussed the need for meaningful sanctions on Israel with Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel or Josep Borrell? Could he enlighten us on any discussions he has had beyond those three individuals on what sanctions are being proposed or considered in response to the horrendous acts that are being carried out as we speak by Israel?</p>

          <speech by="#BridSmith" eId="spk_201">
            <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_502">I thank the Taoiseach for his report. I note that he did not mention any discussions on climate change. Yesterday, the International Energy Agency gave its starkest warning yet. Exploitation and the development of new oil and gas fields must stop this year. No new coal-fired power stations can be built if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the net zero emissions target by 2050. My concern is that although I would love to be in a position to welcome the announcement yesterday by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on behalf of the Government on LNG, I fear that, like the EU, the Government is speaking out of both sides of its mouth. The Government tells us that it cannot ban fracked gas because it is an EU-wide issue. It says it is against LNG terminals, but it will not ban them because there is a review of energy. Can the Taoiseach tell us that at a minimum, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will amend the law to ensure that New Fortress Energy, for example, is stopped in its tracks in having discussions about an LNG terminal at Shannon?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_202">
            <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_503">The statement of the EU Commission President that she condemns indiscriminate attacks by Hamas on Israel was scandalous. There was no mention of the ethnic cleansing in East Jerusalem. Neither was there any mention of the pogroms being carried out by far-right Israeli activists in Israel, with the backing of state forces, against Palestinians. Likewise, there was no mention of the bombs raining down on Gaza, not even the kind of mealy-mouthed false equivalence that the Taoiseach himself likes to engage in.</p>
            <p eId="para_504"> It shows that the official international community, following the lead of US imperialism, is fully on the side of the Israeli regime, one that is a deadly threat to all Palestinians and is an enemy to ordinary, working-class Jewish people. However, there is another international community out there. It was seen on the streets around the world last Saturday. It is a global movement of resistance, solidarity and support for what increasingly looks like the emergence of a new third intifada in the Middle East, which by mobilising people from below, can defeat the occupation.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_203">
            <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_505">Back in the 1980s, Ireland led the way against the South African apartheid regime, starting with the Dunnes Stores workers, and then Ireland was the first country to put in place sanctions against the South African apartheid regime. Human Rights Watch recently published a report comprehensively demonstrating that Israel is an apartheid state, and this follows the report from the respected human rights organisation, B'Tselem. Our Government knows this. That is the context to the slaughter that is happening right now, in which 181 Palestinians have been killed, with 1,200 injuries and 34,000 people displaced. Forty schools operated by the UN are now being used as shelters, and 18 high-rise towers have been destroyed, along with 350 buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> When is the Government going to return to the leadership that we showed in the 1980s? When are our people going to have a Government that will do what is right in what we feel about this crisis?</p>

            <p eId="para_507">Has the Taoiseach raised at European Union level the need for support for the International Criminal Court to investigate potential war crimes in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem? If he has not raised that, will he?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_205">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_508">As I said yesterday, I am very clear that the violence in Gaza has to stop. I believe Hamas should stop firing rockets as well, and that has killed people. Equally, I have been very clear that the response from the Israeli Government has been wholly disproportionate and wrong. It has been ruthless and brutal. One cannot bomb Gaza without killing innocent children, innocent families and civilians. I am very clear about that. That is my position and has been my position for a long, long time.</p>
            <p eId="para_509"> In my view, the key to this, ultimately, has to be negotiations around the two-state solution, but the behaviour of Israel over recent years has made that more and more challenging, and more and more difficult, in terms of settlements, annexation of land and so forth. There has been very little moderation in recent times or engagement in terms of getting a settlement in the Middle East.</p>
            <p eId="para_510"> Ireland has strong views on this, and always had strong views and put forward strong views. In fact, it was the late Brian Lenihan Snr., as a Fianna Fáil Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was the first Minister in Europe, I think, to recognise the Palestinians’ right to a homeland. We have been very consistent as a party in that regard. When I was Minister for Foreign Affairs, I visited Gaza in the aftermath of a war there to witness the devastation at first hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_511"> What I also witnessed and reflected on in particular was the European Union's strong support for UNRWA, the United Nations relief organisation which provides a range of supports to Gazans and Palestinians in the West Bank, from education supports to social supports to economic supports. That needs to be acknowledged but it never gets acknowledged in the debate. It is always one that is condemnatory of stances that the President of the Commission might take but no one on the far left ever acknowledges that Europe is not an imperialist power or anything like that. There is this constant negativity about everything that Europe does without balancing it with some of the positive things that Europe does. Europe, overall, has been a force for positivity in the Middle East, underpinning a lot of economic and social supports and governance supports to try to help to get the capacity for self-governance going.</p>
            <p eId="para_512"> There are different perspectives across the 27 EU member states, and let us not pretend there are not. Some relate to history, and that is the reality. It is easy to stand up in the Chamber and lambast the Union as if it were a coherent whole in terms of this issue. It is not. It is not one coherent entity on this; it brings together a consensus view.</p>
            <p eId="para_513"> Ireland's view is very strongly that the type of behaviour by the Israeli Government is wholly disproportionate and wrong. Likewise, we are equally of the view that Hamas should not be firing indiscriminately into Israel, threatening innocent lives. No one so far who has spoken, apart from Deputy Kelly, has condemned that and said that was wrong too. It is wrong and it has been wrong all along the way. Hamas has enjoyed support from other regimes which would be far better off not doing that, because this can only be resolved in a peaceful way, ultimately. People have to coexist and live in a shared space, and what has been going on for far too long is utterly unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_514"> Ireland's role, in my view, is to work as best we can, as the small nation that we are, to see if we can help to persuade others to move towards resolution. Of course, I fully accept that the public in Ireland are very seized by this issue and have been consistently over the years, and I understand that. There is an innate sense of justice and fair play among Irish people, and that is what we want for Palestinians in particular, and their right to a homeland. That is our position.</p>
            <p eId="para_515"> The Minister for Foreign Affairs attended the EU foreign ministers' meeting earlier this week, where agreement and consensus were reached on the need for a ceasefire. That, in itself, was not easy but consensus did emerge, ultimately, on that. I have not spoken to President von der Leyen yet but we are having a Council meeting on Monday evening and Tuesday. There is a range of issues already on the agenda but we will obviously be raising this issue also, and the foreign ministers have spoken about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_516"> Deputy Bríd Smith raised the issue of fracked gas and climate change. The Cabinet this week passed a significant statement that will emerge from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the importation of fracked gas into the country and outlining the Government's position in that regard. The Deputy was right that the EU legal framework does not facilitate the passing of domestic law that would contravene EU law but the statement is a strong one which will have an impact in terms of planning and so on.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_523">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 13, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> A Policing Service for our Future is the Government's plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. As recommended in the commission's report, implementation of the plan is being overseen by a dedicated programme office in the Department of the Taoiseach. The policing reform implementation programme office monitors progress on the strategy, supports the work of the implementation group on policing reform and keeps the high-level steering board on policing reform and the Government apprised of the progress being made. The programme office has been resourced with appropriate expertise in the areas of project management, policing, justice and public service reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_525"> A Policing Service for our Future is a living document which is reviewed and updated by the policing reform implementation programme office, as required, to maintain ambitious but realistic commitments, timeframes and milestones. A Policing Service for our Future is broken down into four stages of implementation: the building blocks phase, which is of six months' duration; the launching phase, which is of six months' duration; the scaling phase, which is of 18 months' duration; and the consolidation phase, which is of 12 to 18 months' duration as currently envisaged. The first two phases of A Policing Service for our Future - the building blocks and launching phases - have been completed and much has already been achieved. For example, there has been roll-out of a new operating model for An Garda Síochána, designed to streamline Garda administration and to provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide. An Garda Síochána has established and strengthened resourcing of a human rights unit and re-established the strategic human rights advisory committee. The National Security Analysis Centre has been established. We have seen the roll-out of over 3,250 mobile data stations, which have been deployed as part of An Garda Síochána's mobility project.</p>
            <p eId="para_526">It also includes the development by An Garda Síochána of an equality, diversity and inclusion strategy statement and action plan 2020-2021 and, recently, An Garda Síochána launched its three-year Garda health and well-being strategy, which will see the introduction of additional health and well-being supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_527"> There has also been progress on legislative reform. The Government has recently published the general scheme of the landmark policing, security and community safety Bill, which provides for the most wide-ranging and coherent reform of policing in a generation, and the general scheme of the Garda Síochána (digital recordings) Bill, which concerns the use of recording devices, including body-worn cameras. Progress continues to be made also on the codification of legislation defining police powers of arrest, search and detention.</p>
            <p eId="para_528"> These measures and achievements represent only some of the wide range of actions being progressed under the strategy, and further detailed information on the implementation of the reform programme is available on <i>gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_529"> Progress since early 2020 has been impacted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The third phase of the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future, the scaling phase, was originally scheduled to commence in early 2020. However, as the scaling phase was being finalised, Covid-19 and the response required became a factor to be considered. I have been encouraged to see the responsiveness and flexibility shown by An Garda Síochána in dealing with the demands of this unprecedented situation. The third phase of A Policing Service for our Future, the scaling phase, commenced in October 2020 and is published on <i>gov.ie</i>. This is the critical phase of the programme of reform, during which the programme gains momentum. The delivery of the majority of the actions will be started or executed during the scaling phase. The Implementation Group on Policing Reform and Policing Reform Implementation Programme Office have been, and continue to be, actively engaged with key stakeholders to ensure continued momentum on reform, insofar as possible, in the current circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_530">The Taoiseach will be aware the last Dáil and Seanad voted on four motions calling for a public inquiry into the circumstances that led to the death of Shane O'Farrell in August 2011. Rather than implement the will of the Dáil and Seanad, the then-Government introduced a scoping exercise led by Judge Haughton. That was to have been completed by May 2020, then September, then December, then this March and then this April. I am sure the Taoiseach will appreciate that the delay is causing ongoing distress to Shane's family. It has been protracted and it is unjustifiable at this stage. Will the Taoiseach assure the family that it will be completed as soon as possible and a decision on a public inquiry will not be delayed any further after that?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_531">An Garda Síochána has undergone massive reform in recent years, which was badly needed. One reform was moving the promotions and appointments system of the Garda to the remit of an independent oversight agency, which we believe was essential. The Labour Party set up the Policing Authority. It demanded it was set up in order to remove these appointments from the Commissioner. An independent body making senior appointments is something we really fought for. The Commission on Policing has recommended this be reversed. We believe that is a fundamental mistake and we will oppose it passionately. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has been to the fore on this. Our main concern is the removal of the appointment of senior garda officers from the Policing Authority and restoring it to the Commissioner. We know where this has got us before. I note the programme for Government has taken on some of the commission's report but I urge the Taoiseach to reconsider this. We believe the current appointments system for senior people in An Garda Síochána works much better and is more transparent and focused when it lies with an independent body rather than at the discretion of one person, namely, the Commissioner of the day.</p>

            <p eId="para_532">The Taoiseach's statement looked very much at the policing service of the future but in order to make reforms for the future we must also look at the past, and at the record of GSOC in particular. Sinn Féin has already referred to the inquiry on behalf of the family of Shane O'Farrell. I want to talk about two other outstanding issues on behalf of families. When someone dies either in police custody or directly at the hands of the police, invariably they are from a working-class background. That has been notable throughout the history of the State. Terence Wheelock died in 2005 in police custody. GSOC's investigation and report was completely unsatisfactory to the family. Similarly, George Nkencho's family have been very dissatisfied and frustrated and disappointed with GSOC's behaviour since New Year's Eve. Is it sufficient that gardaí investigate gardaí, particularly in cases in which working-class people such as Terence Wheelock and George Nkencho have died at the hands of gardaí?</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_533">It is reported that yesterday the Cabinet agreed to seek to extend the sweeping Garda emergency powers to November with a possible extension all the way to February 2022. Shamefully, while political parties have been exempted from the ban on gatherings, workers' pickets and socially distanced protests have been effectively banned for over a year. Recently, taxi drivers were threatened with criminal action if they went ahead with their planned car cavalcade even though every protester would have been inside their own car. On Monday night, the gardaí were used yet again against the Debenhams protesters. We saw the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign being threatened with prosecution if it went ahead with last Saturday's protest in solidarity with Palestine. Right now, 60 people can sit together on a bus and hundreds are gathered in factories, shopping centres and beyond but if they are holding a placard rather than a shopping bag, they face criminal action. That is shameful. My question is very simple: will the Government scrap this draconian imposition and ban on the right to protest?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_534">Twenty years ago, Amnesty Ireland carried out what might have been the first large-scale survey of Ireland's black and ethnic minority communities. Some 54% polled said that they did not feel confident to report a racist incident to a garda. Twenty years on, how much has changed? The recent survey by Youth Against Racism and Inequality interviewed people of colour and Travellers. Some 35% said they had the experience of being stopped by a garda for no apparent reason and 45% reported feeling humiliation and 42% reported feeling fearful after such an incident. What steps is the Government prepared to take to address this? Has there been any change in thinking whatever around the repeated call from the Nkencho family that rather than an inquiry by GSOC, there should be a full independent public inquiry into the killing of that young man?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_212">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_535">On Deputy Mac Lochlainn's question, I want the scoping review completed as soon as possible. It has been a very traumatic journey for the family of Shane O'Farrell. I have been in touch with them on an ongoing basis. Deputy McGuinness and others have raised this consistently in the House. Scoping reviews can be effective in terms of subsequent inquiries. I do not know if Covid is a factor in the delay in completing the review but I have spoken to the Minister for Justice on this. Obviously, once the review starts we cannot interfere but we understand the need to bring this to a conclusion and take decisions on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_536"> Deputy Kelly raised something that has been the subject of ongoing political debate. The Labour Party-Fine Gael Government brought in the Policing Authority, particularly its role in the appointment of senior positions, whereas the Commission on the Future of Policing took a different view and put forward an alternative view. I had discussions with the commission, as have many others, when it was doing its work. It was of the view that there was a multiplicity of bodies to which the Garda had become accountable, including the Oireachtas, and there needed to be some streamlining, which is part of the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_537">I am of the view that if we establish a commission to carry out a wide-ranging examination of An Garda Síochána, with a view to preparing it for the future, there will always be a difficulty associated with picking the pieces one likes oneself as opposed to accounting for the overall coherence of the recommendations of the commission. We should afford an opportunity to drive through the commission's recommendations and have them implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> Deputy Bríd Smith raised GSOC and the Terence Wheelock and Nkencho family cases. As I said last week, we have to create proper, independent processes of investigation. GSOC involves one such process. Everything cannot become a public inquiry either because we know how long public inquiries can take. They can take years.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_540">Yes. We all need to reflect on this a little. Ultimately, we have to have faith in our services and strengthen their capacity to serve in accordance with the principles and policies we lay down here in the Oireachtas. That means constant interaction with the authorities and management bodies. It also means proper internal and external accountability structures. There is a challenge here for all of us. I am a parliamentarian like all Members present and we all call for specific investigations or inquiries but there needs to be a systemic approach that is robust, resilient and independent.</p>
            <p eId="para_541"> Deputy Paul Murphy surprised me. He seems to have a very anti-Garda approach. I do know what it is about but he is constantly negative about An Garda Síochána. I have to disagree with him. I am confused as to what his position is. He said there should be large gatherings, although he might call them protests or otherwise, in the middle of Covid but at the same time he calls for zero Covid. That does not tally. The Garda has been put in the unenviable position of having to implement very restrictive public health measures. The Deputy wanted to make them even more restrictive. He wanted to make travel virtually non-existent. He wanted all shops closed and all hospitality closed. He did not care at all about the rights of people in the hospitality sector. He said this. He accused us of yielding to the lobbyists. He calls them lobbyists, not people. He does not say they are people with human rights who have interests as well and who are legitimately entitled to articulate their view.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_545">That is not a balanced approach. The legislation will be debated in the House. I would have believed the Deputy would support it because it enables us to restrict the journey of the virus. That is the crucial part of it all. It is a matter of keeping the numbers down and trying to achieve some semblance of normality and to reduce severe illness, mortality and the numbers of hospitalisations and admissions to intensive care. That is the purpose of the legislative framework but we do not want that going on forever. The powers are still necessary, however. We just witnessed the effects of the Indian variant in the UK, for example, so we have to be constantly alert to what could become superspreader events, which the Deputy seems to want to encourage now and more generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> On Deputy Barry's point, the gardaí are rooted in the community. The vast majority of the Irish people trust An Garda Síochána. That has to be said. If one were to listen to the proceedings of the past 20 minutes, one would think An Garda Síochána was an oppressive force out to do down the community. It is not; it is rooted in the community and its policies and procedures are designed to work and engage with people and encourage compliance, particularly regarding public health. Penalties are its last resort. That has always been its position.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> More broadly, the objective of the policing reforms is to embed the Garda in the community in a positive way. Deputy Bríd Smith and I have witnessed the Garda leading the way for the past 20 or 30 years in working-class areas, including some very disadvantaged areas. It has done by developing community buses, for example, and driving kids with challenges to sports occasions. The Garda has done a lot of unsung work quietly in the background for many disadvantaged working-class youths. That needs to be put on the record also and acknowledged.</p>

            <p eId="para_563"> The economic division in my Department supports me and the Government in developing and implementing policy across relevant areas to support sustainable economic development, including job creation, infrastructure, housing and climate action, and social dialogue. This work is particularly focused on ensuring a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of the programme for Government and on issues that cut across multiple Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_564"> The division supports the work of the Cabinet committees on economic recovery and investment; housing; and the environment and climate change. It also supports associated senior officials' groups. As part of the division's work, the economic development unit's work is currently focused on the development of an economic recovery plan, which will be finalised shortly. This will set out our approach to a jobs-rich recovery, with a focus on digitalisation and decarbonisation. The unit also leads work on the development of a well-being framework for Ireland. This seeks to move beyond using uniquely economic measures to gauge our progress as a country towards a more holistic approach that encompasses broader living standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_565"> The housing, infrastructure and digital unit supports the work of the Cabinet committee on housing as well as contributing to cross-departmental work in areas such as infrastructure, balanced regional development and digital policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_566"> The Cabinet committee on housing last met on 15 April and is scheduled to meet again on 10 June. This committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of programme for Government commitments regarding housing and related matters. There is significant work under way on these commitments across Departments and agencies, including the preparation of the new multi-annual housing for all strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_567"> Progress is also being made on legislation to increase the availability and supply of affordable, quality homes. The legislation includes the Land Development Agency Bill and the affordable housing Bill. This work is supported by the provision of more than €3 billion for housing initiatives this year, which will fund the delivery of 12,750 social homes, the new cost rental equity loan scheme and expansion of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan as well as the serviced sites and the local infrastructure housing activation funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_568"> More broadly, the work of the economic division also includes leading Ireland's participation at the annual European semester process, liaising with the Central Statistics Office and providing me with briefing and speech material on economic and related policy issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_569">Thousands of family homes in Donegal are falling apart due to reckless practices in the construction industry in the 2000s. There was a huge housing boom and self-regulation was the order of the day. In the case of pyrite, the State stepped up and put in place the pyrite remediate scheme, which is fully funded, which is as it should be. In counties Donegal and Mayo, however, the families have been asked to step up and make 10% available and the banks were supposed to help. That was second-class citizenship but it has got even worse a year on. Now people have to pay as much as 50% of the cost of making their homes safe. What we are demanding in Donegal is equal citizenship. Our people whose lives have been devastated are asking for a fully funded redress scheme that is the same as that for the families in Dublin and north Leinster. I appeal to the Taoiseach to listen to the stories, heartbreak and despair coming from Donegal and to do what is right by our people.</p>

            <p eId="para_570">I have three points, the first of which concerns the Taoiseach's announcement yesterday on housing. He has taken on board what we have said about stamp duty but I just do not know why he opted for 10%.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">The Government has missed it. It should have been at least 15%. I do not understand why the Government is coming in at ten homes and not a lower figure. I genuinely do not understand the three-month transition period.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> Since I last raised the issues about An Bord Pleanála and strategic housing developments, another 300 apartments in Dublin's docklands have gone. The judge addressing it spoke of the laxity with regard to An Bord Pleanála's work. What can we do?</p>
            <p eId="para_573"> I ask the Taoiseach to give some indication about Project Ireland 2040 and the national planning framework, NPF. This will cause war across Ireland. It will be one of the biggest headaches the Taoiseach will face in a year. He should get ahead of it. Many county development plans are being drafted now. With regard to housing proposals, the idea that some areas will be open and people will be able to get planning for houses and then be told that the year they will get it is 2027 or 2028 just cannot work. We additionally have infrastructural issues relating to water and waste, which I know much about. What are the Taoiseach's thoughts about where we are going with Project Ireland 2040 and the NPF, which needs to be completely changed from how it was constituted by the previous Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_574">I do not think it is an accident that the housing policy of this Government and many previous Governments has not solved the housing crisis and has not addressed the needs of ordinary people, but instead has lined the pockets of developers, speculators and investment funds. I put it to the Taoiseach that that is because housing policy has been captured by those interests. We have seen lots of revelations about how they win on both sides of the equation. The State, through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, invests in the investment funds. They get to buy up the properties and then they lease them back to the councils.</p>
            <p eId="para_575"> I will give the Taoiseach another example, which is HAP. Some 40% of the HAP budget goes to corporate landlords or investment funds. It was €128 million in 2019. Corporate landlords are responsible for 4% of total private tenancies but 40% of the HAP budget goes into the hands of these corporate landlords. This is effectively a gold mine. They get a guaranteed rent from the State, plus a built-in rent increase of 4% every year because of how the supposed rent control legislation is written. It is an even better deal for them than the social housing leases currently being advertised to investment funds. Does the Taoiseach agree that a crucial part of addressing this is to introduce proper rent controls, which do not include this sort of rent increase?</p>

            <p eId="para_576">It is abundantly clear that the Government supports 100% of new build apartments being sold off to investment funds. That has been made clear by the Government over the past couple of weeks, especially with the proposals announced last night. Why does the Government not support home ownership for smaller households, individuals and older couples who may want to move out of a family home into an apartment but do not want to rent? Why is the Government opposed to home ownership for people who want it in our cities and in apartments? Is the Taoiseach aware that, this morning, the share price of the largest real estate investment trust, REIT, in Ireland increased by approximately 4% in reaction to the announcement last night? That is what the stock markets think about the Government's proposals. I do not think there is any indication that the Government is serious about tackling investment funds. If it is, then remember that last year, of the number of homes available for purchase to individual buyers, when one-off houses and various other schemes are taken out, approximately half of the new builds went to investment funds, with the other half being available on the open market. If the Government is serious about that, would it not tackle rents and rent levels for new builds so that investment funds do not get such a high return? It would give people a fair chance to rent and to buy.</p>

            <p eId="para_577">"A home is a home, whether it is an apartment or a house," said Ciarán Cuffe, MEP, of the Green Party. The only pity is that the Green Party says that but does not vote along the line that would follow from that. It is hot air. The Green Party has a chance to show us tonight that it can vote according to what was said. We will keep a close eye on that. What a concession the Taoiseach has made to the vulture funds by excluding apartments entirely from the legislation. That is where the big money is. Some €7 billion of institutional capital chases the purchase of apartments. In 2017, 40% of all new apartments in the State were bought up by these funds. Are the first-time buyers, the young people who want to get into the market and buy an apartment as a home for themselves and their family, not being squeezed out of the market by the vultures? Why does the Taoiseach let the vultures off the hook so completely by excluding the apartment sector entirely from this? I put it to the Taoiseach that he is giving the vultures a huge let-off.</p>

            <p eId="para_578">Deputy Mac Lochlainn raised the issue that he raised yesterday. I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, about this and I believe that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is meeting the group shortly, having invited them in February, when he met them, to make a submission, which he got at the end of April. It is important to say that the Government has responded strongly to the mica issue in Donegal with the allocation of substantial funding. Grants are available under the five remedial options, from €49,500 to €247,500, and approximately €20 million is available for that in 2021. With thousands of homes affected, the State has committed approximately €1 billion to this scheme between now and 2030. That is a substantial commitment by the State and needs to be acknowledged. The Minister will engage on the broader issue in the submission. As the Deputy said, grant levels in the scheme that was developed were initially capped at 90% of estimated costs depending on the remediation option chosen, and vary from €49,000 to €247,000, as I said.</p>
            <p eId="para_579"> The average cost in the east coast pyrite scheme is less than €70,000 per home. The defective concrete blocks grant scheme in counties Donegal and Mayo is likely to be at least double that, which will mean a far more substantial allocation to each home in Donegal than for the pyrite situation. They are not comparable and I do not think the Deputy is comparing like with like. That said, the Minister will engage with the group representing households and is examining the submission that has been made. There are issues that genuinely have to be explored with the group and representatives across the board. As the Deputy knows, much work was done prior to the Government being formed, with expert panels established and so on, that led to the creation of the scheme. There is ongoing work with groups representing the householders affected prior to the design of the scheme itself. I do not think we are comparing like with like with the two schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_580"> Deputy Kelly raised the issue of An Bord Pleanála. We need more resources for An Bord Pleanála and we need to look at the overall planning situation. A planning court has been mooted, for example, and we have to consider developing that. We need a more streamlined, effective and resilient planning system that is more robust to challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_581"> Deputy Paul Murphy raised issues with regard to the funds. Government is in hock to nobody and has no agenda in promoting any particular group in society, whether it is a fund or whatever else. The only objective is to get houses and apartments built and to get a variety of housing and apartments for homeownership, social housing, affordable housing and cost rental.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">There will be a market for rental and a market for homeownership. The Government has initiated a whole range of proposals, all of which the Deputies have opposed. I refer to the affordable housing Bill, the shared equity scheme and the Land Development Agency Bill 2021, all of which will provide housing. All of the Deputies seem to be against mixed housing developments. This morning the Minister turned the sod on a mixed development scheme of 1,200 houses. It was held up for years because of opposition on the ground. People need houses, however. People need social houses and people need to be in a position to buy houses and apartments. </p>
            <p eId="para_583"> We support families, young people and people generally being in a position to afford an apartment but there is an issue with viability with regard to building apartments for sale, particularly in Dublin. The country needs capital to develop some of these markets. Capital has to be there. The Government will not be able to build all the 40,000 houses required every year. The ESRI states that 33,000 will be needed but, given the impact of Covid-19 last year and this year, I believe that a higher figure could be required for the next while. The Government will not be in a position to provide all of that housing. We will need capital to provide some of it. Apartments for rent will be particularly needed. If we took some of the initiatives the Deputies suggest, the number of apartments would be reduced, which would put a further squeeze on people's capacity to buy apartments. What is being proposed on the other side is not coherent or logical.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">I am sharing time with Deputies Patricia Ryan, Martin Kenny and Martin Browne.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Yesterday, I outlined what the various sections of the Bill did and my views on those. I now wish to deal with some of the recommendations of the review of the fair deal scheme. The Government needs to consider these. The review made 32 administrative recommendations, but there has been no update on their implementation. Thirteen pricing recommendations were made and we need a report on their implementation. Twelve recommendations were made on a future model of social care. There should be a report on their implementation. A great amount of work must be done on a new model of social care.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> The pandemic has shown up many failings in clinical governance and oversight, the lack of integrated systems and, in some cases, a lack of knowledge about the sector on the part of the HSE. At a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Health a number of weeks ago, HIQA stated that, in its opinion, the HSE did not have knowledge of the private sector from which it was purchasing services. HIQA was referring to nursing homes among other elements. That is a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> There are poor standards and a lack of authority for safeguarding. The Government says it is committed to ensuring the latter and putting safeguarding on a statutory basis. That must be a priority. We must also consider strengthening HIQA's powers over public and private nursing homes. HIQA has stated that its powers are a blunt instrument and do not provide enough flexibility to work with nursing homes and approved centres for older people and people with disabilities on making necessary improvements. Similar to the Health and Safety Authority, HIQA wants the power to issue what are called improvement notices. That would be important.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Young people with disabilities, including some children, have been placed in centres for older people. This matter was the subject of an "RTÉ Investigates" programme some time ago and needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> We must deliver a high-standard and fully public model of care for older people. The statutory home care scheme needs to be expedited. It was reported at the end of last year that the scheme had been pushed to 2022 because the IT system and a new assessment process had yet to be developed. Once again, IT systems were a problem. Thankfully, the problem was not one of cybersecurity in this instance. Rather, our healthcare system does not have a modern IT infrastructure, which impacts on the State's ability to respond to new systems, policies and processes when it needs to.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> I support the Bill insofar as it goes. The welcome development in the Bill is the three-year cap on assessments of transferred assets to protect the viability of family farms and businesses. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and I share the same constituency and we have attended many meetings of the Irish Farmers Association and other farming representative groups down the years, often at election time, when we are in the cut and thrust of debate. This was one of the issues that arose time and again and what the Bill intends to do will help to resolve it. I commend the Minister of State on introducing the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#PatriciaRyan" eId="spk_228">
          <from>Deputy Patricia Ryan<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_592">I welcome the move to address a long-standing issue affecting business owners and farming families under the fair deal scheme. This issue has been raised many times by my constituents. Unfortunately, the move will come too late for many families who will not be able to claw back thousands of euro in fees already paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> While the Bill is a welcome move, we need to do more to facilitate a greater number of older people to ageing in place. We need to increase funding for the home help scheme to deliver for all older people. Our older people have been an afterthought for successive governments but were to the fore when cuts were made, as in the case of Fine Gael and the Labour Party during the austerity years.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> Sinn Féin in government will introduce a statutory home care scheme. We will increase the role of the public and not-for-profit sectors in the provision of home supports. For too long, our older people have been commodified like our early childhood education, housing and health services and many other public services. I do not mean the small family-run nursing homes that provide a modest income for owners and much-needed employment in rural areas. Rather, I mean companies like Orpea, which recently became the largest provider of nursing home places in the country with almost 2,000 places, and Bartra, which has a number of large nursing homes, including a 146-bed facility that is under construction in Clondalkin and apparently includes co-living staff accommodation. Profit should not be the primary motivation for the provision of older persons' care. We in Sinn Féin favour public nursing homes and, until there are sufficient public places available, a strongly regulated private nursing home sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> We have learned many lessons during the pandemic. One is that concentrated care of our older people is far from ideal. They should be supported in living in their own homes for as long as possible, if that is what they want. The Minister of State and I have discussed this at several meetings. There are many examples of international best practice, such as the Green House model and the Eden Alternative. These favour ageing in place or in small congregations of purpose-built or redesigned homes, with appropriate supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> I commend the book by Mr. Pat O'Mahony from Newbridge, entitled <i>Rethinking Housing Options for Senior Citizens</i>. It makes some interesting proposals and international comparisons as regards retirement villages. We need to accelerate our provision of housing for older people before demographics overtake us and we end up in the same place as we are with schools, where some students still do not know if they will have places in their local schools in just over three months' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> I wish to raise an issue that was brought to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts recently by my colleague, Deputy Munster. She raised the matter of residents in private nursing homes having to pay for items that they were entitled to free of charge under their medical cards and the practice of applying increases to residents' bills as a result of a change in their medical needs despite this being prohibited by the legislation for scheme-supported residents. By law, nursing homes should not be charging patients for items such as incontinence pads, wound dressings, sore creams and medications that residents are entitled to free of charge under their medical cards. This smacks of profiteering on the part of nursing home operators. It is not acceptable and anyone found responsible must be held accountable. People in nursing homes can be vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">We must ensure that those who are tasked with looking after them are not taking advantage. They certainly are taking advantage if they are doing the things I mentioned. We need to put a stop to those disgraceful practices. The treating of our older people as cash cows must stop immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_599">We welcome this long-awaited legislation. As colleagues have stated, the IFA, other farming organisations and business organisations have been campaigning for changes to the nursing home support scheme for many years. Their campaign pointed out that people who had built up assets from nothing over a lifetime are having those assets held against them when they try to get care in their old age. Many people have said to me that they worked hard and paid taxes all their lives but when they needed a service at the end of their life, they had to take out a chequebook and pay for it. That is how people feel about the scheme that has been in place for many years. It was christened the fair deal scheme but, for many, it was not very fair at all. The essence of what we need to address in this legislation is ensuring we bring fair play back into the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> I welcome the three-year rule that will apply in respect of farmland and other assets. Up to now, such assets were subject to a 7.5% per annum charge for as long as their owner was in a nursing home. Of course, the issues with nursing homes do not stop there. There is a great deal of work to be done in this regard and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is aware of that. We need a review of how the system works. Clearly, it does not work properly for many people and there are issues that need to be addressed. Many owners of smaller nursing homes have long been saying that there needs to be a round-table discussion on how we can resolve the issues and try to create a fair deal for everyone involved. That must include the providers, particularly in areas where they are under stress.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The issue of home help and home care provision is linked to all of this. Many people have difficulty getting proper home care packages in place for elderly loved ones and people who are returning from hospital. It is an issue that has devastated people across the country, when they are on waiting lists and cannot get the level of service they require. Sometimes, people have a level of provision, perhaps for a couple of hours a week, but if they deteriorate and need more, the family is told help will have to be hired privately. That is simply not appropriate. People work hard, pay taxes and are loyal to the State throughout their lives. The least they should expect when they come to the end of their days is that the State is there to provide for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> The work the Minister of State has done on this legislation is welcome. It represents an advance on the current situation and is something that has been lobbied for at length. However, there is much more to be done. I encourage her to look at all the remaining issues and to address, with speed, as many of them as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">One thing we can say about this Bill is that it is welcome, but it is also a long time coming. For too long, our farming communities and small business owners had their futures put at risk by the Government despite their being vital contributors to our economy, exports market and reputation. It is welcome that sense has finally prevailed and the way in which these sectors have been overlooked in the past is being addressed to some extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Family farms have been under increasing pressure for years. Their owners have been taken for granted and advantage has been taken of them repeatedly. They seem to be the last in line for attention but the first in line for criticism, as we saw in recent debates. Unfortunately, farmers have become used to being taken for granted. We see that in the manner in which the meat processing industry has been handled with kid gloves over the years. Family farmers are responsible for producing the high-quality, premium product that is renowned globally and which we are, rightly, only too proud to promote. Yet, despite the 24-7 effort farmers put into producing a quality product, their endeavours are underappreciated in financial terms. They find themselves on a low rung of the ladder of beneficiaries when it comes to the food supply chain. Today, we are finally discussing a Bill that addresses how these enterprises have been subject to rules that put many businesses and farms at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> How was it ever right that in order to avail of the nursing home support scheme, farmers and small business owners had to pay a proportion of their capital value for as long as they availed of the scheme, with no cap on the number of years of contributions? Do the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Health, as well as the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, have any idea of the damage that was done to many farms and businesses over the years this scheme has been in operation? Given the challenges that have faced family farmers, why did it take so long to make the changes we are discussing today? Given that the Government depends on small businesses to keep the unemployment figures down and give our produce a particular identity, it is hard to believe it has taken so long to get to where we are today.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> These are the big questions but the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will also be acutely aware of the need to deal with a particular issue on which she has spoken about before. When a loved ones gets ill and needs the care provided by a nursing home, it is an incredibly emotional time in the life of a family. To date, that situation has been made worse for many by the rules that governed the fair deal scheme in respect of farms and businesses. When families find themselves having to make a decision about their loved ones' welfare, they do not want to have to worry about anything else. The fair deal scheme, as it was designed, meant that the families of farmers and small business owners had the additional concern of how their livelihood would be affected. I do not know how the Minister of State feels about having to deal with the legacy of previous governments but she must have questioned how such a situation was ever devised under the governance of her colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> The time it has taken to arrive at where we are today is concerning but I am thankful we got here. The IFA has been campaigning for changes to the scheme since not long after it started. In 2016, it made a presentation to a working group on the fair deal scheme. Now, in 2021, progress is eventually being made. The provisions in the Bill will leave many farmers and business owners scratching their heads and asking whether there are to be retrospective payments to those who paid out under the current rules. Will the Minister of State clarify her stance in this regard? Will she speak to the farmers and business owners who have those questions? If she is resistant to do so, she will have to take it up with the previous Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael governments that put the families of farmers and small business owners in this situation. I welcome that there is finally movement on this issue. It is crucial that no questions are left unanswered and the new system is put in place as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_608">The Labour Party is supporting this Bill and we thank the Minister of State for bringing it forward. It will provide a considerable amount of alleviation for farm families. Who among us has not had a person from a farm family on the telephone telling us about how a loved one is filling out the forms for the nursing home support scheme and expressing deep doubt about the process? Some of that doubt is because it is the end of the road in terms of being able to care for somebody at home. It is often the last resort for a spouse in respect of his or her loved one. It is always with deep reluctance that people agree that it is in a loved one's best interest to go into a residential unit or nursing home.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> On top of that is the added pressure of not knowing where people will stand financially as a result of taking that decision to sign up to the nursing home support scheme. People too often tell us of their concern about what the charge will be on their X amount in assets and where it will leave them and their family in terms of their future financial security. There is no question that this Bill goes some way towards addressing this and, for that reason, it must be supported. Who among us has not dealt with a family whose savings, which were built up with bare hands working the land, have been whittled down to nothing? In many cases, people started with nothing or with a very meagre holding and built it up through years and years of hard work, only to find it is to be scattered like grains on infertile ground. Although their loved one is being cared for, there is often nothing left in reserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">That seems to me to be an awful waste and an awful shame for all those years of work people put into building up these people's holdings. The Bill alleviates that. As I understand it, it does not apply retrospectively, so we spare a thought for the people who have gone through the double hardship of having savings whittled down and having had to make the decision on a loved one's nursing home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> We have to acknowledge the role of the IFA in this issue. It is interesting to read some of the debates and the submissions that were brought forward by the IFA in respect of the pre-legislative scrutiny in 2019. I note in particular the association's submission through its then president, Mr. Joe Healy, in which he encapsulates the matter very well:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_612">[Significant] uncertainty and anxiety has been created for family farms, with fear that the viability of the farm will be undermined or lost while attempting to meet the costs of care. This has led to the introduction of a three-year cap on farm business assets in circumstances of sudden illness.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_613"> It is also important to note that assets transferred for less than five years are included in the assessment of means. As ... [you] can imagine, this has proven to be a barrier to the next generation taking over the family farm due to the debt owing on the farm business asset.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">To be fair to the Minister of State and the Government, they have sought to address this imbalance in the system, and that is absolutely to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> It is important for us to look as a society at the entirety of care for older people, given our demographics whereby people are living longer than historically was the case. There was a very interesting debate in the Seanad on 10 May, at which the Minister of State may have been in attendance. My colleague, Senator Bacik, participated, stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_616">Despite there being half a million carers in Ireland, the issue of care and the immense challenges faced both by carers and the people for whom they care are often neglected. Ireland's population is ageing and people with disabilities comprise a significant portion of the people living in our communities. However, the State remains reluctant to address the fact that most of us will either require care ourselves, or will have to give care to another, and that the infrastructure currently in place is seriously lacking.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">She further stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_618">[T]he State's default preference for institutional care is archaic and highly problematic. Not to mention that this preference is not in the spirit of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which Ireland ratified in 2018, it causes havoc in the real lives of the thousands of people living in this country who cannot do so independently. We have become all too used to hearing horror stories about our broken care model, whether that concerns the scandalous practice of inappropriately housing young people in nursing homes, or the tragic loss of life in institutional care settings that we have seen over the past year due to Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Again, to be fair to the Minister, she is seeking in her approach to fix one element of that, and this legislative proposal before us does that. However, we in the Houses of the Oireachtas should have regard to the issue of our ageing population such that we can put in place a housing infrastructure that allows people to downsize and live independently or to create communities across this land that allow people to live independently but in a sheltered environment such that they retain their independence but there are shared services. In the context of today's debates on housing and the motion on wastewater treatment services tabled by the Regional Group, I believe strongly that if we are to have serious regard to the fact that we are all ageing and that some of us will be able to live very independent lives until we shake off this mortal coil, even if we will require some level of care, and in the context of the nursing home element of this, with residential care another element of it, where there are levels of dependency from low to high, then a housing mix that allows people to downsize into communities needs to be inculcated into political debate. It needs to be further inculcated into how we devise national planning frameworks in order that we talk not only about younger people getting on the housing ladder but also about how older people will be housed into the future and what our communities will look like in respect of the third or fourth age, when people reach the autumn or the winter of their lives. Nursing homes are a part of that narrative but not the only part. I acknowledge the Minister of State is very conscious of this because she has spoken of this previously. I know she is very cognisant of the need to ensure we start inculcating new language into the debate on care for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> As I have said, we in the Labour Party support this legislation. We hope it will bring peace of mind to many farm families. It is important we note again that IFA submission on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, in which Mr. Joe Healy quoted from the 2018 Teagasc national farm survey, which showed that 30% of farmers were aged 65 years or older while only 7% were under the age of 35. The survey also showed that average farm incomes declined by 21% in 2018, dropping from approximately €30,000 in 2017 to €23,500 in 2018. His submission stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_621">This steady erosion of farm incomes threatens both the viability and sustainability of the family farm and the sector's growth prospects. This can be clearly seen in the survey findings with only 34% or 47,000 of farms classified as viable.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">We can interrogate those figures more closely, and some will say that the natural result of there not being intergenerational solidarity between fathers and sons or fathers and mothers and daughters going into family farming is that people flee the land, which then allows other people to consolidate farm holdings. What we want to see is a system that ensures that as many people who want to stay on the farm as possible are incentivised to do so. We do not want to see another Mansholt plan, a famous European Commission plan dating back to the 1970s whereby an attempt was made to create massive industrial-type holdings. There needs to be a mix that includes the small, sustainable, intergenerational, father-to-son or father-or-mother-to-daughter farm. I do not mean to be gendered in my language in any way. I do not think people will take me up the wrong way on the point I am making. This mix should allow for the passing of the farm from one generation to another and ensure that no disincentive is put in place. This legislation seeks to provide that type of alleviation at least. It takes out one worry for farmers who find themselves in that unfortunate position whereby a loved one has to go to a nursing home.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> We support the legislation. We send our sympathies to people who find themselves faced with very difficult decisions of filling out the form and making the life-changing decision to send a loved one to a nursing home. In dealing with the financial element of this, they are concerned about whether their financial legacy will be whittled down to nothing. We hope this legislation will at least provide some alleviation for them at this time. I am talking about small farmers, people who have built up farm holdings from nothing, from mere blades of grass to fields of green. We must be mindful of those people who are the backbone of the co-operative movement and who continue to be a vital part of our life on this island.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_624">I welcome the Bill. As a member of the Government that introduced the home care system initially, I recognise that we obviously did not get it completely right. It is very hard to get it exactly right the first time around. Several deficiencies emerged which are being effectively dealt with by the Minister of State in today's legislation, which I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> I am slightly concerned that it has taken so long. I remember the fourth last Minister of State in that Department speaking about this particular reform. Since then we have had three different Ministers of State and now Deputy Butler is the Minister of State. Thankfully she has been able to introduce it. It is quite a complex Bill, containing several points of detail that I would like to discuss, but that will be a matter for Committee Stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_626"> We have always recognised that social care does not come cheap. It is a very expensive system. This year the fair deal scheme will cost in excess of €1 billion to the Irish taxpayer in net terms, after taking into account the contribution from the nursing home occupants. The elephant in the room here is the absence of a system of statutory home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The policy of parties on all sides of the House is that people who can be cared for in their own homes should be cared for in their own homes insofar as that is possible. They should be left to live out their declining years in the comfort and security of their own homes. Only people who cannot be cared for in the family home should be taking up nursing home beds. Of course, as in many other cases, policy and practice diverge. Everybody on all sides of the political divide is in favour of people being cared for at home. Whereas the law states that if a person meets certain criteria, they have a statutory legal right to be accommodated in a nursing home under the fair deal scheme, they have no statutory legal right to home care, which, apparently, is what everybody wants. </p>
          <p eId="para_628"> I know the Minister of State intends to introduce a system of statutory home care. I understand she is working very hard on that and it will be her next project after this Bill has been passed. However, I am concerned about how long it has taken us to get to this point. This is a significant improvement on the current system, but it has been spoken about for several years. How long will it take us to have a system of statutory home care?</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> First, it is recognised as being more desirable for people to be able to live out their lives in the comfort and security of their own homes if that is possible. Second, it is much less costly for the State. I have seen various figures, and while it is hard to average these things because conditions vary so much, on average maintaining somebody at home costs one third of what it costs the State to prop up the fair deal scheme for people in nursing homes. This means there is a double benefit. If people feel they can stay in their own home and can be catered for in their own home, and their family are willing to have them at home, they would prefer to be in their own home. It is much better for them. All studies tell us that it is much better for their mental health. The added bonus is that it costs the State only about one third of the cost. It makes no sense that we have not moved further in providing a statutory home care system even as things stand. The home care system in the country is sporadic and inconsistent. It depends on where people live; there is a certain postcode lottery.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> In the previous Dáil, I introduced a stopgap measure to allow people to access home care on a statutory basis while we were waiting to put in place a statutory home care system, which needs to be carefully worked out. That legislation was passed by a large majority in the Dáil. I believe everybody in the House, bar Fine Gael Members, voted for it. It passed Second Stage. The Minister of State at the time promised me that she would hold Committee Stage within six months, but that six months has come and gone. It was about three years ago when I was promised that it would be back in six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> Having drafted the Bill - the temporary measure I just referred to - myself, I recently sent another Bill to the Minister of State. I must give the credit for drafting the second Bill to Community Law Limerick, which comprises many learned legal people, including experienced senior counsel. Given that there are about 5,000 houses vacant whose last remaining occupant has gone into a nursing home, the Bill provides that in such cases there should be discretion to hand the house over to an approved housing body, which would then select somebody from the list of homeless to put into that house.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> The arrangement between the owner and the approved housing body would be a licence arrangement so that the approved housing body did not have to act as a landlord with all the attendant rights, duties and obligations. It would operate from year to year. It would be entirely at the discretion of both sides. The central tenet is that people from the list of people who are officially categorised as homeless would be put in there, which is far preferable to the hubs and other places where they are accommodated at present. This would also be a financial benefit to the State because in 2019 the average cost to the State of providing emergency accommodation for a homeless person was €36,000, which has probably risen quite significantly since then. While I know that rents vary significantly in different parts of the country, the average rent is about €14,500 per annum. At €14,500 per annum as opposed to approximately €40,000, it would be cheaper for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> I have sent a copy of that Bill to the Minister of State and I know she is studying it. If she cannot incorporate it into this legislation, I hope some version of it makes its way onto the Statute Book soon.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Gould<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_634">I welcome and support the Bill because for many, the fair deal scheme has not been fair or equal and the Bill finally provides recognition of that. We could go further and introduce a publicly funded residential care model because the Government is relying too heavily on the private sector to provide residential care.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Older people must be treated with dignity and respect and they must be confident they will get the care they deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Statutory home care should be provided. Where possible, people should be supported to stay at home when they are able and where they want to be, but many families, because the support is not there, have no option. That is something this Government needs to look at and put in place because if people want they should have the right to stay at home with supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> Five years ago, I asked the then Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Coveney, to meet with groups and to look at the possibility of renting out the homes of people who are on the fair deal scheme. This would provide a rental income for the people in the nursing homes. As far as I am aware, and I stand to be corrected on this point, the HSE requires 80% of rental income for people in nursing homes. This is not viable for most families and where I live in Gurranabraher in Cork there are three houses within 100 yd of mine where people are in nursing homes and the houses are empty, with trip switches to turn the lights on at night. This is shocking because the people in the nursing homes could do with an income from these properties. There are thousands of families in Cork who are crying out for these beautiful homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> We are in the middle of the worst housing crisis in the history this State. Many promises were made that this Government will deliver on housing. As mentioned, I raised this issue with the then Minister, Deputy Coveney. Here we are now, two housing Ministers later, and the Government is still looking at this. The Minister of State needs to engage with Age Action Ireland to get its insight into rolling out a scheme like this. According to the<i> Irish Examiner</i>, there are 25,000 homes tied up in this scheme right across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> I will finish with the comment that people are also waiting too long to get into nursing homes in that it can be four to six weeks and perhaps longer. Many of these people who need a nursing home place have been in hospitals but because of issues they have to wait. There should be no waiting list for people who need to go into nursing homes. Places should be available. I ask that the Minister of State puts the supports in place to deliver on the fair deal scheme for everyone.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_640">The Bill before us provides for the extension of the three-year cap on assessable property to farms and businesses for not less than 50% of their normal working time for six years. This is an issue that has been long recognised as something that needs to be addressed. To that extent, I have no difficulty with the Bill and the Social Democrats will not oppose it.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> What is notable about the fact that we have legislation before us on the fair deal scheme, or the nursing home support scheme, as it is called, is the number of issues it does not address. It is beyond time we took on those broader issues. Everybody is talking about them today in the Chamber. We are all very conscious of the shortcomings in services for older people and we deal with them daily in our constituencies. It is incumbent on the Minister of State and the Government generally to address those issues which have been brought into stark relief over the past year or so, and I will refer to those later. This is a pressing area given our demographics and the growing number of people over the age of 65, which is going to continue to grow very rapidly over the coming years. We have to get services, our support systems and our accommodation sorted out to meet the needs of older people and we really must go much further than this simple measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> The legislation is notable for those aspects of services for older people that are not contained in it. Primary among these is the failure to address the whole question of home care and the promise that has been there for a long time to introduce a statutory scheme for home care, similar to the statutory scheme for nursing home care. This issue was highlighted several years ago by Members in this House, and by Brendan Courtney, who did a very good television series of programmes on his own circumstances with his late father and so on. He really brought this to prominence and showed how the current system, as it operates, makes no sense whatsoever. It limits people to arrangements that are not in their best interests and forces people into nursing home care when they are not ready for it and do not want it and where it may not be in their best interests and is an expensive option for the State. On that basis, it makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> The other things that are missing is that the Bill does nothing to address the over-reliance on private nursing home care, which I will talk about further in a moment, and the tendency to see nursing home care as an investment opportunity and a business rather than a critical element of the social care system in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> The Bill makes no effort to reorientate the social care system towards the community. We are supposed to be moving people away from institutional care to services in their community and the Bill makes no attempt to address that.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> I refer also to the issue raised by Deputy O’Dea which I have been talking about for many years, which is that the Bill does not include any amendments to incentivise the rental of vacant residential properties when people have moved into nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> There are a whole range of more urgent and pressing issues, or at least equally pressing issues, that need to be addressed and it is very regrettable that these have not been brought before us today in a comprehensive piece of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> Central to Sláintecare is the belief that care should be delivered as close as possible to people’s homes in their own communities. That is about the ethos of ensuring that we provide care at the lowest level of complexity as close to a person’s home as is possible and recognising what his or her desires and needs are. Our population is ageing very rapidly, which means more people than ever will enjoy their older years well into their 80s and 90s, which is a fantastic thing. They should be able to age independently and for as long as possible in their own homes where that suits their needs. It falls to Government to ensure that they have the care and housing options which older people rightly deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> When we look at the health outcomes, we know people do best when they are in their own homes. No matter what age one is, wherever one is away, be that on holidays or elsewhere, one always wants to get back to one’s own home because that is where one feels best, most comfortable and secure. We ignore those feelings when it comes to older people in the main.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> Understandably, most people want to stay at home in their communities for as long as possible and it is also the best option for many different reasons. Many, however, have been essentially forced into nursing homes because of the Government’s focus on only this one narrow aspect of social care.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> I will read an excerpt from the nursing home expert panel review that came out last year, after Covid-19 forced this Government to look at what was happening in our nursing homes. That review states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_651">In the past 20 years significant financial incentives ... were given toward meeting the costs of new private nursing homes. This major policy shift effectively handed future responsibility for the residential care needs of an increasing number of frail older vulnerable members of society to the private sector. Thirty years ago, 80% of residents in long-term residential care were in publicly-funded [nursing homes]. Today the exact reverse applies with 80% in private nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">This over-reliance on the private sector has clearly failed our older people in many respects. It has led to a situation where nursing homes are largely unregulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">They have been like that for many years and were essentially left to their own devices when the dangerous virus arrived on our shores. It is not acceptable to have care institutions that are not properly regulated. This thing of keeping nursing homes at arm's length, which is what the current system amounts to, is dangerous and irresponsible of the Government and it is unfair to the residents. We know, of course, how that arm's-length relationship worked out through the past year or 15 months in the context of to the impact of Covid. HIQA has been very clear in its call for regulatory reform for many years. Mr. Phelim Quinn, its chief executive officer, appeared before the health committee in March and at that meeting he stated, "It is important to note that Covid-19 has not in itself signalled the need for regulatory reform; rather, it has shone a spotlight on an issue that was already in need of urgent consideration."</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> The 2015 review of the nursing home support scheme looked at the need to reorientate the social care system and highlighted that home or community-based care can be a cost-effective alternative to nursing home care for many older people. It states, "Admission to long-term residential care should be seen as the last resort and should only be availed of when it is no longer feasible for people to remain in their own communities with appropriate support." It further states, "Reducing the proportion of older people in residential care will require the expansion of community and home based services and perhaps, the development of alternative models of care."</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> The same conclusion was drawn last year by the nursing home expert panel review, which clearly calls for a revised model of social care. The review states, "There is increasing evidence to show that highly dependent persons can live safely and more happily in domestic settings, provided their required home care supports are in place." It clearly states, "Nursing homes should be part of a continuous spectrum of care of the older person in the wider healthcare system, with provision of multidisciplinary support." However, there is still no statutory right to home care in this country and the pilot scheme for it has been pushed out yet again. Having a statutory scheme for nursing home care without the same provision for home care forces people into nursing homes even if that is not what they want or the best option for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> One of the key issues raised during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill related to incentivising the rental of vacant properties. The way rental income is treated under the current operation of the scheme does nothing to encourage people to let out their homes while they are in nursing homes. All Deputies, as public representatives who have been involved in election campaigns and going door to door, see clearly the extent of this issue and the vast number of houses that are lying idle and are clearly the homes of older people. One can see all the signs such as handrails, ramps and so on, but the houses are vacant and there is nobody on the register. Those are clear signs that, in the main, these are the homes of people who have gone into nursing homes and they are lying idle. At a time when we have a serious housing crisis, it makes no sense whatsoever to have thousands and thousands of homes lying idle. Of course, it makes no sense from a financial perspective either. There should be a way of addressing this issue which ensures that people do not lose, euro for euro, any income they get from letting their homes. Many Deputies have been talking about this for years. There is a real urgency about that. The Minister of State should raise this with her colleagues in government, particularly the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, but also the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. It should not be beyond them to come up with a scheme that addresses this issue and is better in terms of the costs involved in nursing home care, but also ensures that those homes are brought into use.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> Right now, there are more than 13,000 homeowners on the scheme but only approximately 740 of them lease their home. Some properties are occupied by partners or family, and that is quite understandable, but that still leaves many thousands of vacant homes. More often than not, the homes are left empty because rental income is assessed. In light of the major housing crisis, the Bill should have taken note of that issue and addressed it. Legislation is needed urgently to change how rental income is assessed. This could instantly help people in nursing homes to generate extra income while also dealing with the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> The responsibility for creating better options for older people as they age does not fall only under the remit of the Department of Health. Sage Advocacy, which provides advocacy and support for older people, has been very vocal on this. We need to listen to older people regarding what they want, what their wishes are, what is in their best interest and how they can be best supported into their older and frailer years.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> It is extremely important that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage takes action on the issues of supported housing as well. The 2015 review of the nursing home support scheme recommended that sheltered housing and assisted housing models should be considered to provide more options for people as they age and to ensure that greater overall capacity is created in supported living. There are many different models of that with which Members are familiar. There is no standard model. There are various such models but there is not anything like enough capacity to meet the significant need that is there. If older people had better housing options that enabled them to live independently for longer in local communities, many would choose to do so rather than maintaining and heating costly homes that are larger than needed or paying property tax, for example, on a home in which not all the rooms are used.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> All Members are familiar with constituents such as an elderly couple, an elderly single person or a widowed person living in a three-bedroom or four-bedroom house. They really struggle to maintain the house as they are on a fixed and usually low income and they are faced with many maintenance and energy bills and property tax but their options are so limited in terms of what they can do. I regularly get queries from constituents asking whether there are any options for them to move to designated older people's supported housing so that they can continue to live independently and live full lives but not have the burden of trying to maintain a bigger property. Even a two-bedroom or three-bedroom property can be very difficult for an older person to maintain. If there were better options available, we could cater much better for older people. I do not know why that is not being done; it just does not seem to make sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> I am very familiar with what is done in other countries. In Germany, for example, 10% of units in every housing estate are designed for older people so that when a couple or an elderly person is left with an empty nest, they do not have to move out of their community or struggle to try to maintain their home. Rather, they can move down the road, into a more appropriate housing unit within the estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> One obvious and important part of the response is to designate housing for older people and to enable purpose-built accommodation, but the current housing strategy of the Government largely overlooks this. There are examples of such housing in London, where there are flat complexes or apartment blocks that are designated for over-55s or over-60s. They are very suitable for people who want to downsize. We do not have any equivalent here in the private sector and that makes no sense whatsoever. We should have that designation because at the moment the only option for an older person is to move into an apartment and, as Members are aware, there are no apartments for sale at the moment because the funds are gobbling them up.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">There must be designated housing for older people where they can have that kind of security. Older people do no want to move into a mixed apartment block where a gang of students or otherwise could be living next door to them and where it would not be suitable for their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> I ask the Minister of State to consider that designated developments for older people could be built on many of the small infill sites in our cities, where new estates could include a mix of older people's homes as well as family homes. This would enable people to move to more appropriate accommodation as they age. There are some models of dedicated housing schemes in Ireland, but there is no standard consistent model in place. This is happening in many other countries and we should be doing the same. There are also sheltered housing schemes run by local authorities and they have proved to be very successful. When people are getting older, they need easier to maintain and more accessible housing. Local authorities had been providing that on a widespread basis, but they have largely stopped doing that. We need local authorities to get back into that area, not only for the sake of older people, because that is what they want, but also to address the wider housing issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> The financial contribution scheme is a very good one. I do not know if the Minister of State has come across it. It was used widely in my constituency and in other Dublin areas during the 1990s. People sold their homes back to the council, they kept a portion of the proceeds and in return they were offered supported sheltered housing units that were accessible, easy to maintain and well insulated, with supports around them. That was the ideal arrangement. From the local authority's point of view, it got back family homes which it could re-let. They were pepper-potted around the area rather than all in the one place. That is something which must be restarted. Different levels of support can be provided. There are some good models in existence. There is a very good one in Clareville in Glasnevin, which has been there for about 20 years. Different services are brought in. As a security measure, there is somebody on site who drops in to people. All the other services, such as public health nursing, can be brought in. Meals on wheels can provide meals everyday if people require them and if not, that is fine. We must be much more ambitious regarding the kind of support services older people need.</p>

Any time I have raised issues regarding the care of older people, she has always listened and she is very attentive to the excellent debate we are having this afternoon. I have every confidence, having discussed it with her in this House and in private, that statutory home care packages for all families who want to receive them is the way forward. That is absolutely critical and essential. It is an essential promise in the programme for Government. There is universal support from those of us in this House who articulate that demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> I agree with what this Bill seeks to achieve. I congratulate the IFA and business groups for ensuring that all family members, no matter what their income or background, are treated fairly and appropriately under the fair deal system. There are many good things about the fair deal system. This is an additional support which will be very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> I am concerned about the deaths in nursing homes during the past year as a result of Covid. There is an urgent need for an independent inquiry into these deaths. Through my investigations, queries and freedom of information requests, I believe there must be an independent inquiry into what happened in the Dealgan nursing home in Dundalk. I discovered two precedents recently under a freedom on information request. There are inquires-audits-investigations ongoing into two nursing homes, namely, the Tara Winthrop private clinic in Swords and the Phoenix Park community nursing unit. I do not know the reasons this is happening but I welcome them. It is absolutely critical that the Dealgan nursing home is independently investigated. It is the only nursing home in the State that the HSE went into and, with the consent of the owner, took over the running of it and in which more than 22 people died.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> I agree with the point that a nursing home should be the last option. With all due respect to the people currently in one, I believe a nursing home is the last place, medically and physically, one should be in. Support should be provided in one's home or in sheltered housing and through the many good ideas Deputy Shortall outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> One issue that has arisen because of Covid is the inability of survivors to meet repayments after a person who had benefited from the fair deal scheme has passed away. There is a difficulty in meeting the 12-month requirement. The Revenue Commissioners want their income back within a 12-month period after the passing of the person. I think the time period should be extended and the interest should not be demanded for a further six to nine months, or even a year, while maintaining adequate precautions. People cannot get houses repaired at the moment, as we all know. One could not bring in a builder until recently. If a person has to sell a home, we should not penalise him or her because of Covid.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> I want to express my deep concern about the potential for elder abuse if we insist older people living in their homes must go into nursing homes, or other care institutions, before their time. I am very reluctant to make any change to the right of an individual to live in his or her home for as long as he or she possibly can. I oppose absolutely family pressure, financial pressure and other pressures on older vulnerable people living in a home they have lived in all their lives, for 70, 80, 90 years, and pushing them into a nursing home as quickly as possible. That is wrong and is absolutely morally unacceptable. We must examine that proposal in greater detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Some 70% of people who are in nursing homes suffer from dementia. Dementia is not like the flu - here today and gone tomorrow - it gets progressively worse. I know of many people who are broken-hearted looking after a family member at home as the dementia proceeds and increasingly disables the individual cared for. We need due and proper recognition of any pressure which may be inadvertently put on such individuals to get out of their homes. Their quality of life and their familiarity with their bedroom or kitchen is hugely important to them. The only knowledge they may have of their very existence may be something as small and as simple as a favourite teapot, cup or chair. Before we go down that road, we must look at the decision-making process we would make if we were be put in that situation. Consent is the most important thing. How can one give his or her consent in advance to such a decision? The protocols put in place should be clear and absolute. I am very concerned about it. We should be looking at research on it from other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> I support the Minister of State's reluctance to introduce this without due and proper thought. Older people have given their lives to society and their families. They do not want to be placed in a situation where there is conflict between family members, with children saying to parents who suffer from dementia that it is time for them to get out because they cannot pay for their care without doing this. The fair deal scheme is there to protect that individual. That is what it is there for. The asset is not disposed of until the person has passed on and there are no other survivors who are entitled to live in the home. I am reluctant in respect of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> I have no doubt this Bill is very important and I look forward to contributing on Committee Stage. I advise proceeding really slowly on the other proposal and the Minister of State has my full support on that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_675">I welcome this amendment to the nursing homes support scheme. I am happy to support it and it is long overdue. For years, many families with small farms or businesses have been charged 7.5% of the value of the farm or business to pay for nursing home care. It is draining those farms and businesses and making them unviable. I am happy to see the 7.5% will be capped to three years. However, I believe it will not be retrospective, which is quite unfair because of the length of time it has taken this Bill to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas. Many families have been waiting for this, as has been discussed, over a number of years but nothing was done. It is better late than never but some repayment or reduction in fees should be considered for those who have been paying since 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> There is an overemphasis by the HSE on nursing home care for elderly people. There are other options. The HSE has indicated that under Sláintecare it will invest more in providing home-based supported living for elderly people. I welcome that but at the moment not enough is being done in that quarter. I know of several people who would be able to live in their own homes and be much happier there but the home support packages are not available. There would be a saving for the State and, more importantly, people would be able to continue living in and contributing to their community.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> Recently I raised as a Topical Issue matter the upgrading of boarding out regulations. I also raised that issue with the Minister personally and with the Department. It is a much more cost-effective form of care for elderly people based in the community. It suits people who cannot or do not want to live alone but do not require nursing home care. It and other options need to be looked at as there is far too much emphasis on nursing home care. Many people being discharged from hospital are directed towards living in a nursing home instead of looking at what other options might suit them. It may be the most suitable option for many, but it is not for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> The programme for Government contains a commitment to reform the nursing homes support scheme to incentivise renting out vacant properties and encouraging vacant accommodation to be brought back into active use. It is disappointing it is not being followed through in this Bill. There was potential to free up approximately 9,000 properties if it had been included in the Bill. We are in the middle of a housing emergency and that would have been a most welcome move. That is unfortunate but I welcome the amendment as it is.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gino Kenny<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_679">I want to say this Bill addresses enormous problems in the care of older people in Ireland but it does not really address the profound problems we have in that provision. The past 15 months have exposed the inadequacies of the model of residential and long-term elderly care in Ireland, particularly around staffing levels, medical expertise, resources, including personal protective equipment, and payment and treatment of staff. There are limitations in the model we have. As Deputy Shortall said, 20 years ago the ratio of nursing homes was 80% public and 20% private. Now that has reversed completely and it has been Government policy over the last 25 years to incentivise tax breaks for wealthy individuals and companies to invest in large-scale private residential nursing homes. In Clondalkin, two multi-bed nursing homes are being built at the moment. The model has compromised care of the elderly. I would like to see it reversed and a model in which 80% of nursing homes or all of them are publicly run for the good of our elderly citizens. That is the way I ideologically see it. It even makes economic sense, rather than giving it to the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> A number of Deputies have mentioned the fair deal scheme, which has been quite controversial since its inception over a decade ago. Some people have huge difficulties with it but, in some ways, it shifts the onus onto families where the cost has shifted to the private sector. There are huge gaps in the fair deal scheme regarding those who can or cannot pay and the money going to the private sector. Alarm bells always ring when the private sector sees this as a model to make profits, while the State has given up its obligation to care for older people. There are very good, well-run nursing homes in the private sector but I do not think any healthcare should be in private hands, especially the way we have it now. During the pandemic, there were gross inadequacies around private healthcare.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> As Deputy O'Dowd has stipulated, there is an onus on the Government to call a public inquiry into all deaths in nursing homes. Just over half of those who have died in the South of Ireland have been in nursing homes. They were extremely difficult circumstances for all the people working in that setting. There were times when people did not get to say goodbye to their loved ones. It is profoundly difficult. The least we and the Government can do is have a public inquiry into what happened in the last 15 or 16 months during the pandemic. It is important that families and loved ones have some closure about what happened to their loved ones and that this never happens to anybody in those circumstances again.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niamh Smyth<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_682">I congratulate the Minister of State. I do not want to underestimate the work she has done and what she has achieved in delivering this. As Fianna Fáil's Opposition spokesperson for older people, she often spoke about the unfairness of this and how it was debilitating in terms of allowing people to go forward for the fair deal scheme. Not only has she spoken about it and, as Deputy O'Dowd said, listened, but she has delivered on it in a short time in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> This change to the scheme that Fianna Fáil has long sought will mean that, after a period of three years, the value of the family-owned farm will no longer be taken into account when calculating the cost of a person's nursing home care. This will happen where a family successor commits to working the farm or business. We often talk to young farmers who feel it is difficult to find a future in farming and all of that plays into what the Minister of State is trying to do. This change is essential to the viability and sustainability of family firms and allowing them to pass down to the next generation, which we all want to see, particularly those of us in rural constituencies like mine of Cavan-Monaghan. It will ensure that the fair deal is fairer, more accessible and more affordable for family farms.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> This has been a hugely emotive issue for family farms and communities across Ireland and one that Fianna Fáil has now acted on. I am happy to see that critical steps have been taken with the publication of this vital Bill. The Minister of State has listened, heard and responded to the calls from family farms and businesses seeking fundamental reforms, which she has achieved. I hope the Bill receives the full cross-party support it deserves so these hugely important changes can be delivered without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> The nursing homes support scheme, commonly known as fair deal, is a scheme of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing care. The scheme aims to ensure the care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. Under fair deal, residents make contributions to their care based on a financial assessment of their income and assets. In the assessment, the capital value of an individual's principal private residence is included only for the first three years of a resident's time in care.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">This is known as the three-year cap. The nursing homes support scheme has been in operation for the past ten years and there is broad agreement that the scheme operates well and continues to provide appropriate financial assistance where it is required. However, the Government recognises that the current three-year cap and financial assessment of a person's income and assets applies to family farms and businesses only in the case of sudden illness or disability. This situation may place unnecessary financial pressures on families and would challenge the future viability of farms and businesses. I am delighted that this amendment deals with the issue. The Bill delivers on the programme for Government commitment to address it by introducing additional safeguards to the scheme to promote and protect the sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> The Covid-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the vulnerability of many older people, especially those living in long-term residential care. It is critical that the public investment in long-term care services is maintained for those who need it. Care must remain accessible and affordable at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> The nursing homes scheme has been in operation for the past ten years, since 2009, and on 31 December 2020 more than 22,000 people were participating in the scheme at an annual cost of more than €1 billion. That is an endorsement of the popularity and usefulness of the scheme. Participants in the scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum on the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicants' means are assessed at 50% of the couple's combined income and assets. The first €36,000 of an individual's assets and €72,000 in the case of a couple are not counted at all in the financial assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I extend my heartiest congratulations to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. She is only ten months in office. She spoke about this issue on many occasions in opposition. I am thrilled for her and for many people across the country that the matter has been acted on and the Bill is being delivered and implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> I have had direct experience of people close to me being in need of primary care. I thank all the staff working in nursing homes and in primary care. A close family member with complex needs is now being cared for at home. The care, compassion and empathy his family have received from the primary care service have been second to none. I include carers, dieticians, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and GPs. It has not been easy during the pandemic for staff with such expertise to go into homes, but they have willingly delivered the service and allowed people the opportunity to be cared for at home if that is their wish. I cannot overstate what that means to a family, a husband, a wife, children and the extended family. That was the case in particular during the pandemic because such restrictions had to be imposed on nursing home and hospital visits. That is something the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has addressed in order to allow families to get in to see their loved ones. I compliment and congratulate the Minister of State, not only for listening but also for delivering.</p>

          <p eId="para_691">There is little doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed some of the issues regarding how we take care of the weaker in society, in particular the elderly. At one stage, much was made of the differing death rates between Ireland and the UK, where the use of nursing homes is more widespread, and places like Spain and Italy, where it is more common for multiple generations of the same family to reside together. Needless to say, the comparison eventually fell foul of the rising case numbers, and while heroic efforts were made by staff and others to keep the virus out of nursing homes, many eventually succumbed to the awful reality of the virus. I understand that half of the deaths occurred in nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> The Oaklands Nursing Home in Listowel made national headlines during the second wave when the virus found its way in from the community. HIQA previously expressed concerns in the lead-up to the outbreak. I believe what happened in Oaklands and in other nursing homes must be part of a public inquiry into the State's response to Covid-19. While there is a place for good, private operators, the outsourcing of elder care to private operators has caused problems. The HSE should have more of a role. When problems emerged in private nursing homes they called on the HSE for assistance. I pay tribute to all healthcare workers, but especially to the ones in the Cork-Kerry community healthcare area, who rolled up their sleeves, went into places and sorted out the problem, putting their own lives at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> I would also like to see a review of how elder care is provided generally across the country, including a review of HIQA. It is clear that there is significant demand from families to get their loved ones into a HSE-run nursing home in County Kerry, in particular in north Kerry, where there is no HSE-operated home. I reiterate my call for the HSE to commit to the provision of a new community nursing home in north Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> We also need to change radically how we provide and fund these facilities. A public model is easier to regulate and, when we consider that 80% of all residents in private homes avail of the fair deal scheme, we are effectively operating a publicly funded model already. People requiring elder care are some of our most vulnerable and they deserve better.</p>

          <p eId="para_697">This Bill is welcomed by everybody. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for bringing it forward with such haste. The Bill is long overdue. I wish to mention the previous Minister of State, Jim Daly, who worked on the Bill. He probably got some of the legal wrangles sorted out for the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and I want to acknowledge his work.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> It is important that we protect family farms and businesses. It has been an anomaly in the system that there was no cap on the contribution in the same way as there was on a private house. It will make sure that businesses are safe. There is a lot of trauma involved when a member of a family has to go into a nursing home. If there are financial worries as well, it is important that we try to sort them out. The exposure that existed was genuinely a worry for many families with farms or businesses, as it meant they might have to sell the farm or business to pay for the nursing home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> I wish to refer to a woman in my constituency, Maura Canning, whom I met some eight years ago. She was campaigning on this issue on behalf of farmers and their families. She never gave up, she just kept at it. I acknowledge the work she did on the issue over the years to bring it to this stage. She deserves credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> I also acknowledge the work that has been carried out by staff in nursing homes in the past 15 months. They have always done the work, but it came to the fore, especially in the family-run nursing homes, how they performed in their duties against all the odds to try to protect as many of their residents as possible. I had first-hand experience of that in Green Park Nursing Home in Tuam, where I saw what they were doing. The pandemic was very tough on staff and we must acknowledge the input of every member of staff. We must also acknowledge that when a crisis developed in certain areas, members of the public who had medical training donned their nurses' uniforms again and went back to help out. That is a sign that we are all in it together when it comes to care for the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> I wish to raise the significant differential rates being paid to the private nursing home sector, especially to family-owned nursing homes. This is something I have come across and Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, has spoken about it on numerous occasions. Different nursing homes are getting different rates of allocation from the HSE and there is no apparent reason for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">In one case where a nursing home is providing dementia services, the HSE does not recognise that as an additional service that they provide and it refuses to give them any type of increase in their rate. That needs to be examined because there is such a variation in what is being paid to nursing homes, yet the services they provide are the same. That is wrong and needs to be upended to make sure everybody is treated fairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> Small, private family nursing homes, those that have a 50-bed or 60-bed unit, have to make sure they can meet all their bills. They are providing local employment and they need to be treated with parity and equality. There is no reason different rates should be available to different nursing homes. It is archaic. It is something that was brought in at one stage but now, if percentage increases are being offered, it means the person on the lowest rate will end up with less money. There is also no recognition for specialist units. I request that a review be undertaken as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> In addition, there is no independent appeals process if people feel aggrieved with the rates they are getting. The process is reviewed within the HSE and it takes months to do that. In the meantime, the nursing home is left on the old rate, which is causing a severe financial burden, especially as they are now investing more and more in safety and in strategies to ensure they deal with every kind of pandemic that arises into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_705">The HSE confirmed to me in recent days that approximately 750 people who caught the virus while in hospital have died. We know that 2,000 people who also died of Covid-19 in the State were nursing home residents. These are truly shocking statistics. When we add those two figures together, we learn that 56% of all the people who died of Covid in this State did so in either hospitals or nursing homes. A majority died in facilities that were either run by or regulated by the State. While many people were pointing the finger of judgment at pubs, masks and beaches, more than half of Covid deaths were among people in the care of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> We also know that where people died from Covid in a nursing home or in HSE care, these were very tragic situations. They were often situations where people had an injury or a fall and were presented to hospital for examination, caught Covid in that hospital, deteriorated quickly and, sadly, passed away. One of the most tragic aspects was that it was due to the shortage of staff in many nursing homes and hospitals. This led to difficulties with people finding out what was happening in nursing homes. At St. Mary's in the Phoenix Park, families only learned about outbreaks through news bulletins and, scandalously, this was all too common. In response to a parliamentary question, the State Claims Agency told me that at least five families are suing the State regarding the circumstances of family members catching the illness in hospitals or nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> Last week, the Department of Health told me that 74,283 people had signed up for the Be on Call for Ireland recruitment campaign but a mere 355 of them were actually recruited. That is hard to believe. I listened to nurses from nursing homes and hospitals crying on the phone to me, telling me they needed staff as soon as possible. Some of them were actually going on social media, asking members of the public to help them.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> It also emerged last week that the Government is carrying out an inquiry into the State's handling of the pandemic, which I welcome, and we had called for that. Nursing homes should be the primary focus of that inquiry. I have much respect for the Minister of State and it must be borne in mind that many of the fatal mistakes that were made with regard to nursing homes were made before she went into government. Let us take, for example, the fact that when the pandemic broke out, nursing homes decided to close their doors to visitors, only to be slapped on the wrist by NPHET and the Department, and told that the doors should remain open and closure was not necessary. We were also told in reports that the HSE intercepted supplies of PPE, oxygen and staff that were designated for nursing homes, and “intercepted” is the word that was used by the health spokesperson for Fianna Fáil at the time, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. Freedom of information documents show that the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, repeatedly ignored meeting requests from Tadhg Daly of Nursing Homes Ireland during that time. On 16 April last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, furnished this House with a survey she had conducted of nursing homes, which found that 60% of them had no supply of PPE.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> I welcome the fact that the Government is launching this inquiry but we need to have a discussion about how it will run. We need to have a discussion in Leinster House on the terms of reference of the inquiry. There is no way the inquiry should fail to have the input of all elected representatives in the Dáil and all the 26 counties of the State. The Government, the previous Government and the HSE have serious questions to answer about what happened in nursing homes and in hospitals around the country, and how the pandemic was handled. We need to get to the truth of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">I will first talk about the Bill and then nursing homes. I welcome the Bill, which introduces a three-year cap on the financial contributions of family-owned and family-operated farms or businesses when calculating the cost of nursing home care. The cap applies where a family successor commits to working the farm or business continually for a minimum of six years and commits to working the farm or business not less than 50% of their normal working time. The family successor must also have worked on the farm or business for three out of the previous five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> Commonly known as the "fair deal", the nursing homes support scheme, established in 2009, is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care. Under the scheme, a financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much each applicant will contribute to the cost of their care. Participants contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and up to 7.5% per annum of the value of any assets held towards the cost of their care, although a participant's principal residence is included in the financial assessment for only the first three years they are in nursing home care, regardless of how long they spend in care. Anyone who is ordinarily resident in the State and needs long-term nursing home care can apply for the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> Where an individual's assessed weekly contribution is greater than the cost of care, they do not qualify for financial support. Therefore, applicants with substantial assets or incomes are unlikely to qualify for financial support. The capital value of an individual's primary private residence is only included for the first three years of a resident's time in care. This is known as the three-year cap. However, to date, the three-year cap has applied to family farms or businesses only in cases where a farmer or business owner suffers a sudden illness or disability and, as a result, requires nursing home care. When the three-year cap does not apply, this can result in financial pressures on these families and could challenge the future viability of the farm or business. Introducing a three-year cap on the financial contributions of family farms or businesses will help protect the sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation. The changes have been long-awaited and will bring relief to many families.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> The maximum contribution, based on the capital value of a farm or business, will be 7.5% per annum for three years only, provided that all the conditions of the scheme are complied with. The current system sees farm families and business owners required to set aside 7.5% of the value of their land annually to fund a place in a nursing home. This means the family farm could be lost to the next generation after 14 years as it would drain the value of the farm to pay for the care of a family member in a nursing home.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> Many older people were not going into care out of fear that the farm will not be there to hand on to the next generation. This should not happen. I am relieved this new legislation will resolve the situation. Care must remain accessible and affordable, including for those families with a farm or a business. Many of those with farms and businesses have worked extremely hard to build their business from the ground and they employ local people in the area. They deserve this additional safeguard to protect the sustainability of family farms and businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> It is important that we protect our older generation as much as any other citizens. Many families are grieving at the moment. The bottom line is that they simply want to know what will happen to loved ones. I am glad there will be an inquiry. It has gone on a long time and there has been a lot of bad publicity for nursing homes during the Covid-19 pandemic. In fairness, some deserve it, but some do not. Given my experience as a Deputy for the past ten or 11 years, I have nothing but respect for nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">My mother was in a nursing home for three years and the staff, management and everyone involved in the nursing home did a fantastic job. It is very important that the nursing homes that abused, or whatever they did to these residents, are held accountable. I have visited many nursing homes in my own town of Dundalk. They and the families want closure. I appeal to the Minister of State on this, as it is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> We must also mention the HSE. When it came to equipment for the nursing homes, they were left wanting. The HSE really let the nursing homes and the families down, and the nursing homes feel that themselves, and I hope the investigation also looks into the HSE's performance. The nursing homes in Dundalk have done really well but when it came to getting food delivered, some small businesses in the town actually refused to go to the nursing homes. That is not right.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> Many families are grieving, which I know from my town of Dundalk. They have lost their mothers, fathers, uncles and aunts and they just want answers. This has been going on for more than 12 months. I ask the Minister of State once again to look into it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Verona Murphy<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_719">I am happy to see this Bill come forward. It has much to do with the Minister of State's progress since taking office. When we talk about farming, we are often limited in what we can say and do within the parameters of EU rules and regulations, often to the detriment of farming communities. However, with the fair deal scheme we cannot blame others or pass the buck on the treatment of farmers. Successive Governments have been solely responsible for this unequal treatment of farmers and it is welcome that steps are finally being made to level the fair deal playing field. I will attribute that to the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> The nursing home support scheme is a vital State support, which ensures those in need of care are able to avail of it in an affordable way but up to now for farmers and farm families it could better be described as the "unfair deal". It has been an unfair deal because farmers have been expected to pay higher contributions for their care than others. The scheme in its design did not take into account the unique situation in which farmers found themselves. The 7.5% contribution from the value of assets towards the cost of care is capped for all other sectors but not capped for farmers. That means that if a farmer had been in long-term care, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, for 14 years, the farm could actually be lost. It is not just the farm. In most cases, family farms, farmed for decades, are passed down generation after generation. The Bill is, therefore, very welcome. It is a step in the right direction but even its passing will leave some outstanding issues to be addressed. Members of the farming community have shared with me their continuing concerns. The demands made by the Bill are quite restrictive. The successor is tied to farming the land for six years after the client enters the nursing home. It places a heavy burden on the successor, who will still have to commit to paying fees of up to €200,000 over the initial three-year period. </p>
          <p eId="para_721"> We must remember that a farm is a working asset and if the farmer has to sell land to make payments, we hurt their ability and the ability of future generations of the family to make a living from the farm. The average farm income is well below what we would call an industrial wage. It could be as little as €24,000 when the annual nursing home charge can be between €50,000 and €60,000. Farms will be mortgaged to meet care payments, which will restrict the ability of farmers to borrow for farm development or machinery and other related capital expenditure necessary for progress. I appeal to the Minister of State to examine ways to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> Life expectancy has steadily increased. In 1950, life expectancy in Ireland was approximately 65 years. Now, thankfully, it is approximately 82 years and projected to continue rising. As people are likely to live for longer, it stands to reason that the average time spent in long-term care is also likely to increase. This will affect people in every walk of life but I believe it will have the greatest effect on farmers and their families. We must be proactive in preparing for it. </p>
          <p eId="para_723"> I will support the Bill as it is a step in the right direction that will make a positive difference to farmers and farm families who find themselves in these situations. However, I hope the Government will take on board the issues I have raised and that were raised with me by the farming community and take the steps necessary to solve the problems. I acknowledge the input of Alice Doyle from the IFA in Wexford, as well as the nursing staff in our nursing homes who have been under severe pressure because of Covid, just like all the front-line staff, who have, in most cases, done a stellar job. </p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Finally, I endorse the point that there are many small nursing homes. Deputy Canney spoke about how bed funding is allocated to different nursing homes. It is a significant issue in Wexford. In Wicklow, €250 more is paid for a nursing home bed. I have looked into why that is the case but have not been able to come up with an answer.</p>

          <from>Deputy Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_725">I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward the Bill, which I very much welcome. I also join in paying tribute to all those working in nursing homes, the staff, care assistants, the people who provide the meals and the management in all the homes across the country. It has been a very difficult 18 months for everyone. The current scheme provides that 80% of the person's income goes towards nursing home cost. If they are the owner of a dwelling house, it is 7.5% per annum for a maximum of three years, so the maximum that can be taken when a person has a dwelling house is 22.5% over that three years, if they survive for that period. The same cap does not apply to businesses and to farms and, therefore, I very much welcome the proposed change in the Bill which was clearly set out in the review published in 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> Sometimes the State is slow to act on the changes required. I can go back to a ward of court case in 1976 called Maud McInerney in the Supreme Court where the court decided that nursing home care came under the definition of "medical care". Therefore, anyone with a medical card was technically entitled to free nursing home care. It took a further 28 years before the Department of Health and the health boards reacted. They continued to deduct 80% of pensions even though there was no proper regulation or legislation to allow them to do so. It is only when a number of us in the legal profession challenged it in 2004 that suddenly changes were made. It should not have taken 28 years for a proper structure to be put in place. Until the time of the fair deal scheme, it was hit and miss whether someone got a bed in a public nursing home or had support if he or she was in a private nursing home. It was interesting how, in 2004, emergency legislation was rushed through in three days which tried to make nursing home charges retrospective. The then President, Mary McAleese, referred it to the Supreme Court and, in February 2005, it found it unconstitutional. That meant it was back to the drawing board and a refund of more than €400 million to people who had been charged in nursing homes over previous years. This raises the question of why it takes us so long to bring about necessary change. I very much welcome what occurred after 2004 and the introduction of the fair deal scheme. What was done was very fair and brought about the necessary changes except for those who were farmers or in business.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The necessary change was not made for them. I recently encountered the case of a man who had paid more than €480,000 in nursing home charges, which is a substantial amount, over ten years before he died because he was not in the fair deal scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> Let me address the provisions of the Bill, particularly section 3 and the circumstances that arise when a farm is transferred and the transferor needs nursing home care within five years of the transfer. If a son or daughter to whom a farm is transferred borrows substantially to invest in it and his or her parent ends up in a nursing home, the question of how to service the debt arises when the debt is registered against the farm at a later date. We must ensure that the interest rate is not above the current bank interest rate. This needs to be examined carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> I am sure every Member has come across very difficult cases. I have had a case involving a son who had a farm transferred to him and who had it in his possession for more than five years. His father died and then he was killed tragically himself in an accident but had no will made. The farm reverted to the mother, who ended up in a nursing home. A question arose over the entitlement to take the farm into account in determining what should be paid to the nursing home. Those are very genuine circumstances. I came across the case of a man who died and left his farm to his son and mother. The mother ended up in a nursing home but the farm was not yielding a sufficient income to pay the nursing home charges. Fifty percent of the value of the farm was taken into account in calculating the charges. These are very genuine cases. We need to be careful when putting in place the regulations. While I very much welcome the three-year cap, a valuation does not necessarily identify whether there is sufficient income to service the debts. We need to be careful about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> On nursing home care and responding to the changes needed, we all want to develop home care. In rural areas, there are major challenges in getting people to give care. We do not have a sufficient number of people who can provide the type of home care in question. We need to determine how we can encourage more people to provide the service and obtain the necessary training and skills. That is the biggest challenge we will face in the next ten years. The number aged over 65 is currently 720,000. By 2030, there will be 1 million. We need to increase the number of people who can provide home care immediately if we want to keep as many people in their own homes for as long as they want to stay in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> I thank the Minister of State for introducing this legislation. I look forward to working with her to have it passed and implemented at an early date.</p>

          <p eId="para_732">As Deputy Burke outlined, nursing home care and care homes will become a more considerable issue politically and socially in the years to come, undoubtedly because of our growing and ageing population. The Deputy outlined that there are challenges in this regard. Undoubtedly, there are but it is important that we acknowledge that it is good that people are living longer. What is important is ensuring that if we live longer, we live a life of good quality, be it at home or in a nursing home.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> The pandemic highlighted the fact that there were significant issues in some homes, including governance issues and failings, but it should be acknowledged that the standard of care in many homes is very high. However, we have a system that operates on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. There is a mixture of community, private and HSE-led services in a sector that we need to consider as public. The State needs to regard the sector as one in which a minimum standard of care is provided. It needs to be responsible for that. It should outsource less and allow others to take less responsibility, as is the case in education and health services, generally, and in many other public services. We need to ensure a minimum standard. This is essential. Forthcoming legislation needs to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> The three-year cap is sensible and logical. The circumstances in which people can find themselves when engaging with the fair deal scheme can be extremely challenging so we need to be as fair as possible to them. I welcome the changes in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> There are two other areas we need to address. To flag an issue, I have come across people entering the fair deal scheme or seeking a nursing home bed who have come from mental health facilities and through the mental health system. There is a challenge in this regard in respect of getting transition funding cleared. It is sometimes the case that, by the time the transition funding is cleared, a bed can be gone, meaning the family in question or the nurse helping them has to start the work again. We need to make the system a little more transparent and effective in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> The vast majority of people want to be cared for at home for as long as possible. It is what patients, citizens and families want. It is also probably better medically. We need a statutory home care set-up. We need to think about legislation underpinning this. At the heart of this are the home helps. We need to ensure they are well paid and that their employment supports are secure. We need to have more of them because the waiting lists are far too long.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_737">I congratulate the Minister of State on this. We have had many battles over St. Brigid's hospital, Carrick-on-Suir. We have been waiting for equality and fairness for farming families and self-employed people. My colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and I will table amendments because there are still anomalies regarding farmers not being treated fairly. Regardless of how long it took to get this right, everyone accepted it was wrong. It took four or five years to get to where we are. The former Minister of State, Jim Daly, did a lot and tried his best. I acknowledge that it was the current Minister of State who got it over the line. I compliment her on that. There are still aspects that are so inherently unfair, however. There is a yearly cap of 7.5% of the value of the home, capped after three years, but I am referring to those with a farm or business. We should remember a farm is no good unless a farmer is able to work it. If it is going to be stripped away for years, it is no good. What will happen those who were severely punished? I realise the legislation cannot be made retrospective but surely the individuals should have some redress because farms and small businesses have been rendered useless by the annual charges. We have to look after our elderly. They were always revered in this country and we respected them but now there is a tragic situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> The differences in the prices of public and private nursing homes, as mentioned by Deputy Canney, are shocking. The cost of the public ones is shocking. It is also shocking that there can be so many anomalies.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> I salute the staff, management, nursing home owners and their families for the sterling work they have done in the past 14 months. They were abandoned by the Government but they did great work. I salute Mr. Dermot Dougan of Clonmel especially because he has added a massive extension to Melview nursing home. There is a spanking new, pristine nursing home only up the road from the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in Carrickbeg. There are supposed to be negotiations on taking patients out of St. Brigid's, which is no longer with us thanks to the Minister of State and the Minister. I ask the Minister of State to meet Councillors Kieran Bourke and David Dunne and the action committee, nurses and doctors. She is responsible for the care of the elderly and palliative care. All the people going into the facility were older people but now the palliative care beds are denied to the people of the surrounding area, including the Minister of State's county, Port Láirge. It is very unfair and downright wrong. The people funded those beds and all the associated technical equipment. I ask the Minister of State to have an open meeting with the relevant individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">There is no point in telling Damien Tiernan and Waterford Local Radio that he spoke to them and offered a meeting. They were not offered a meeting. They were refused.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> Getting back to what happened in the nursing homes, 2,000 people died in them. Just think about it. They could not get PPE, staff or anything. They were crying out for help. Doctors were refusing to go in to sign the death certificates. Nurses and nurse managers were asked to sign the death certificates. They were put in body bags and gone and the families did not see them. It was horrific. We must have an investigation into what happened. It was shocking. Some 750 people picked up the virus in hospitals and died, including a good friend of my own, John McGrath, Ballyporeen, whom I spoke to on Christmas Eve. He went into Cork University Hospital, and he and three other patients on the ward got Covid, and he is no longer with us. That is a shocking indictment of the HSE, the Minister for Health and anybody involved with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> We have to have a totally independent review of what happened. There is no point in setting up an investigation chaired by some Secretary General from some Department. We must get an outside, external, independent person from a different country to see the blackguarding going on with the people in nursing homes. They were abandoned. There was no PPE. PPE on the way to them was diverted, as was oxygen. If we did not have oxygen, we would all die. Oxygen which was so badly needed was stolen from the nursing homes. That kind of blackguarding and the mismanagement in the HSE since it was set up is just appalling, with the lack of accountability and the wages paid to the CEO. It is despicable. We clap for the nurses but we will not pay them.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> Some 75,000 people signed up for Ireland's call, in the spirit of the meitheal. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle loves Irish terms. Only 3,500 were taken on. They wanted, in the spirit of the meitheal, to serve their country, but they were denied because of a conglomerate and a cabal in the HSE. It kept all these people out, saying it wanted to keep and control all the overtime for itself. Caring for the people is one of its last worries. The Health Information and Quality Authority is not fit for purpose and should be disbanded too. If it suits it, it will come in. It will not go into the crowded corridors in the hospital in Limerick or South Tipperary General Hospital, but it will come in and close down good nursing homes. There is a lot of blackguarding and unfair treatment by HIQA. We need a full and proper inquiry, not a toothless inquiry, into what happened in nursing homes and hospitals.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">Tá áthas orm labhairt faoin reachtaíocht seo. Tá an reachtaíocht seo fíorthábhachtach agus ba liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit Butler as ucht an tsárobair a rinne sí chun na hathruithe a bhaineann leis an reachtaíocht seo a chur chun cinn. Ba mhaith liom é sin a rá go poiblí.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> On 7 April, I welcomed the Minister of State, Deputy Butler's, confirmation that the Attorney General had provided a measure of legal certainty about the fair deal reforms, which are so badly needed. We know that, the length and breadth of the country, many farming families and small businesses have really struggled to make ends meet. I acknowledge and commend one man in particular, a farmer from Kilcormac in County Offaly, in my constituency, Joe Carroll, who led from the front on this issue. Joe had his own personal reasons and story and a significant struggle over the years. He played a major part in ensuring this issue was brought to the fore, in campaigning for fairness and to ensure we are where we are today. I hope the rest will progress quickly. It needs to. We cannot leave farming families and small businesses waiting a day longer. We need to get this over the line. I hope that will be done. To date, in fairness, promises have been delivered on.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> Until recently, the HSE was providing financial support in respect of more than 23,300 individuals within the scheme. This gives some sense of how urgent the reforms are. We also know the HSE reported that this support amounted to €969 million, including some €51 million in the form of loans to residents to assist them in paying their contributions. The HSE also estimates that an additional €343 million was paid directly to nursing homes in 2018, in the form of residents' contributions. Those contributions have to be seen in the context of the motion tabled on the fair deal scheme by the Rural Independent Group in May 2017. At that time, the Rural Independent Group pointed out that family farms make a vital contribution to growth and employment in rural areas, forming the backbone of our rural economy. It is estimated that farm families spend €8 billion per year in the Irish economy, most of which is spent locally, supporting local jobs and local enterprises. This is clearly not just a sensitive area with regard to addressing people's care needs but also a significant economic issue, with almost 550 nursing homes involved in providing care under this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> On the proposals before us, I share the concerns about the lack of capacity for the reforms to be made retrospective. We have seen that the Irish Cattle &amp; Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, has described this move as a scandal. The ICSA rightly points out that the three-year cap was approved by Government in 2019 and that any calculation over the three years should apply from back then. I ask the Minister of State to look at that aspect to see if this can be applied retrospectively. I believe it is the right and fair thing to do. We have to end up with a system that is more just and equitable than the current arrangement. To that end, I hope to continue to engage constructively with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and others so that goals to that effect can be achieved.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_748">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for bringing us to where we are today. At least we will have a cap of three years on the family farm, as there is on all residential properties. I am still not happy with this because I believe the land should not be assessed. It should be the family home, the same as everybody else. Why treat farmers, publicans and shopkeepers differently from everyone else? Why should their business places be assessed? I will give an example. A poor farm could be valued at €500,000. To pay 7.5% of that would amount to €37,500 a year, for three years. That would be €112,500 the young fellow or whoever takes on the farm will be responsible for paying back. If that young fellow had to provide a house for himself, with a mortgage, and to pay back this loan, he would not get much out of the work of 60 or 70 cows and he would be fairly run down to the ground before he would be paid back. It is not right. The family farm should not be assessed in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> Even though farms may be worth big money, they do not always generate big money. That is what we have to know here. The Minister of State said that family members must have been involved in the enterprise for five years previously and that they must farm the farm for six years in future. That is a fair commitment. What we are not recognising properly is that farmers have a constant battle on their hands, long hours of manual work, red tape and regulations. When they have dealt with everything else, they have to contend with the weather. Many finish up in bad shape physically and maybe mentally too. That needs to be recognised. To say that some young fellow or his wife must continue to farm does not consider that they have children who may be going to school or that there may be apprentices. It is wrong to stop the farmer who is left behind from leasing the land, because that would generate money for him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> Every one of us here has a duty to ensure that every law that is brought in is democratic. This assessment of the family farm is not democratic. The family farm is handed down and the farmer wants to hand it down again to the next generation. That has been done traditionally in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">I respect the Minister of State very much because she keeps people in mind at all times. However, she needs to consider this again. The family farm should not form part of the assessment. It is not fair, it is not right and it is not democratic. In the normal case, income and savings are assessed and the first €35,000 of savings are not reckonable. In many cases, farmers do not have €35,000 in savings because, as has been said here, many of them do not even make €20,000 a year. It is very wrong to say that the person left behind when, all of a sudden, the worker on the farm finishes up in a hospital and then in a nursing home cannot rent out the farm. It is very wrong to include it in the assessment in the first place.</p>

          <p eId="para_752">I thank the Minister of State for bringing this Bill before us today. It has been a long time in the offing. There was a lot of discussion on this issue with the previous Government since I was elected in 2016 but it led to little or nothing. Perhaps there was some work going on behind the scenes but it was certainly not being addressed in the manner in which it should have been, so we appreciate the Minister of State bringing this Bill before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> The nursing home support scheme, generally referred to as the fair deal scheme, was established in 2009 to provide financial support to eligible residents to help them with the cost of their nursing home care. Residents are required to make a contribution towards the cost of their care depending on their means while the HSE contributes the balance. In 2018, the average rate charged in public nursing homes was €1,564 a week. The agreed average maximum price chargeable for private or voluntary homes was €968 a week. This difference shows that the cost associated with private care homes is 62% less than that associated with public care homes. For 2018, additional funding of €23 million was required from other Exchequer sources to meet such deficits. In 2015, the HSE committed to publishing the weekly cost of care base charge rates for public nursing homes. Charge rates were published for 2016 but not for 2017. Will the Minister of State advise if these weekly cost of care base charges data are being published? If not, why not? It would provide transparency for everyone and not least for patients and their families. </p>
          <p eId="para_754"> Presently, people using the scheme who are moving into nursing homes contribute up to 80% of their income and up to 7.5% of the value of any assets held towards the costs of their care. The value of a person's home is included in the financial assessment only for the first three years of that person's time in care but this three-year cap does not apply to family-owned, family-operated farms or businesses when costs are calculated. The 7.5% per annum levy means that farmers and business owners face indefinite contributions based on their assets. In some cases, this threatens their very viability. The scheme clearly discriminates against them. The Bill makes no provision for the making of retrospective payments in cases where the farm has been included as an asset in the calculations. This is grossly unfair and must be addressed by the Government. This issue has dragged on for many years and, as such, a retrospective repayment should be made to families. It is a scandal that the resolution to the fair deal scheme has been dragged out for so long. I am not pointing the finger at the Minister of State, but at her predecessors who allowed the issue to drag on for so long. </p>
          <p eId="para_755"> I also commend the people who work in community hospitals. The staff work so hard. I refer to hospitals in my own constituency, from Schull Community Hospital right over to Kinsale. There are great workers out there but some of these hospitals are not up to HIQA standards. One comes to mind. It is a fabulous hospital which serves a massive area, Clonakilty Community Hospital. The bottom line is that the HIQA standards were meant to apply well before now but the matter has dragged on and on. No matter how good the staff in Clonakilty are, if the building is not corrected and brought up to standard in the same way as other hospitals such as those in Schull, Skibbereen and Castletownbere, where work is ongoing at the moment, that will obviously have a knock-on effect on that local community hospital. Will the Minister of State look into that? I recently had a meeting with the HSE, which says it is not on the agenda, which is bad news.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> I also thank the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, which have worked very hard on the issue of the fair deal scheme and have been pushing this agenda for many years. As Deputy Nolan said earlier, the Rural Independent Group tabled a motion on this matter a few years ago because we saw the need and we saw the difficulties farm families were having because of the unfair way in which the scheme was being rolled out.</p>

          <p eId="para_757">I thank Deputies Michael Collins, Danny Healy-Rae and Nolan for allowing me some of their speaking time on this very important subject. I also thank the Minister of State for being here to introduce this very important legislation. While it is a step in the right direction, it does not go far enough. I want to look back on the campaign that brought us to where we are. I thank all of the people who lobbied their politicians up and down the length and breadth of the country. I thank the people in Kerry, including those in the Kerry branches of the IFA and ICMSA. I too remember Joe Carroll. I remember meeting him and I do not mind saying on the record of the Dáil that he was a terribly nice man who really put his heart and soul into this campaign. He made a very strong impression on me with his own life situation. Similarly, many other people with whom I have been dealing over the years have been adversely impacted by the rules and regulations surrounding the fair deal scheme as it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> A terribly important issue when speaking about farms, which I would love to knock on the head once and for all, also applies to pubs, shops and other types of business. When I hear people putting values on such businesses, it is obvious that they do not know what they are talking about. If a farm is worth a given amount of money - and I do not care what it is worth on paper - it is actually worth nothing, because it is not being sold. It is a tool for a family to make a living. It is a mechanism to make money. That is all it is. When one hears of a farmer expanding a farm and purchasing more land, all that farmer is doing is trying to improve his or her income. They are custodians of the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> I thank our nursing homes and community hospitals for the work they have done over the pandemic. I thank the staff and the management for the efforts they have made in really difficult times. It has been very hard on those people because they were taking care of very vulnerable people and doing their best to protect them.</p>

          <from>Deputy James O'Connor<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_764">I know the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has put an enormous amount of work into this particular issue. I am glad to see that progress is being made. I am sure there are many issues that still need to be teased out but I have every confidence that she will deliver. I come from a farming background and the Minister of State and I share a constituency border. We are very much at the heart of dairy country in Ireland. This particular issue is of the utmost importance to people working in agriculture in the dairy industry and to family farms right across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021 updates the fair deal nursing home support scheme to give greater protections to farm families and businesses. This was also a firm commitment in the Fianna Fáil manifesto last year. This change to the scheme will mean that after a three-year period, the value of family-owned farms will no longer be considered when calculating the cost of a person’s nursing home care. This will happen where a family successor commits to working the farm or business. This change is essential to the viability and sustainability of family farms, allowing them to be passed down to the next generation. It will ensure that the fair deal is fairer, more accessible and more affordable for farm families.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> The capital value of an individual’s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the scheme for the first three years of that individual's time in care. This is known as the three-year cap. Currently, this unqualified three-year cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses, except in the case where a farmer or business owner suffers a sudden illness or disability and, as a result, requires nursing home care. This Bill seeks to address this issue by introducing additional safeguards to the scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family. The proposed change is to cap the period in which financial contributions are based on farm and business assets at three years, where a nominated family successor commits to working the productive asset within the first three years of the resident’s time in care.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> This has been a very emotive issue for many farm families across the country and it is one on which Fianna Fáil has now acted. We are happy to have now made this critical step forward with the publication of this vital Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">We have listened to, heard and responded to the calls from farm families, the IFA and businesses for these fundamental reforms. I pay tribute to the IFA for its significant work on this issue. There is more to be done and, speaking as someone from a farming background, I look forward to engaging with the association on a continuous basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> This Bill to amend the nursing homes support scheme will place a cap of three years on the financial contributions of family-owned and family-operated farms or businesses when calculating the cost of nursing home care. This will occur where a family successor commits to working the farm or business. The scheme, commonly known as fair deal, is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care. It aims to ensure that care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. The Government recognises that the three-year cap on the financial assessment of a person's income and assets applies to family farms or businesses only in the case of sudden illness or disability. This may place unnecessary financial pressures on those families and could challenge the future viability of their farms and businesses. The Bill delivers on the programme for Government commitment to address the issue by introducing additional safeguards to the scheme to promote and protect the sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> The Covid-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the vulnerabilities of many older people, especially those living in long-term residential care. It is critical that public investment in long-term care services be maintained for the people and areas that need it. Care must remain accessible and affordable, including for those families with a farm or business.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> Where my community of Youghal is concerned, I am looking forward to engaging with the Minister of State on expanding the local care facilities in our area of east Cork. It has a rapidly ageing population in addition to having quite a young population and further investment in the region is needed. I thank her for her engagement so far and look forward to working with her.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denise Mitchell<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_772">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Bill, which I hope will finally deal with the scheme's inequalities and make the scheme fairer for those who are going into residential care for longer than a couple of years. The care we will get in our senior years is something that we all worry about. We want to be sure that we receive the best care possible and keep as much of our independence as we can. We want to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> We need to start considering how to deal with the care of older people in a way that is fair to everyone and does not leave people with large debts. International best practice in elder care must be examined. Independent living in single units with services and wrap-around supports on site must form part of our planning for elder care living. We need to introduce a publicly funded model of residential care. The current model is another example of the Government relying too heavily on the private sector to provide what should be a public service. We must also consider how we use home help hours. The lack of available hours and supports is the reason some people need to move into residential care. They have no alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> The Bill is welcome and improves some elements for some people, but we need a complete rethink of the nursing home system and how our home help supports operate. We must consider how we treat older people and ensure their dignity and respect when we help them in whatever way we can to have as much choice as possible. We need to be much more ambitious than just tweaking a system that is struggling.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_775">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute on the Bill. I have been asking parliamentary questions for some time about the Bill's progression, as its provisions may impact a large number of my constituents. Some Donegal farming families have been in contact with me about this amending legislation and were anxious to see what it would contain. The IFA farm family and social affairs chairperson in County Donegal has been in regular contact with me about it since December. The chairperson was originally in touch last year with proposed amendments to the Bill. A three-year cap was seen as a priority and a number of other issues were highlighted as important for the IFA, including the exclusion of some farms with leased land from the cap. In County Donegal alone, there are more than 32,000 ha of leased land, according to Central Statistics Office figures, and a large number of farmers will be affected. This would mean that many families would not be able to avail of the three-year cap. The IFA also called for no reduction in the look-back clause.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> The IFA was concerned that some people would not meet the criteria for the three-year cap as outlined in the heads of the Bill. For example, the identified successor, usually a son or daughter, may have been working abroad and only returned when a parent was in need of care. Such successors would not meet the criterion of having worked the business or farm for a given number of hours in three of the previous five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> This week, I met the IFA farm family and social affairs chairperson in County Donegal to hear the IFA's ongoing concerns with the Bill. Despite having raised the issue last December, it seems that leased land is still excluded from the three-year cap. There has been no reduction in the five-year look-back clause either and no change on retrospective charges to 2018. The IFA is still worried about families that will be excluded on the basis that they do not meet the criterion of having farmed the asset for a portion of time in three of the preceding five years. The association raised all of these issues a number of months ago. According to the chairperson, she had been informed that it was unconstitutional</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_778">... to place a Burden/Mortgage on a deed which may have been transferred e.g. within 2 yrs. of a person needing Nursing Home care to a Successor, all taxes paid, the folio/Deed registered in the name of the new owner. The Successor new registered owner becomes responsible for the debt of the previous owner.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The IFA questions whether this complies with Irish and European property rights. The chairperson said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_780">This burden on the Deed will impede the Successor from borrowing to upgrade as Banks look for a "clean Deed". The Executive has the first call on any loan.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Perhaps the Minister of State will address these issues when concluding.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> The chairperson and I also discussed how Donegal was one of the counties with the largest number of farmers receiving farm assist. They do not receive a credit as others do, for example, those on jobseekers' payments. These credits are important, as they are calculated for contributory pension purposes. The Donegal representative of the IFA acknowledges that there is the option to pay €500 annually, but many cannot afford to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> The fair deal scheme is to be amended in terms of how farm and business assets are treated in the financial means assessment of applicants. The Bill will extend the availability of the three-year cap to family-owned and family-operated farm and-or business assets in cases where, for the first three years of an applicant's time in care, a family successor commits to working the farm or business. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that the intention of the Bill "is to ensure that, in situations where the farm or business' productive income is being relied upon as a principal livelihood, and the farm or business is being handed down to the next generation, the viability and sustainability of such farms or businesses is protected as a result of having a degree of clarity surrounding the total cost of care." If that is the case, then surely the IFA's concerns should have been addressed by now.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> Last October, the review of the fair deal scheme had to be "paused" because of data protection concerns. The review ran into problems in accessing important information that was found to be "sensitive" under data protection laws. Three years ago, the Committee of Public Accounts requested a value for money review to examine the cost differences between public and private nursing care homes. The review was delayed due to legal issues. The National Treatment Purchase Fund sets the maximum prices for private care. It had been hoped to access the data from the NTPF, but this had to be abandoned and accessed instead through Nursing Homes Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> The Comptroller and Auditor General's report into nursing home care found that, in 2018, the average maximum price for private homes was €968 per week compared to an average of €1,564 per week for public nursing homes, a difference of 62%. As usual with many data sets in the Irish economic arena, however, it is difficult to create a meaningful comparison because of the differing methods used to determine weekly rates. The CEO of the HSE stated that the difference in price was due to a number of factors, including pay-related issues, with generally higher staff pay rates and conditions in public nursing homes as well as higher staffing ratios.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">In my experience in Donegal, the reason for these cost differences is that public homes tend to have the patients with higher dependency and higher care needs. This is taken into account. Private homes tend to have fewer nursing staff on each shift. According to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, there are around 10,000 applications for the scheme each year. Something that has not been addressed by the Government is a statutory right to home care and this is the next thing that needs to be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> The Bill before us is lengthy and technical. I note the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has said a number of Government amendments will be brought forward on Committee Stage. Will she reconsider the issues that I have raised? I will submit amendments to support them. We need to make sure this is done properly. Often, when people are at the point where they are looking into this, they are also dealing with the stress and upset of a loved one needing full-time care.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> There are 27 sections in the Bill, which consist of amendments and insertions to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. Section 3 provides for the application for appointment of a family successor for the farm or business. Section 4 deals with the charge against interest in chargeable assets. Sections 5 and 6 look at the duties of the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> On Tuesday in her opening speech, regarding section 5, the Minister of State said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_790">Persons wishing to avail of the three-year cap must have been in care for three years and have appointed a family successor in respect of relevant assets. The charge on the asset must also be in place. The executive will determine whether the applicant will qualify for the relief, with all the conditions for qualification being outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Will the Minister of State clarify that this means what I think it does? My reading of this, and of the ten detailed subsections in section 5 of the Bill, is that if a successor is not appointed until two years after the person goes into care then that is when the timer starts. This would mean that it would be two years plus the three years, so five years in total would be counted. Equally, if someone did not appoint a successor until two years and 11 months after being in care, then the three years would start after that date. Is this the case? If so, I do not believe this is fair. In the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 19 May, the Minister of State is reported as having said this legislative amendment to the scheme will now extend the principle to cap contributions based on family-owned and operated farm and business assets at three years. This makes it sound like the cap timer starts from when the person enters care. We need clarity on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> Section 7 requires the HSE to conduct at least one review regarding compliance with the conditions set out. Will additional resources be provided for the HSE to carry out this review? Will there be an appeals process for this provision also? The explanatory memorandum on this section states that where more than one family successor has been appointed in respect of a relevant person the executive will carry out a review in respect of each family successor, even though only one successor is used to assess for payment of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> Sections 8 and 9 make provisions for the death of the person receiving care or the family successor, or a change in circumstances of the family successor also. Section 10 deals with a change of family successor following the transfer of a particular family asset. Section 23 provides for the Health Service Executive to keep records and prepare an annual report for the Minister. Section 25 amends Schedule 1 to the 2009 Act by repealing some existing provisions on farm and business assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> As I said, the Bill is lengthy and technical. It is an important Bill and I will support it. I will also try to amend it on Committee Stage. This whole area can be confusing and distressing for people and I am sure many other Deputies regularly assist people and make representations for constituents who are trying to navigate their entitlements. I hope clear and accessible information will be provided in a timely manner to those who have been awaiting changes for many years, particularly where no change will be applied retrospectively. It will also be vital that people are aware this is happening. As the transfer of land is taking place, provision should be made for this. Solicitors as well as the families should also be aware of it so they can work on the basis it will be a planned action. I would appreciate the Minister of State addressing the issue of the timing as to when people enter the scheme when she is summing up.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_797">In page 10, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_798">
            <b>"Amendment of section 102 of Principal Act</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_799"><b>14. </b>Section 102 of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (6)(f) by the insertion of "without the agreement of the secured creditor" after "security".".</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The Personal Insolvency Act was introduced to address deficiencies in the law and provide for fair and reasonable settlement of debt without having to resort to bankruptcy, which was then the only solution available in Ireland. In most cases, bankruptcy required the sale of the family home. One of the main objectives of the legislation was to try to create a solution to protect citizens from losing their family homes given the exceptional situations that emerged following the collapse of the banks and the property market, which saw the value of homes fall by more than 50% and the inability of thousands of people to repay huge mortgages taken out during the Celtic tiger years.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> As we are very much aware, this process saw the bailout of the banks by Irish taxpayers and the assumption was generally held that the restructuring of mortgaged homes would follow. From very early on, it was clear the banks were resistant to complying with these clearly stated aspects of the Personal Insolvency Act, to such an extent the Government was forced to introduce the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015, which provided for an appeals process when banks refused to agree to arrangements constructed by personal insolvency practitioners drawn up within the parameters of the Act. However, the banks continued to challenge these appeals process solutions at great cost to the State. It took several High Court rulings to deem most of these solutions legal and enforceable.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> Unfortunately, the High Court stated debt for equity swaps could not be enforced by the courts as the legislation did not allow the courts to do so. As the law stands, the agreement of the banks is required to allow these cases to proceed. The solution in this proposed amendment to section 102(6)(f) is the only realistic one available to older mortgage holders aged over 50 because they do not have the time to avail of other solutions. Our laws should be for the benefit of all citizens irrespective of their age. The main objection of the banks to equity swaps is that they are too complicated to draw up. This is not a valid argument. Swaps do not adversely affect the balance sheets of banks and they certainly do not require a further cost burden to be placed on the Irish taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The amendment I propose is very simple and straightforward but, I believe, will allow our courts to force the most needed solution on our banks. I call on the Government to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_804">I rise to support Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment, which is very sensible and, as he said, would not result in an impediment or a cost on the taxpayer. This legislation is welcome. The people of Ireland are paying back and their grandchildren will pay back the banks for the savagely expensive bailout they got. The banks are not being fair. There is not a lot of refuge or solace in the courts either, especially for lay litigants forced into a situation in which they have no recourse to finance to pay for lawyers or barristers. I have been there with some lay litigants and they have not got a lot of solace or support. They are up against the might of the bank. I have no truck with people who could pay but do not want to pay. I am talking about people who are trying to keep the roof over their heads, especially if they are getting elderly. Many of them invested in things, maybe foolishly, but that is how it happened. The banks behaved recklessly and they got bailed out. We need supports for the people, including the vulnerable families, to keep the roof over their heads. Many of them are getting sick, both physically and mentally, with the stress and the pressure. It is so daunting to go down to the river and to the Four Courts - when you could go down. Now it is all done on Zoom. As I said, there is no refuge and not much solace in the courts for these people. We have very little robust legislation at all to put manners on the banks, and they need manners put on them because they are not dealing with any sense of respect or fairness with people. They are arrogant. You are trying to deal with things and trying to help and then when you think you have it over the line, the next thing is that the staff change and the case is handed to somebody else. They are playing on the merry-go-round. I do not know what kind of game they are playing, but it is mind games. It is very stressful and is terrorising some people. I support the amendment. I hope the Minister of State will be able to accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_805">I support the intention of the amendment. The idea that secure creditors can block a deal from proceeding is an issue that needs to be dealt with, and I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about it. If there is an alternative way of dealing with it, that is absolutely fine. I appreciate that what Deputy Fitzpatrick has tabled tries to ensure the best interests of people who are in serious trouble, who have major levels of stress in their lives and who have to go through the indignity of getting through this process. The amendment ensures they can do so without being held to ransom by some lending institution that can just block them and stop them from moving forward. There is a validity to the amendment and I hope that it or some version of it can be accommodated by the Minister of State, if not now then at a later date.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">The Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced key protections for insolvent homeowners struggling to pay off their arrears. It has allowed them the right to seek a court review if their mortgage lenders or creditors refuse reasonable proposals for personal insolvency arrangements. The success of this Act has gone beyond insolvent individuals struggling to repay the mortgages on their homes to include in some cases farming families who are in financial difficulty with their land. I very much welcome the adaptation of this key legislation by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> A number of months ago I attended a webinar organised by the ICMSA at which a personal insolvency practitioner spoke of how this legislation is being successfully used to protect the farm family from repossession and for appropriate debt settlements to be reached. However, this very useful legislation, which can protect the family home, family farm, farm business and livelihood of a farm family, is only accessible when both the principal primary residence and the family home is included in the debt with the land. We must act to amend this legislation to allow the family farm to be included in the personal insolvency process, regardless of whether the principal primary residence is affected by the debt. If the land alone is used for security for a loan or mortgage, there is a strong case to be made for the personal insolvency process to be extended to include this instance. I ask the Minister of State to take this on board and amend the Personal Insolvency Act to allow access to the personal insolvency process for insolvent individuals who are farm land-indebted and not only in instances in which the family home is also included in the security for the loan. This would open up the protections of the Personal Insolvency Act to even more worthy individuals and families. It would ensure that the family farm is not repossessed and sold off by the banks. It would allow for a debt resolution process that does not mean farmers have to lose their entire livelihoods to settle their debts, which results only in further financial hardships.</p>

          <p eId="para_808">Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment refers to section 102 of the principal Act. Currently, this provision would allow a personal insolvency practitioner to propose that the principal amount outstanding on a mortgage should be reduced by a certain sum if the borrower grants a share of his or her equity in the secure property to the secure creditor. The effect of the Deputy's amendment is to specify that the proposal would be made without the agreement of the secure creditor concerned. I appreciate the Deputy's intentions in making this proposal. I recognise that the potential scope of a debt-for-equity proposal under this section, with or without agreement of the secure creditor concerned, has been the subject of several High Court judgments, including most recently in the Fennell and Kirwan cases. I am not, however, in a position to agree to this amendment and I will explain why.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> The proposal to impose a debt-for-equity solution on a secure creditor without its consent raises potential legal issues and potentially constitutional issues and would require careful consideration and detailed legal advice. Imposing debt solutions on secure creditors enters into a very difficult legal territory as there is a risk of impinging on the constitutional rights of those creditors. The personal insolvency legislation and previous amending Bills have been very carefully designed and balanced to take full account of these concerns. To make the change the Deputy proposes could disturb this careful balance and risk opening up the Bill to legal challenges. Above all, the legal uncertainty likely to result from such challenges would be extremely damaging to the situation of homeowners in serious mortgage arrears who are in urgent need of solutions. I know the nature and scope of potential debt-for-equity solutions was raised in stakeholder submissions due to the statutory review of the Personal Insolvency Acts. This issue is receiving detailed consideration in that context. The review, as I mentioned in my introduction, is due to report this summer and the Government legislative programme already includes a further amending Bill consequent on its findings. The general scheme of that Bill will be prepared later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for tabling the amendment. It is a very important amendment and speaks to a very important issue that needs detailed consideration. It will be given detailed consideration under the review, and we have a broader and larger insolvency scheme coming later in the year. I have asked the Department to engage with Deputy Fitzpatrick on his very important proposals and to see if they can be accommodated. When this original legislation was brought forward, it was very radical and very badly needed. Willie Penrose was instrumental and critical in that respect. Some limitations may have been put on it, in that the Government at the time would perhaps have preferred it to have gone a little further, but there were fears about the constitutional rights to property. It has proven to be very robust legislation. We are now probably somewhat more confident about that legislation. Where amendments can be made and the protections expanded, that should be done but, as I said, within the context of the review and a broader discussion and assessment. Those are my comments for Deputy Fitzpatrick. I ask him not to push the amendment at this stage, but the Department will certainly engage with him further.</p>

          <p eId="para_812">As the Minister of State said, the solution I am looking for is for people who are 50 and over because everything else in insolvency law helps younger people. I know many people in my area and other areas in the country who are in their 50s and the last thing they want is to lose their homes. It is very important that legislation looks after all citizens, no matter their age. The thing that really annoys me is that the bank says the solution I am looking for is complicated. How do you tell a family who is losing their home that it is complicated? How do you tell the homeless in the streets it is complicated? I feel that my solution is a very simple one. It gives the courts the authority to go ahead and do what they think is best.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> I will be honest with the Minister of State. I am delighted he said the Department will engage with me. I am overwhelmed by the support I am getting from the Opposition. I was not going to press the amendment but I think I would be doing an injustice to the people I represent in my constituency, the people who work very hard during these crises, were I not to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">I know those people should not have gone to the bank and got so much money. However, these banks lend these people substantial amounts of money and I do not know how they ever thought people were going to pay it back.</p>

          <p eId="para_816">I commend Deputy Fitzpatrick on tabling the amendment. I awaited with interest the response from the Minister of State. Having worked in government in recent times, I was not a bit surprised. There is an extraordinary caution - I use that word advisedly - regarding anything that tramples on so-called property rights. The Constitution is a permanent shield often against the public good.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> The Minister of State made comment, as I did in my Second Stage speech on the Bill, of the work of the former Deputy, Willie Penrose, who championed this legislation. It was ridiculous that people, including some well-known people, were leaving this jurisdiction to live abroad for a year to get bankruptcy abroad because our insolvency law was so difficult. We made very significant progress. The Personal Insolvency Act, which was amended in 2015, has proven to be an extraordinarily valuable tool. All of us have dealt with personal insolvency practitioners, and dealt with people in very difficult situations where their homes were under threat. This legislation has been a shield for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> It is important that we are not always dependent on the acquiescence of the creditor. I ask the Minister of State to indicate when we will see the more substantial insolvency legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> It would do no harm to accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment right now. I know legal advices are always ultra-cautious on these matters. We do not want to dislodge that in any way, particularly when we have a framework that has already been tested in the courts. However, in legislating for the public good I believe we need to push harder against this perceived constitutional difficulty because the property rights are seemingly so defended in our Constitution against the will of the vast majority of our people.</p>

The amended numbering is required because the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act 2021 was recently enacted and commenced and section 9 of the Act also amends the relevant provisions. The amendment is necessary in the context of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.</p>

          <p eId="para_999">This is an amendment to the Economic and Monetary Union Act 1998 to provide for the recovery of costs by the Central Bank of Ireland for the functions carried out relating to euro coins and, in particular, relating to the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. As he was required to do under Council decision 98/415/EC, the Minister for Finance requested an opinion from the European Central Bank, ECB, on the Counterfeiting Bill. This opinion was supportive of the Bill in general, stating that the ECB welcomed the draft law which will ensure the preservation of euro banknotes and coins in circulation, resulting in continued public confidence in euro banknotes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">The opinion, however, noted that the Central Bank of Ireland should be remunerated for its tasks in respect of euro coins, in particular in the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, and noted a concern that this was only partially done currently. </p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> The issue of notes and coins is treated differently under European law. The governing council of the ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of euro banknotes within the EU. Such notes may be issued by the ECB and by national central banks. In formal terms, it is the task of the European System of Central Banks, ESCB, and, therefore, may be funded from the Central Bank of Ireland's own resources without giving rise to monetary financing concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> Member states, on the other hand, may issue euro coins subject to approval by the ECB of the volume of such issue. This task is done by the Central Bank of Ireland as an agent for the Minister for Finance. The monetary financing prohibition requires that such tasks be fully and adequately remunerated. Sections 13 and 14 of the EMU Act provide for the funding of the Central Bank's role in the issue of euro coins to ensure compliance with the monetary financing prohibition. In accordance with these provisions, the bank may offset its expenses associated with the issue of euro coins against the income that is thereby generated with any shortfall being met from funds to be advanced by the Minister for Finance from the Central Fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> While the ECB opinion acknowledges that sections 13, 14 and 14(<i>a</i>) of the EMU Act provide for reimbursement and remuneration in the provision of euro coins, it notes that this reimbursement does not cover certain relevant costs that arise from the performance by the Central Bank of Ireland of its functions in respect of counterfeiting, and in particular the operation of the coin national analysis centre. The amendment will address this issue by extending the relevant provisions of the EMU Act to cover these functions. The net effect is that the amount that is returned by the Central Bank to the Central Fund will be reduced by the cost of the operation of the functions in respect of counterfeiting. We anticipate this will be in the order of about-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1004">The moneys involved are very small but, and I asked this in my contribution on Second Stage, where does that money comes from now? This is to bring the money from the Central Fund to cover the cost of counterfeiting. I assumed it was always from the Central Fund, or was it defrayed by the Central Bank? If the Minister of State does not have the answer, it is only a technical point.</p>

          <p eId="para_1093">I present this evening a financial resolution on stamp duties. Its purpose is to amend the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 through the insertion of a new section, 31E, titled "Stamp duty and certain acquisitions of residential property". It does this by imposing higher stamp duty charges on multiple purchases of residential units to take effect from midnight tonight. It is one part of the Government's response to the recent development of commercial institutional investors bulk-purchasing homes at or near completion in competition with the owner-occupier market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> The other significant element is the decision of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to issue new planning guidelines requiring that all houses other than those already ring-fenced for social and affordable housing will have to be made available for sale and first occupation by separate individual households for a period of a year after completion. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is dealing with this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> These measures are part of the Government's broader commitment to improving the supply of housing and affordability for first-time buyers, which has included to date bringing forward significant measures such as the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 and the Land Development Agency Bill 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">These measures stand as part of an overall housing strategy which provides the highest ever budget for housing in the history of the State of €3.3 billion to support the social housing needs of 28,500 additional households.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> The background to this resolution is the purchase by institutional investors of all or a significant proportion of residential housing estates, in particular, close to the time of completion. The new higher rate of stamp duty proposed in this resolution is intended to provide a significant disincentive to this practice of multiple purchase by investors of large parts of housing estates or whole housing estates before they reach the market, thus denying first-time buyers an opportunity to purchase a home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098"> In summary, the legislation will introduce a new 10% rate of stamp duty to apply where a person purchases ten or more houses within a 12-month period. It may apply to a single book purchase but may also apply in cases in which ten or more houses are purchased across a number of different transactions in a 12-month period. Once the threshold of the tenth house is passed, the higher 10% rate will apply on all houses purchased in the period, including the first nine.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> A key objective of this proposal is to achieve a balance between addressing the issue of multiple purchases by institutional investors while, at the same time, ensuring the supply of financing is not undermined, especially for the construction of new apartment developments. It provides a specific exemption from this higher stamp duty rate for the multiple purchase of apartments at any time whether, for example, the apartments are being bought at planning permission stage or at another stage in the future. The rationale for this is twofold. In order for apartment complexes to be built, it is necessary in virtually all cases for an institutional investor to commit through a binding contract to purchase all or some of a complex on completion. This is known as the forward-purchase model and it is usually entered into once planning permission has been obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> The benefit of this approach is that it allows a developer to obtain the necessary funds through bank lending to finance the project. The financing would be unobtainable in the absence of this forward-purchase contract and therefore these apartments would not be built. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has indicated that institutional investors are likely to commit to a forward-purchase agreement only if they can be certain that at a later stage they will be able to sell the same apartments. A key concern raised, which I share, is that a 10% stamp duty levy would inhibit such a sale and, again, thus discourage such investors from participating in the financing of apartment complexes. This is an important exemption, as in its absence there is a significant risk that developers would exit from the apartment building market, that projects would no longer be viable and that an important element of our future housing strategy would be lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101"> Research carried out by my Department indicates that the financing problem for own-door housing in traditional housing estates is much less significant. The household buyer market for houses is sufficiently deep and this, combined with the flexibility to develop and sell in phases, reduces the risk premium on funding from traditional sources such as the pillar banks. Moreover, as this measure is specifically targeted to ensure a greater supply of houses is available for families and for individuals to live in, the application of the stamp duty charge to all large purchases of houses, including forward-purchase agreements, is essential in delivering on its purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> It is also important to recognise that some multiple purchases of property are undertaken by bodies specifically for the purpose of providing social and affordable housing. It is not intended to apply the higher stamp duty rate in these instances. Therefore, the higher rate will not apply to local authorities, affordable housing bodies or the Housing Agency when they engage in multiple-purchase transactions. Other social or affordable housing arrangements will be considered as part of the legislation which will be brought before the Houses in the next few months to underpin permanently this resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103"> I will now outline the key elements of this measure. The higher stamp duty rate will be 10%. It will apply to multiple purchases of ten or more houses in a 12-month period. As mentioned already, apartments in apartment buildings are fully exempt from this higher stamp duty rate, as are multiple purchases by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Housing Agency. While the higher rate of stamp duty will apply automatically to all bulk purchases of ten units or more, it will also apply on a cumulative basis where, for instance, a person is purchasing regularly on a unit-by-unit basis. This is an important safeguard, as otherwise the policy intent of disincentivising multiple purchases could be circumvented through a series of smaller purchases. The higher stamp duty charge would therefore take effect once the tenth property is purchased in a 12-month period. This means that where a person or institution has purchased incrementally and reaches the threshold of ten, the higher stamp duty will apply to the other previous nine purchases also. In such a situation, where the standard stamp duty rate has already been paid, this payment will be offset against the amount due under this new charge. It will apply to all Irish dwellings that are acquired, other than apartments, regardless of location. That is, it will apply where there are multiple dwellings in one estate or single dwellings in different locations across the country. It will also apply in circumstances in which multiple purchases of residential units are made indirectly through shares or units of companies, investment funds and other entities that hold residential property.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104"> There will be a three-month transition period for execution of binding contracts that have been entered into but not completed prior to the commencement of the resolution. This is provided for normally on the introduction of new taxes or increases of rates on transfer of land and this has been included in this measure on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General. Similarly, units purchased before the resolution comes into effect have been counted towards triggering the threshold of ten, but higher stamp duty rates can only apply to units bought after the introduction of the financial resolution. For example, if six units were bought in April and five units are bought in June, the April purchases would enable the higher stamp duty rate to be applied to the June purchases but not to reassess the stamp duty chargeable on the April purchase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105"> As indicated earlier, the new stamp duty rate of 10% is designed to disincentivise the multiple purchase of houses by large investors and purchasers. When combined with the complementary measures introduced by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on planning, this should ensure greater availability of houses for purchase by individuals and families. I believe the 10% rate is at a sufficient level to discourage institutional investors from participating in the market for houses and to direct available capital to apartment developments where viability challenges are more significant and this capital is critical in increasing the supply of homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106"> The Government is well aware of the complexity of the property market, as housing policy must balance the needs of all tenures – private rental, private ownership, affordable or cost rental and social housing. As part of this balance I believe investors have a particular role to play, as they bring an added source of finance to the market. The bottom line, unfortunately, is that there are now two remaining Irish pillar banks and one other bank and these are limited in their ability to finance large property developments without either co-financing from investment funds or the de-risking of the project through a binding contract for the forward purchase of a development in its entirety or a large section of it. In their absence, activity in the housing market would be much reduced and this would increase the already significant pressure facing both renters and prospective homeowners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> Institutional investors are a long-term presence in the Irish market, as in all other property markets, but I have clearly stated on many occasions that where such investments bring a profit, a fair share of tax must be paid. In recent Finance Acts I have made significant changes to the taxation of institutional investors in Irish property to ensure that appropriate tax is collected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">As with investment funds generally, tax for these investment entities occurs primarily at the level of the investor rather than within the fund. In the case of both Irish real estate funds and real estate investment trusts, withholding taxes apply on distributions to investors to ensure collection of tax revenues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109"> The tax treatment of these investment vehicles is kept under review, most recently in a 2019 analysis produced for the tax strategy group. This led to the introduction of additional anti-avoidance measures in the Finance Act 2019, aimed at ensuring the regimes operate as intended and at preventing the avoidance of tax on property profits. This has resulted in a significant increase in the tax take from investment funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110"> In conclusion, I reiterate the importance of the passage of this resolution. Its purpose is very simple, namely, to disincentivise the multiple purchases of houses through the imposition of a higher stamp duty rate, in order to increase opportunity and availability for individuals and families. As Members are aware, a financial resolution is required whenever a charge is imposed upon the people which will impact at any time before the planned legislation that will provide for it becomes law, thus explaining why it has been put forward this evening. I inform the House that I propose, through legislation, to place this resolution on a permanent statutory footing in the coming weeks. I hope the House will support the resolution this evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_1116">I move amendment No. 12:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1117">After section 31E, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1118">"<b>Report on Application of a Stamp Duty Charge on the Purchase of Apartments by Investment Funds</b></p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1119"><b>31F</b>. The Minister shall within 14 days from the passing of this Resolution prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the impact of deleting subsection (6)(a) of Section 31E and including residential units in an apartment block as a relevant residential unit to which the higher rate of stamp duty will apply as a consequence of this Resolution."</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">Amendments Nos. 12 to 14, inclusive, are in my name and that of Deputy Eoin Ó Broin and the Sinn Féin Party. The first two deal with an appropriate level of stamp duty on these funds and ensure it will apply to apartments, along with other residential developments. The third amendment is to ensure that the profits of these funds are also taxed and that the sweetheart deals, which the Minister intends to leave in place for these funds, come to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121"> The Minister comes before the House today with a financial resolution to place a restriction on investment funds, and what happens? The share price of the funds goes up. That is some trick, even for the Minister. The reality is that this has basically exposed what is going on here. This is a Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government that has been desperate to try to find some answer to the public anger and outrage at what has been happening for many years in terms of deliberate policy by this Government, which has locked generations out of the housing market and left other generations of renters paying extortionate rents and young people's dreams shattered in regard to being able to own a home, particularly in this city and other cities and in the commuter belt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122"> What it has come up with here is the bare minimum to try to suggest it is now clamping down on the funds, but not really, to try to take this House and the members of the Opposition for fools. We are not falling for it and I do not think the public will fall for it either. The share price rise says exactly what we all know, namely, that this is not real and it will not deter investment. Indeed, these investors now believe they will be more profitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123"> The Minister has set a rate of 10% and he has suggested he wants to stop these funds buying up houses in the market. If he genuinely wanted that to happen, then he would set the rate a lot higher. When this House on previous occasions decided we wanted to stamp out a type of activity, we set punitive rates, an example being that when bankers were paying out bonuses to chief executives after the crash, the public outrage forced the Government at that time to bring in a surcharge on bankers' bonuses. The effect was that the tax on those bonuses was 89%. It was about stopping it; it was about deterring it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124"> The Minister has brought forward a 10% stamp duty with so many loopholes that anyone could drive a horse and cart through it. Even for those it may apply to, 10% simply will not wash. I ask the Minister to explain to the House how this rate will impact residential property being bought up by these funds. Let us take the example of Maynooth, where property was purchased at an average of €400,000. This fund, which snapped up the 135 houses from under the noses of people who were saving for years for their deposits, would make a 5% yield if it charged the average rental charge in the State of €1,667. If it has to pay this 10% stamp duty, which is 8% more, its yield would drop from 5% to 4.5%, a drop in the ocean. At a time when international money cannot find yields like that, when Government bonds are being sold at negative interest rates, the impact of the Minister's measure, if the fund was just to accept a drop in yield, would be half a percentage point. Otherwise, what it could do is raise rents by 10%, or it could split the difference. The reality is this 10% charge is not going to make the difference, and the Minister damn well knows it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> That is what it is designed to do. It is designed not to make the difference but to give a semblance of that, in that the Minister is suggesting he is doing something about it. How do I know with conviction that that is the case? Because, six months ago, I put forward a proposal that we look at the area of a stamp duty surcharge on these funds. I have been telling the Minister for years that these funds are squeezing out people who want to own their own home, whether they be first-time buyers or other property owners. The Minister railed against it. He marched his troops into the committee and he voted against even looking at the issue. He did not want to go here, he does not want to be here and he is only reacting to the public anger which is evident over recent weeks. Therefore, he has designed something that is designed to fail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126"> He has also made so many exemptions that it is unbelievable. Forward purchases are not to be included and they all get the sweetheart deal in terms of the stamp duty that is in place. The Minister knows damn well that forward purchases amount to thousands upon thousands of homes. In the last quarter of 2020, forward purchases for private rental sales equated to €600 million. In the first quarter of 2021, the largest forward purchase was for homes in a private rental sale in excess of €500 million. They are all exempt from this stamp duty increase, as little as it is. Not only is the Minister exempting all of those forward purchases that have already been included and agreed upon, but he is giving them three months to conclude arrangements, or handshakes, or words that have been exchanged to make sure they are excluded also, not from buying apartments, but from buying homes and duplexes across this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127"> The Minister made the bogus claim - let me just nail it - that apartments would not be built if it were not for forward purchase agreements. Riddle me this. How is the Marlet Property Group, one of the biggest developers, funding the development in Grand Canal Harbour? The Minister knows; he damn well knows. It is through AIG. They have no forward purchase agreement for the 596 apartments they are building in Grand Canal Harbour. It is being funded by AIG to the tune of €147 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">How is the Marlet Property Group funding St. Clare's in Harold's Cross? A total of 220 apartments will be completed in July. There is no forward purchase agreement there. How do I know? Because it is part of something that only went on the market in March this year. Investors are now interested, after the funding has been secured. Some of these apartments will be completed in the coming months and investors are now just starting to bid on forward purchasing, offering in excess of €1 billion for the entire portfolio of 2,000 apartments, which means an average cost in excess of €500,000 per apartment. Not one of them is going on the market for anyone to buy in this city across the six regions. Not one of those units will be charged an additional cent of stamp duty as a result of the Minister's policy here tonight, and not one apartment will see its tenants have a reduced rent. What the Government is doing as a result of this is pushing up apartment prices right across the city and beyond. The Minister should not take my word for it. He should read Savills's report for investors in Dublin for 2020. It makes it very clear that private rental sales for apartments in Dublin are 23% above the market average for non-private rental sales. A premium price is being paid by these funds, and why would they not? The Minister has created this structure so that they can pay this amount and, as we saw last week in the <i>Business Post, </i>it is not just apartments. These funds are also outbidding approved housing bodies up to the tune of €80,000 per unit, pushing up house prices for everybody. How did they do it? Because the Minister has let them go tax-free. They will easily absorb a 10% increase, if it even applies to them, because they will look at the lifetime of their investment. What the Minister is saying to them very clearly today is that they will still have no tax to pay on their rental income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129"> Let us look at two of these funds, the first of which is IPUT's consolidated accounts. Were it not so serious, the Minister would have a good giggle. The fund states that its profits before tax are €101 million from rent and its profits after tax are €101 million. There is no tax. Shame on the Minister. That is a commercial entity but let us look at a residential entity, I-RES, one of the biggest landlords in the State, in some cases charging rents of more than €2,000 a month in this city. It made €75 million in profit last year on its rental income and it has not paid a cent in corporation tax on that. Any other structure or company that might have bought that property and had that rental income would pay 25% corporation tax on rental income, but the Minister for Finance, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil want these funds to go tax-free and that is why they are pushing up prices on individuals. Today is the day, 19 May 2021, and this is the hour, when the Minister has surrendered this city to the vulture funds and the investment funds. This is the moment when he hoisted the white flag over this city and said that it is a free-for-all for these funds. Instead of the Government coming in here and giving the red card to these funds, he has given the green light, and shame on him. And shame on the Green Party, which champions a type of urban living, to actually back this because the consequence of this is not just about tax or revenue or house prices but what this city, the commuter belt and the outer regions and, indeed, other cities, will look like in the future. There can be no hiding of the consequences of the Minister's decision. Six out of seven homes that were completed in Dublin last year were apartments in Dublin city. Half of all homes completed last year in Dublin were apartments. The Minister is saying that it is a free-for-all for apartments, with no tax increase, no capital gains tax and rent-free and "Let us go on the way you are, boys, keep it going". By excluding apartments from this measure, he is effectively saying that this city is not a place where workers and families can ever aspire to own their own home, with rents set at rates the majority of earners will never be able to afford. </p>
          <p eId="para_1130"> I will leave it at that. We have tabled amendments, which I hope this House will accept. I hope the Minister does not do what he did six months ago, when he turned his back on even looking at stamp duty, and then having to come in here and do a U-turn but one he knows will not have any effect on deterring these funds from gobbling up houses from under the noses of first-time buyers and others who aspire to own their own home, whether that be a house, a duplex or an apartment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1131">Cuckoo funds have mutated and the shot that the Minister has administered will not succeed in stopping them in their tracks. The evidence so far suggests that they will be resistant to the new measures he announced last night. I called in recent times for a meaningful hike in stamp duty as one of a series of targeted measures to do what the entire House seems to say it wants to do, which is to clip the wings of investment funds to ensure a level playing pitch for those who want a shot of owning their own homes. The evidence from the markets over the past 24 hours is telling. If investors feared a 10% hike in stamp duty, they would take their money elsewhere. Instead, the valuation of I-RES REIT, for example, has gone up by in excess of 2% since last night. A rate of 10% is not punitive; it is a puny rate. It says to me that they are not deterred. They will take the move on the chin and absorb the cost and-or pass it on to already hard-pressed renters who have little security in a legislative context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132"> I have heard the Minister's defence of the 10% rate at his press conference last night and in his remarks this evening and I am still not persuaded that it ought not to have been set at a higher rate of 15% or 17%. I believe, in the interest of transparency, that he should publish the rationale for arriving at the 10% rate, the rationale from his Department and the advice in forming his decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133"> I tabled two amendments that were ruled out of order. The first called for the House to oppose the exemption applied to the bulk purchase of apartments and apartment schemes. The Labour Party does not support this exemption. An apartment is a home when one applies for a mortgage or when one might apply for housing assistance payment, HAP, but it is not a home to be owned and enjoyed by owner-occupiers when it comes to tax advantages enjoyed by investment funds and that have the effect of distorting the market. This takes some explaining for those of us like myself and my colleague, Labour Party housing spokesperson, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, who want to see sustainable, balanced communities encouraged in our cities and major town centres. It really is sad that a home is a home but only until it comes within the grasp of a REIT. Our fear is that what we will see now is a move by investment funds to get a bigger bang for their buck and move en masse to build-to-rent and the lower floor space standards the rules allow for them. That will be bad news for renters and bad news for our society. </p>
          <p eId="para_1134"> In addition, the amendment that was ruled out of order proposed that the stamp duty changes ought to have been effective from today, 19 May, not 20 May, as the Minster proposes in the resolution. Normally, as he knows, when changes such as these are announced on budget day, they are legislated for that very night to ensure that advantage is not taken before the new rules kick in, so why did he choose not to bring this resolution to the Dáil last night when we were expecting to see it, following his press conference after the decision was taken by Cabinet? I fear the midnight oil was burning through the night in lawyers' offices in the docklands with date stamps at the ready to make sure that big sales of tranches of homes kicked off in time to avoid bigger stamp duty bills. I also note there is a three-month window or transition period to allow things to be tied up. Given the seriousness of the situation we are now in, I am not in favour of that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">It will come as a surprise to first-time buyers who might have been beaten to the punch by an investment fund to learn that in the past two to three years, four REIT shareholders under the immigrant investor programme have, by virtue of their investment in funds operating in Ireland, qualified for Irish residency. This is confirmed to us in a reply to a parliamentary question from the Minister for Justice. I do not believe this will sit well with most citizens in light of what we know about the activities of some REITs and their impact on the housing market, particularly on first-time buyers. </p>
          <p eId="para_1136"> We need a full review of the tax treatment of these funds. We know they are not, as commercial entities, captured for corporation tax and capital gains tax purposes. We are also aware that they do not pay the universal social charge and PRSI on rental income like the common or garden landlord. How would they? Are the advantages they enjoy a form of unfair State aid? If so, is that anti-competitive? It is a question that ought to be explored further by this House in the coming weeks and in advance of the legislation the Government is committed to introducing shortly to give ultimate effect and bring legal certainty to the measure the Minister is introducing this evening. These measures ought to be explored in much more detail because I cannot find a persuasive argument as to why corporation tax and capital gains tax are not charged on the commercial activities of these organisations. Although they may not accept them, everybody fully understands and can compute the reasons the structures were introduced several years ago but the fact is that, over the past ten years, with one or two minor exceptions, the tax treatment of the funds has gone largely unamended. It is time to radically change the Government’s approach to REITs, IREFs and other institutional investors in Irish property. The time to do it is now. Unfortunately, we cannot support this financial resolution because we do not believe it goes far enough. We cannot support a position whereby apartment complexes and schemes are exempted.</p>

          <p eId="para_1137">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this draft financial resolution. Like many, I watched the "Prime Time" special a fortnight ago in which we saw Peter Melrose and his fiancée, who are of a similar age to me, standing outside Mullen Park, literally and metaphorically locked out from the houses there. They had no opportunity to buy them. It is what they had aspired to do. They aspired, after marriage, to have a family and settle down there. Is it not what every young couple dreams of? The couple was fully denied this because in came a cuckoo fund and bought up all the properties. It was appalling. It made for shocking viewing. In the following days, it became public knowledge that this practice was far more widespread. It has not happened thus far in my county, Clare, but it has caused major concern among constituents, particularly the young.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138"> The resolution before us is positive. It seeks to impose a stamp duty charge of 10% on the multiple purchase of ten or more houses. Today is 19 May. As we transition from May into June, we will need to have flexibility. If this deterrent is not seen to be sufficient, we should consider an even higher rate of stamp duty and perhaps lower the threshold of ten properties to four or five. There was space for investment funds in the property market at one point in that they brought a surge of capital when there was very little. However, seeing them buying up properties in one fell swoop, denying young first-time buyers the opportunity to own a home, is definitely what we want to discourage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139"> The introduction of a higher stamp duty rate for the bulk purchase of houses is aimed at discouraging the practice whereby institutional investors buy up all the homes close to completion or fully completed, thereby depriving first-time buyers of their chance to own a home. The stamp duty proposed is ten times the normal rate of stamp duty applicable to residential properties and 30% higher than the rate that currently applies to commercial properties. It will add significantly to the purchasing cost, which it is hoped will be a deterrent. If it is not sufficient, we will need to increase the rate and lower the threshold for the number of houses. It is important that we ensure that owning a home, to which every young couple strives, is possible and remains a priority for the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140"> There was an exposé on properties this week by Clare FM in my county. The station examined rent pressure zones and the disparity in what people are paying in rent in different parts of the county and in the thresholds for rent pressure zones set by the Department. There are major anomalies. The current criterion is based on electoral divisions. As the Minister probably knows well from his constituency, these do not fully reflect the make-up of the locality. Some properties in my electoral area, Shannon, where I served up until 14 months ago, are being rented out for €1,500 per month while others are being rented for €700 or €800. The Kilrush electoral area encompasses the small village of Lissycasey, which is quite close to Ennis. The rents there are quite high but further out the Loop Head peninsula, in places such as Carrigaholt, the rents are low. Therefore, the metric is a little outdated. The income thresholds for people qualifying for social housing are also very outdated. They were set in 2011 when incomes, rents and property prices were very different. Everything seems to have changed in the interim, including taxation. Pay deals have been struck in the public service, for example. Many things have changed but the thresholds in place for those seeking to avail of social housing supports have not been amended in the same period. This needs to be examined. The measures being introduced tonight offer a safety net under the initiatives the Government announced ten days ago to make housing affordable once again to first-time buyers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1141">Yesterday evening, I received a message from a struggling first-time buyer. She asked me to read her message into the Dáil record today. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1142">Dear TDs, those who have a controlling hand over our future. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1143">I am a 27 year old woman living with my parents. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1144">I am lucky enough to have a high paying job.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1145">However, I am a single woman, with friends who are in relationships and in settled living situations. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1146">[When the Tuesday evening news broke], my first thought was 'Great. I will be living with my parents until I am either not single or else am 35.' </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1147">We should not be forced into relationships to afford to live out of our parents’ houses. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1148">There is going to be a mass exodus from Ireland of those of us in our 20s, simply because we cannot afford to live ... [here]. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1149">When the choices are to live with parents until we can afford a shed in someone's back garden or to rent and starve, there is a serious problem. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1150">I ask for a show of hands in the Dáil of who owns ... [their own home]. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1151">Imagine moving your entire family in with your parents, and not being allowed to move out again.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1152">I promise, you would very quickly understand the extreme decline in people's mental health in the past decade. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1153">[…]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1154">You all have a responsibility to your people. Put caps on house prices. Set a price for a house of a certain size. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1155">A pitiful 10% stamp duty is simply not good enough. Stop the vulture funds. Help your people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">The experience of this young woman, whose anger and frustration can be noted in her words, is the experience of tens of thousands of others, including singles and couples alike, first-time buyers, those who are separated and divorced who are seeking another home, those who lost their homes through no fault of their own owing to mortgage distress after the Celtic tiger, and, indeed, those trapped in negative equity who need to trade up but cannot. Over recent weeks, both the Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, promised that they would help them and stop the bulk buying of family homes, houses, duplexes and apartments that were intended at the outset to be purchased by working people. Instead, both in the financial resolution before us and the proposed planning reforms of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Government has offered them absolutely nothing. The pretence of action will do nothing to solve the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">Funds will continue to bulk-buy family homes. Worse still, the exclusion of apartments means that if one wants to live in a city centre, high-cost rental will be the only option. This decision undermines the national planning framework, the climate action plan and the possibility of ever having a 15-minute city. It will have long-term consequences undermining the sustainable development of our city centres for years to come. In the suburbs, if you are single, a couple without children or a separated or divorced person, your future will also only be high-cost rental. Just as it has been for the past five years, so it will be for the remainder of this Government. There will be minimal investment in genuinely affordable homes for working people to rent or buy and the red carpet for big developers and institutional investors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158"> I wonder if the Minister understands how angry people are at the Government. Is the Government so out of touch with its own voters that it cannot see the damage it is doing to them, to our cities and to our housing system? Ineffective tax changes and ill-conceived knee-jerk changes to our planning system are not the solution. People need affordable homes to rent and to buy, not in their tens or hundreds but in their thousands. Last night, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party made it crystal clear that that will happen only with a change of government to one led by a party that is genuinely committed to delivering the thousands of affordable homes to rent and buy that working people desperately need and rightly deserve.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1159">Earlier today, the Minister said the purpose of these measures was to protect homes for families. That was a telling remark. Clearly this Government does not believe that families live in apartments. It believes that apartments are for students and renters but not for families, it seems, so they are not protected and they are left to the vultures. It may come as news to the Minister that the majority of planning permissions granted last year were for apartments, with 26,000 granted compared with 18,000 granted for houses. Last year was the second year in a row that planning permissions for houses declined. This is a phenomenon that predates Covid. If you strip out one-off housing and social homes from the approximately 44,000 planning permissions granted last year, cuckoo funds will be free to feast on 75% of what remains. Is this what the Minister calls protection? He is slapping on an ineffective 10% stamp duty increase on the bulk purchase of 25% of available units. Is it any wonder the share price of I-RES REIT increased this morning after the Minister's measures were announced?</p>
          <p eId="para_1160"> There is a crisis in housing and this Government just does not seem to get it. It does not want to get it. The Minister has abandoned Dublin, the location of 75% of planning permissions for apartments, and the mid-east, which comprises a further 14%. Fine Gael, in its approach to planning and development, introduced tax breaks for development funds and dismantled building standards to supercharge their profits. That created a monster and the Minister is refusing to cage it. We have build-to-rent monstrosities going up all over Dublin and other urban areas, which will never be available to buy. Nobody would want to live in them long-term anyway because building standards were shredded by the Minister's ex-colleague, Eoghan Murphy, in 2018. Since then, they can be smaller, have much less storage space, have no private outside space, and be devoid of communal amenities. As a result of the Minister's housing policies, these apartments are cheaper to build, more expensive to rent, and impossible to buy. That is a neat summation of this Government's housing policy. One such monstrosity was granted planning permission despite containing single-aspect, north-facing studios the size of car parking spaces. Is that the future the Minister wants for people in urban areas, many of whom are now working from home and living and working in substandard apartments while paying extortionate rent every month for the privilege?</p>
          <p eId="para_1161"> Our housing market is broken. The only people whom it works for are the vultures and the cuckoo funds. Nothing in these measures will change that. We need mixed developments in which people want to live long-term. Apartments that are an appropriate size for modern living and for families are a crucial element of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162"> If the Minister really wanted to tackle this problem, he would do something about rents. High rents and high yields, along with the tax breaks, are why these funds are swarming on Irish property at present. Does the Minister know what the average rent is in Kildare? It is the county that apparently woke him up to the damage being caused by these funds. It is €1,495 per month. Does he know what cuckoo funds are demanding in rent for a two-bed home in a new estate in Maynooth? It is €1,995. They want nearly €2,000 per month in rent despite the fact that the sale price of those homes is cheaper than the average sale price in the county, at €270,000 compared with €292,000. Average homes attracting extraordinary rent is the nub of the problem. There is no cap on rental costs for new builds. Funds can charge what they like and we know that they do. Even if people are unwilling to pay these high rents, investment funds prefer to leave them empty rather than reduce the price. Up to 50% of some high-end developments in Dublin are empty at present. Funds can afford to leave them empty and ensure that rent levels remain artificially high. There is no penalty when they do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163"> In Paris, property tax on vacant homes was tripled to 60% to address the problem of properties being left empty but we do nothing like that here. If rents had increased in line with inflation for the past ten years, they would have gone up by 5.1%. Instead, during that period, they have doubled. An entire generation of people has been betrayed by this Government and previous Fine Gael-led Governments. They have been called "Generation Rent" by some but they are actually "Generation Spent". They have insecure jobs, insecure homes and, as a consequence, insecure lives. The ESRI told us this week that they will be the first generation who will be worse off than their parents. This is the legacy of decades of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments. Their failed policies and mismanagement are situations that they have learned nothing whatsoever from. These proposals tonight, including the proposals about planning, will make no significant difference to that generation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1164">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this issue. It is emotive and needs to be dealt with. I reject in their entirety the continuous allegations against Fine Gael and whoever else to the effect that we are all a bunch of hard right-wing opportunists and that we have no concern for the people. I remind everybody on all sides of the House that in the 1940s, 1950s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Fine Gael itself, or in conjunction with the Labour Party, brought forward some of the most progressive legislation in the history of the State. If anybody does not believe that, let them go back to look at it again, both where it came from and the circumstances that prevailed at the time. Similarly, in respect of the housing situation, we might refer back to the 1980s.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">The late Peter Barry, when Minister, introduced very important legislation six months after coming into office. It established the Housing Finance Agency loan system, which was the means by which many people who could not acquire a house beforehand acquired affordable housing. He was sneered at and regarded as a merchant prince but the legislation he introduced dealt with the housing situation quickly and in a very meaningful and serious way. </p>
          <p eId="para_1166"> The Minister now proposes to introduce regulations to address the issues that have emerged. My only criticism is that we were not alerted to these issues by the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator or others on whom we rely to let us know what is happening in financial environments at an early stage. That did not happen and I have raised that issue separately in the relevant committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167"> The Ceann Comhairle and I dealt with housing issues for many a long year in our constituency in Kildare. We dealt with these matters successfully and, through our own efforts and our example, we ensured that people on the average industrial wage were able to acquire and own their own houses, which they did. Various people tried to dissuade us but we prevailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> The Minister has fired warning shots across the bows of the strategic investors, the vulture funds or whatever we want to call them. Anybody who intervenes in the provision and supply of housing at the present time in a way which will, in any way, increase the price of the product or restricts its availability to the market is not acting in the national interest. Let us remember that affordable housing is part of our taxation system and always has been. It was always necessary to ensure that there was a supply of houses available to people who wish to own their own house.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169"> It should not be forgotten that, for many years, we were criticised by people who said that the real problem in this country is that people wish to own their own houses when they should rent properties. This was all rubbish, as the Ceann Comhairle and I know well. Security is what follows people. It is part of what they think about all the time. When they go to purchase or rent a house, the first thing they look for is security. Why do people want to buy a house? It is for reasons of security. It allows them to not be at any landlord's beck and call. They cannot be kicked out of the house on somebody else's whim. Under our Constitution, they are entitled to that and long may it continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170"> I support the Minister's proposals but I ask that they be monitored very carefully in the very short term to ensure that the provisions now proposed do their job. To those who want to be cynical and say that it will not work, I say that we do not know whether it will. However, I remind everybody that we were all part of an all-party committee set up by the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, to study housing needs and what to do about them back in 2016. I remember well that I made proposals very similar to those now put forward by people in the Opposition in order to deal with the housing situation quickly and effectively. What I effectively said at the time was that the focus should be shifted to direct building for the local authorities. I did not necessarily mean direct building by the local authorities because local authorities do not employ plumbers, bricklayers and others needed to carry out work themselves. That is ineffective. It went out with the ark. The new system involves the contracting of a contractor to design, to build and to look for planning permission, if necessary. Planning permission is given at the behest of the local authority in any event. Building directly would provide houses that were affordable to rent through the local authority system or to purchase. They would all, however, be affordable. Let us not forget that there was always a provision allowing a tenant to buy a property after one year. That was very progressive and helpful and, as a result, an income derived from that property by way of mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171"> Let us go back to what happened. The all-party housing committee made a mistake. It did not determine that there should be a total emphasis on the provision of affordable housing. It came up with a series of proposals because the parties could not agree. That is what the problem was and what it still is, as we can see. A series of measures were proposed and, although not everybody agreed to all of them, all agreed to some. The problem is that we have been pursuing that policy ever since. We are pursuing it to this day and will continue to do so. As long as too many options are available, with each doing a little bit, some will conflict with others, which will cause confusion and create obstacles. We will end up in a situation in which each is succeeding a little bit but in which, in the final analysis, we will not reach our targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172"> I agree with the measures the Minister is proposing. Various people will dispute whether they are severe enough to do the job required. I honestly do not know if they are but we will need to know fairly soon. If these particular measures do not do the job expected of them, we will have to go back again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173"> People have a right to feel we are thinking about their interests at some stage. There is not much sense in thinking about our own interests; we have to think about their interests. We have to be seen to respond to their needs as they arise. Like everybody else, I get emails and from time to time some of them say that I speak strangely for a member of Fine Gael. I do not. I have spoken like this all my life, as the Ceann Comhairle well knows. He spoke the same way. The fact of that matter is that we never spoke in a way that suggested we were adversely disposed to our electorate, by which I mean all of the electorate. They are entitled to live and to benefit from their constitutional rights at all times. This pertains in the provision of homes, jobs and infrastructure. Housing is a vital part of our infrastructure. We need to invest more in it and to deal with these issues now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174"> One of the mistakes the all-party housing committee made was that it did not identify the size of the problem we faced. I am not certain that we have done so yet. We are told that we have to build 35,000 houses a year. I believe we need to build 55,000 houses for each of the next two or three years and maybe longer. If we look at our individual local authorities, we see that the numbers on housing waiting lists are increasing. That should not be. I know that the onset of Covid interrupted matters and that we previously had the financial crash and the housing crash but we have to get out of the situation in which we have found ourselves at some stage. We need to put ourselves on a solid financial footing insofar as the provision of housing for our population is concerned. I refer to all of the population. Nobody should be left out or feel they are likely to be left out. They are all entitled to the best that can be given under our Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175"> As I have said before in the House, I have already tried this. I know that other Members from our county have done the same thing and proved that houses could be produced at a fraction of the cost at which they were placed on the market in the middle of the Celtic tiger. If that could be done then, it can still be done. We have to set about finding the ways and means to do it. As I said at the beginning, I hope that these measures are sufficient. If they are not, we will have to move again. The Minister knows this. We have discussed it many times.

          <p eId="para_1177">Does this motion, which the Minister has speedily introduced, represent progress? Yes, it does. Does it go far enough? No, it does not. Was the Government dragged kicking and screaming by us, other Opposition parties and the public into making these changes? Yes, it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178"> Yet again, large investment funds with the sole interest of making mega profits from the misery of young families desperate to purchase their own homes were allowed into our country at the behest of this and previous Fine Gael Governments to destroy our housing system. After 2008, when the Minister's colleagues in Fianna Fáil last collapsed our economy, the then Government welcomed in the vulture funds to pick at the carcasses of housing. This Government has now allowed the cuckoos to come in and sing all the way to the bank. Increased rents and house prices are out of control for most workers and families, who are just looking to get on in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179"> For the past few weeks, I have listened to the Government trying to shift the blame for the housing crisis to my party, Sinn Féin, because it apparently held up the building of houses. The Government has even tried to criticise us for speaking against the involvement of the private sector in our housing system. Families and young people across the State who are living with their parents or paying astronomical rents and are slowly resigning themselves to being a locked out generation unable to purchase a home are not fools.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180"> All day and every day, I will defend the building of public housing on public land, for example the site on Oscar Traynor Road. As the Minister for Finance knows, the majority of councillors on Dublin City Council made a proposal for 100% social and affordable homes on that site. Despite the proposal being with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage since February and repeated correspondence from the mayor, the Minister has still not thrown his weight behind it. I will always defend houses being sold to young people on an affordable basis. I will always promote rental properties being available at an affordable price.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181"> Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have made a complete hames of housing policy. It started in the late 1990s when, overnight, Fianna Fáil changed its public policy of building social housing and commodified a roof over a family's head for profit for the highest bidder. This change was single-handedly responsible for crashing the economy in 2008 and giving control of our country to the International Monetary Fund, IMF. Former Deputy Michael Noonan, who was in charge of rebalancing the economy, believed that the market would balance itself out. The vultures and cuckoos flew in and exploited and damaged our housing market further. As such, no lectures will be taken by Sinn Féin for the mess that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have created. Blame for this crisis lies squarely and only on both of those parties equally. We are the laughing stock of Europe because of the mess that successive Irish Governments have made of housing provision. This is to the detriment of our own people. Shame on you.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> The people are not fools. The Government can try to deflect and shift blame elsewhere, but that will not wash. The people, in particular young people, will have their say at the next election whenever this coalition of chaos falls. The proof will be in the pudding then. Those who truly want to build a new housing system will get their chance. Of that I have no doubt.</p>

          <p eId="para_1183">I would like it noted that People Before Profit proposed three amendments to the Government's motion, all of which have been ruled out of order. For the record, I should say what they were. First, we proposed that the stamp duty should be 90%, not 10%, as the Government is proposing, or 15% or 17%, as the other Opposition parties are proposing. We need not just to disincentivise funds or make purchasing a little more costly but, rather, to exclude them completely from the market in order that they cannot bulk-purchase houses, price people out of the market and control the prices and rents therein. Second, we proposed that the threshold at which the higher stamp duty kicked in would not be ten properties, but two. In other words, there could be no multiple purchases by these profit-hungry funds. Third, apartments should be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184"> The Government will not accept any of these amendments, of course. With this motion, it is simply responding to the fury that people felt as a result of seeing these cuckoos swooping in and purchasing whole estates. The Government had to be seen to be doing something so it has engineered to do the absolute minimum, no doubt in deep consultation with the very cuckoo funds and vulture funds it is supposed to be trying to deal with. The Government is not planning or even attempting to deal with the cuckoo and vulture funds because it is up to its neck in this with them and has been since at least 2011 or 2012, shortly after the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government came into office, when it held multiple meetings with them to invite them into Ireland and informed them of the tax benefits they could have by investing in Irish property, paying no tax on their rental revenues or capital gains, and when the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, sold off property worth more than €40 billion with the Government's active encouragement. The same funds that were invited in by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government are now being given the opportunity to move into other sectors of the housing market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185"> The extent of what is happening is terrifying. One would think the Government had learned its lesson when all these policies led to the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State, with rents and house prices going off the Richter scale and 80% to 90% of workers being priced out of the purchase market or asked to pay rents that no worker can afford of €2,000, €2,500 or €3,000 per month, but what is happening has actually got worse. I will elaborate on a point I made earlier today. People should google Housing Together. Its website reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1186">A Unique Opportunity For Investors Seeking Capital Growth And Secure Income</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1187">Government Backed Residential Property Investment</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">By the way, this relates to the provision of social housing. It is about capital growth and secure incomes for investors. So far, Housing Together has bought property worth €50 million and leased it to local authorities at extortionate rates. As I recited to the Taoiseach, Housing Together boasts that it will achieve an annual average yield of 5%, high incomes at low risk, the opportunity to lock in rents linked to inflation, no maintenance, no voids, no letting fees and no advertising costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">It further boasts, giving examples, that, say, a 25-year lease on a two-bedroom apartment in Dublin will net investors €15,279 a year in rent. At the end of a 25-year to 30-year lease, they will have made €475,000, which is a yield of approximately 7.8%, and they will still own the asset. The State will have paid through the nose and these people will have made an absolute fortune. More millionaires will have been made who did absolutely nothing except invest in "Government-backed investment opportunities". At the end of it all, the State will own nothing. The funds can flog the assets off and the people in so-called social housing can be ditched, just like the HAP residents in St. Helen's Court face being thrown out because a vulture fund decided it wants vacant possession to drive up the value of the property. That will be happening on a mass scale because of Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190"> At the other end of this twisted equation and heist, we have the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, investing in the funds that are doing this kind of thing. When the Government says we need these funds financed, I say we do not. We are already financing them through the ISIF, HAP payments, lease payments, RAS payments and the tax loopholes that allow them to pay no tax. They run off with the asset and the profits and we get nothing. We get neither affordable rents nor affordable housing. Why do we not use our capital to invest in public and affordable housing that is genuinely affordable, that we will own at the end of it and whereby the profits, instead of going into the pockets of these bloodsuckers and vultures, go into the coffers of the State and the people?</p>

          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1191">The proposal that is before us will do nothing other than reinforce the reality that the Government is led by the interests of developers, vulture funds and cuckoo funds. I represent the constituency of Dublin Bay South where, generation after generation, in communities like those in Pearse Street, Kevin Street, Ringsend and around the Iveagh Trust, people have grown up in apartments and flats. Those apartments and flats are homes as well and the inner-city communities who live in them matter. Unless apartments are included in measures to tackle cuckoo funds, we will witness the fast-tracking of ordinary working families being pushed out of their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> Many people in the inner city believe there is already a process of social cleansing taking place. The gentrification of long-established working-class communities has been gathering pace. These proposals will mean the Government is, in effect, abandoning inner-city communities and handing the inner city over to vulture funds. People who grew up in areas like Ringsend, Pearse Street, Rathmines and Harold's Cross are well used to not being able to afford a home locally. The big companies like Google and Facebook have been moving into urban villages like Irishtown and Harold's Cross. As they move in, prices soar and become increasingly unaffordable. Huge areas of the inner city are made up of apartments and flats. The docklands area is almost all apartments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> The plan for the Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend will see 3,500 new homes, all of them apartments. These proposals will have no impact on that plan. What will stop vulture funds from coming in and buying up all the apartments on the site? This resolution certainly will not. What will the Minister say to the residents in Irishtown who were hoping to buy an affordable house there? The Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group, which has fought hard for new homes on the site, fears there will be no affordable homes delivered. A home that costs €450,000 is not affordable. The group has not been reassured by the Government or Dublin City Council that the homes promised by the previous Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be delivered. These proposals will not protect those 3,500 new homes from vulture or cuckoo funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194"> In ten years' time, all of the 3,500 new homes on the Poolbeg Peninsula could well be owned by a vulture fund charging vast amounts in rent. There will be no one who went to primary school in Ringsend or Pearse Street living in those apartments because they will not be able to afford them. A total of 900 of the homes planned for construction on the Irish Glass Bottle site will be public and affordable. That means they will cost €450,000, which is not affordable. It is unlikely that many of the children who went to Marian College, Ringsend College or Westland Row CBS will be able to afford them. The idea that they will be classed as affordable at a price of €450,000 is mind-boggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> Project Ireland 2040 outlines what it sees as the future of the growth of Dublin. It states, "Identifying a number of ambitious large-scale regeneration areas for the provision of new housing and employment throughout the city and metropolitan area and the measures required to facilitate them as integrated, sustainable development projects." What is sustainable about letting investment funds buy up the bulk of apartments in Dublin city? What is sustainable about enabling those funds to rent out apartments for sky-high rents? What is sustainable about the funds' practice of leaving apartments empty for years if the sky-high rent prices cannot be obtained? There is a prime example of this in the Capital Dock development, a stone's throw from Whelan House in Ringsend and Pearse House on Pearse Street. The rent for a two-bedroom apartment there is €4,000 per month. The local community lost out when the Part V provision for Capital Dock was delivered outside the area. The rents are only affordable for some senior executives in the construction and technology sectors, which means the locals lose out again. This sort of development is not sustainable unless one is a lucky winner of the EuroMillions draw. How can anyone take seriously what the Government says about making Dublin a more liveable and sustainable city when it continues to allow these cuckoo funds to run riot?</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1196">I am sharing time with Deputy Tóibín. Homebuyers should not have to compete with investment funds. While the measure before us is a starting point in tackling this issue, it is no more than that. I fear that the 10% stamp duty provision does not go far enough. It was pointed out earlier today that share prices in the largest REIT in Ireland went up 4% this morning on foot of the Government announcement. That has to give rise to genuine concern for all of us in the House. I want a commitment from the Minister that this measure will be reviewed and revisited within the next 20 weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> In the meantime, we need to look to other jurisdictions to see what works and does not work. We need to look at the incentives that are in place and go through them thoroughly. At present, we are providing tax incentives to encourage investment from these particular funds. In fact, there is a double incentive provided. A total of €223 million in HAP payments is going into these investment funds, with a guaranteed return of a 4% increase in rents per annum. That is in addition to the tax incentives and structures that are in place. Availing of the HAP payments means the funds do not have to source the tenants or deal with vacancies or maintenance, and the properties are handed back to them at the end of a ten-year, 15-year or 25-year lease to the local authority. For the investors, there is a high-income, low-risk return and a tax incentive. The existence of this direct double benefit needs to be revisited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> At the same time, we are not seeing a reduction in the price of rental accommodation in Dublin city.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">If you look at <i>daft.ie</i> or <i>myhome.ie</i> today, you will see that a one-bedroom apartment in the Dublin suburbs costs a minimum of €2,000 a month and that a two-bedroom apartment costs €2,500. These are not affordable rents, and that really needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200"> What I find frustrating - and I have taken up this point with the Minister previously - is the fact that we provide security of tenure for cows in fields but not for children in rented homes. Up to the 2000s, we had a model of leasing farmland which was based on an 11-month lease and farmers could not plan for a future beyond that. The Government of the day took a decision to bring in a tax allowance to incentivise farmers to lease their lands long-term for a minimum of five years. Additional incentives were subsequently introduced to allow for ten- and even 15-year leases. As a result, more than half of the land in this country that is leased out is leased out long-term and this provides security to the farmer actively farming the land. While we are prepared to put those structures in place for farmers for the management of cattle and farmland, we have failed to do anything for security of tenure on a long-term basis for people in rental accommodation in respect of the amount of rent they pay or the terms of their leases. As a minimum condition of the incentives in place for the organisations that are buying up apartment blocks across the country, they should guarantee fixed rents and security of tenure for their tenants over the term of those incentives. This would encourage the development of a long-term leasing approach in this country, which is far more sensible and more along the lines of the European model and would at least provide some security for families who cannot afford to source houses of their own. One of the biggest problems we have in this country with families finding themselves homeless is the fact of the churning of accommodation, whereby the lease on the rental accommodation ends up lapsing and then the families end up trying to find alternative accommodation. Such a model would help to address that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1201">They say there are five stages of grief. It seems to me there are also five stages of Fine Gael in government: first, introduce a red carpet and a tax regime for cuckoo funds; second, invest in those same cuckoo funds; third, suffer amnesia and forget anything has happened; fourth, have a political wobble as you see your support in a key target voting market being wiped out; and, fifth, rush through half measures to seek cover. By God, there is a locked-out generation in this country at the moment. This is probably the first time in hundreds of years that we have had a complete generation that is economically worse off than the generation before. For hundreds of years, each generation improved economically but that is reversing for the first time now. This has not happened by accident. The dysfunction that exists in the market is a direct result of Fine Gael policies. I have had this discussion with the Minister numerous times and I had it with his predecessor, Michael Noonan. The red carpet was rolled out for vulture funds and REITs. The playing field was tilted in favour of big international investors in an effort literally to put the floor under prices in the housing market and to improve the balance sheets of the banks in this country. The problem, however, is that it has ended up at this stage creating a new tenant class that has not been seen since the time of the landlords. The truth of the matter is that unless the Government reverses those competitive advantages that each of these international investors has over families seeking to put a roof over the heads of their children, this situation will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202"> What level of economic modelling has the Minister done to indicate what result will come in the market from an increase in the stamp duty rate that is included in this financial resolution? Has he done any economic modelling whatsoever? This could go a number of ways. These same international investors could have a big enough yield to be able to deal with the increase in stamp duty. This could have no effect at all on their purchasing decisions. Their business model may not change as a result of this. Alternatively, they could still purchase those same units and pass the cost change on to the renter, as often happens when stamp duties increase. I would like the Minister to answer that question in his closing remarks. What economic modelling has been done in respect of this increase in the stamp duty rate?</p>

          <p eId="para_1203">I am delighted to be able to say a few words on this rushed legislation. We are closing the stable door long after the horse has bolted. The horses have been dancing around the Curragh. We saw before the financial crash the people who were visiting the tents, playing golf, attending race meetings and minding the horses. We saw where that got us. We invited these investors in. I accept that there were a number of problems at the time, however. We could not get money. Our banks were broke - or they were supposed to be. We painfully bailed them out, are bailing them out and will be bailing them out, and our grandchildren will too.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204"> To have what is going on now unabated is shocking. I am not one to demonise every builder and developer because we need people to build houses for people to live in, but there has to be value for money and the homes have to be affordable. The builder has to make a small profit. Most builders are decent. However, then there is this carry-on with these cuckoo funds and the vulture funds. I remember the former Minister, Michael Noonan, telling us in the Dáil that the vulture funds were necessary. We are being told these cuckoo funds are necessary as well. How necessary are they, though? We needed them at the time but we got back on the road. We should be able to build the houses ourselves without having these funds making a profit. Does the Government think this legislation will work? Share prices at some of the companies involved were actually up by 2% this morning, so they are laughing all the way to the bank, literally. It is a very serious situation if they can twiddle successive Governments around on their little fingers, the lúidín, twisting and throwing them around.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205"> We are ineffective with the banks in the legislation we pass, with the meat barons, with the insurance companies and with everything else that affects our people and their sovereign right to live out their lives with some modicum of decency and housing and liberty. We have seen those rights diminished completely in the past 13 months and the Government will diminish them again next week or the week after with another motion to go through here. We are at the behest of and we obey Europe and we obey the international funders and everyone else, but our own people? Defend them? No. I do not know how the people are so slow to see what is going on or how they do not have them all pulled and thrown out of government. It is Tweedledum or Tweedledee. The previous Government was backed up by the current Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, with confidence and supply. He is now denying he was in there, and Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are blaming each other back and forward. Now the jolly mixture includes the Greens. They will not leave us cut a clipping. They will not leave us do anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> The price of building is going up and we cannot see the problem. It is bizarre. It is very strange. The system in this country is ineffective and unable to deal with any of these funds or vulture funds. We see the terror that is going on in the courts with the evictions, even through the pandemic, and they are still going on. Those tenants are waiting now, their backs up against the wall. Farmland and family homes are now being put up overnight on a website, sold maybe in two hours without the farmer even knowing. What did Dan Breen, Seán Treacy, Michael Collins and Pat Crowe fight for? What did they all fight for at Soloheadbeg? For this? I say "No". I cannot support this.</p>

          <p eId="para_1207">I have heard so much about the cuckoo here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">It is a grand thing to hear the cuckoo under Mangerton Mountain or around the Roughty river. It was very wrong to give these funds that name. It is such a lovely bird that comes to our shores every year. It is grand to be listening to the ding-dong about housing that has been going on here over the last four or five years. It is clear that the Government needs to tackle the investment funds and try to level the playing pitch. It was very wrong to see young couples competing against these massive investment funds to try to put a roof over their own heads, only to be blown out of it by these funds which are being incentivised by the Government. That incentivisation must stop. </p>
          <p eId="para_1209"> There are other things we need to do to help young couples in Kerry and in every other county up and down the country. We have a regulator going around rezoning land now in all our counties. The regulator is even dezoning serviced land. We have another scenario where it finishes up with only one square of land zoned and that developer then has a monopoly and can charge whatever he or she wants to charge. We need to zone enough land and let there be competition or else forget about zoning and let every planning application stand on its own when it is submitted to the local authority, Kerry County Council, Cork County Council or wherever. However, it is wrong to give any developer or investment company a monopoly. I have nothing against developers because if it were not for developers and builders, we would have no houses. </p>
          <p eId="para_1210"> There are also designations, like urban-generated housing, to stop people building outside towns. That is actually hurting the people outside the towns in the first place. People who do not own land and want to buy a site are stopped from buying a site, the same as the people coming out and denying them the chance of building in their own area. It is very wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211"> Places are not serviced. People need to start on the ground with sewerage schemes and water schemes. Our infrastructure is falling asunder. Different things are happening at present. Irish Water is charging €6,500 per house in a development. Insulation is going up by 40%. What are we going to do about it?</p>

          <p eId="para_1218">I thank all Deputies for their contributions on this very important motion. Many different allegations have been made this evening regarding my intention, the intention of my party and indeed the intention of the Government in how we want to meet the housing needs of our country and the lack of progress we have made. Allegations have been made about my intentions regarding this resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219"> Let us consider what happened with housing under the last Government while acknowledging that for many it was not enough and while acknowledging that many people wanted to see more progress. During the period of the last Government, in the aftermath of a financial crisis, in the aftermath of our country, our economy and our ability to build houses all being brought to their knees, that Government saw the delivery of 86,000 homes over four years. It saw 30,000 families removed from the social housing list and began the process of the Government being able to directly build homes in our country. We saw it increase from a few hundred homes per year in the aftermath of the financial crisis to 5,000 to 6,000 homes per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220"> I make this point while again acknowledging that for too many the rent they are paying is too high and that for too many the promise of being able to own their own home is still out of reach. I understand that. I understand what drives the demand on the Government to do more. However, over recent years I have outlined the progress that was made. That is the number of homes that were built and the number of families, our fellow citizens, who were taken off waiting lists for houses. The Government is determined to build upon that progress. </p>
          <p eId="para_1221"> There has been more than €3 billion worth of investment in either directly building homes or enabling them to be built. For 2021 and probably for 2020, the largest single builder of homes within our country, and probably the largest single purchaser of homes within our country, was the State. We did so in an effort to respond to the issues that are motivating the contributions of most Deputies this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222"> Many who are looking in at this debate are asking what this House can offer, what the Opposition can offer to respond to the urgent issues, given the anxiety that I know is there. I think they will probably be deeply confused by what they have heard from the Opposition this evening. Opposition Deputies are against anybody who wants to build homes on any scale. They have been against any bank that wants to lend to us. They are against anybody who wants to invest funding in our country, to have savings from elsewhere channelled into our country to build homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223"> The question is: how will they build the homes? Where will they come from? It is a relevant question because I listened to Deputy Doherty's contribution in particular. How can I reconcile what I hear from Deputy Doherty with the fact that in the city he speaks about, whose centre I have the great privilege of representing, every time any land becomes available to be rezoned to allow homes to be built, his party votes against it? Sinn Féin voted against rezoning ten to 12 different light industrial use areas on which public housing could be built on private land.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224"> What Sinn Féin Deputies will say in response to the argument that I make - if they accept my ability to put an argument forward and most of the time they do not - is that the Government should do it. I agree that the Government should build. That is why we have a budget of €3 billion this year. That is why the Government is building 5,000 or 6,000 homes either indirectly through approved housing bodies or directly through local authorities. Any time the Government looks to do more, through the Land Development Agency or through the Affordable Housing Bill that the Government has introduced, Sinn Féin will vote against it. On the one hand, it wants the Government to do more, but on the other hand, when the Government introduces measures aiming to do more, they are rejected by Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225"> The Opposition is always - correctly - calling for more houses to be built. I understand that need and I want to meet that need. The Opposition is calling for rents to be more affordable and for the price of a home to come down. For those who are involved in building a home, for those who may have to lend for that home to be built, for those who may invest in housing in our country to see that housing being delivered at some point in the future - housing that I want to be affordable - the message from the Opposition here this evening is that it is always against that happening. </p>
          <p eId="para_1226"> I acknowledge that the Government has a leading role to play in the homes that need to be built - more than 330,000 homes in a decade. The Government has a role to play in directly building affordable housing through our local authorities and in supporting our approved housing bodies. That is what the Government is doing. However, there is a role for savings in our own country and savings from other parts of the world to be channelled into the provision of housing in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">We are a small economy with two pillar banks and one smaller bank. I want these homes to be built because I also represent and have the privilege of serving those generations, that is, those citizens who have such deep concerns about what their future is. If we want those homes to be built, they will be built through an active Government and a role for the private sector, both coming together. The job of the Government in the coming years will be to harness both to respond to the need, to meet the urgency and to support our citizens in the quest that many of them have for lower rents and more affordable housing. It is a mission to which I am committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228"> On some of the central charges that have been put here this evening regarding why apartments have been excluded from the taxation measures in front of the House, that is because of my view and that of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that were they to be included, those apartments would not be built. In responding to the great demand and urgency we know is there, we need supply. We need more apartments to be built in cities all over the country for rental use to respond to the rental needs the Opposition identifies regularly, as it should. They also are needed for apartments that are affordable to buy and to live in in our city centres for families, for our citizens and for our workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229"> On the charges that have been made about REITs and IREFs, I acknowledge that this is a contested area and that there are concerns in this regard. It also should be acknowledged that because of changes I made in a recent Finance Bill, filings show that the level of taxation that is being paid by IREFs now stands at 18.4% of all of the revenue they have declared for taxable purposes. That is the tax that they pay. As some of the Opposition know, the way that the rest of the taxes are paid for REITs and indeed for IREFs is at the time the income or returns that they make are distributed to those who invest in them. They pay an exit tax, a withholding tax, and after those taxes have been paid and when income is distributed to the investors, it is at that point that the tax is paid, whether that be corporate or income tax, but that is where this occurs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230"> In conclusion, the reason this measure is being taken is to deal with an issue which I acknowledge has caused much public concern and this motion is a response to that issue. I believe this motion will be sufficient and the measure that is being proposed here this evening, with duty of 10% on more than ten homes, is a strong response to the urgency of this issue. It is just one part of the many different measures which this Government has in place to address the needs, issues, worries and concerns that have been raised here this evening and which I, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, and the Government are determined to do everything we can to deal with.</p>

I was in the convention centre waiting to speak and a Government speaker did not show up. I am not complaining but merely explaining the fact that I was here and that I wish to speak on this issue.

          <p eId="para_1688">Yes, I have moved amendment No. 2. The purpose of the amendment is fairly straightforward. It is a concern that has been relayed to me by a number of students. A commitment was previously made that the collective junior certificate data of the cohort or year group would be used to determine the accredited grade, not any individual's performance. This is possible and, as I understand it, was done last year. Even where there is churn within a cohort, it is possible to unify the individual results and therefore to treat them as a collective. The data are significant, and individual students are worried about their junior certificate, which may not have been as good as it could have been or as good as they would have liked. What we are seeking in the amendment is a clear commitment from the Minister that the accredited grades will not be based on individual data. I would like to get a commitment from the Minister in that regard to the effect that it will be based on the collective group.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education (Deputy Norma Foley)<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T21:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1689">As I said in the Seanad when the same amendment was tabled, I agree with it in principle but I must reiterate the point that I made on that occasion in response to what is being requested by the Deputy. Fundamentally, the process of standardisation will operate at national level. It is preferable to use aggregate or cohort data, as the evidence is that the use of junior cycle data in the regression model is of better predictive quality when done at a class group rather than an individual level, which is the same view as the Deputy has expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1690"> The amendment as drafted is potentially problematic. In general, some flexibility is needed on precisely what is included in the standardisation process rather than being overly defined by the Act. I cannot agree to the amendment, as in certain cases it is necessary to rely on the individual junior cycle result of an individual student where that student is typically an out-of-school learner or a student pursuing a subject out of school. This was the case in 2020 in respect of calculated grades and it is set out in the published national standardisation group report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1691"> In addition, in order to ensure we were being clear about the junior cycle's potential use in standardisation, the guide to State examinations and accredited grades for leaving certificate 2021, which issued in February, stated: "Though the prior performance of the class group in Junior Cycle may be used in this process, the individual performance of the student at Junior Cycle would not be a determinant of their performance at Leaving Certificate, other than when the subject is being taken outside of school." However, the accredited grades system is, overall, subject to the determination of policy by me. Specifically, section 2(2)(d) operates "in accordance with such policy directions as the Minister may give". On that basis, in rejecting the amendment, I am happy to include in my determination under section 2(1), which is our intention in any event, a policy direction expressly stating that the junior cycle and leaving certificate data used in the process of standardisation will be aggregated or cohort data subject to the flexibility referred to above in limited cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_1693">I am not pressing the amendment. I appreciate the Minister's response. Overall, I am broadly reassured by it that the results of the cohort will be used rather than the results of individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1694"> I am not entirely convinced that it makes sense for an individual student who is an out-of-school learner and who is not part of a cohort to have his or her junior certificate results used. I have in mind circumstances in which somebody had a bad experience at a school, went through a difficult time and did a poor junior certificate but when he or she went to a different school such as a post-leaving certificate, PLC, type of institution did significantly better in the leaving certificate. In such a case, I do not understand why the individual's junior certificate results would be used, given that his or her circumstances may have changed very significantly. If there is to be a national standardisation against the traditional bell-curve standardisation that is used, I imagine that it would probably be more reliable in standardising those results than an individual's junior certificate results. It seems to me to be potentially problematic. In any event, I accept the Minister's point and I will not press the amendment. I am encouraged by her statement that the approach of the Department will be that the results of the cohort rather than the individual will be used.</p>

          <p eId="para_1695">I move amendment No. 3:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1696">In page 5, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1697">"(iv) be set out in writing and published by or on behalf of the Commission prior to the issuing of results to each candidate;".</p>
          <p eId="para_1698">I will be pressing this amendment. It is an important amendment. There was an awful lot of controversy last year and much of the discussion was about standardisation. We are trying to identify potential flaws in the legislation but we support it and want to see it progressed. We will support it on Final Stage. We must be especially careful this year given the controversies in other jurisdictions about the methods of standardisation, primarily in respect of school profiling, but also the very significant error we had here that led to the downgrading and upgrading of many students' grades. That had implications for third level places. The third level sector responded admirably in ensuring that those whose grades were downgraded secured places.</p>
          <p eId="para_1699"> We do not want to have a repeat of last year's scenario, when a significant error was not spotted until after the fact. A crucial way of preventing that is allowing the formula of the algorithm to be published and scrutinised publicly. That would be a benefit as there is a transparency issue involved and the trust of students in the process is called into question. It would be helpful if the algorithm was no great secret and was published. The Minister informed my office at an earlier briefing that it would be published before results would be issued. However, she rowed back from that in the Seanad when she indicated it would not be published. This amendment is intended to ensure the Minister publishes the algorithm, as that would be the right, necessary, transparent and fair thing to do. It is essential to ensure the errors of last year are not repeated.</p>

          <p eId="para_1700">I agree with the principle behind this amendment in terms of transparency in how the process of standardisation would operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1701">However, the amendment seeks to have the process of standardisation published in advance of results day. This is not something that can be agreed to as the final composition or application of the process will not, or at least may not, be known right up to the day of the results.</p>
          <p eId="para_1702"> I can commit, at a minimum, to doing what we did last year in having the technical detail of the model and standardisation process published on results day. I am also happy to commit to publishing any other information on the process of standardisation in advance of results day. That is what I was clear we would do, and any information that could be published in advance of results day can be published in advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1703"> We will be able to comment more on what it would be hoped to publish on the standardisation process once the standardisation process for 2021 has been developed. However, it is an iterative process and the algorithm used for the standardisation process will not be finished until the end of that process. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment as drafted.</p>

          <p eId="para_1704">I find that difficult to comprehend. This process has already started, the company has been engaged and the Minister is recruiting another company for additional scrutiny, which I welcome. It is 19 May and we have June, July and into August for this to take shape. I do not understand why the Minister suggests this work will never be done until the results are out. I find that very difficult to comprehend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1705"> Surely, there has to come a point where those who are responsible for drafting the formula, and who have given as much consideration as possible to all the different factors, are able to say they are satisfied with it and confident in it. As the Minister is holding on to this until the very last minute to ensure that error does not arise, publication would, if anything, potentially identify error at an earlier stage because it would be the subject of public scrutiny. It is with the intention of avoiding last year's difficulties that I am urging transparency in this regard. I am not saying it has to be out next week but it should be out before the results. There is no good reason not to publish it before the results day. What particularly happens on the results day? Obviously, the results come out but no changes can be made to it. Surely, if there are errors, we want those changes to be made and we want that to be spotted. If it is going to be kept under wraps until the last minute, that is not going to happen.</p>

          <from>Deputy Norma Foley<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1706">I want to be very clear that there is no intention of keeping anything under wraps. There is no intention whatsoever of concealing any detail. What is important to remember is that the process of standardisation is just that: it is a process, not a static formula. It is very important to point out that even if we were to look at the written leaving certificate exam in terms of that process, it also contains and has always consistently included standardisation. As to, for example, publishing the marking scheme of the written leaving certificate exam, that is never publicised or published until after the release of the results because, again, the standardisation process works there as well. There is an alignment between the written process and the accredited grades process this year or the calculated grades process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1707"> There is no question of not wishing to co-operate. As I said earlier, it is an iterative process and any detail that can be released in advance will be released in advance but, certainly, all of the data that need to be published, in a similar fashion to the publishing of the marking scheme for the written exams, will be published at the time of the results, and it is similar for the algorithm.</p>

          <p eId="para_1708">To be clear, I appreciate there is no bad faith or anything like that in not publishing this. I appreciate the Minister is not deliberately concealing anything. However, the fact remains that this formula and the process connected to it will not become public until after the results are issued. It is different from marking schemes, when we take into consideration the controversies here and elsewhere over the past 12 months and the difficulties that have become very apparent with standardisation and the risks that exist. It is in the interests of addressing that and ensuring confidence in the process that we are calling for this to be published and, accordingly, tabling this amendment. I will be pressing the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1839">Amendment No. 4 relates to the appeals mechanism. As the legislation is drafted, the mechanism operates only on the basis of how grades are transmitted to the Department. The mechanism is technical, limited and unlikely to make any difference for the vast majority of students if there is an error or problem with accredited grades. The amendment is to allow for a more substantial appeal, which many students were seeking last year. They wanted an opportunity to have a broader appeals process. Could the Minister provide for that by way of regulation?</p>

          <p eId="para_1840">There are a number of reasons and grounds for rejecting this amendment. As a matter of policy, the provision of estimated marks is grounded fundamentally in the professional judgment of teachers and school alignment before submission to the SEC. The definition of "estimated mark" in the Bill provides clarity on what professional judgment is understood to encompass. The process through which professional judgment is exercised would make it impossible that another person unknown to the student could be expected to review the evidence as a candidate's teacher had done, acknowledging that some of it will have been based on observation over the course of the senior cycle, and then be asked to provide an estimated mark that could be compared to the one initially provided. This would make the design of such an appeals system, even if it were desired, extremely difficult and potentially impossible. The appeal process would be highly likely to last several weeks, if not longer, and impede the candidate's progression to further study, or at least not facilitate it in terms of later rounds of offers. For these reasons, it is not possible to accept the amendment.</p>

Given the significance of the consequences, whereby grades can be withheld, which has implications for the rest of a student’s life, his or her career and access to third level, it is only fair that the student accused would have the opportunity to have his or her version of events heard in any review and to put his or her case. I am not saying the student's version of events would necessarily be accepted but it is a question of him or her having the opportunity to be heard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1846">Sections 4 and 5 will operate in accordance with such procedures as may be prescribed. In that regard, regulations are being drafted that give effect to the provisions concerned. I have already indicated to each House, including today, that there will be a robust review process that will not lead to decisions being made without considering individual circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1847"> While the operation of the provision is always subject to the constitutional protection of fair procedures and natural justice, and while regulations are in development, section 7(2) expressly requires that the regulations provide for what the amendment would provide for. Section 7(2)(a) specifies that the candidate will be notified should a report in regard to a communication under section 4 be made, or what has been referred to as canvassing, or if false and misleading information is given, as provided for under section 5. The candidate then has the opportunity to "make representations to the Commission". In this way, the candidate is afforded the opportunity to be heard as the amendment intends. In addition, before any decision to withhold accredited grades is made, a review is carried out, and any decision arising to withhold results must be accompanied with reasons for the withholding and is subject to appeal. Therefore, there is a second opportunity for the candidate's views to be taken into account. I want to make it abundantly clear that there is every opportunity for the student to be heard. There is a robust review mechanism and a further appeal. There is no question but that the student will be heard at every opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_1848">I am broadly willing to accept that. I will make a general point and then return to the specific issue. There is a bit of a difficulty with this Bill that has arisen regarding other Bills over the past year. I am referring to where regulations that follow the passage of legislation are of a significance that goes far beyond the usual significance of regulations. The regulations under discussion are important. In ordinary circumstances, it is fair to insist that they be made available before a Bill passes into law. There is a very tight timescale and we are not going to slow down the passage of this legislation but the Minister should have regulations such as those in question available and ready to inspect before we vote so we can understand what will happen when so much of the detail is left to regulation. Having said all that, I accept what the Minister has said. I am satisfied there is a reasonable opportunity to be heard, at least according to what she has described. This is vital. In general, I am not entirely thrilled that so much is left to regulation and that we do not see the regulations before having a chance to vote on the final Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1855">Siri does not agree. Siri does not have a vote. We discussed this matter on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1856">It is an important amendment. The point was perhaps misunderstood. To clarify, there should be no toleration of canvassing or interference. There has to be a clear message to everyone, including students, parents and anyone connected with a student, that teachers and school staff are off limits and that they should not seek to put them under any pressure. I am thinking of teachers living in our communities, especially smaller rural areas, where they could be going to the same shops as the students and parents and might be involved in the GAA team, the soccer or such. Under no circumstances should it be considered acceptable that they be put under any pressure, implication or anything of the kind. It is important that teachers are protected from that. I believe and am hopeful that there will not be many such instances. I hope there will not be any instances of this kind of behaviour over the course of the next few weeks and months because I hope and believe that students understand that teachers and school staff are under significant pressure in this process too. The point of this amendment is not in any way to undermine that but to ensure that those who are responsible for bad behaviour carry the burden of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1857"> It is far from inconceivable that a parent or somebody connected to a student could canvass or lobby a teacher or a member of school staff on behalf of a student without the student's knowledge. I do not believe that that is difficult to conceive of at all. In such circumstances, where that can be demonstrated, I believe it would not be fair on students for the sanction to be the withholding of their grades, given the implications it has for their career and for their access to third level education. A substantial fine for the person who is responsible would be more appropriate, which I have provided for in this amendment. In the instance that somebody challenged the Department or the State Examinations Commission in court on the basis of grades being withheld for actions that the person was not party to, was not responsible for and did not have any hand in, I think the State Examinations Commission or the Department would be on thin ground. I urge the Minister to make alternative provisions. There have to be significant sanctions but they should apply to the person who is responsible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1858">The procedure under which a review will be conducted will seek the views of the candidate, the student, in respect of any report made of canvassing. Section 7(2)(a) expressly provides that the student or candidate will have the opportunity to submit representations. If the student was unaware of any canvassing, the candidate has the opportunity to make that case in his or her representations, and if he or she makes that point, the review must take this into account when reaching any decision. The candidate enjoys the protection that, fundamentally, any decision following the review must be reasonably based on the information available to the review. As the intent of the amendment is already provided for, including by virtue of legal principles, the amendment does not improve the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1859"> With regard to the drafting of the amendment itself, it could have unintended consequences and does not develop or elaborate on the policies or principles to be applied in determining how a candidate would show that he or she had no knowledge of a communication or in how the person making any communication would himself or herself be afforded fair procedures. The ultimate objective is to offer an opportunity to ensure that canvassing does not take place and to provide protection in that regard. It also provides protection to the student as students can make representations declaring that they were not aware of the canvassing. That will be taken into consideration during the review. I do not accept the amendment as proposed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1860">I do not agree with the Minister's interpretation of the legislation. I refer to section 4(5)(b), which states, "The Commission may, following a review referred to in paragraph (a), withhold all or any of the accredited grades comprised in the Leaving Certificate 2021 in respect of any candidate by whom, or for whose benefit, the communication concerned was made." That is the only sanction envisaged in the legislation. It states clearly "for whose benefit", as it would potentially be, even if they had no benefit or desire to get involved in such lobbying or canvassing. It is far from inconceivable. The Minister appears to have conceded the principle but I am not confident in her interpretation of the legislation. It states clearly that this can be withheld. There is no qualification of that in this section. All that the sections the Minister has quoted do is talk about the process for a review. What if the review concludes that there was lobbying and canvassing, which is substantiated, and finds that the student was not aware of that? Either the Minister is saying that there will be no sanction for anyone or the sanction is the withholding of grades and it will apply anyway. Which is it?</p>

          <p eId="para_1861">Students enjoy the protection that, fundamentally, any decision following the review must be reasonably based on the information available to the review. We must be clear that the objective is to ensure that no canvassing takes place. The staff involved in the accredited grades process use professional judgment. They deserve protection from interference. Their professionalism should be the only objective in the accredited grades process. There must be a mechanism to ensure that happens and is supported. That is currently provided for in the legislation. If anything is done to the detriment of that, action must be taken. That is provided for here. I have every confidence that it will be upheld in the truest and best sense of the law as it should be. It is important for those procedures to be in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_1862">I am more concerned now than when I first submitted the amendment. All the Minister has talked about is the review that happens afterwards and the procedure. I am sure that they will be heard and have a chance to make their case, which is why I withdrew the previous amendment. There are only two potential interpretations of what the Minister is saying. She has not been clear on which is correct. If there is a third, she should tell me. The first is that somebody is unaware of lobbying or canvassing on his or her behalf, that is demonstrated, and the grade is withheld anyway because there are no other sanctions. Alternatively, the implication of what the Minister is saying is that the grade will not be withheld but that there is no sanction for the person who did the lobbying or canvassing, so nothing will happen. If that is the case, there is a perverse incentive, a danger and an encouragement which has to be prevented. There has to be a sanction for the person who is responsible. It is one or the other and the Minister needs to tell us which it is and how she intends to fix it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1863">We need to be clear that the provision the Deputy is quoting states "may", not "must". The provision is enabling, not requiring, the State Examinations Commission to act. Where there is a determination that action is required to be taken, action will be taken. As I said, this is an enabling mechanism, not a requirement. There must be consequences if the professional integrity of those who are providing the estimated marks or who have any involvement in the provision of the estimated marks and accredited grades process is being interfered with. I am clear on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1864">The Minister is not being clear. Yes, it states "may" and there is discretion, but if that discretion is not used and the Minister is saying that it may be the case, where it is only fair to the student that it not be used, she has not provided any other sanction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1865">The Minister has not provided for any sanction for the parent or the person connected to the student, which may be another teacher. Who knows what kind of person might be involved? It is immaterial. The point is that the student is not involved. The Minister has not provided for any sanction for such a person. Yes, the provision says "may" and there is room for discretion. That is right because each set of circumstances will be different. However, unless provision is made for circumstances in which somebody else does something that interferes with the process without the student's knowledge, an incentive will exist. The Minister needs to be clear on this. I have given her two possibilities but she has not told me which applies.</p>

          <p eId="para_1866">We will have to agree to disagree as to clarity. I am very clear that the sanction is outlined in the Bill. Where such cases are found to have arisen, the penalty is the withholding of the grade. I will again be clear. There is no requirement for this to happen. There will be a review. Again, the provision says "may" rather than "must". It enables the State Examinations Commission, SEC, to carry out a review rather than requiring it to do so. The section allows for a full review to take place and an adjudication to be made. If it is adjudicated that a person provided false or misleading information, the penalty will be the withholding of the accredited grade.</p>

          <p eId="para_1867">My final contribution will be a question. If a review finds that lobbying happened or, to give a particular example, if it finds that a parent lobbied, and if the review accepts that the student did not know, there will be no sanction for the student. What is the sanction for the parent? Is there any?</p>

          <p eId="para_1868">As I said, as part of the review process, the SEC will take into consideration all of the evidence before it. There is one sanction. I would suggest it is the most severe and significant sanction. If there is a case to be answered, the potential sanction is the withholding of the grade.</p>

          <p eId="para_2004">I am pleased to engage with Deputies on this significant legislation. I acknowledge the work done by the former Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in bringing the Bill this far.</p>
          <p eId="para_2005"> I thank Deputy Funchion for her amendments, which seek to provide for a gender breakdown of information on various categories of employees. However, I have real concerns that providing that type of breakdown may lead to individual employees being easily identifiable within workplaces, particularly smaller workplaces. The amendments would potentially be at odds with section 20A(8) of the Employment Equality Act 1998, as set out in section 2 of the Bill, which provides that regulations may prescribe measures to be taken by the employer or the person who has access to the information to ensure that personal data have undergone pseudonymisation before or when they are released. Pseudonymisation has the meaning assigned to it by Article 4 of the general data protection regulation, GDPR. It refers to the processing of personal data in such a manner that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. In a situation where there is a small number of one category of persons in a workplace, it is very likely that the publication of the information proposed in the Deputy's amendments would make those people individually identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_2006"> I acknowledge that the Deputy is concerned that women may make up the majority of part-time workers, which could be a contributory factor in their being lower paid. However, there are measures proposed in the legislation that allow us to delve into the information that is provided by each company about the gender pay gap, which is the basis of this Bill. I draw the Deputy's attention to section 20A(9) of the 1998 Act, as inserted by section 2 of the Bill, which provides that regulations may be made requiring publication of the percentage of each pay quartile who are men and women. For example, information may be provided on what percentage of the highest hourly paid 25% of employees are men or women. That sort of information is less likely to identify individuals and provides a more detailed and texturised level of background information on the origin of a gender pay gap within a particular employer. This is the better way to go because it avoids the potential, in a small workplace, that the categorisation the Deputy proposes in these amendments could give rise to the singling out and identification of certain individuals, which would mean their pay information could become known.</p>

          <p eId="para_2007">With respect, I disagree with the Minister. The reason for this legislation is that women are already discriminated against in many workplaces. Many people do not believe it still happens in 2021 but there are a huge number of workplaces where a woman is paid less than a man for doing the exact same job. Women are already discriminated against in this regard and I do not accept that my amendments would somehow lead to further discrimination because they are being identified by gender. That is already happening. These provisions would give us an opportunity to obtain data for further research and further possible legislation. It will be a missed opportunity if the Minister does not accept the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_2008">We absolutely accept there is a gender pay gap. That is why we are bringing forward this legislation. There is no question about that. The most recent EUROSTAT figures indicate it is 14.4% in Ireland. That is not acceptable and these provisions are designed to address it. We all accept that the Bill will not solve everything but it will, for the first time, provide for a structured and steady flow of information on what is happening in individual employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2009"> To clarify, I am not at all suggesting that the Deputy's amendments would bring in additional discrimination. I am saying that by bringing the categorisation under which each individual employer must report down to very small levels within a workplace, there is a risk that individual employees may be identified. The whole tenor of the legislation is not to allow individual employees to be singled out. That is my concern about the Deputy's amendments. The additional information in terms of what creates the gender pay gap in a particular workplace can be teased out through some of the other reporting requirements that are set out in the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_2010">The Irish gender pay gap is 13.9% and it is estimated that at the current pace of change, it would take 55 years to close it. The gap is experienced most acutely by older women, women from ethnic minorities and women with disabilities. Pay transparency is an internationally recognised tool to help reduce pay gaps. It will ensure that employees have access to the information necessary for them to be able to enforce their right to non-discriminatory pay. It will also help to shed light on informal pay systems and pay negotiations and variable wage practices such as bonuses, all of which contribute to wage gaps.</p>
          <p eId="para_2011"> This legislation can and must be made stronger if it is do everything possible to close the gender pay gap. We know women are disproportionately represented in low-paid and precarious employment and spend fewer hours on average in paid work than men do. The specific provisions in Deputy Funchion's amendments to allow for a gender breakdown of full-time and part-time employees and those on flexible working hours will provide the type of detail needed to get a fuller picture of the issues. This will help to identify work practices and cultures that lead to women disproportionately holding roles other than full-time roles. I urge the Minister to accept the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_2014">This amendment might be referred to as a technical amendment but its purpose is to address a particular instance of the language used in the Bill. It is extremely important that any vague language be removed and the onus be firmly placed on employers to reduce gender pay gaps within their organisations. I reiterate that this legislation is a step in the right direction and an important measure. However, we must do everything we can to strengthen it and get it exactly right, rather than just having a box-ticking exercise. Unfortunately, that seems to be the case with a lot of measures, particularly those that affect women.</p>
          <p eId="para_2015"> We are discussing these provisions at almost 11 p.m. at night. When we had a debate some weeks ago on International Women's Day, it was one of the matters of business at the very bottom of the agenda on a Thursday evening. If this House is serious about dealing with issues that affect women, we need to put those issues properly on the agenda. There is no point in asking us to make submissions on family-friendly practices in the Houses of the Oireachtas when debates in the House on issues affecting women are pushed out almost to midnight.</p>

          <p eId="para_2017">I agree with everything Deputy Funchion just said. Amendment No. 4 is entirely sensible. It removes ambiguity and ensures that employers must be serious about addressing any wage gap. It would require employers to set out the measures they are taking to address wage inequalities. If, in the context of this legislation, we are to be serious about addressing the wage gap, employers should be required to state how they will address gender-based discrimination. The Government needs to accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_2018">The gender pay gap in Ireland is 14%. This means that women in Ireland are effectively working for free for a quarter of the year. That might make sense if women did 14% less work, worked 14% fewer hours or put in 14% less effort, but we all know that is not the case. In fact, it is often acknowledged that women have to work twice as hard as their male counterparts to get noticed in work and to progress their careers. The bottom line is that we all know that the gender pay gap is not a gap. It is a gaping injustice. It is a reflection of how we value men and women in society but it is not a reflection of the value that women bring to the workplace. We all want a fairer and more equal economy that rewards work and not gender. Working to close the gender pay gap is the very first step towards pay parity. Once implemented, this Bill will require large employers to publish details of their pay gaps, including bonuses. It will also mean that Departments and Government agencies will have to report on their own gender enforcement and gender pay gaps. They will have to take greater responsibility for enforcing the recommendations of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. That is so welcome and so long-awaited. Publishing gender pay gap information might seem like a small step but it forces businesses and business owners to do the work, to acknowledge the problem, which is sometimes under their own roof, and to confront the inequalities in their businesses. It is not as easy to ignore issues when you are forced to confront them. Publishing pay gaps is a first step towards pay parity. I for one look forward to the day when slogans like "equal pay for equal work" are no longer needed. I welcome the Bill as proposed to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill<recordedTime time="2021-05-19T23:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2019">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Deputy Funchion's amendment. I have seen in multiple organisations examples of two solicitors doing the same job in an in-house commercial firm where it was only by accident that the woman found out she was doing the exact same job on a different side of the business as the man for 25% less pay. I recall a similar situation in another professional services firm: two people doing the same job. He was doing it for €70,000 and she was doing it for €58,000. She was doing a much better job, and she knew it, but at least she knew about the pay gap and found ways to try to get around it. Part of the difficulty in being effective about redressing the gender pay gap is the culture of organisations, the lack of openness and transparency and the difficulty women face in trying to articulate the unfairness of doing the same job on a different pay scale without that then following them culturally through an organisation, particularly when there has been a history of that within the organisation. It is difficult for women in senior positions, including senior commercial positions, to try to articulate what is already a matter of law and just a matter of basic fairness. There is a reluctance to highlight it, even though they know they can and even though they know their organisations are liable in employment law. They still are reluctant to highlight it for fear of being seen as a nuisance or as being difficult and for that to follow them.</p>
          <p eId="para_2020"> This legislation is really important, but it is about the follow-through and cultural change. It is not just about the reporting of any pay gap. It is about making it really serious that these cultural changes are necessary, making it easier for women who find this out and who are aware there is disparity, not only in pay but also in work. It is a matter of really being able to articulate that comfortably and as a matter of course within their organisations without fear of it following them around.</p>

          <p eId="para_2021">I, too, support the Bill. Reducing the gender pay gap is one of the key priorities of gender policies both at EU level and here in Ireland. We must ensure businesses publish information relating to the remuneration of their employees by reference to gender in order that we can monitor this. These measures, which take into account the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on both employers and women, who have been hit particularly hard, will increase awareness about pay conditions within companies and give more tools to employers and workers to address this pay discrimination at work. This will address a number of factors contributing to the existing pay gap and is particularly relevant during the Covid-19 pandemic. Anyone doing any work deserves to be paid for that work at the same rate as anyone else doing the same work, regardless of gender. It is important that pay scales are transparent and that women can fight for what is their right when they are given knowledge that exposes unfairness. We need to make sure this information is as transparent as it can be. This is so important. I am delighted to support the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_2022">I thank Deputies for their support for the legislation. I agree with Deputy Funchion's comments on the very significant distance the Houses of the Oireachtas have to go towards a family-friendly and particularly a gender-friendly system of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_2023"> To refer specifically to Deputy Funchion's proposed amendment, it seeks to delete the words "if any" in respect of the publication of reasons in the employer's opinion for any gaps and of the measures, if any, that an employer is taking or proposes to take to eliminate or reduce these gaps. The use of the term "if any" provides for circumstances in which no measures can be taken by a particular employer to eliminate or reduce the gender pay gap in their particular situation. This may be due to segregation in education and the overall labour market, whereby women are under-represented in certain sectors of the economy. These are policy issues which cannot be addressed by the individual employer but must be examined on a sectoral basis and will probably require Government intervention to address. Indeed, the whole purpose of this Bill is to allow us to identify these situations more easily and more readily. This is exactly what the Bill is about. It is about providing the information on where there are certain sectors of the economy where there is that gender pay gap, looking not only at its size but also at its origins and giving the government of the day the relevant information that it can use to respond. It will be possible in many cases for the employer to pursue positive action measures that are within the law and which will increase the number of women in more highly remunerated roles in that particular firm. However, the legislation recognises a reality in including the words "if any". The text recognises a reality that in certain situations the solution to the gender pay gap may not always be in the gift of the individual employer but may require wider and co-ordinated State action. On that basis, it is my view that we should leave that phrase in. As a result, I do not propose to accept Deputy Funchion's amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_2027">I will make my points about these amendments and two others together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2028"> Regarding amendment No. 5, the latest CSO business demographic figures show that approximately 50% of workers in the State are employed in smaller microbusinesses with fewer than 50 employees. If we are to get a true reflection of the real gender pay gap in the State, we need to make provision for this large employee base in the Bill. This is why Sinn Féin believes that the number should be reduced. The Bill refers to "50 employees" but we propose that the figure should be reduced to 20.</p>
          <p eId="para_2029"> Amendment No. 6 is very similar to amendment No. 5 and is part of the Government's proposed staggered roll-out period between various-sized organisations. We would like to see the figure of 250 reduced to 150 to apply on the second anniversary of the legislation. Amendment No. 7 follows on from that. We are opposed to the provision that allows an organisation of 250 employees to avoid the legislation until its second anniversary. We believe that organisations with a smaller number of employees should be required to fulfil their duties within 12 months of the Bill coming into effect. </p>
          <p eId="para_2030"> When these kinds of laws are changed, I know it can be difficult for smaller businesses. However, there is no excuse for one employee to be paid less than another based on their gender. Irrespective of how many employees an organisation has, that is not acceptable. It is not a case of a smaller employer having a difficult financial situation. It is never acceptable for a woman to be paid less than a man doing the same job. I do not believe there should be any sort of get-out and that is why we are proposing this amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_2031"> Regarding amendment No. 8, we strongly believe that the reference to organisations with 150 employees or more must be reduced to 50 in order that a full picture emerges of disparity and gender pay gaps. Regarding amendment No. 9, we believe that the third anniversary is too long before this legislation must be adhered to by businesses and that 18 months is sufficient for an organisation to put in place the necessary provisions to begin correlating these important data.</p>
          <p eId="para_2032"> I reiterate that we should not need to have legislation on gender and pay. People should already be able to ensure they are paying their employees fairly and it should not be based on gender. However, if we are to have legislation, it needs to be robust. It is important that there are no get-out clauses.</p>

          <p eId="para_2033">I support the amendment. The Minister outlined the significance of the Bill and the positive impact it will have on wage equality. Surely we want to ensure that it comes into effect as soon as possible. The Bill currently allows an employer with fewer than 250 employees two years to adhere to the regulations and an employer with fewer than 150 employees three years. We all expect an adjustment period; that is absolutely fine. However, these are excessive, especially given that the Bill was initiated more than two years ago and it will likely take some months before the regulations are made. Employers and the Department have known this is on the way. There is no need for such a prolonged lead-in. We should work towards greater equality as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_2034">I understand why the Deputy is trying to expand the reach of this legislation and the speed at which it will apply. However, it is important for the House to recognise the reasons it is designed in this way. The incremental application of the reporting requirement is deliberate and is based on consultations that were undertaken with both unions and employer representative groups. There was significant engagement across an 18-month period. There were written submissions, a symposium and then direct engagement with the employer and employee stakeholders. It was agreed to have the approach outlined here to allow smaller companies the time to learn from larger companies that have the capacity to undertake and publish the wage surveys already. Therefore, the regulations apply to those larger employers immediately and subsequently to smaller employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2035"> The Bill creates a significant new obligation for employers and it is important that they are supported in the implementation of this process. We want employers to recognise the gender pay gap in their organisations and take steps to address it. We believe it is counterproductive if employers are at risk of breaching their obligations simply if we try to accelerate the relevant timeframe. </p>
          <p eId="para_2036"> I also draw the Deputy's attention to amendment No. 16, which shortens the time period for the review of the legislation from what was originally five years to now four years. We will, I hope, have the opportunity to discuss that in more detail when we reach that amendment. That four-year period will give the opportunity for the first full cycle of reporting across this legislation. Many Bills these days contain a review-and-reporting clause and it is important for this legislation to have one.</p>
          <p eId="para_2037"> However, I think the five-year period was probably too long. We are doing something new and innovative here. It is important that we take the opportunity to review it to see if it is functioning effectively and delivering a significant improvement in the gender pay gap. That is why I propose to reduce that from five years to four years. At that point, we will have the opportunity for a wider consideration of the impact of the legislation as it has operated. I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_2051">I understand the Deputy's intent to ensure that the reporting requirement is as far-reaching as possible. However, it is important to note that no other specific class of employer, other than by reference to its size, is specifically referred to in the Bill. The Bill instead provides at section 2 for the insertion of a new section 20A into the Employment Equality Act 1998 and that under subsection 4(a) the regulations may prescribe the classes of employer to which the regulations apply. It is the intention that the regulations will apply to all classes of employer, including individual Departments and Government agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_2052"> Where a legal partnership or a multidisciplinary practice meets the size criteria to fall within the scope of any regulation, as an employer, it will fall within the scope of the regulations made. However - and I think this may be the intention of the Deputy's amendment - given that partners are not employees and they take a share of the employer's profits, which is not directly comparable with employees' pay, partners will not be included. They are not covered in the gender pay gap calculations under the legislation. Therefore, the Deputy's proposed amendment, even if it were accepted, would not remedy that. On that basis I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_2088"> Deputies may note that at (a) the definition states "a Department of State" rather than "a Minister of the Government" as provided for in section 10 of the Data Sharing and Governance Act. This move away from the precedent definition is to ensure that where a Minister has responsibility for one or more Departments, and we know quite a number of Ministers do nowadays, an individual report from each individual Department is required. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure Departments and agencies will meet the criteria for reporting under the Bill and will report individually. It is important we can use the individual report from each Department so we can more thoroughly and precisely identify where gender pay gaps exist. I seek the House's support for this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_2110">This amendment to section 3 of the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill provides, first, for the deletion of section 85B, second, for the amendment and renumbering of section 85C and, third, for the amendment and renumbering of 85D as drafted and the insertion of amended sections 85B and 85C into the principal Act. The original purpose of section 85B in the Bill was to provide for certain enforcement powers in respect of gender pay gap information through the appointment of designated enforcement officers. A policy decision has been taken not to proceed with the appointment of designated enforcement officer provisions due to the concerns about how this system would operate practically and indeed about whether having such a role is indeed necessary. The proposed amendment would first of all delete section 85B. The current section 85C provides for a power of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, to apply to the Circuit Court for an order requiring a person to comply with the regulations. A person who fails to comply with a Circuit Court order is in contempt of that court.</p>
          <p eId="para_2111"> The proposed amendments to section 3 to insert a new section 85B into the principal Act will enhance the enforcement powers of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission by providing a power to take an application to the Circuit Court or to the High Court. That is the additionality that is being added here where IHREC is being given the choice of proceeding either as it was with the Circuit Court or, indeed, now of making an application to the High Court. Again, these applications can be made where it has reasonable grounds for believing there has been a failure by a person to comply with the provisions of the Bill and to obtain an order requiring the person concerned to comply. In deciding whether it should go the route of the Circuit Court or the High Court, IHREC will have regard to the size of the company, the number of infringements, etc., and these will be the criteria it will use to determine which court it should take the proceedings in. By inserting the capacity to take these cases to the High Court, it elevates the seriousness of the legal case. The company in question, if the court makes an order, will now be held in contempt of the High Court as opposed to being held in contempt of the Circuit Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_2112"> The purpose of the current section 85D is to provide for an employee to make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission of non-compliance with reporting regulations by his or her employer. The proposed amendment changes the section number from 85D to 85C. In addition, subsection (4) of what was section 85D previously provided for an investigation to be carried out in private by the director general of the Workplace Relations Commission. The use of the text "in private" is at odds with the finding of the Supreme Court in the recent Zalewski judgment, which has implications for the procedures of the Workplace Relations Commission as to proceedings held in private. The new section 85C removes the subsection requiring an investigation to be held in private.</p>
          <p eId="para_2113"> In addition, subsection (7) provided for an appeal in the Labour Court to be heard in private unless, at the request of the complainant or respondent, the court determined to hold the appeal in public in full or so much of it as it did not consider to be treated as confidential. Again, in the amendment I am bringing forward this has been amended at subsection (6) to allow for an appeal to be held in public unless at the request of either party the court determines there are special circumstances to hold the appeal or part thereof otherwise than in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_2114"> The proposed amendment on the whole will strengthen the enforcement procedures for the gender pay gap reporting and ensure they are practical, effective and meet with the new interpretations following on from a recent Supreme Court decision. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_2115">I welcome this amendment and it is good to have the role of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission strengthened. That is welcome. I agree that by adding the High Court to the Circuit Court, it gives the legislation additional seriousness and a greater standing. I also welcome the inclusion of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. From my experience of working for a union, they are in general more worker-friendly forums as opposed to a court, although they may not have always seemed like that at times. It is important nonetheless to have the court there also as a sort of backup and, as the Minister said, to highlight the seriousness of the legislation. As a first step it is good for people to be able to deal with the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court. I welcome this amendment and will support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_2117">I move amendment No. 14:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2118">In page 8, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2119">“(2A) Failure to comply with an order granted by the Circuit Court by the person concerned would be a Category 4 offence subject to a class A fine.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_2120">I am withdrawing amendment No. 15 on the basis of the Government's amendment No. 13. Amendment No. 14 seeks to strengthen the provision for enforcement if a company does not comply with the legislation by inserting the following: "Failure to comply with an order granted by the Circuit Court by the person concerned would be a Category 4 offence subject to a class A fine."</p>

          <p eId="para_2121">I am of the view that the strengthening which we have just agreed to under amendment No. 13, by giving those extra powers to IHREC to take a case to the High Court, where IHREC believes the seriousness and the egregiousness, perhaps, of the breach of the legislation of these reporting provisions by a particular employer warrants going to the High Court and warrants that very significant sanction, both legally and from the point of view of publicity, in the form of a ruling of contempt of court by the High Court, is a significant enough enforcement power. As such, I am not inclined to accept the Deputy's amendment. This is a very significant additional power, that is, enforcement through not just the Circuit Court but also the High Court, that we are giving to IHREC, which we all recognise to be an independent body and the expert on human rights and equality provision in the country. It is best placed to make determinations on pursuing enforcement actions under this legislation. I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_2123">I move amendment No. 16:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2124">In page 10, line 15, to delete “5th anniversary” and substitute “4th anniversary”.</p>
          <p eId="para_2125">I was able earlier to refer briefly to this amendment. It reduces the time period within which a review and report of this legislation will be undertaken. It is set currently at five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_2126">I propose to reduce that to four years. We have to strike a balance here between vigorously reviewing new and innovative legislation to ascertain whether it is working and delivering on its stated purpose, which, in this case, is the taking of measures to reduce the gender pay gap but, at the same time, giving the legislation time to work and giving time for the processes to successfully change practice and culture among employers. By setting the review to take place before four years have elapsed, the full application of the Bill will have come all the way down to employers of 50 or more employees, which is the cap at which the legislation is set, and will give one year for that to take place. It is an amendment that will enable a future Government to examine the success of this legislation in a more compact time period, and I think that is appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_2127">Obviously, I always err on the side of wishing to see the review being carried out sooner than after four years. However, I welcome the fact that it has been reduced from five years to four years. That is a positive move.</p>
