B'ionann leithroinnt mhaoinithe phoiblí TG4 agus €37.2 milliún in 2020, leithroinnt a bhí comhdhéanta de €34.2 milliún i gcaiteachas reatha agus €3 milliún i gcaiteachas caipitil. Fuair m'oifigigh comhfhreagras ó TG4 ar 11 Meán Fómhair inar iarradh €1.9 milliún i maoiniú breise don bhliain 2020 i ndáil le costais bhreise a bhain le Covid. Aithním gur bliain thar a bheith dúshlánach a bhí inti do gach earnáil agus go raibh dúshláin ar leith i gceist le hiad i dtionscail na cruthaitheachta. Táthar ag lorg tuilleadh faisnéise ó TG4 maidir leis an iarratas ar mhaoiniú agus tá m'oifigigh i dteagmháil leis ina leith sin. Táim ag labhairt faoi seo mar Aire ar a bhfuil freagracht as na meáin, as an nGaeltacht agus as an gcultúr. Tuigim an obair atá déanta ag TG4 chun foinsí nuachta, oideachas agus faisnéis seirbhíse poiblí a chur ar fáil i rith na tréimhse seo. Tá an sceideal coinnithe ag TG4 mar atá agus tá sé curtha in oiriúint aige le freagairt ar riachtanais a lucht féachana in ainneoin gur bhain dúshláin léiriúcháin leis sin de bharr na srianta sláinte. Tá ról tábhachtach ag seirbhísí craoltóireachta a chuirtear ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge i straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge an Rialtais. Is ríthábhachtach atá TG4 ina leith sin. Tá ról tábhachtach aige i dtreo cultúr na Gaeilge agus an Ghaeilge í féin a chur faoi bhráid lucht féachana a bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Cuireann sé ábhar nuálach agus ábhartha ar fáil trína sheirbhísí teilifíse agus ar líne. Chomh maith leis sin, mar chraoltóir foilseacháin, cuireann sé tacaíocht thábhachtach ar fáil d'earnáil na cruthaitheachta in Éirinn. Chaith sé €23,000 in 2019 sa réimse sin. Tá na meáin Ghaeilge ag teacht laistigh de chúram an choimisiúin um thodhchaí na meán, coimisiún a d'fhógair mé féin agus an Taoiseach ar 29 Meán Fómhair chun féachaint ar an bhfís amach anseo do na meáin seirbhíse poiblí. Tá sé beartaithe agam chomh maith cruinniú a bheith agam le TG4 sna seachtainí amach romhainn. Táim ag súil leis an mbealach ina mbeidh sé ábalta leanúint ag fás agus tacú tuilleadh leis an nGaeilge a phlé leis.

Dar ndóigh, is bliain dhúshlánach í ní hamháin do TG4 ach do gach earnáil agus gach uile dhuine ar shlí amháin nó ar shlí eile. Sa chás seo, murab ionann is a lán comhlachtaí eile, níor bhain TG4 úsáid as aon cheann de na scéimeanna fóirdheontais a bhí ar fáil. Choimeád an comhlacht gach uile dhuine a bhí fostaithe aige ag obair agus choimisiúnaigh sé scannáin agus cláir atá le teacht. Choimeád sé a lán daoine nach raibh ag obair go díreach don chomhlacht ag obair chomh maith. Thug sé deontais dóibh. Choimeád an comhlacht a sceideal, agus sceideal "Cúla4 ar Scoil" ach go háirithe, ar siúl ar feadh na tréimhse uilig. Bhí gach duine ag maíomh as sin ach ní féidir leis an stáisiún leanúint ar aghaidh gan airgead.

Soláthraíonn an clár seo seirbhís chuimsitheach do scoileanna Gaeltachta agus Gaelscoileanna chun foghlaim i nGaeilge a éascú don lucht féachana. Clúdaíonn sé na príomhábhair: an Ghaeilge, matamaitic, stair agus tíreolaíocht. Bhí áthas orm a nótáil freisin go bhfuil an clár ag clúdach ranganna cruthaitheacha ar na healaíona, ar na healaíona traidisiúnta agus ar shláinte agus folláine. Mar gheall ar an mbeartas seo, bhí costas breise de €1.9 milliún le clúdach ag TG4 i mbliana. Tá iarratas á dhéanamh agam chun tacaíocht airgeadais a fháil i mbliana i leith na costais Covid seo. Mar is eol don Teachta, tá grá agam ar TG4 agus déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall chun gach tacaíocht a thabhairt dó, don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, táim ag súil le cruinniú a bheith agam le TG4 sna seachtainí atá romhainn.

Has the Minister had any discussions with the FAI to bring payments to the women’s international team in line with payments made to the men’s international team, given that several countries have brought these payments for appearance fees in line? Does the Minister support such a move?
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	10	The Government has dedicated funding for women's sport over many years with considerable Exchequer funding allocated to programmes aimed at encouraging women's active and social participation in sport. I would highlight in this regard the Sport Ireland women in sport programme established in 2005 which has provided funding for sport of more than €20 million to a broad range of programmes aimed at increasing participation of women and girls. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the Federation of Irish Sport 20X20 campaign. The Minister and I already have had discussions to support this initiative. We had a recent meeting with Mary O'Connor, CEO of the Federation of Irish Sport, who is very involved in this campaign. I am aware that sporting associations in several countries have decided to bring into line payments of their international men's and women's teams. This is a welcome if long overdue change. I encourage all our sporting bodies to consider this and more broadly the parity of treatment of international men and women's teams at senior and junior levels. In respect of the sporting body referred to by the Deputy, the national governing body of sport respects the autonomy of all the associations, competitions and selection of teams. Payments to international players is a matter for the association itself. We do not have a specific role in determining the level of payments for international teams selected by this or any other national governing body. It is important, however, to recognise that when members of the international team referred to by the Deputy highlighted the challenges in their remunerations and conditions, the issue was raised with the association on several occasions. In 2018, the then Minister provided additional funding to support the women's international team. In 2019, despite a number of challenges, the Department and Sport Ireland made arrangements to ensure the funding allocated to the women's international team was dispersed to it specifically and used to support its preparations for international fixtures. I thank the Deputy for highlighting this important issue. The Minister and I will be engaging with the FAI and the 20X20 campaign to ensure this is addressed. The programme for Government specifically highlights the importance of women's participation in sport. It will also be highlighted in the context of an international and national basis.

Last month, the English Football Association joined associations from Brazil, Australia, Norway and New Zealand in bringing the payments for appearance fees for their women's team in line with their men's team. Players on the Irish men's team get €2,500 as a basic appearance fee before any win bonus or other extras. Our women get €500, 20% of what the men get. The Department gives the FAI €800,000 a year. Will the Minister of State ensure that money comes with strict conditions for appearance fees? The book Champagne Football was released in recent weeks by Mark Tighe and Paul Rowan. Any person with a love of this sport has been shocked by what they have read in this book. Can the Minister of State imagine being a woman player at club or international level seeing millions of euro washing around the FAI while having to pay to play in the Champions League on behalf of her club? It is disgraceful.

The Deputy is correct in how the funding allocation occurred over many years. To be clear, we will engage seriously with the FAI and Sport Ireland on this. We have seen leadership across many other associations. The programme for Government is specific around targets. The national sports policy asks all national governing bodies to set gender diversity targets and to develop equality action plans. Support will be provided for dedicated leadership training programmes for women, including governance and technical training. Sport Ireland is monitoring the progress and reports on it annually. In the context of the overall women's programme from 2005 to date, €20 million has been invested through the national governing bodies and local sports partnerships. The recently published Irish sports monitor shows the gender gap in participation continues to decline from 4.5% at the end of 2017 to 3.4% in the 2019 report. The Deputy is correct in his summation and reflection on what is happening internationally. We should show leadership in an Irish footballing context. We will be seriously engaging with that. With the 2020 campaigns, we will meet broader equality targets in sport.

They have not shown solidarity with the women over the years. During the 2017 strike, they were noticeably absent through their silence in supporting their women colleagues who were fighting for basics such as tracksuits as well as pay and conditions. We have seen it in other sports with Andy Murray being a strong ally for equality of pay for women in tennis. We have not seen it in football, however. It is absolutely shameful. Footballers are publicly and laudably supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. If they can do that, they can also support gender equality in their own sport and do it vociferously. As a young schoolboy player, I paid my €2 sub. I knew if my dreams ever came true, all the gifts and allowances that come from being a professional footballer would befall on me as a man. There are women playing international football and the Champions League who are still paying their subs every week or month to play for their country or team. It just cannot go on.

It is probably one of the few sports which has shown real equality. I support that as well as those associations in football which are doing that. The promotion of women's participation in sport is a policy priority for the Government and includes women's football. There has been extraordinary participation in soccer by women and girls which I would love to see continue. It is important to recognise that the FAI and its staff have done excellent work to address the participation gap. There were challenging times in the past 18 months, but funding has been restored to FAI programmes, including those aimed at women and girls. In the context of the diversity and equality action plans, I would like to see much better equality and diversity on the boards of all of these national governing bodies. That is what Sport Ireland is trying to promote. We saw the Olympic Federation set a 40% target at its annual general meeting. It is a priority for us that we see funding prioritised and greater equality achieved at structural levels.

Many have since reopened but, unfortunately, the majority of businesses are operating with significantly reduced levels of turnover compared with 2019 as a result of the ongoing public health measures and the almost complete absence of overseas tourists coming into the country. This has meant that many jobs in the sector have been lost or remain vulnerable. Along with my colleagues in government, I have taken a number of measures to help the sector survive this crisis. The July stimulus package introduced significant measures to help businesses recover following the devastating impacts of the Covid-19 crisis. Some of the key measures for tourism and hospitality include the stay and spend initiative, the €26 million adaptation grant, the €10 million grant for coach tourism and the revised restart grant, which now includes bed and breakfast establishments. Tourism enterprises will also benefit from wider horizontal support, such as the new employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, liquidity and enterprise investment measures, warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension for a further three months of the waiver of commercial rates. As part of its response to Covid-19 and to drive bookings for short breaks and holidays in Ireland in 2020, Fáilte Ireland has invested in a number of domestic holiday campaigns since June of this year, and I have seen at first hand that these campaigns have been successful in getting Irish people to holiday at home. All of these measures have helped the sector, but I appreciate that severe challenges remain and there is justified deep concern in the sector. We need to continue to examine ways to ensure businesses survive and recover. The tourism recovery task force, appointed in May, has just submitted its report to me. It is making a number of recommendations to help the sector survive the crisis and recover. That will feed into the roadmap the Deputy refers to in her question. Along with my colleagues in government, I will consider its recommendations as we prepare for the budget and the subsequent national economic plan.

They are on their knees and they face into a long winter. The Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, has said that the weekly rate of new bookings has plummeted by 67% and it is looking at occupancy rates of 23% for October. It also estimates 100,000 jobs have been lost and a further 100,000 jobs are at risk, so it is massive. The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the EWSS are being cut, and the July stimulus package was a major disappointment for the industry and they made no bones about that. The stay and save initiative launched today is not going to cut it either. It is October and the Minister has missed out on the holiday period. Children are back at school and so on. The initiative also excludes so many people that it is not fit for purpose. How can the Minister call that a stimulus package?

I have had extensive engagement with people representing those working in the tourism and hospitality sector and will continue to do so. As the Deputy said, at the beginning of the year tourism supported 270,000 direct and indirect jobs. That is one in ten of all jobs. The IHF has estimated another 100,000 jobs are at risk. I am aware of the pressure they are under. On the stay and spend initiative, the purpose of that was to support the accommodation and food sector during the off-season, not during the peak season. That is what was flagged to us as what was needed. There was concern about the season between October and April. However, this is a fast-paced pandemic and we are in a different position now to July when we launched what was a very innovative scheme. The country was reopening then but now we are dealing with much harsher restrictions on already devastated sectors. Given that, it is natural to assess if the initiative is providing the full benefit that was planned in July.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	19	Can the Minister honestly say the stay and spend initiative is sufficient for what the sector needs? A whole section of society has been excluded from it and it is only those who can afford to go on a holiday that will benefit from it. A voucher scheme such as that proposed by my party, according to which every adult and every child in the State would have got €200, would been a real stimulus package. Given the pandemic, the restrictions and the lockdown, if a person's county is in lockdown between now and April, there is hardly an opportunity to break away and he or she is not going to be able to benefit from it. I sent a written question to the Minister and she referred to the tourism and recovery task force and the recovery plan that has been published. She said earlier she had seen it. She said in the written response to me that, if necessary, she will refine existing supports and consider further necessary measures. They need to be more than refined. There is a whole sector in hospitality and tourism in deep trouble and the first thing that needs to be done is the PUP needs to be restored and larger grants and initiatives introduced to sustain the sector. It is crying out for help.

One of the first things I did as a Minister, on day two, was to meet with the sector. On the stay and spend initiative, that is exactly what I said in my answer: it needs to be reassessed. I take that on board. That is why I am saying that in this Chamber. It is because of the fast-paced nature of this horrifying pandemic and how it is impacting on the sector. The tourism recovery task force report landed with me this week. I am reading that and will give it consideration. As the pandemic evolves, the Government will consider what are the best supports and measures which can be introduced to support businesses and employment. I will be discussing this with my Cabinet colleagues in the context of the budget and in my role as a member of the Cabinet committee on economic recovery. The people who represent that sector and other individuals I have spoken to know I voice that at Cabinet and will continue to do so. That means everything has to be considered. As far as I am concerned, everything is on the table in the context of the budget.

Measures introduced by the Government to date which have benefited the sports sector include the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, the PUP and a series of enterprise supports. There has been extensive engagement with the sports sector over recent months which has highlighted the significant adverse impact of Covid-19 on all levels of the Irish sporting landscape. The Covid-19 sports management group, chaired at a ministerial level, has been established to engage directly which the sporting bodies. An expert group on the return to sport, chaired by an official of my Department, is also being established to provide advice and guidance to sporting bodies. Sport Ireland is also engaging directly which the sporting bodies on an ongoing basis. A funding package of up to €70 million has been put in place to support the sector and the package will be administered by Sport Ireland. There will be funding of up to €40 million for the three main organisations: the FAI, to which the League of Ireland pertains, the GAA, and the IRFU. There will be a resilience fund of up to €10 million to support the national governing bodies of sport, as well as a sports club resilience fund and up to €15 million in support for clubs, and a sports restart and renewal fund. The funding will be invested through new grant schemes with Sport Ireland. The closing date for applications under the Covid-19 grant schemes was 14 September and a large number of applications were received. There are four strands of funding. I know how valuable and important the League of Ireland is as a competition in our local communities. It plays a central part in the lives of many club supporters and we are lucky to have such a great league. In that regard, Sport Ireland is engaging directly with the national governing body and through the FAI on the allocation of Covid-19 funding for its affiliated clubs. In recent contact with the sports sector, we made clear that the financial and operational challenges associated with Covid-19 will continue into 2021. Any additional funding for sport in 2021 is subject to the budgetary process which is under way, but we want to see sport funded and supported. It is a key part of our community and that includes the League of Ireland.

I have spoken to Shelbourne and Bohemians, which are in my constituency, and to clubs throughout Dublin. They have told me that they have asked for a financial package of approximately €5 million which will keep them afloat into 2021 and ensure that they can keep their staff on so they do not need to avail of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP. Every club has approximately ten staff members so a PUP for each employee would stretch into the millions if the payment is available for another year. The clubs are asking for €3.5 million to €5 million. Can we commit that amount to the League of Ireland to ensure it continues into 2021?
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	24	As I referenced, the stimulus package provides a significant amount of support for the FAI. The association, through Sport Ireland, will fund the League of Ireland and many other sporting competitions. The chief executive officer of the FAI, at a meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, indicated that €3.5 million is required to stage the League of Ireland. Funding provided to the FAI by Sport Ireland is for the non-professional elements of the sport and is broadly aimed at encouraging and creating more opportunities for young people to participate in football. I also referenced the €40 million package and the resilience fund of up to €10 million. We have a sports club resilience fund of more than €15 million. I will engage further with League of Ireland clubs through the FAI and with Sport Ireland. We cannot have a scenario where there is a question mark over our league. That also applies to many other leagues across the sporting landscape in the next year. Sport will have significant funding challenges in 2021 but it is an important part of our communities and we will have ongoing engagement with the sector about its funding. The financial packages that have been put in place and will be filtered out through Sport Ireland demonstrate that the Government has supported sport.

The FAI was quite clear that it has applied for a grant but there is no guarantee it will get it and allow that money to filter down to the League of Ireland. This is a time sensitive matter. Most clubs would usually sell season tickets in December or January and if they are not sold, clubs will not be able to reopen their doors. People use clubs for a variety of reasons and some go to their clubs just to have a cup of tea and engage with their community. This needs urgency. I am asking specifically about the League of Ireland. We will talk about other sports on other days. I implore the Minister of State not only to commit to meeting and engaging with the League of Ireland but to funding that will give confidence to those clubs to start planning for 2021.

As I said, a significant funding package has been put in place which will be allocated and distributed over the month of October. That is €40 million for the three major sporting bodies. Decisions about how that money is specifically allocated by those sporting organisations is a matter for them but the Minister and I are keen to support the League of Ireland and ensure its continuity. We cannot have a scenario where there is a question mark over it. There will obviously be funding challenges for all sports next year. We are engaging with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform around the whole sporting budget because the reduced numbers of participation are directly impacting the budgetary position of clubs across all sports that require ticket sales for their underlying finances. The League of Ireland is a key, grassroots league that is important for Irish soccer and I support it. We will ensure that there is certainty around it through the packages we have already announced and future packages.

The programme for Government calls for a report within nine months on the measures that need to be taken to ensure there is a vibrant, independent public service media for the next generation. It notes that the current funding model for public service broadcasting is inefficient and the commission will publish recommendations. The commission is being established by the Department of the Taoiseach in liaison with my Department, and the terms of reference and membership were approved by the Government on 29 September. The goal of the independent commission is to identify what the Irish experience has been in delivering the above aims through public service broadcasters, or broadcasters, print and online media at a local, regional and national levels, and the challenges created for these media by new global platforms and change in audience preference for the delivery of content. It will consider the extent to which the current models of delivery are appropriate for the next ten years and review the best practice in other comparable jurisdictions, particularly across the European economic area, in terms of providing future-proofed models for meeting the above public services in light of changing audience expectations, in particular the preferences and behaviours of younger audiences. Within this context, the commission will examine how these aims can be delivered in a way that is sustainable, give greater security of funding, ensure independent editorial oversight and deliver value for money to the public. It will also make recommendations on RTÉ's role, financing and structure within this framework. It is expected that the commission will engage in a wide-ranging consultation with all relevant stakeholders and sectors to ensure that all relevant perspectives are considered in its work.  In light of its remit, I expect that the licence fee will be among the issues examined by the commission. I believe it is important to allow the commission the time and space to undertake its work and any recommendations made about the funding model and licence fee will be considered by the Government. In the meantime, An Post, which acts as my issuing agent for licence fee collection, will continue to sell television licences and free licences will continue to be issued by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to qualifying applicants under the household benefit scheme.

RTÉ and TG4 have significant funding gaps, to the tune of €30 million and €4 million, respectively. I am sure that the loss of advertising revenue during the Covid-19 period has made the situation worse. It is also important to note the importance of TG4 as a public service broadcaster. I hope that the work of the commission will support it to grow and continue to produce excellent programming, as well as provide vital jobs in Gaeltacht areas and the television production sector. I know that RTÉ was given €10 million in additional funding last year but it is still well short of the €30 million deficit. The licence fee needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, as has been flagged up by all sectors.

I made sure to have someone on the commission who is fluent in Irish and works in the sector. I recognise the work TG4 has done in providing an important source of news, education and public service information during this time, maintaining and adapting its schedule to respond to its audience needs despite the production challenge posed by the health restrictions. The delivery of broadcasting services through the medium of Irish plays a vital role in the implementation of the Government's 20-year strategy for the Irish language and TG4 has been essential in that regard. TG4 plays an important role in bringing Irish language and culture to Irish-speaking audiences, providing innovative and relevant content through television and its online services. In addition, as a publisher and broadcaster, it also provides valuable support to the Irish creative sector, spending €23 million in 2019. I look forward to the recommendations of the commission in this regard. As the Deputy said, there is a need to support quality journalism and media now more than ever. I am committed to doing so and that includes RTÉ but I do not want to pre-empt the work of the commission.

My question relates to the urgent matter of the licence fee. The wide remit of the commission is welcome and we need to examine all aspects of the media. I also hope to see print journalists appointed to the commission; they have been omitted so far. The real issue concerning all the areas that have been flagged is the need to address the licence fee.

As I said, the licence fee will be discussed in the context of the commission. I do not want to interfere with the work of the commission.I am aware that evasion is currently estimated to be at 12.57% even though An Post makes every effort to bring the evaders into the licence pool with reminder notifications and inspections. There is also an increasing number of homes, approximately 11%, which have televisions and do not pay a fee.  I cannot pre-empt the work of a commission, the members of which will serve really well. The NUJ has written to me and sent me its report, which I will bring to the attention of the chair of the future of media commission. As I said, there will be extensive engagement with all stakeholders. The print sector was added to the commission as an acknowledgement by the Government that it is at risk. We have to acknowledge that and see how best to provide a road forward for it.

This is having a significant effect on the arts, entertainment events, tourism and sport. What long-term plans are there to support these sectors? I can understand that during the early phases of the pandemic there was emergency planning, but we need a long-term plan for the tourism, sport, arts, culture and events sectors.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	34	The tourism, arts, culture and sport are integral parts of the fabric of society, supporting economic activity and physical and societal well-being. The public facing and audience driven nature of those sectors means that each time there is an escalation for any county in the level applicable under the living with Covid plan those sectors will be hardest hit. The Government is acutely aware of these challenges. The need for important public health measures, such as social distancing, has placed necessary limits on gatherings to protect public health. This has had a devastating impact, which the Government and I, as Minister with responsibility for tourism, culture, arts, the Gaeltacht, sports and media, have sought to address in a range of ways. Some key measures have been introduced to help support the tourism, arts, culture and sports sectors, including an additional €25 million for the Arts Council, a €5 million live events pilot grant scheme, €5 million to support national cultural institutions and nationwide arts infrastructure, the stay and spend tax credit initiative, a €26 million adaptation grant for the tourism sector, a €10 million grant for coach tourism, €40 million for the three main field sport its bodies, the GAA, IRFU and FAI, and a €15 million resilience fund for sports governance bodies and clubs.  The universal income support of PUP and the wage subsidy scheme have been key to supporting sectors through this crisis and the extension of these schemes has provided certainty for the coming months. My officials and I are in regular contact with stakeholders and representatives in all of the sectors for which I have responsibility. I have established a number of sector specific task forces. I have considered the views and recommendations of these task forces in the context of budget 2021 and the development of the national economic plan, and will review and refine existing support as required. I intend to continue this collaborative process with stakeholders in order to ensure the sectors remain viable and resilient as we continue to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.

While we wait for the report, nothing happens. This is an urgent issue. The budget is only a few weeks away. Can the Minister confirm that some certainty will be brought to this wide range of sectors in the budget? Will provision be made, not just for a month or two but in the medium term, to ensure the survival of these vital parts of our society?  Anybody who owns a tourism business will tell us that international tourism has already been wiped out for 2021 because there is no certainty about how people can enter the country. There are no bookings. The new tax break that was introduced has now collapsed because under the new restrictions people are cancelling or are not making bookings. Nobody is availing of the scheme, other than those who can go to a local restaurant if it is open. At the moment, nobody is doing that even in places that have not been locked down. What has been done is okay, but we need a much bigger long-term plan.

That is why I feel task forces are key to this. My engagement with people across my Department brief has shown me that they want to have a say. The arts task force, chaired by Claire Duignan, met for the first time last week and is due to report on 31 October which is obviously post budget. That is why in the first meeting I attended last week I asked it to give me its key priorities before the budget so that I can use that information to feed into my negotiations. On the tourism recovery task force, that landed on my desk this week and it is key in the budget negotiations. The Government is fully aware that, given the social nature of such gatherings, tourism, arts, and culture were the sectors first affected by the pandemic and may be the last to return to normal. We must find a way to get our performers singing again and help them. Our pilot €5 million live performance support scheme assists that and has worked really well.

I regret that it was not done in time for her to receive all the task force reports not just a week or two before the budget but well in advance of it. Better late than never. I still wish to stress the fact that we are getting stopgaps, pilot schemes and so on. We need some medium-term planning and certainty for all of sectors, including sports, events, and the arts. Some are largely State funded and have funds in the kitty. Some are totally commercial and are facing catastrophic situations. I look forward with interest to the budget. I hope it delivers. We do not need sticking plasters. The budget needs to deliver medium-term planning and the finance to back that up. Can the Minister assure me that will happen?

Waiting for the task force report does not preclude us from taking immediate measures. For example, the live performance scheme involved an allocation of €5 million. My Department developed the conditions of the scheme in consultation with the sector, with particular assistance from EPIC. The initial closing date was 24 August and by that date more than 100 applications had been received, requesting funding of over €15 million. The main objective of the scheme is the provision of employment for artists, creative technicians and their support. That is just one element. The task forces will also feed into the national economic plan which will come after the budget, and will in turn feed into a long-term plan. The July stimulus package was part one, and we will then have the budget and the national economic plan. Ongoing consultation and engagement is key to how we get that roadmap in place and identify the supports that are needed so that they can feed into the negotiations.

The local authority swimming pool programme, LASPP, provided grant aid towards the capital cost of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. To date, 52 pools have been completed and three swimming pool projects remain in the LASPP.  Exchequer support for any new swimming pool is now being provided by the large scale sports infrastructure fund, LSSIF. It was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects, including swimming pools, with at least €100 million being made available over the period to 2027. Provisional allocations totalling €77.4 million for 25 projects under stream 2 of the LSSIF were announced on 10 January 2020. On 13 January additional provisional allocations of €5 million for a further seven projects under stream 1 were announced.Of these 32 projects, eight swimming pool projects have been awarded funding. The evaluation procedures and guidelines of this scheme provide that once provisional allocations are announced, the successful projects will undergo a further process of due diligence. This includes a further review of projects including economic appraisals and feasibility studies. This work is continuing and a priority in the short term is to advance the projects allocated funding in January. There is no process for applications in the current scheme at present. It is planned, however, to review progress of existing grants in 2021. That will decide whether we open the LSSIF in 2021 to include applications for a swimming pool, which I am sure the Deputy will be pursuing at that point in time. The decisions that are made after the review has taken place will dictate whether it is open in 2021.

I am sure she will be doing so behind the scenes with her officials. The programme for Government rightly highlights the importance of sporting activities for people of all ages. Swimming is a unique sport because it allows essentially everybody to participate. It is the most inclusive sport that there is in many respects because people can do it as part of competition or leisure, on their own or with family. The problem is that they cannot do it if there is no swimming pool. Carrickmacross is one of many towns with younger populations that have been growing in recent years. We need to see a commitment from the Government. The difficulty with the response read out by the Minister of State is that it is the exact same as the response to a parliamentary question in this House in March. It appears that there is not the urgency or the reflection just yet to press this on. Will the Minister of State ensure that any review that takes place happens quickly, and that we see some movement in this respect as quickly as possible?

When I was in primary school, which was neither today nor yesterday, I used to buy raffle tickets in the hope that we would have a swimming pool in Carrickmacross by my time in secondary school. It was Dave Phelan who championed it when I was in my secondary school days. I will keep an eye on this development. I will allow Minister of State continue now.

This is a serious issue. Many funding allocations were made at the start of this year under the LSSIF and they are being fed through. We are committed to reviewing progress in 2021 with a view to potentially reopening for applications to include swimming pool projects like that in Carrickmacross, as referred to by the Deputy. We want to reconvene the sports leadership group and we will do that this month. As the Deputy has said, the programme for Government places a key emphasis on participation. The swimming pools in all of our local areas are a very important pillar of participation in that they are available to everybody. The Deputy has also referred to the importance of local authorities in this regard. We have a member of local government on the sports leadership group. When the group is reconvened, there will be discussions on whether the application process will reopen next year, pending the review I have mentioned.

In his final remarks, can he deal with the resistance to these types of projects from local authority officials, which is an issue that has become more prevalent? I am most aware of the case of Carrickmacross, where local elected members are united in their determination to see this project delivered. As the Minister, has rightly said, the local community has been campaigning and fundraising for a swimming pool for several decades. Every time something has been asked of the people of Carrickmacross, they have delivered. The difficulty is that many officials within the executive of the local authority are afraid that such a project, if it were to be developed, would end up becoming a drain on the local authority. Projects of this scale cannot always make a profit. It is important that the Department does not decide that this project needs to be cost-neutral. Sometimes the cost-benefit of a project does not come in euros through the door but from its societal benefit, from how it increases the attractiveness of a town for new families to move to and stay, and from the avenue it provides for young and old within the town. Can the Minister of State comment on the long-term sustainability of these projects when, hopefully, they are delivered?
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	45	We recognised the importance of swimming pools in the July stimulus. Some €2.5 million was announced to support them, to continue their operation throughout the pandemic and to provide increased capacity for such facilities. The programme for Government and the national sports policy refer specifically to the importance of facilities that are run by local authorities. The reason we have the LSSIF can be seen when one looks at this year's funding allocations. Some €4.7 million has been allocated for swimming pools specifically, with a further €4.1 million in 2021 and a projected €3.9 million in 2022. As I have said, that will be subject to review next year with a view to potentially reopening applications. We want to support local authority swimming pools. As a former member of a local authority, I acknowledge the Deputy's point that there can be disagreement between the executive and elected members. The elected Members here, along with the personnel in the Department, recognise the importance of swimming pools in local communities and the broad participation they ensure for people who want to swim. There is also a safety aspect to this because we want to ensure we have enough people across our country who can swim. To that end, it is important that local communities have access to swimming pools. We are trying to support these projects on an operational basis and to support the provision and allocation of greater capital injection towards swimming pools. We note the Deputy's serious commitment to Carrickmacross. I know that the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has a particular interest there as well.

Over 12,000 projects have benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocation since that time to close to €1 billion. The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland, with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country. The programme for Government commits to continuing the sports capital programme and prioritising the investment in disadvantaged areas. The most recent round of sports capital grants in 2018 attracted a record 2,337 applications. Allocations were announced in January, May and November of last year, with a total of over €56 million awarded to 1,648 different projects. All unsuccessful applications were given the opportunity to appeal the Department’s decision. On the capital grants announced in November, a total of 122 appeals were submitted by the December deadline. The review of these appeals was completed in April with six new allocations approved. The priority in the short to medium term is to advance all of these projects to ensure the facilities are available for use and the relevant grants are drawn down. In this regard, work has been ongoing to advance previously allocated grants, with over €20 million paid out to 800 different sports clubs and groups so far this year. To deal with the Deputy’s specific question on future rounds of the programme, a full review of the 2018 round of the sports capital programme has now been completed. The terms and conditions of the next round of the programme are being finalised based on the recommendations of the review. I expect that to open shortly. We are committed to a sports capital programme opening for applications over the coming period. The review has been completed and we are finalising the process and application criteria. There is a commitment to do that. The programme for Government is strong on the sports capital projects and their importance for all our local communities.

I agree that the sports capital grants scheme transforms participation in sporting clubs across the country. Due to the gap in 2019, clubs are in severe need of funding to rejuvenate their facilities. As they have no or very limited fundraising capacity but still have ongoing expenses, the clubs greatly need this injection. In the context of pay equality and the 20x20 campaign, will the Minister of State consider weighting the sports capital grant allocation to ensure there will be greater support for female participation? That is something he might consider.

The review, which is being concluded, is examining many criteria around the previous plan. That will be updated in the next round but I take the Deputy's point on that. The programme for Government states that we will prioritise sports capital investment in areas of historic low levels of participation and deprivation. Where there is a participation gap on a gender basis that is an important pillar for all of us who want to fund sport. We need to see any gap in participation addressed. Preparations are well advanced for the next round of the programme, with testing of the IT system in the new Department under way. On the guide to making an application, the terms and conditions of the programme are being finalised and will be submitted shortly. We are hopeful that the applications will open in the coming period. There will be the usual deadline and engagement around workshops with different clubs across the country but we are anxious to support sport. There is an important stimulus element of this in terms of the capital injection we provide for communities. I hope that provides an update on it.

The sports capital programme, and its continuity, is committed to in the programme for Government. We are engaged in budgetary discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and we will be able to provide full details on next year in the aftermath of the budgetary process. We are anxious to see sport, and investment in sport, continue. That is specifically referenced in the programme for Government. I am aware there were previous occasions where there were large gaps between previous allocations and a new grant scheme and we have to continue to roll it over to support projects. Not every club is ready to apply right now and might not have everything ready for now. We have to give hope to communities that there will be future programmes and that is what we are anxious to do in the context of the budgetary process.

This is a cross-Government approach to managing the pandemic for the coming months. This plan sets out how the balance between public health, economic and social aspects of living with Covid-19 will operate in the short to medium term. Most of the country is now at level 2, which is based on a medium-term approach to managing risk. At all times the priority will be to keep our schools open, while keeping people safe and protecting the resilience of our economy and communities. I am very aware of the impact of the pandemic on those working in the commercial events sector, not just in terms of performers but also the crews and the wide range of people it takes to put on a drama or a music performance. I have met the Events Industry Alliance and my Department is in regular contact with the representative groups. The Deputy approached me informally to make sure there was a member of the events industry on the task force. In response to the Deputy's informal request, I have put two on the task force to make sure their voices are heard. The arts and culture sectors have been severely impacted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic; cultural venues and events were among the first to be closed in the country and they will be among the last to recover. The Arts Council is the statutory body charged with supporting and developing the arts in Ireland and has received an additional €25 million in funding in 2020. Among the measures being introduced are new and additional bursaries and commissions from the Arts Council, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis. The jobs stimulus package has specifically provided a wide range of supports across the culture and audio visual sectors. These include the €10 million pilot performance and production support package to support the live performance and the audiovisual production sector as well as a new €10 million culture fund. The recently appointed task force will prepare a report including a set of recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. With the upcoming budget and the development of the national economic plan, the Government will review and refine existing supports. The programme for Government states that that task force must feed into the national economic plan but as I said earlier, I have also asked them to give me a report outlining their key priorities ahead of the budget so that I am not waiting until 31 October. It is to ensure I get their key priorities before the budget. On 31 October, after the budget, that task force will feed into the national economic plan when they present the report.

Even since then, however, the situation has deteriorated. With more severe restrictions being imposed in Dublin, and possibly elsewhere, it is a very grim picture that is facing the events, music and arts industry. Frankly, if we compare the additional supports that have been provided with the position in New Zealand, it has given massive support to sustain these people compared to what we are giving them. We will need those music and arts people and so on in the grim period ahead we are facing, and we will need them to be around when we finally get out of this dire situation. They have made clear their demands. Critically, it is the maintenance of the PUP but for people to be allowed to take bits of work on top of that without losing their income, additional supports to cover their ongoing costs such as grants and so on and, where events can happen but on reduced capacity, that subsidies would be provided to ensure those things can happen.

I realise the situation has deteriorated. I am also very conscious of the unprecedented nature of the challenges facing live performers, promoters and producers, not least from a financial point of view. I recently announced a new fund that will assist established commercial venues and promoters to employ performers, artists, technicians and creative and performance support staff up to the end of 2020 in anticipation of the return of audiences to live performance. An allocation of €5 million has been made under the live performance support scheme. That was a pilot scheme, which is why the amount is €5 million. It is looking at the applications and the number of applications seen helps and informs me in my negotiations on the budget because I can see how well that has been responded to. My officials engaged with the sector in designing that specific scheme because it helps de-risk the cost of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector, allow commercial organisers of live performance to commence preparations immediately and for productions to go ahead in the near future, while also complying with the protection measures. My focus is on getting these people performing again and getting technicians working again because, without them, we will not have any performances.

With the cuts in the PUP, the retrograde decision to allow the banks end the waiver on mortgage repayments and so on, the financial pressure on the 35,000 people working in this sector will become unbearable. They then have the ongoing costs of repayments, insurance and warehousing; we can go through the list of costs. There will not be a sector unless there is a dramatic improvement in supports. Many of these people will not be able to pay their bills so the PUP issue is critical.That has to be addressed. Equally, the ongoing costs must be covered and grants must be made available to sustain this industry through what is a very uncertain and indefinite period of shutdown, or near shutdown. It is a life-and-death matter for the 35,000 people affected and many more who are affected indirectly.

I understand these supports are needed now more than ever to support artists in their long-awaited return to work. I have raised these matters with my Cabinet colleagues in the context of budget 2021, recognising that there will be an extended period in which we will have to live with the virus. I am aware of the difficulties this will raise, especially in the sectors in question. My focus is firmly on the survival, sustainability and recovery of this vital industry. As the Deputy stated, there are 35,000 workers, but they bring €3.5 billion to the economy. As the Taoiseach said at the Dáil on Tuesday, the Government is considering sector-specific supports to protect the livelihoods of as many people as possible. In the face of this pandemic, we have to be creative and innovative, and we have to think outside the box to support as many as possible. All suggestions should be considered and all should remain on the table. All schemes will be kept under review and no decision will be finalised until budget day.

#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	60	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 18 together. I am acutely aware of the difficulties and challenges faced by sports organisations, particularly regarding the rules on spectators. Measures introduced by the Government to date that have benefited the sports sector include the temporary wage subsidy scheme. There has been extensive engagement with the sports sector over recent months, and this has highlighted the significant adverse impact of Covid-19 at all levels of the Irish sporting landscape. A Covid-19 sports management group, chaired at ministerial level, has been established to engage directly with the sports bodies. An expert group on the return to sport, chaired by an official in my Department, has been established to provide advice and guidance to sports bodies. Sport Ireland is engaging directly with sports bodies on an ongoing basis. A funding package of €70 million has been put in place to support the sector. The funding package, which will be administered by Sport Ireland, includes funding of up to €40 million for the three main fields sport organisations, namely, the FAI, GAA and IRFU; a resilience fund of up to €10 million to support the national governing bodies of sport; a sports club resilience fund of up to €15 million to support clubs; and a sports restart and renewal fund of up to €5 million. The funding will be invested by way of new grant schemes through Sport Ireland's recognised public partners, including the national governing bodies of sport, the local sports partnerships and other funded sports organisations. The closing date for applications to Sport Ireland under the Covid-19 grant scheme was 14 September. I understand a large number of applications was received. Thirty-nine national governing bodies applied on their own behalf and on behalf of their member clubs. Sport Ireland is currently processing and validating their applications. There is significant interest in each of the four strands of funding. The process will be complete by the end of October. An announcement of all allocations will be made at that time. In addition to this funding, I announced a special fund of €2.5 million for the July stimulus scheme to support swimming pools and their operation. This funding will also be administered by Sport Ireland. The Deputy will note the €15 million support for the GAA, the Camogie Association and ladies' football. That is in direct recognition of the shortfall that will arise from the reduced number of spectators at all the games. We want to ensure our all-Ireland competitions across the three codes happen this year. The reduction in spectators in stadiums and at local clubs and pitches has a direct impact on sport, and that is why we are providing the stimulus funding and buffer for all the organisations this year and why we are engaging in the budgetary process for next year. While Covid stays with us, we want to ensure sport is supported by the Government in the context of participation and continuing competition. That is why we have provided such a wide range of supports. Sports have been referred to specifically in the context of the resilience roadmap and plan. In this regard, when the pandemic worsens or improves there will be certainty for clubs and sports organisations regarding how they can plan for their matches and the impact this will have on funding.
#PaDaly	unknown-#PaDaly-party	unknown-#PaDaly-dob	unknown-#PaDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	61	The impact of the pandemic on finances is quite pronounced. When representatives of the IRFU were before the Covid committee, they said 80% of their organisation's revenue is generated by the senior men's team. It is now down €30 million. The FAI, which is already in a difficult position, is down €14 million, and League of Ireland clubs fear for their future. Just today, it was reported that Leinster Rugby is €18 million down. It needs spectators and it needs to get them back safely. It needs funding for alterations. Even though these organisations are experts in managing large numbers, their staff and volunteers may need extra training. Fans are returning in some other countries, as the Minister of State probably knows. It was interesting that the Minister of State mentioned the return to sport. The GAA told us 600,000 people returned to play Gaelic games and there was not a Covid case as a result. Thousands of children returned to Cúl Camps and there was not a case as a result.

As the Deputy knows, the resilience roadmap tries to ensure that people participate in sport and are physically active. We must also consider the mental well-being of all our population, including young people, and that is why sport is being properly and directly funded by the Government in the context of the stimulus package and funding I have mentioned. I had a meeting with the IRFU this week and I acknowledged the funding difficulties it and many other sports organisations will have next year. That is why we have an expert group on sport and a sports leadership group working directly with the organisations. In light of the roadmap, the group has plans to map out the mitigation of risk while potentially ensuring the return of some spectators to the larger stadiums. That is referenced across the levels in the roadmap. We are trying to proceed in a safe way, and we have ongoing engagement with all the sports organisations to meet their challenges.
#PaDaly	unknown-#PaDaly-party	unknown-#PaDaly-dob	unknown-#PaDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	63	Given the return to sport and what the Minister of State said about the mental health of returning spectators and participants, and given what he said about being supported by the Government, what does he think about introducing the 1 m rule in stadiums? In Germany, for example, a capacity rate of 20% has already been introduced. There are no away fans and no alcohol and it depends on the seven-day infection rate in the relevant city. There were 10,000 at a game recently in Dresden and 20,000 at a game in Budapest. There are some National League games coming up. Would the Government consider allowing the GAA to self-regulate, as it does in the Six Counties, and nominate a different number of spectators per ground to give it some flexibility? There could be oversight by a fire officer, for example, allowing for a higher percentage. Given what the Minister of State said about mental health and the importance of getting spectators back into stadiums, and acknowledging, as we must, the expert capacity of the GAA and other sports bodies to deal with large crowds, I ask the Minister of State to address this, particularly in respect of the GAA's upcoming National League games.

I understand that the expert group on the return to sport is considering comprehensive proposals in that regard. As Ministers, we do not make the decision regarding the 1 m or 0.5 m rule, we have to take the advice from public health experts and experts around event management on how we mitigate risk across the events sector be that in sport or in other areas. What we want to do over the next six to nine months is, as referenced in the resilience roadmap, ensure the safe return of spectators, particularly to larger venues. There is flexibility within the resilience roadmap for the return of spectators to larger stadia. We have not set a number on those larger stadia. The expert group, with the sporting organisations, has the authority to develop specific spectator attendances.

The €5 million announced in the July stimulus for 35,000 people is a pittance. The Minister says this is just a pilot, but a pilot is not good enough for the dire situation that faces those 35,000 people. The Minister will know that the EPIC working group, The Events Industry Alliance, the National Campaign for the Arts and the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, representing musicians and so on, are looking for a hell of a lot more. What they want to know is what the Minister is recommending to the Government in advance of the budget to ensure that happens and that they can survive?

I am pleased to inform Deputies Boyd Barrett and Brendan Smith that earlier this month I launched a number of new music and performance schemes, totalling €6 million, to aid employment in the creative industries. The music stimulus package involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country and traditional folk. Under this package, a fund of €1 million has been put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources, including live event fees. These schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases. The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and insure their work in the context of Covid restrictions. The music stimulus package schemes are being managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.  Under the live performance supports pilot scheme, a further allocation of €5 million is being made available, which aims to assist commercial venues, producers, promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in creative industries. My Department developed the conditions of this scheme in consultation with the sector, with particular assistance from EPIC. By the initial closing date, more than 100 applications had been received, requesting funding of over €15 million. That is why it is a pilot scheme. We will engage with the stakeholders to see what would work best before we consider anything further. The Deputy will be aware that I cannot have the negotiations for the budget on the floor of the House and that that is work I will be doing with my Cabinet colleagues.  Deputies Boyd Barrett and Brendan Smith will also be aware that I recently appointed the arts and culture recovery task force, which is being chaired by Clare Duignan. The membership of that task force includes representatives from the Events Industry Alliance. Taken as a starting point, the research and evidence of the devastating impact of the pandemic on the sector compiled by the Department, the Arts Council and other stakeholders, the task force will prepare a report setting out recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the pandemic.  The sector includes culture, the arts, the audio-visual industry and the live entertainment industry. The task force has already met twice. Its proceedings will be conducted in a transparent manner and all correspondence will be published in due course. I will consider the findings of the task force, as well as the experience of new schemes which were launched last month, in framing any further responses to the crisis.

The Minister might not give me the exact figures that she is recommending in the negotiations but in New Zealand, the package for arts, music and live entertainment is €175 million. This dwarfs what is being given to, let us remember, a live music and events sector that has never received a cent from Government, and never asked for it, and an arts sector which is one of the most poorly funded in western Europe. We have taken our arts workers, musicians, crew and live entertainment people for granted. We now realise, or should realise, how badly we need these people and how much they contribute to our mental well-being, our welfare and our future in these grim times. The additional money that has been put forward is really a pittance when divided among the 35,000 people who work in music, live entertainment, the arts and so on. It is not enough. We need much more.

The Minister also said that this was the first sector to close. We know it is facing unprecedented and ongoing challenges and given all the medical evidence those challenges and difficulties will be with us for some time. As stated by Deputy Boyd Barrett, we do not want to lose this sector or the professionals involved in it who are across many different trades, professions and disciplines. We need a comprehensive package in the budget to assist live performers, producers, artists, musicians and others. When assistance and a programme is being put in place it is important that emerging talent and small bands are recognised as well. We are all aware that we need the emerging talent and they may not be very well organised. In many instances, they bring our music, song and dance to other continents. They are great ambassadors for our country. In any scheme of assistance, which is needed for the entire sector and for all disciplines within the sector, it is important that emerging and new talent is recognised as well and given adequate assistance.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	71	Both Deputies will be aware that it is not possible to anticipate the budget. I am very familiar with the pre-budget submissions of the Events Industry Alliance and everyone involved in this sector. I acknowledge the Deputies' interest in these matters and I can assure them that I will be doing my best for the sector in the budget and subsequently. For information, the total funding for the arts in Ireland this year is €338 million. That has increased by more than 30% this year. I would never have suggested - this is the reason I continually emphasise the word "pilot" - that €5 million was enough. It is a start. I come from this background myself. There are many Deputies here who have family or friends in this sector. I am acutely aware of not just the needs and livelihoods of the performers who are front and centre stage but those who enable to go on stage.  On the international comparison, I know some people look to approaches taken in other countries but it can be very difficult to make those comparisons. Population differences mean that supports are not directly comparable. We need to focus on what is in Ireland. For example, in the UK there is a very large commercial theatre sector that does not exist here to the same extent. We need to focus on the measures that are needed here. My focus will be on the report of the task force, which will consult widely to develop a clear approach which, in turn, will inform not only the budget but the national economic plan.

At the best of times many people who worked in the arts were in borderline poverty situations. Cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment and the employment wage subsidy scheme will, potentially, drive thousands of people into poverty. Without sufficient grants to cover insurance costs, warehouse costs, debt repayments and other ongoing payments, people are going to go under and they are going to go under soon. Historically, we have undervalued, in terms of the support provided by Government, the arts, music and live entertainment sectors, although we trade internationally on their reputation and they contribute so much to our society. They are the glue that makes us a culture and a society.There must be a seismic shift in the mentality of the Government regarding the importance of this sector to us as a people and a society, particularly in these difficult times.

It is spread throughout the regions. The industries are not just good employers but are also important for the well-being of our society. It is important to put in place robust measures to provide adequate support for all the artists and their support personnel, to ensure we do not lose these key artists and this sector. They are very important for this country and for the reputation of this country abroad. They bring a good and positive message from this country to other continents in normal times.

I am very conscious of the emerging artists. For example, we ran a programme online with Hot Press for young and emerging artists earlier this year. I also guarantee that I have never undervalued music and the arts. That is the background I come from; it is what I studied. That is where all my friends and family are. I place an immense value on the sector. It is a privilege to be the Minister with responsibility for culture and arts at this most challenging time. I have a keen eye on doing what is best for this sector, to support it not just to survive but to thrive at the other end of Covid. That is why I am engaging extensively with the sector. I have heard people's concerns and I will bring those to the negotiations, but I cannot have the negotiations on the floor of the House. However, I can guarantee my commitment to this sector and how much I value it. It is the beating heart of our nation, as far as I am concerned. It is our identity. We have to stop talking about and praising it without placing a value on it by supporting it.

"Endured" is the only word for it. Three months before the examinations the schools were shut due to the public health emergency. As weeks passed, students faced the uncertainty of whether they would even sit the leaving certificate examination this year. There was postponement, cancellation and then uncertainty about what model would be used. These young people have had a horrendous year. In ainneoin sin, lean siad ag obair leo go tréan agus rinne siad gach rud a iarradh orthu, ach tá faillí déanta ar an dream sin ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna. These students were entitled to expect standards from the Government and the Department of Education and Skills that matched theirs, but this is not what they got. Instead, they have faced an extraordinary mess and further disadvantage due to errors in the calculated grades model. In May, I made it clear to the Department that the calculated grades model was not the correct one to use, because it would be a blunt instrument that would cause students to miss out when they should not. The Minister for Education and Skills persisted with the model and there have been persistent difficulties since then. The flaws have become apparent following the issuing of the results. The events of yesterday beg many serious questions. The Opposition and even the Cabinet were kept in the dark. Most importantly, the leaving certificate students were kept in the dark. There is a striking lack of clarity about who in the Government knew what and when. We know that this information was in the Minister's hands for seven days, and she said nothing publicly about it. Incredibly, this was while second round offers from the Central Applications Office, CAO, were being issued and accepted. This is not academic. We cannot forget that this affects the lives and futures of students. There are likely almost 1,000 students who have missed courses due to these errors. The Minister says it will be a few days before the full numbers are known. Many students will have taken up lower choice courses in cities and counties in which they had not expected to be located. They will have paid registration fees and deposits to landlords. They do not know whether they are coming or going. It is most important that we fix this shambles. Third level places are at the heart of the solution. The Ministers, Deputies Foley and Harris, are making general commitments or statements about additional college places to be made available. However, the Minister, Deputy Foley, also concedes that some will have to defer. That does not cut it. Asking students to spend a year in limbo is not good enough. The Minister, Deputy Foley, said that no student will be disadvantaged. To achieve that, there must be a guarantee that every student who missed a college course will now be offered the place that is rightfully his or hers. We also must ensure accountability. The Government decided on this model. It hired the company in question. How experienced was this company in doing this type of work? How were the errors not picked up before the results were issued? This smacks of serious incompetence. What is the Government going to do to ensure there is accountability? Can the Minister clarify what he was told about this and when he was told? What did he do as a result? Did he, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste decide not to tell the rest of the Cabinet at its meeting on Tuesday? Can the Minister clear this up?

The Deputy is right that the young people in this year's leaving certificate class have had a year unlike any other. They have suffered probably more than most and as much as anybody else, other than those who went through illness or lost their lives. They have suffered most in terms of the quality of their lives at this critical time. In my experience, anyone making decisions in this entire process had the interests of the students at heart, first and foremost. That will continue to be the case. Included in that, following a coding error in the system, we will ensure there is no student who is unable to avail of a course he or she should have been able to access had that small change in code and those four characters being different in a 50,000 line code. We must ensure those students do not lose out. We are committed to doing that in every way possible. Nobody was kept in the dark on this. The error only became apparent when the person who had been involved in doing the coding saw a slight variation in running the model again when working on the applied leaving certificate results. The person decided to check, at the person's own instigation, and found out what had happened. The person is eminently qualified. The person worked previously with Statistics Canada, the Canadian statistics agency, and also had specific expertise with regard to the Irish academic system due to work the person had done here in assessing our programme for international student assessment, PISA, results and had published on the very area on which the person was working. The person was eminently qualified. At a time when every country is considering these calculated grade systems, it was difficult to find people with such international expertise and knowledge of the Irish system. On seeing the variation that occurred when the person ran the model for the applied leaving certificate, the person contacted the Department of Education and Skills late last Tuesday week. The Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Department were only informed on Wednesday morning that there was a difficulty, but it was not clear exactly what it was. The CAO ran its second round of offers on that day because it was not clear whether it was going to have an effect on the CAO process. The Department, correctly, started to address the issue. It employed a firm of American international consultants with expertise - it is the company that runs the SAT system in the US - as an independent, outside consultancy to go through the 50,000 lines of coding to ensure there were no other errors and to check what were the consequences of that code error. That work is due to be completed in the next day or two. Once it is confirmed to the Department, the model will be run again and the CAO will be immediately informed whether there are any upgrades, so it will be able to ensure that those students are not disadvantaged and are able to get the courses they should have received.The Department informed my party and myself of the details on Friday. At that stage, because it was a complex issue to look into, there was only still an initial sense of where the difficulty might be. I was fully briefed on Monday in advance of a leaders' meeting where we discussed it at length. It is not a matter of keeping anyone in the dark at any stage. The Deputy can imagine if, at the early stage in this process, someone had gone out without full knowledge of what the consequences would be to all the thousands of students who did the leaving certificate. That would have created real anguish and uncertainty. It was only yesterday that the scale of the issue and the numbers were clear. A press conference was planned for 4 p.m. yesterday in advance of it being raised in the Dáil. There was no intention to keep anyone in the dark. There was an intention to try to get this right so that the risk or anguish to students would be minimised. I think that was the right approach.

I have heard the Ministers, Deputies Foley and Harris, talk about them. This is not abstract stuff. Four characters represent hundreds of students and the futures and dreams they have for their courses. This is not academic, it has real implications. What might seem small on a spreadsheet is very significant in terms of the error that was made. The Minister talked about having no intention of keeping people in the dark. People were kept in the dark for over a week. The Minister still has not answered. He was informed on Friday and I would be interested to see over the course of time what was known at that stage. The Minister was given more detail on Monday and there was a Cabinet meeting - a meeting of the Government - at which the matter was not discussed. The Minister was aware of that beforehand. Why did he not insist that this be discussed at Cabinet? It is one of the greatest challenges that this and the previous Government have faced over the last few months yet it was decided that it should not be discussed at Cabinet. There is no logic to that. The Minister should try and tell us why it makes sense. I cannot make head nor tail of it. Surely such a significant issue needs to be discussed at Cabinet. We need a commitment on the third level places to resolve this.

The Ministers, Deputies Harris and Foley, were working on sorting out the issue and getting to the stage where we had final detail on the estimated numbers, what the solution would be and how we would manage this. We wanted to get that right and we will get it right. The real issue here is those students. The American company is reviewing and checking the code. The Deputy is right that the characters are not the important thing. The fact that it was a coding error is not the key thing. The key thing is the students. The key thing now is the estimates we have. We will have to wait until we run the full programme on the checked code; it could be something like 6,500 students. From experience, last year some 3,000 students would have been in a similar position where they were due to get an upgrade after an appeals process. No one will know the number until the final coding check is completed and all the other systems are put in place. We can expect that there will be a number of students - no one knows the exact number - but it will be equivalent to the sort of percentage one would expect that was done last year. It may actually be less because they were students who were looking to get up a grade to get to the points that they just missed. It will probably be less but we do not know that until we get the final numbers. They will then be included in the CAO system and will be able to get the course they would have got in the first place. That is guaranteed. That is what the Government is committed to and within a matter of days.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	80	I want us to look at a few figures: 175 is the number of days that the Debenhams workers have been on strike and €175 million is the amount that was paid to KPMG to wind down Anglo-Irish Bank by the State. The value of the stock inside Debenhams is €11 million, and €11 million is what it would take to pay proper redundancy to the 1,000 workers and their families, namely the two weeks that were negotiated and bargained for. The fee that was paid to KPMG to advise the Government on the national broadband plan also happens to be €11 million, a fiasco for which the State is paying six times the cost and which we will never own. I want to bring those figures together to illustrate to everybody and particularly the leaders of the Government that what they are doing in terms of their treatment of the Debenhams workers is disgraceful and unacceptable. I walked behind what looked like an army of ordinary working class women towards the Fianna Fáil headquarters this morning, where they were protesting. I was telling them how shameful it looked for the State to be overseeing the 175 days of their struggle without getting justice, and said to them "you are just ordinary women." They said no, and that they have become extraordinary people. I read the article in The Irish Times describing how Jane Crowe, the chief shop steward, sat in a cell having been arrested after occupying Henry Street, with a bed and a hole in the floor for a toilet. She wondered how it had come to this. I am asking the Minister how it has come to this. The State has no end of largesse when coughing out to companies like KPMG for failures, indeed, as KPMG was supposed to have overseen the accounts of Anglo and Irish Nationwide. It failed to alert us before the bank bailout that there was a problem. Why is it that the State has no end of largesse to treat those big conglomerates in this way but cannot hold up its hands and say it failed to implement the terms of Duffy-Cahill? It has failed to give those workers a mechanism whereby they could receive justice and should admit that the hard-won rights that they fought for having given years and years of service are being thrown back at them. It is five days now that the workers in Waterford are occupying their store. Last night an official from KPMG walked in and more or less asked them what it would take to settle this. They said it would take negotiating with them and KPMG said no way. The State is the best customer of KPMG. Here is the way to settle it. The Government should tell KPMG to sit down and negotiate and that the State, regarding its ability to collect the insolvency money, will take one step sideways and allow the workers to have first preference as a creditor. That is what should have happened under Duffy-Cahill but the State failed to legislate. The Minister is now part of the Government. How can he sit there and say it is not possible to look after 1,000 workers and their families while it is possible to throw the largesse of the State at the big conglomerates? Which side is he on?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	81	I am on the side of every worker in this country. Our partnership process, our model of working with unions, employers and the various interests, is critical. The social democratic partnership model is the strength of our country and vital for our country. If there is one first priority it is social justice and rights. Those rights are preserved when we have law. The rights of the workers are protected in law so that employers are not able to exploit them, which would happen in the absence of that legal system and outlook in a country. We do have to abide by the law. The role of this House is such that if there are deficiencies in the law in protecting workers, then of course we would look to see if we needed to amend legislation, strengthen law or provide further funds. On us going another way and ignoring the law, even as hard, cruel and significant as the circumstances of workers in any one situation are, including in this case of the Debenhams workers, although one wants to do everything one can, what one cannot do is start going outside the law. Once one does that, some of the protections that exist in the law are lost and it actually undermines and weakens workers' rights. This Government is committed to doing whatever it can within the law. The liquidation is proceeding under the supervision of the High Court. Once it is in that High Court process, we cannot directly interfere. Under the Companies Act, a liquidator is under statutory duty to realise and distribute the assets from an insolvent company as prescribed by law. For State creditors including Revenue, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and local authorities in respect of rates, their legal frameworks have to be respected. We do not have the discretion to forego debts owed to the State by a particular company. At the same time, we do guarantee statutory employment rights to the workers of Debenhams and if a company is unable to pay statutory redundancy then the State will step in. The first case is that the company has to pursue all possible avenues to provide that its statutory obligations are honoured and met.The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection expects to receive claims on behalf of the former employees of Debenhams under two separate schemes, namely, the redundancy payment scheme and insolvency payment scheme. The Department estimates there will be approximately 1,750 claims between the two schemes with some 300 claims arriving per week and that it might take three or four weeks for all the claims to be submitted. As of 18 September, the Department received 600 claims under the redundancy payment scheme and 646 under the insolvency payment scheme. Members on every side of this House believe it is important to protect and meet workers' rights. We cannot, however, do that outside the law. Where we need to change the law, we have committed to review the various pieces of legislation in this area in the programme for Government. We will certainly commit to do that.

I would not expect anything else from the leader of the Green Party. He finished with more or less the same sentiment. In between, however, he read out some Civil Service claptrap that makes no sense to me. I do not think the Minister understood it. Does he expect 1,000 workers and their families to understand it when we know there is stock in those stores, which those workers are protecting, that is worth the same value of their redundancy payments? I ask the Minister again which side he is on. If it is the side of social justice and social rights, and the law has not provided for it, then the law is an ass and the Minister and the Government can sit down with KPMG reminding it that the Government is its best customer. The Government pays KPMG millions for every other project it wants to engage in. Therefore, KPMG must listen to the Government. Tell KPMG to negotiate with the workers and that this State will step aside in terms of what it is owed as a creditor and allow the workers to be first creditor because this State failed to implement the Duffy Cahill report. Now, the Minister is making a promise to do it. That is great. Do it. However, it will be too late for the Debenhams workers so the Minister needs to make a special case. He can do somersaults for vested interests in this country. Do somersaults for the workers in this country. There are 1,000 of them and their families and they must be looked after.

With regard to the Duffy Cahill report, as I said, the Government is seeking to implement a whole series of measures and is reviewing whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies protect the workers' rights effectively. It is reviewing the Companies Act 2014 with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property. I am aware that is more relevant to the Clerys case but it will have a result where any trading company is trying to separate out its operations. We will examine the legal provision that pertains to any sale of a connected party following the insolvency of a company, including who can object and allow grounds for it. Recently, I understand the Irish Congress of Trade Unions allowed two further proposals it believes will assist workers where a collective agreement is in place. The Government is committed to ensuring those proposals are considered and this will meaningfully involve engagement with all stakeholders. We cannot, however, say to an auditor that because we are working with it on some other line of business we will not pay it or use it unless it treats stock in a certain way. That would be completely outside the law.

People around the country are wondering if anybody is in charge at all. In a few short months, this Government has proven itself efficient in only one thing and that is the creation of chaos. The predictive grades process has turned out to be a complete dog's dinner. What has actually been delivered looks nothing like what was designed in the first place. The Government said the process would be accurate, reliable and fair. It is none of these things. The predictive grades situation is a disaster for many students across the country. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, in particular, have a fierce fondness for outsourcing serious State roles to private companies. This has obviously caused untold damage right across the sectors, especially in areas such as cancer screening. However, from the responses of the Minister and other Government Deputies over the past while, it looks like the Government is trying to outsource the blame for this particular issue to the private sector as well. At this juncture, the key question is: who is responsible for what has happened? I do not ask that question for the purpose of the blame game but because there will be a cost to this cock-up. The class of 2020 has gone through extraordinary turmoil over the past year. Many will have serious financial costs heaped upon them. Some students will have taken courses in certain cities. They will have been set up there and have paid big deposits for houses, flats, etc., only to find out they have another preference in another city they want to take.  The Government now states it will provide extra places for those students. Those are extra places for students in a third level sector that is already on its knees financially. There is a €500 million shortfall in that sector. It will not be feasible to provide places for everybody; it is just not going to happen. Many students will be left in limbo in respect of their preferences for a full year and many of these cases will lead to court cases. Did the company make this mistake? Is it consequently liable for the financial costs that will accrue to the State or did the Department give the incorrect directions? Will the taxpayer be left pick up the costs again?

The Minister for Education and Skills, specifically as part of the Government responsible for this particular area, her Department, the calculated grades office and all the tiers of administration we have are responsible. To assist this calculated grades process - no one wanted to do it but the pandemic forced it on us - they decided they wanted to get in some of the best international expertise they could, that is, people who had knowledge of the area in this country. It was appropriate for them to seek that international expertise and bring it in. There is a critical strength and benefit to the leaving certificate. There are some downsides to the leaving certificate but, to my mind, one great strength is that it is a level playing field for everyone and for every household in this country. No matter where one comes from, what school one went to or what one's background is, we all believe, truthfully, the leaving certificate is a level playing field test and not an arbitrary one. There is no benefit to someone living in one part of the country or to someone coming from one side of society or from another side. Everyone knows it is fair, and I believe in the grading, the testing and the process. No one wanted to not be able to do the leaving certificate this year. I believe, however, at the end of this process that still holds true. It is far better that a mistake is recognised, admitted to and immediately acted on in an open way to retain that trust in the integrity of the system. Various Members have had a chance to interview and question Department officials, people from the calculated grades office and others on how they are managing this. My view is that they have done the best thing in a difficult and almost impossible situation. We have seen similar difficulties in other countries. However, I trust that what they are doing here is to address an unfortunate error. There is deep regret that it occurred. The error was recognised by the person who made it. When they discovered they made the mistake they immediately said that. It is far better that the person said an error was made, and we need to reflect on what the consequences are. Far better than that, to my mind, is that the Department said it wanted to get the truth of this and that it brought in international, independent and highly-regarded experts so that it could have confidence that their review would tell it that, hopefully, there were no further errors and would explain how and why the actual error was made so that it is absolutely clear what happened and that trust in the system is ultimately protected.It is important that the younger students, who are key to this, believe they got the correct result in the end. That will be the outcome of this very unfortunate process. They will also get the college place they should have got based on that revision. I think any teacher would say that if a student or anyone else made a mistake, they should admit it, rectify it and learn from it. That is what will happen here.

The Minister has tried to paint the Government as noble for having admitted the mistake in this case. However, the Government knew about this mistake a week ago. The Taoiseach, who has made a big play of education during this Government, knew about this mistake a week ago. The Minister for only good news stories, Deputy Harris, who did not appear at the press conference yesterday, has not been available to answer questions since. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, is making herself available in the graveyard shift tonight at 9 o'clock, when hopefully from the Government's perspective most Deputies will have hit the hills. That does not look like a Government with its hands up saying, "We've made a mistake. Let's be transparent about this." The Minister may have answered this key question. Is the Government taking full responsibility for this? Does that mean the taxpayer foots the bill yet again?

I prefer that I am here able to answer some of the valid and appropriate questions Members of the Opposition have. The Minister for Education and Skills will be able to answer any further questions this evening. I would prefer to be able to stand up now with the full knowledge, as I do now, of what had actually happened, which I do not believe would have been available or was not actually available earlier this week. It was more important to get the facts right, get the resolution and rectification of the problem right and then to present the approach we plan to take. Had we taken the other route and immediately said there was a problem without being sure about the consequences, the numbers or the implications for the CAO and college places, tens of thousands of students, all of whom would fear that there are implications for them, would spend a week wanting to know the answers to those valid questions. It was more appropriate to get this sorted as best we can - and we will - and then openly and transparently go to the Dáil and outline the difficulties we have. On contractual arrangements, if someone's contract has not delivered or a mistake has been made, obviously that is a legal contractual issue to be managed after the fact. The first thing is to get the code checked, which will be done, get the revised assessment of students with higher grades and then allocate third level places to them in a timely manner. That is what we will focus on.

This week Bus Éireann announced that it is to scrap a number of its Expressway routes, significantly reducing connectivity between our major cities and the regions. The removal of the X8 service between Dublin and Cork, for example, will have a major impact on students and commuters travelling from Tipperary to either Cork or Dublin and patients travelling for hospital appointments if they can ever get one these days. Cork and Shannon Airports are facing a serious crisis and our rail services are nearly non-existent in terms of connectivity. The programme for Government commits to prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity yet six months in, we are learning that the Government is shutting down services instead of promoting them. At the same time, appallingly, 3,100 students have been refused school transport tickets this year. I understand the Government had agreed last year to have a review in an effort to sort this out and do something about the situation. It is providing money for physical distancing to Bus Éireann contractors only. Where will that come from? What extra funding has been allocated to ensure the 3,100 students will get a school bus ticket? From a green point of view, it is astounding. How can the Minister for Transport stand over instances where in the same household two siblings can get a ticket but one cannot? That is bullying of young children and the pressure it is putting on their parents is disgraceful. Then the parents, grandparents or carers must get into a car to follow the bus down the road to the school. How does that fit in with the green agenda? In October 2019, the then Minister announced a review of the school transport scheme to ensure funds are being spent in the most effective way to meet the objectives of the scheme. Terms of reference and everything else were agreed, but now because of Covid it has all been abandoned. The school transport scheme is a pure mess. I know a man in Cloneen in Tipperary, Michael O'Brien, whose daughter Bianca is a recovering cancer patient and doing well, thank God. He has to drive her to school. He must make a choice between work and his child. Obviously, his child comes first so he has had to give up his job. This is shameful. The bus passes quite close but she cannot get a ticket on it. It is not acceptable that the review of the school transport scheme has been delayed because of Covid. With 3,100 students left to find alternative arrangements, the Government needs to sort this urgently. It is beyond urgent; it should have been sorted last year. The future of the X8 Expressway service is in jeopardy and we cannot get a train out of Clonmel, Cahir or Carrick-on-Suir before 9 a.m. any morning. The bus service is very poor. I salute the private carriers and others, whom the Minister knows, who do the work there. We have 85,000 people waiting for driving tests. They are not allowed to drive and they cannot get on the system. The system is badly broken. I ask the Minister for Transport to try to fix it.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	91	I commit to that. In an ordinary year the Government would provide about €300 million in public service obligation supports to the public transport system. This year we will provide that, but we will also provide an additional €460 million because carriers have lost fare revenues owing to the Covid restrictions. If necessary, we will do the same again next year. Bus Éireann has announced that it is seeking to withdraw from four of its intercity express services to consolidate the other 14 services and to provide additional bus services in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Meath and Louth. That was a decision by the company over how it wants to meet what it sees as growing demand and areas where it was suffering significant losses. It was not because of a lack of financial support or a lack of willingness to support public transport services. There will be an increased employment of drivers and a redeployment of drivers on existing routes. As I told the company - I commit to it here - if there is any loss of service with any town left out or left behind, we will apply the public service obligation to ensure no town is left behind. This was the commercial side of its bus operations. It was not under the public service route network, but that does not matter. We still need to ensure every town is connected. Indeed, we seek to expand the public transport network. Under the towns first policy, we can use the strange opportunities Covid presents to change our transport system away from long-distance car commuting towards having local bus services. People who are able to work remotely without the need to commute will have good quality local bus services in their own town as well as between cities. Obviously, Covid restrictions have presented considerable difficulty for school transport. With the recommencement of schools, the Government set up the school transport system to work effectively with student safety in mind. The Department of Education and Skills provided funding for all the proper sanitisation and hygiene requirements on buses. Because the numbers spiked about a week before the schools came back, we had to revise the plans further. We did not have the 1,600 drivers needed and the extra coaches to meet the higher standards that the health authorities required. The Minister for Education and Skills has been working on that. We will introduce it shortly. I estimate it will cost over €100 million to further protect and improve the school bus transport system. Everyone in the House knows there are difficulties with that system. About 20,000 students get buses in a separate private system. There are issues with concession tickets, none of which are optimal. There is no lack of support, no lack of commitment and no lack of funding. Many hundreds of millions of euro of additional funding will be allocated to public transport this year and we will do the same again next year.

The school transport system is a mess. The Minister is talking about €750 million this year, €450 million more than last year. He would be better off subsidising parents to drive their kids to school and forget his green ideals. We have buses passing by and cars travelling in front of them and behind them and the whole thing is organised chaos. The Minister said the numbers spiked in September but the Government knew, since the schools closed last March, that this problem was coming down the track. Can the Government not think ahead? The Department managers would not survive in business for a week. The Minister should know as he is a former businessman. Surely one plans ahead when one sees what is coming down the track. We have 85,000 people waiting for driver tests, we will have a carbon tax hitting us in the budget, we literally have no rail services in County Tipperary, although the Minister has made the right noises about how he wants to see stations restored, and we have no guarantee on the Expressway services. Thank God for PJ Kavanagh, McCarra's, Lambert's, Denny and Kit Whelan and Mr. Toohey up in Nenagh. Thank God also for the parents' groups who are able to organise private routes. They can do it efficiently with buses. Those bus owners have got no support whatsoever from the pandemic unemployment payment or anything else. They are getting no support to sanitise their buses either. It is discrimination against rural people all the time and rural children are being bullied. Can the Minister imagine the damage it does to a child when his or her two siblings are taken on and they cannot be taken on? Just think of it happening to a child of five, seven or eight years of age. The Minister should think about that for one minute.

We have actually managed it well, both within the schools and the public transport and other systems we have been using to get our children to and from school. It has actually worked. We have not seen a spike and an increase. However, at the last minute the health authorities came to us saying that because they were worried about rising numbers, as an extra precaution they wanted to see a further change in the arrangements. As I said, that will involve something like 1,600 additional coaches. Some of these will be from the very businesses the Deputy is aware of which are in real difficulty because they are not able to operate services in other areas of the economy. The Government was willing to take on the financial implications and the organisational arrangements even though we felt the system we had in place was a good one, because it had not led to an increased incidence of the virus.

As I said, the Opposition and the Cabinet were kept in the dark as well. The Minister still has not told us why he did not insist this issue be discussed at Cabinet and that his Cabinet colleagues knew. The other groups kept in the dark were the third level institutions and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. At the start of his answer to my supplementary question earlier, the Minister said the Minister with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, were working on actually sorting out this issue. If the Minister, Deputy Harris, knew on Friday and was sorting it out, then why did the HEA not find out until yesterday?

From the best advice on how this can all be sorted out, it was far better to get that right and to get the pieces in place so we can adjust and ensure every student gets the third level they should have got and that is what will happen.

Second, it set up the national standardisation group. Third, it set up the independent steering committee to oversee the implementation. Fourth, on top of those, the independent expert Dr. Janet Brown was appointed as an external reviewer. As such there were four layers in order to do the calculated grades. Then on 24 August all of that work changed suddenly. This was because the assistant secretary in the Department sent out a memo and changed the modelling. How in the name of God did these four layers not catch on that there was something wrong here? I have a second question. We said this at the time but was 24 August not too late in the day to be changing the model which all 61,000 students in Ireland were depending on?

There was a variance from historic patterns by, I think, 4%. All the analysis done by all the different tiers of State expertise and officials mentioned by the Deputy came to the conclusion that that was roughly what we expected. There was no other variation that in any way indicated that this coding error had been made whereby the bottom two of the junior certificate results were counted rather than the top next two. It was only when the person responsible for that ran the applied leaving certificate results that there was a variation he could not quite understand. He then looked through the 50,000 lines of code – he had certain expertise having written much of it – to find out what it was and he reported it back. The variation was not categorised in any one area, in any one school or in any one subject. It did not lead to a significant change in what the results would otherwise have been. It is still appropriate, to my mind, to adjust this to be absolutely correct and accurate in terms of how our leaving certificate is adjudged.

It is a very difficult subject for a man to speak about but I know the science, research and health evidence show that breastfeeding has huge benefits to health and all sorts of other outcomes. We need to radically improve the incidence and level of breastfeeding. We have the right strategies and our maternity strategies have improved in recent years. I would have been very critical about this a number of years ago. We have the right strategies and plans in place but it seems we are not implementing them, right down to hospital ward level, and that has to change. It is not easy because it is a matter of personal choice and there is no way one would ever criticise anyone for the choices they make in that regard but on public health grounds, I absolutely commit to supporting the Government in trying to achieve those objectives.

In the context of Covid-19 the Government was forced, rightly, to bring in an eviction ban because making people homeless is totally incompatible with public health, yet the Government has now allowed that ban to lapse. We sought to bring forward a Bill in our Private Members' slot next week which is essentially the eviction ban, but we have been told that staff in the Dáil, through no fault of their own I want to stress, cannot process it because they have been overrun with things such as the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which the Government rammed through with a guillotine, collapsing the normal sequence of legislative scrutiny. The Government has done this on multiple occasions, and as a result the staff are not able to process our Bill for Private Members' time. The Bill would seek to reinstate the eviction ban to prevent people going into homelessness during Covid-19.

Over the past 14 days, the people in Louth have been working very hard to reduce the figures. The rate in north Louth is 179.7 per 100,000, in Dundalk it is 120.2 per 100,000, in Ardee and mid-Louth it is 19.7 and in Drogheda it is 55.9. In July, 1,000 tests were done. In August, the figure was 2,000 tests and in September it was 4,000 tests. It looks like there could be 8,000 tests in October. Why is the HSE trying to move the test centre from Dundalk to Ardee when there are serious issues in north Louth? It means people have to travel from Omeath, Carlingford, Lordship and Dundalk to Ardee. It makes no sense whatsoever. Please not to tell me it is the HSE that allocates the locations. Covid-19 is a serious epidemic and it makes no sense to move the test centre from Dundalk to Ardee. Will the Minister please intervene as soon as possible?

I have friends in the area so I look out for it and keep an eye on it with real concern. Every day if the Louth numbers have not gone up, I hope it will manage not to have the difficulties we have had in Dublin, Donegal or elsewhere and I hope this continues to be the case. With regard to the issue of swabbing, next week the HSE will initiate a recruitment drive to hire more than 700 community swabbers and testers to work in community test centres, home-based testing, outbreak testing, residential care facilities and specific work locations.

The Regional Independent Deputies are voting with the Government. They want to play a double act then of being in opposition. The post office network is under the remit of either the Minister or his ministerial colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin. It is about to collapse if there is no State intervention. Covid is having a huge impact because people are being encouraged to pay by card and payments are not going through the post office. The Government is choking the post offices. Will the Minister and his fellow Green Party Minister seriously look at the post office network because it will no longer exist? This is not just in rural Ireland but also in urban areas where post offices are under huge pressure.

As the worst programmer that ever walked God's green earth, I know we have all come up with sample data that we run through to find these issues. I do not understand. It sounds to me like something fairly basic, whereby somebody had a less than or equal to sign in the wrong place and the testing did not find it. I just want an answer. The more important answer is that students need delivery now and the costs need to be covered for them.

What preparations are being made to look after next year's leaving certificate students and to ensure that those who sat the leaving certificate before this year are not further penalised? What preparations are being put in place to assist those students who wish to take the exam in November? Are schools being told to give assistance and support to these students? Students have gone through so much with Covid-19 and they are now looking for support from their schools. Everything is being put online but that is not good enough. The Department needs to give information to the schools to help these students who are resitting their exams.

It is clear that everyone's preference would have been to have sat the leaving certificate this year but it was not possible. That was the decision that was made. One thing the Government is saying about the pandemic is that we will keep the schools open. It is critical for the mental health and development of our children that we will do whatever it takes to do this. In these circumstances, the message to the upcoming leaving certificate students is that there will be leaving certificate exams next May and June. They will have a difficult time because they have lost out on class time and they have had a different experience. The syllabus and the exams will reflect this. They absolutely have to expect that they will sit the leaving certificate.We will not know the numbers until the model is run with this revised code and it is checked to ensure there are no other errors in it. It is impossible to know precisely when that will be. As I said earlier, last year some 3,000 students got an upgrade. This issue only applies to upgrades. There is no downgrading in this. Last year's upgrades led to 600 students being successful in getting a different application. If we play that statistic, that is why one gets to 1,000 places. I believe it will be fewer. That had a qualification in that there were people who wanted an upgrade. In this instance, it is random.

In one electoral area in west Cork we have had fewer than five cases in the past 14 days. As this is based on per 100,000 population and the population of the local electoral area is fewer than 25,000 people, this effectively equates to less than one case and most probably none. Since the Taoiseach spoke last week, on Sunday the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, spoke on certain counties with Cork, Galway, Waterford and Kildare being watched carefully over the coming days. The reality is that Cork University Hospital, as of last Friday evening, had one - one too many - Covid-19 patient in the entire hospital. This is the largest hospital in County Cork and possibly the largest in Munster. Cork is a large county, stretching 150 km from one end to the other. Will the Minister continue with a more targeted approach and keep as many areas, parts of our country and economy open, as we all try to find a way through this? Will he specifically keep County Cork open for business?

There was an instance in Cork where it started up. I remember talking to some of the medics in Cork who were really expecting to be hit the worst. In truth, Cork over the subsequent several months, had a much lower incidence compared to the rest of the country. That has changed in recent weeks in Cork city but it may, thankfully, not be the case in parts of the county. We all have to be vigilant. One of the reasons the Government set up this framework with five levels is to allow us to be flexible and have a situation where a county can be at a different level. I hope that with Dublin and Donegal that if the numbers stabilise - we are not going to get the numbers down to zero - they can get back down to level 2. If we can all stabilise for a period, we can get to level 1. That is where we want to head to.

It is obvious there was no good news to be announced this morning because the Minister's Fine Gael Cabinet colleagues are not here. There is an absolute crisis in the Government. I do not think the Minister understands it. From start to finish, we have had months of this in terms of the leaving certificate. It is unbelievable that the Minister and his colleagues in Cabinet would think that it was okay to sit down at a Cabinet meeting and not discuss the leaving certificate issue. The Minister is either saying it was not important enough or he did not get the gravity of what has happened. The business of the week was being discussed. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, or the Minister with responsibility for further education, Deputy Harris, was not even in it. Does the Minister realise that whatever words he is using, his actions are telling people a much different story? This is without the 10,000 prior leaving certificate students who we were told there were no places for but suddenly there are places for them. It is an absolute shambles. I feel sorry for the Minister that he has been left defending this.

The Cabinet comes to discuss something when there is a decision to be made. Sometimes it is appropriate to get the proper information, as well as all facts and figures correct. There was nothing restricting the Government in doing the key work that had to be done, which is sorting out this problem quickly to ensure we can get students in college next week. That is what we focused on.

It has given 12 months' notice. It is a serious issue and I am happy to provide a note to the Deputy with background information. St. John of God Community Services, part of the St. John of God Hospitaller Services Group, provides a range of invaluable services and supports to more than 2,400 children and adults with intellectual disabilities and 5,000 children and adults with a mental illness in Dublin and other areas of the country. The HSE allocated €162.7 million to support these services this year. This comprises €134.2 million for disability services and €28.6 million for mental health services. The HSE has also provided it with access to €12 million in cash acceleration above its core budget this year to ensure continuity and service provision. I will provide the Deputy with full details.

Michael O'Brien has a daughter who is 12 years of age and who is recovering from leukaemia. The school bus stops outside her door but she is refused a seat on the bus. We have 14 other students in that area who have also been refused school transport. There are numerous examples in County Tipperary where Bus Éireann has refused to provide transport for children for school. The single parent in question, Michael O'Brien, has to choose between going to work or taking his daughter to school. She has already missed eight school days this year. I have numerous examples from Moneygall or Kilcommon where Bus Éireann, although allocated an extra €11.3 million, is not providing the services needed in rural areas. Will the Minister urge Bus Éireann to put on extra school buses to get our pupils to schools?

Essentially, he said there was nothing to see here and that everything is working as planned. In County Monaghan, I am dealing with more than a dozen families with school transport problems. In some instances, one child from a family is permitted on a bus while another child is not. I am dealing with families with children with special needs for whom no provision has been made for their school transportation this year, as was the case in previous years. I have been dealing with officials in Bus Éireann who have told me that they are absolutely exacerbated by the Government's failure to release the resources necessary to ensure those children who need to get to school are permitted to do so. The Government needs to act on this issue now.

It clearly is not. The case of the child recovering from an illness is difficult. If the Deputy provides me with the details, we can look at the specific case. We were not able to adjust the actual system in the timeline for the return to school and the public health side of it. It was working because there had not been a spike or an increase in infections due to the return to schools. The first real concern was keeping our schoolchildren healthy. The bus drivers, the bus companies, Bus Éireann and the schools managed to do that part of our operation in a way that has not seen a spike. I commend them on that work.

In the meantime, there have been meetings at political and official level between both Administrations and that is welcome. Unfortunately, there have been increasing incidences of the virus in areas both north and south of the Border over recent weeks. Many eminent persons in different areas of medicine, such as Professor Sam McConkey and Dr. Gabriel Scally, have repeatedly spoken about the need for greater North-South co-operation. Will the Minister indicate if there are Government proposals to introduce new measures and intensify existing co-operation on an all-Ireland basis in dealing with the pandemic? We must take a greater all-Ireland approach or we will never rid our island of this virus.

In those circumstances, we need to have complete co-operation between our health services, North and South, to make sure the risk of infection is minimised. At the recent North-South Ministerial Council, the administration from Stormont came down to Dublin Castle and it was a good meeting. A large part of it was made up of a presentation from the office of the Chief Medical Officer in Northern Ireland with Dr. Ronan Glynn, our own acting Chief Medical Officer. I know from talking to Dr. Glynn that they are in regular contact and are committed to integrating the two systems to make sure we minimise the risk of transmission across this island. I do not have specifics in terms of additional measures that are being considered in that regard but my sense is there is nothing restricting co-operation. If there is, we should identify it and address it with our colleagues. I am going to a North-South Ministerial Council meeting next week. If any Deputy has examples of where there are problems about gaps between the two, I am happy to raise it there.

The company has to manage its resources and we agreed to it. They were various caveats or conditions related to that. One is that they are looking to redeploy bus services in Cork to improve the services into and in the city. I was aware a number of years ago that the same issue was arising in Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Cahir and all the towns along that line. It was difficult for Bus Éireann Expressway to compete on the Dublin service because it was stopping on all the routes along the way and the other bus companies were going direct. Bus Éireann was losing customers on that Expressway route. I said if there was a withdrawal of any services it would be with the caveat that the National Transport Authority, NTA, would look at each of those towns and, where there was a lot of connectivity or services, we would see whether we could provide such connectivity or services on a public service obligation route instead of an Expressway commercial route and do that in tandem with anything we do with revised routes. Those towns are specific examples where we have had that difficulty so I will be in touch with the NTA in that regard to make sure there is connectivity.

Before I begin, I want to acknowledge the enormous impact this virus has had on our society. Every corner of the country has been affected on some level and it has touched every county, community and family. We have had to stay away from friends and family members for months. Some people have lost their jobs and others have lost businesses that they had dedicated their lives to building. Some sectors have been particularly badly hit. The arts community, the people to whom we turn to keep us going, inspire and comfort us in dark times, has been decimated by the virus. The arts thrive on people gathering together for shared experiences and that is the very thing that Covid-19 forces us to limit. The same applies to the hospitality sector, sports and many other areas of our country, community and lives. Those groups, like the arts community, have done everything they can to respond to the challenges of Covid-19. They have adapted, innovated and worked tirelessly but the inescapable need for less social interaction in order to suppress this virus has come at a high cost to all of these sectors in every county across the nation. We have not been able to celebrate weddings, birthdays, communions and many other of life's milestones as we would want. At funerals, we have not been able to say goodbye, pay our respects and mourn the deceased as we need to.We now have more than 36,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland. We have reported the deaths of 1,804 women and men from Covid-19. I express my deepest sympathies, as well as those of the Government, to the families and friends of every single one of these women and men. I pay tribute to the front line workers who have worked tirelessly since early this year. Our healthcare workers have played an absolutely vital role in combating this disease and caring for those who needed healthcare when they were affected by it. Other public services, including An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, local authority staff and many others are to be commended by us on their commitment to this national effort. Tragically, some healthcare workers lost their lives while caring for others during this pandemic. I pay particular tribute to them, their families and their loved ones. The virus is having a huge impact internationally. There are more than 33 million confirmed cases and in excess of 1 million confirmed deaths from Covid-19. We are not alone in trying to devise a strategy to limit the growth of this virus and its impact on our people, communities, economy and lives. It is clear at this point that the virus is going to be with us for some time. While we cannot be certain how long that will be, we nevertheless have to plan our society and live with the virus in the meantime. Chapter one in our fight against Covid-19 involved closing the country down in order to flatten the curve. While that came at an extraordinarily high price for many people, it worked. It is not something we can continue to do. Therefore, we are taking a new approach. This is chapter two, keeping the country open while suppressing the virus, moving early and targeting the virus where we know it spreads so as to protect lives, resume health care services, keep our schools, colleges and childcare facilities open and protect jobs. The resilience and recovery plan provides us with a way of navigating chapter two, allowing society and businesses to operate as normally as possible while continuing to suppress the virus. It is designed to help individuals, organisations and sectors to better understand, anticipate and prepare for measures that might need to be introduced as the virus moves through the country. The framework in the plan brings clarity and certainty to how we will move forward with opening our society at this time. Inherent in the framework is a prioritisation of activities. It represents a move away from the short term emergency response that was needed to a medium-term risk management of the virus, including repairing the impact Covid-19 has had on our economy and society. Given the constantly evolving nature of this pandemic, it is critical that a certain amount of flexibility is built into the plan to allow for a nuanced approach. This allows our public health doctors and the Government to take account of disease profile and trajectory at a given time and to make decisions accordingly. Each numbered level in the plan corresponds to the measures that will be in place as a result of the pattern and progress of Covid-19 in a particular county or region at a particular time. This is a framework to help guide decision-making by each of us individually as well as collectively and a society. The measures at each level have been carefully developed by our public health doctors and specialists in infectious diseases. The national framework is built on three pillars. The first of these is healthy people. This involves taking personal responsibility and following the public health guidelines as a first line of defence. It also includes accessible and sustainable testing and tracing, the flu vaccine, non-Covid health and social care services and additional capacity for new ways of delivering non-Covid care. The second pillar is strong businesses . These include the employment wage subsidy available to the end of March next year, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, which is remaining open to new entrants and has been extended to April of next year, loans, grants, rate waivers, vouchers and other support schemes for small and medium enterprises, enhanced restart grants worth more than €550 million, €200 million in training and support for people who have lost jobs, and €500 million in capital works. A stay and spend tax incentive is in place from October to April of next year. There is a six-month VAT reduction from 23% to 21%. The Covid-19 illness benefit has been extended until the end of March next year and local authorities will develop local recovery initiatives. The third pillar is resilient communities. There will be a strong focus on the well-being and resilience of our communities and a programme of well-being activities and initiatives will be delivered locally, including supporting healthy living, physical activity, managing chronic disease, positive ageing and the needs of young people. There will be local community and voluntary group funding to enable them to adapt their services. Libraries will expand online and digital book delivery services will take place. There will be a permanent volunteer reserve corps established in every county, and individual mental health supports will be provided. In tandem with the plan, I am working with the HSE to develop services as part of the winter plan to ensure that resources are devoted to those areas that will see the most benefit as we approach the seasonal impacts on our hospitals and other healthcare services. Central to all of our efforts is a robust testing and contact tracing strategy for the virus. The HSE and Department have worked intensively over recent months to put in place a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing regime. The HSE has increased resources significantly, including optimising and maximising our laboratory testing capacity on the island. The HSE is finalising its future service model for testing and contact tracing at this time. This includes recruiting a permanent workforce as well as other service improvements. The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, continues to be a vital resource for the Government, advising on public health measures and strategies to limit the growth of virus in our society. It continues to monitor the emerging international evidence and the advice of the WHO and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC.  In the absence of a vaccine for Covid-19, the advice for the public continues to be to limit the number of people we meet outside our homes and the time we spend with people. It includes wearing a face covering on public transport, in shops and in other indoor settings, avoiding crowded places as much as we can, avoiding public transport where possible and walking or cycling instead – that is obviously not possible for all people at all times - avoiding places where we cannot keep 2 m apart from each other where possible, and working from home if possible. I recognise that many people, including many essential workers, simply cannot work from home, but there are measures that can be taken in some instances, such as social distancing. We have seen very positive responses to the communication of this roadmap. The high number of people wearing face coverings, for example, demonstrates the solidarity in our society in respect of dealing with this virus. We must continue this solidarity if we are to suppress the virus. We have come a long way since March. We have learned to live in a world with this virus. We have reopened many aspects of our society and economy. Around a million children have returned to school. Students are returning to college. Our health services are resuming. The majority of society is open, despite the highly infectious and dangerous disease circulating among us.We succeeded in doing these things thanks to the collective efforts of all of us to adhere to the guidelines, as well as to the expert knowledge and advice from our public health doctors and specialists and the dedication and hard work of our front-line workers. Right now, we need individually and collectively to keep doing the basics right. This is what the vast majority of people are doing every day. We have the power to adhere to the public health guidelines. The regulations in place are designed to assist each of us to make choices to reduce the risk to ourselves, our family and our vulnerable loved ones. I urge everyone to listen to the public health doctors, to the public health advice and I ask all Members of this House to use their influence to support this message, support our public health doctors and the national guidelines in place. Together we will suppress this virus. We will keep people safe. We will keep our schools and colleges open, protect jobs and continue this fight. I thank the House.

I greatly welcome the publication two weeks ago of the roadmap for living alongside Covid-19. Covid-19 has placed great demands on every one of us, as individuals, parents, families, workers and indeed business owners. The overall aim of this plan is to keep schools and crèches open in as many of these scenarios as possible. The Government prioritised that schools would remain open. We are all well aware that children depend crucially on education and learning. I recognise the great amount of work undertaken to make this possible. The reopening of international travel formed a key part of this plan. The aviation industry is one of the industries that has been most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. All airlines have suffered a severe depletion of revenue and are now facing significant financial challenges. I recently attended a briefing at Cork Airport where I was told that the passenger numbers there had declined by 95% due to Covid-19. Its impact on Cork Airport is expected to see the loss of over 2 million passengers this year and more than €23 million in lost revenue by year end. Ireland’s approach to international travel has sought to protect public health. This has certainly been the correct approach in the earlier phases of the pandemic. It is now time to find a reasonable balance that combines public health requirements with those of a functioning economy. The Aviation Recovery Task Force published its final report recently and it contained several recommendations relating to the provision of further support to the industry. The European Commission has also published a proposal to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within the EU. The Minister has previously stated that work is required to develop these recommendations into effective interventions and that this work is well underway. I ask that the Minister and his Department make this an urgent priority and would appreciate an update or general timeframe as to when these interventions will be in place. The importance of Cork Airport to our economy and to the region cannot be underestimated. I want to ensure that Cork Airport’s interests are to the forefront of this Government’s agenda. On a totally different topic I will talk about messaging. I compliment the Minister and his Department in tackling in recent months what has been a national crisis. I understand the key messaging regarding the Covid-19 tracker app and the various tools that he has at his disposal. I urge that we look at other countries in Europe, such as Belgium, France and Germany, and even countries in Asia such as India, in order to complement our own Covid-19 tracker app, with a specific messaging service, be it through WhatsApp or through mobile providers. If messaging was made directly into people’s individual mobile phones every day or couple of days, with specific problems or problem areas highlighted and specific messaging around identifying cases and so on, this would be of great benefit. Another point is regarding the local electoral area, LEA, breakdown and the figures that are available on the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, website. The data on this website is updated every Thursday, so we will be waiting to have it uploaded later today, based on last week’s figures. Every week there is some chaos, as people are asking are we going into lockdown. Is the city, in the case of Cork, or the county, going into lockdown, or are both? I point people towards the HPSC website to look at their LEA but I urge the Minister and the Government, with a county the size of Cork which equates to the size of four or five counties, to consider seriously this point in future area specific lockdowns, be it urban or LEA. This needs to be looked at. I thank the House.

We have a number of speakers. I will start straight away with my eight minutes. First, I welcome the opportunity that we have been given to debate this plan. As he knows we have been looking for this debate for some time. As someone who has been calling for briefings and more interactions between health spokespersons and party leaders with Deputy Donnelly, as Minister, and with NPHET, I welcome an email I received from the Minister and his office yesterday saying that those briefings will be put in place. They are very useful and as much engagement as we can possibly have will be of benefit to all of us. Analysing, probity and scrutiny does not in any way underestimate the public health advice or indeed any decisions taken by the Minister. It strengthens the overall approach. I also join with the Minister in calling on people to do whatever they can to play their role in suppressing this virus. Local leadership can play a great part. Look no further than Waterford, and indeed Tipperary and Limerick, as examples of that. I spoke to the CEO of Waterford City & County Council yesterday on this matter and he quite rightly pointed out that what we should be looking at is more localised input into the public health advice that is given, having local influencers, using the local radio station, using the local GAA, sporting, rugby and football clubs and getting as many people as possible to spread the positive message. Indeed this should include politicians, from councillors to Oireachtas Members. That is what we did in Waterford over the past number of weeks and we can see that the numbers have gone down. They have also come down in Limerick and in Tipperary. That needs to be looked at. The national message is important. Sometimes the national message can get muddled if different counties are in different positions. The national public health officials and the Minister should also look at ways in which we incorporate more localised responses and leadership into the overall responses. The plan to live with the virus has to do a number of things. It has to keep schools open which we all accept. I have two children going to school and I want to see them continuing to go to school for all sorts of reasons but mainly for their own personal development. We also have to ensure that we keep people in jobs and that people can go to work, which is of great importance to them. We have to protect our health services, which includes not just the acute services but mental health services as well. We also, however, have to allow people to live. That is the more complicated part but it is important. Living means that people have to have social outlets and opportunities. We have to find ways where we can adhere to public health guidelines, keep socially distant, do all of the things that are required of us with the hand washing, cough etiquette, the wearing of a mask and all of the things that we need to do, but people need to live. When people hear that this will be with us for six, nine, 12 months or more, that is all the more reason that we must give people hope. We also have to stop blaming certain sections of society, whether it is pubs or restaurants, or young people, for the spread of the virus. Some of the commentary that I have seen in recent times about young people has been unhelpful. We need to speak to young people and to acknowledge that young people play a role of great importance in suppressing the virus. When mistakes are made these should be pointed out, but it has to be balanced and proportionate. We have to understand that young people need social opportunities. It is a big issue for them when they cannot go to college, when it is online, when they cannot interact with people and when they cannot go and meet their friends in the way they did before. We have to accept that and explain that it cannot be the way that it was. We also have to give people hope that it can be better. That is what the plan should be about. I need to put a number of questions to the Minister and I will give him two minutes to respond to them. One concerns comments from the acting CMO yesterday that the window of opportunity for it not to be a national issue is closing. Can the Minister reaffirm for this House that he was not talking about all counties going to level 3?That is a very important point. There was a significant amount of speculation on social media about what the acting CMO said. It is very important that there is clarity. The plan has five levels and different counties will be at different levels. If the Government is looking to move the whole State into level 3, that should be communicated. If it is not looking to do so, then the acting CMO needs to explain better what he meant by referring to this becoming a national issue in the context of the various phases. It is important that there is no misrepresentation of what is being said. I am giving the Minister the opportunity to clear that matter up from the Government's perspective. My final question relates to a comment made yesterday by the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar. He seemed to indicate that we should only use the incidence of hospitalisations to determine whether a county goes up a level or down a level, as opposed to all the other factors of which NPHET would take account. To me, that would be a departure from what is in the plan. That statement needs to be explained. Will the Minister explain what the Tánaiste meant? It is important that we do not have very senior politicians flying kites after the Government has published a plan that sets out guidelines. I ask the Minister to respond on those two issues.

Céilí lives in Naas and she is not doing well with Covid-19. She is three years old and profoundly deaf. As a result of a heart condition, she cannot be fitted with cochlear implants, so she relies on two hearing aids instead. Without them, the only sounds she can hear are vacuum cleaners and lawnmowers. As she is young, her hearing aids need to be adjusted regularly and her hearing needs to be tested regularly. The moulds must be snug in her ears. Just like Goldilocks, Céilí needs her hearing aids just right. However, for months during the summer she could not get them adjusted because of the bizarre political decision made in March to redeploy the highly skilled paediatric audiologists on whom Céilí depends as Covid-19 contact trackers. I have heard of service dogs smelling the virus, but I have never heard of audiologists hearing the virus. Children such as Céilí were told to go whistle and her hearing aids certainly did that. Her mother could hear the hearing aids whistling on the ground floor while she was on the first floor of their home. Céilí did not get an appointment until seven months later. Her mother is now seeking assurances that there will not be a repeat of this lack of service because Céilí is missing out on the tiny opportunity she has to learn how to speak in order that she can keep up with her peers. I spoke to her mother last night. She is frantic, and rightly so, because she knows her daughter needs to take this chance. Will the Minister guarantee that these highly skilled and desperately needed audiologists will be free to work with children such as Céilí who need their specialist skills, rather than wasting those skills contact tracing? When I think of the thousands of people who volunteered under the Be On Call For Ireland initiative, it seems to me that the past six months have been wasted. To give Céilí the chance to speak, I ask the Minister to listen to what she and her parents are saying. Will he guarantee that the audiologists will be available to carry out this necessary fitting?
#MarkWard	unknown-#MarkWard-party	unknown-#MarkWard-dob	unknown-#MarkWard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	199	If this was a real roadmap for living with Covid, I am afraid we would be turning into dead end after dead end when it comes to people seeking supports for mental health. I am a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response. I listened to expert after expert tell the committee that we are facing an avalanche of mental health issues. The experts stated that mental health services that were already out of date and not fit for purpose prior to Covid were facing unprecedented demands on their services. The many years of underinvestment in mental health supports are coming home to roost. The previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, spouted at every opportunity about how he got €1 billion spent on mental health last year. I remind the Minister that that is the same amount that was spent in 2009. The fact that there has been no substantial increase in mental health supports for more than a decade shows the indifference of the Government and previous Governments to mental health supports. Tonight on RTÉ1 there will be a special broadcast of a programme entitled "The Next Normal". It will relate how 33% or one third of the people surveyed for the programme have suffered with their mental health in the past six months. Mental health providers have stated that they are inundated with people crying out for help. The warning signs are stark, but there is no mention of mental health in the winter plan that has been developed to prepare for and manage the anticipated pressures this winter. That plan will be discussed later today but I will not have the opportunity to contribute on it. Where is the winter plan for mental health? Where is the roadmap for mental health supports? It is simply not good enough that we are forced to rely on non-governmental organisations and charities to plug the gap in State mental health supports. Only yesterday, the St. John of God group, which has provided mental health supports for more than a century, had to give notice to the HSE that it can no longer operate due to its financial difficulties. We are facing a tsunami of mental health issues due to Covid-19. Not only is the Government standing on the beach watching the wave approaching, it is also burying its head in the sand.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	200	In the little time I have, I wish to raise several points with the Minister. The Labour Party welcomes the roadmap. We consistently stated that it is necessary. The Minister should have had the acting CMO with him when it was announced. It might have helped with the deep issues that came across in communications. I was glad that he recently projected we need to be planning for this for six to nine months. It was with that in mind that I told the Taoiseach that we need to deal with the next six months differently from the way we dealt with the previous six months. I would like the Minister to listen to these remarks and maybe pass them on to Dr. Holohan who will be returning to his post. I acknowledge Dr. Glynn for the way he stood in for Dr. Holohan. Covid came at the best time for Ireland. We had a very good spring and then it was summer. Now we face six months of bad weather in autumn and winter. We need to give people hope. We need to prepare in two three-month projections. I am asking the Minister to set out such projections and give people hope that they will be able to enjoy Christmas, see their loved ones again and possibly travel outside the country. People need reassurance that they will be able to have a Christmas that at least resembles a normal Christmas. If all Deputies work together on the matter, would the Minister consider preparing two such projections? It is just a suggestion to give people hope. The Minister is a reasonable person. I know it is a suggestion that comes from the Opposition, but would the Minister consider preparing a plan for the weeks between now and Christmas, setting the situation out county by county, and stating that if we all pull together, we can have a Christmas when loved ones will be able to see each other. Another plan would be released in early January to bring us up to St. Patrick's Day. That would break the back of it and we would then be back into spring and summer and we would then see where we would be. On lockdowns and changing phases, I appreciate what is stated in the roadmap, but there is no doubt that some counties are adapting. My own county has one of the lowest rates, but as I stated on local media in an attempt to show leadership, that could change pretty quickly. Will the Government give consideration to more localised lockdowns, particularly in urban areas, rather than locking down entire counties? Has modelling been done on how that could work? Dr. Glynn stated that he was concerned about the amount of traffic in Dublin, but in an interview an hour or two ago, the Minister stated there was a lesser amount of traffic. We need to make sure the messaging is consistent. My principal question regards whether more localised lockdowns could be used and whether that has been modelled. On moving from phase to phase, the Government needs to give notice of such changes, especially when an area is moving into a more stringent phase. The hospitality and tourism industry needs more notice. Yesterday I discussed budgetary measures with the Taoiseach. We need to ensure there are budgetary measures in place to support sectors that are impacted by decisions to move to stricter phases. The hospitality and tourism sector, including those providing food and accommodation, lose out immediately when such decisions are made. We need to customise and mould the response to such circumstances.Similarly, students have paid their fees and also paid for accommodation, and then everything suddenly moved online. Turning to older people, my parents are both aged over 80. I have spoken about this issue before, and this situation has not been good for people in that category. We need to give those older people hope. During the phases to come, we need to give older people the capacity to socialise and have normal lives. They have given the most and paid the most taxes, but unfortunately they have the least amount of time left with us, on average. We need, however, to give those people hope and to do that we need a plan for that group of people. We also need a plan, and I want to see this in the budget, that will ensure that people with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disabilities, who are our most vulnerable and those we should be most concerned about, are looked after during the phases of this roadmap. I will move on to the last issues I want to raise. It has always been said that we follow the public health advice and the Government has always said that it follows the public health advice. We now know, however, about a date when the CMO wrote to the Government stating that the issue of sick pay had to be dealt with, but the Government did not follow that public health advice. The Government did not follow that advice, it is as simple as that and that is an anomaly. We are asking people to follow public health advice, so when NPHET asks the Government to do things and but it does not, I ask that the Government to please explain why it is not doing what has been recommended. I ask that because I see that as a complete contradiction. One issue I really want to get to is the area of testing and tracing. It is obvious that we must let those therapists and specialists who are doing some of this work back to their day jobs. I understand that the Minister agrees with me. I have some ideas about how we could undertake the recruitment necessary for that roll-out, but I want to present them to the Minister personally and privately. I do not have time to do that in detail here, but I will do it separately. In addition, we also need to look at other technologies, such as rapid testing. We need to examine how we are going to facilitate people coming in through the airports. I met some of the people who look at this testing and I have had a Covid-19 test, which has a high level of accuracy, and I had the result in ten minutes. The test was done in front of me. We need to look at what other technologies being used across Europe and the world. We must examine how can we use them if we can get them through the regulatory process quickly enough and if Dr. Cillian de Gascun and his team approve them. Might it be possible that we could model it so that we could bring such testing into some sectors, test and check the process several times and then use that method?  I state that because we need that type of technology rolled out into society to allow people to go about their business a little bit more freely. I encourage the Minister to look at other technologies. We have the analogue version of testing, but we also need to look at the digital version of testing. They may have other issues, but we need to check them all out. If we can use those technologies then they may have a positive impact on some of this roadmap, how we move through the phases and how we open up society and allow businesses to operate. I ask the Minister to please take on some of my suggestions.

These measures were initially introduced with a short timeframe of several weeks in mind. The virus remains in our society today, but more is now known about it than when it first came to Ireland in March. According to our current knowledge, a vaccine for the virus will not be available within the next 18 months, at a minimum. Considering the rate of fatalities from Covid-19 compared with other established human illnesses and the potential long-term consequences for society, I feel that a reassessment of the objectives of how we manage the virus should be considered. The capacity of our ICUs is a critical metric for determining the significance of the level of cases. While it is understood that it is beneficial to reduce the number of cases in general as this ultimately reduces the number of deaths, the ratio between the number of cases and deaths and our ability to impact on that ratio should be considered and the necessary investment in healthcare capacity should be prioritised by the Government to deal with that issue. If we have an adequate level of ICU provision to deal with the level of cases within society at present, then we should look to balance this against the level of restrictions throughout our society and the impact that such restrictions are having on the quality of life of our citizens. It must also be noted that the nature of restrictions must be questioned. Under the medium-term nature of the restrictions, as compared with the short-term measures in March, people are likely to forgo social interactions and reduce their social contacts. This can be seen in the increase of uncontrolled social gatherings. A logical conclusion to draw from that, therefore, considering the balancing act required between ensuring hospital capacity is not overrun and the level of societal damage that restrictions are causing, is that a strong case can be made for reopening controlled environments such as restaurants, hotels and pubs. Overall, clearer objectives regarding the significance of the meaning of the level of cases need to be considered alongside the potential long-term consequences of restricting part of our economy. If capital investment is required in the healthcare sector, the initial upfront cost will be mitigated by the potential savings of lost economic growth arising from maintaining a level of restrictions. Regarding damage to our economy, a 2020 report from the World Bank recognised the need to incentivise a switch to more sustainable production processes, including a move towards a great digitalisation and green investment which will enhance the productivity of our economy. There must be a recognition that the dynamic of the economy has changed and it is not sustainable to continue to support industries in their current form. A realignment of resources should be undertaken during the budget. At the same time, we must be conscious of the economic scarring of certain sections of our society in adapting to this changing work environment. Systems must be put in place to ensure that reskilling and job reactivation schemes are put in place so that the levels of inequality within the economy do not widen, as stressed within the World Bank report. Large capital investment programmes should be pursued across several areas where the economic return on the investment will be redeemed over time. With current Irish borrowing costs at record low levels, this is an excellent opportunity to raise the capital necessary to pursue such initiatives. Turning to the impact on young people, this must be more of a priority for the Government. The long-term development of the country is dependent upon young people buying into the institutional structures of our State. If the level of trust that our young people have in this State is diminished, that can make it harder to have a functioning institutional framework within society and to mobilise knowledge and the productive capacities of a significant sector of our society. If this issue is not addressed, it will make it far more difficult to return to the level of economic growth required to return our economy, country and society to the standards of living we enjoyed previously.

The Minister is doing a fine job. He has the best wishes of this side of the House and, I hope, the other side of the House. The Minister is in the position at a unique time in history when we are faced with a pandemic for the first time in a century. That is quite a burden and responsibility to deal with. He is entitled to the support of his peers and he certainly has it. I want to focus on one facet of this plan, because I know some of my colleagues have dwelt on the different aspects of the Roadmap for Living with Covid-19. The strategy has much to recommend it and there is much to read in it. Clearly, there has been much thought and planning and an awareness of the impact that phase one of Covid-19 had on people. There has been a huge amount of learning and I want to come back to one specific aspect of that. In a previous professional chapter in my own life I practised as a psychotherapist and I took a particular interest in the literature and research around loss. Generally speaking, the public - I hope I am not underestimating them - tend to associate loss and grieving with the loss of a loved one. The literature, however, tells us that we can go through the same stages of grieving, if perhaps not so acutely, when we lose many other different things that we take for granted in life. That can include loss of health, loss of status, loss of routine, loss of friendships, loss of work colleagues, loss of work, loss of business, loss of a partner present during labour and loss of having a partner present during pregnancy-related appointments.It can include loss of hugs, loss of granny, loss of granddad, loss of work colleagues and loss of joy. My sister sent me a photograph on WhatsApp recently of myself and herself and her husband outside Mulligan's this time last year celebrating the drawn all-Ireland game and the picture really hit me right between the eyes. What I saw in one little moment encapsulated what has been taken away from us. There we were with not a care in the world drinking our pints and the people around us very happy, and all of that has been robbed of us. In the literature, they tend to say, generally speaking, that there are five stages in grieving a loss. The most underestimated response to loss is anger when people do not get to express their feelings around the loss that they have just experienced. I have elucidated just a few of those kind of losses. We could have a much longer list than that. As a parliament and as a society, we need to watch out for anger. There is a significant amount of unexpressed anger in society at present. I am particularly taken with the emphasis and the research work done. I am looking forward to what the Minister will produce in practical terms because there is a good roadmap in, I think, section 6 on resilience and community. I am taken with the work that SpunOut has done, particularly with the generation aged 16 to 25. As Dr. Tony Bates said in an article in The Irish Times this morning, people in this age group have suffered more than most because it is the time when they develop primarily through contact and interactions with their peer group and that has been denied to them. Do we begrudge them when they break out of the rules a little? I would side with Dr. Bates on this. We need to practise the rules but we need to be human too and resist pointing the finger. We need to give people hope. How does one give people hope? Generally, when we get bad news, we learn to live with it, cope with it, absorb it, internalise it, digest it, grieve the consequences of it and move on. There is no moving on with this pandemic because we do not know when it will go. This means that there will be continued losses carried on by society. I often think of how useful Dr. Maureen Gaffney's morning piece with the late Gay Byrne on the radio used to be years ago. She psychologically analysed the nation and dealt with its problems. I know that much of this stuff happens on social media and it is really positive. I think the Government needs to step into this space. There is one useful thing we could do. It is not for the Minister; it is for the Cabinet. We need to do something special for people this Christmas, such as give city and county councils significant budgets for fantastic public lighting displays that people can go out safely and admire. We need to put some thought into this. It will be a Christmas like no other and the State needs to step in. I refer to all the messages people are receiving from the State. I looked at the make-up of NPHET this morning. It is such a fine body of people, generally from a medical background. I hope I am not being harsh on them when I say that the people who have a psychological, mental health or well-being background are on the administrative side rather than on the medical side. In Ireland, we tend to separate physical and mental health from each other instead of looking at them as one integrated piece. We have a big task as a Government on the mental health and well-being piece. People across society, even people who have been virtually unaffected by the virus, have suffered losses. It could be that they cannot go to see their son or daughter playing the local sport. That is a loss. People are angry about that. The Government needs to acknowledge that. In our messaging, we need to find a way to give people hope. Hope has been missing from much of the messaging coming from the Government. We need to devise a way to give people something to cling on to or hope for, whether it is the promise of a great festival the likes of which has never been seen in the country or whether it is devising ways of memorialising those people who have been lost to Covid, even now at distance in our churches, in our places of worship or in a humanistic way. There is much good. I am looking forward to the outworkings of the SpunOut investigation into the needs of younger people, but this is a cross-society requirement. In bringing this back to his Cabinet colleagues, the Minister should watch out for anger, which is the most underestimated response to loss.

I express sympathy again to the family and friends of those who have passed way and those who have suffered throughout this pandemic and crisis. Covid-19 has seen the decimation of many small businesses across the State, certainly across my constituency. I have been in contact with many of them over the past number of months since the initial shutdown and also as the guidelines changed and came out and we went into different phases. I am sure all Members will be aware of this. I am sure many of these businesses and similar ones in the Minister's constituency have been in touch with him time and again. They are terrified of what is to come. They are terrified at what has happened. They are afraid for their businesses, for their employees and for their employees' families and loved ones and how they will see their way through this. As the Minister will be aware, all of these business people work extremely hard to pay their bills, keep their businesses going, pay their employees and create local employment. Many of them have dug deep into their reserves financially, psychologically and emotionally to deal with the Covid-19 crisis, to reopen their businesses and to get their workers back to work so that they can also pay their bills. Some of the businesses that come to mind in my constituency include the gym that I go to, Ger Conroy Fitness, and a wonderful water babies group in the swimming pool in Junction 6. There is also a salt cave, which was a brand new business that had only opened in February. Those involved had put their heart and soul into it. These are people who had come to the country, had an idea and wanted to build a future in this country. I have seen many such businesses struggle with it. The overarching theme I am getting from constituents is that there is confusion over the guidelines and that is what we need to get right. There is fear around how they can continue to open up and close down. That is what happened many of the businesses that have been in contact with me. I will mention as an example a café which is right next door to a bookies. The café is closed to people inside. They have tables outside to try and keep the business going and they offer a takeaway service, but the bookies next door has virtually no guidelines or rules. Up to 30 people are allowed in depending on the size. There are no names being taken. There is no rule on how long the customers can remain within. Two businesses are operating side by side under the same guidelines but there is confusion about why in one case, customers can stay all day if they wish because there are no rules to say that they cannot and in the other case, customers cannot even walk in the front door and have to stay outside. People are looking for clarity and an understanding of where they need to be. That is where we need to be in relation to moving forward.

I will be as brief as I can. The first is in relation to Cork. There is little other talk than concern around the potential move to level 3. There is also the very serious situation in hospitals. Dr. Ronan Boland told Claire Byrne's show on Tuesday that there were just three acute beds left between the Mercy University Hospital and Cork University Hospital, CUH, to treat any acute case that might arise among Cork's 500,000 people. Yesterday, the Mercy hospital said that patients should seek care elsewhere due to the pressure on the system. It is clear there is a particular issue regarding hospital beds in Cork. Currently, there are issues with regard to community hospitals and issues like that, which I know have been discussed in other areas, and that due to the pressures they may not be admitting additional patients. Can we look at that with a view to resolving some of those issues, even at a later stage, because beds in community hospitals and step-down beds relieve the pressure on acute hospitals? Whatever the case, we need to find additional capacity in hospitals in Cork. The other issue I want to raise is that schools are open. I welcome that and give credit to the people involved in that, including many people in the Department and the Minister, but we need a specific plan to keep the schools open. The Minister knows that teachers and school staff are very concerned about the difficulty with regard to social distancing. We have 1,300 schools in the State with classes of more than 30 children. There is a need for a significant investment to fund and deliver additional space and the staff required for them. We need additional space to ensure that schools can adhere to social distancing and safety for the children, the school staff and everyone connected to the schools because there is a great deal of concern and it needs to be addressed. There are issues around communication also. I have corresponded with the Minister on that but it needs to be addressed.

It was really good and very moving. There was so much in it and I hope his Government colleagues were listening because there are major issues about loss in many different ways, the real fear that that will engender anger and the absolute need for people to be given hope. I want to thank the Deputy for that. I believe his contribution stopped many people in their tracks and made us think. I have a few points to make. The Minister referred to this document as a roadmap. He is probably the only one here referring to it as a roadmap. It is generally referred to as a plan. The previous document we had was a roadmap going from stage to stage. This is a plan and it is more accurately described as a framework because it sets out a structure or framework where we can see that if we meet certain unspecified criteria in terms of danger we will move to the next level. It is helpful from that point of view and, hopefully, people will become more familiar with it and motivated to pull together in order to go down the levels. I have to say that this is not a strategy; I have said that already to the Taoiseach. I am not sure at this stage, seven months into the Covid-19 pandemic, exactly what is the strategy. It is not clear to me and I believe it is not clear to many people. That is critical to keeping people with the Minister. What we have done is concentrated, supposedly, on having a very good testing and tracing system. That has been a patchy experience. Ultimately, however, the approach that is being taken is that every time there is an upsurge there is a lockdown. That is not a sustainable strategy by any means, not least for business, but for everybody in living their lives. I ask the Minister again to ensure that consideration is given to suggested strategies and learning, in particular, from the experience in other countries. There are many elements in terms of what we should be doing to try to minimise the incidence of Covid-19. There are many things we are ignoring in that regard, and I will come to them shortly, but it must be to come as close as possible to eliminating the virus. People talk about zero Covid-19. Those same people are saying that the aim should be at least zero. By doing that we identify all of the high-risk areas and then take action on those. That does need to be the approach but there needs to be at least debate on what is the best strategy and the pros and cons of different approaches. That debate has not taken place. The second point I would make is that messaging is key in terms of keeping the public with the Minister. The launch of this document was a missed opportunity; we have said a good bit about that. It was a time when people were listening in but the messages were very unclear and confused. That was a missed opportunity but we now need to make up for that. The Taoiseach mentioned a couple of weeks ago the possibility of using influencers. I thought that was a very good idea and I suggested that it would have our support. It is not just about influencers on social media for young people. It is about influencing all different categories of people, including those older and middle-aged, people with different interests, sports people, people with an interest in music and different ethnic groups. The message needs to be tailored to those different cohorts. We should be using influencers because with all due respect, many people have switched off watching the standard six o'clock news or reading the broadsheets. People access their news or information on different platforms and in different media and we need to get to people through those different media by using people to whom those different cohorts will listen. What is happening about that? We have been talking about it for a long time. The next point I would make is on decision-making. NPHET has very significant power. It is making major decisions that are affecting every part of our lives and our country. I said a long time ago that we needed to broaden out the decision-making and that we needed a task force that drew expertise from different areas. It is regrettable we did not do that. We need to have people who understand sport, business, logistics and travel in there who also have an expertise in risk assessment because every aspect of our lives carries risk in respect of Covid-19. It is a matter of assessing the level of that risk and then balancing that risk. In the absence of that kind of expertise, there is an element of guesswork and closing down everything is not sustainable. Also in terms of the decision-making, I find it very hard to understand the reason the Opposition has been completely excluded from any kind of debate, and I am talking about engaging debate, not shouting across the floor of the Dáil. I am talking about bringing people into a room and looking at different aspects of it. As the Minister knows, there have been hardly any briefings since this Government took office. That is a big mistake. Party leaders and spokespersons want to be involved in that. We have legitimate questions and proposals to make and there should be a forum established. The Taoiseach said two weeks ago that he would give consideration to that. We have heard nothing since. It is absolutely essential that the 14-day tracing back happens. On travel, and I will talk more to the Minister about this later, I refer to the example that was given at the briefing last night of two people who had been away coming back, mixing with others and spreading the virus to 30 other people. We have to go back to the source. I take it those people were abroad. It would be very interesting to know where they were but when we look at the figures of people coming into the country at the ports and airports, effectively, there is no oversight or monitoring of where the people have been or what they do when they come back. That is a glaring omission in terms of any approach to tackling this virus.

The Minister, his Department and, importantly, the very many front-line HSE staff are doing a great job in grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, which it now appears we will be co-existing with for some time to come. Covid-19 has thrown a major curveball at this country. Ways of life have changed utterly, and possibly forever, and politically we are now dealing with very real and deep issues in our constituencies and communities. I would like to bring public orthodontic and dental care to the Minister's attention. With up to 40% of HSE community dental staff currently redeployed to help with contact tracing and testing, there is a backlog of those waiting on public lists for essential treatments. Those who can afford private care to short-circuit that delay are doing so but at great personal cost. I ask the Minister to propose at Cabinet some form of enhanced tax rebate for parents who ordinarily would have brought their child to the public dentist or orthodontist but these days are paying for private treatment. The next issue I wish to raise concerns Covid outbreaks in schools. It was great to see 1 million students return to school last month. The reopening-of-schools roadmap has been one of the major successes of this Government. The Irish Primary Principals’ Network has a major concern, however. When there is a suspected or confirmed case of Covid in a school, the principal seeks advice from the HSE as to what actions he or she should take. The HSE, at that moment, effectively takes over the management and communication of the event, and the principal defers functions to it. Ideally, the HSE would communicate rapidly and clearly but, in some cases of which I am aware, it has taken up to 24 hours for the communication to filter out from the HSE. In that 24-hour period, the principal is effectively gagged. There may be a member of staff with an acute underlying health problem or living at home with an elderly or high-risk parent but the principal is prevented from having a cautionary word with his or her colleagues. I ask the Minister to take this up with HSE. We cannot have principals stewing and stressing over having knowledge of a Covid case in their schools without having the sanction to inform their staff. I welcome the fact that the Government's winter plan will inject unprecedented support into our health system this winter. This €600 million will definitely help to resource our health system better over the very tough months ahead. The funding, while welcome as a medium-term measure, does not fully address the challenges that we in Clare and the wider mid-west region face in terms of hospital care. Before Covid hit this country, University Hospital Limerick was consistently the worst off hospital in terms of trolley numbers. The much-needed fix here is very obvious; it lies in increased funding and supports for the other hospitals of the region, namely Ennis General Hospital and Nenagh and St. John's hospitals. I am glad the programme for Government commits to hiring more consultants but I would like to know the strategy that exists to send some of them west of the Shannon. That is certainly a concern we have in Clare. I wish to address the issue of maternity hospitals. Generally speaking, being pregnant is a medical condition, not an illness. Most women attending for scans or antenatal appointments are in good health. On this basis, maternity hospitals need to be considered to be somewhat different from other hospitals. I hope public health guidance will change in the quickest time possible so more men can attend appointments with their partner or spouse. I was fortunate to be able to attend appointments with my wife when our three children were expected. Some leave the room full of jubilation and butterflies in the stomach but, for those who get bad news in the scanning room, it can be a devastating moment and people need considerable support. Either way, it is a landmark moment in someone's life and the expectant mother needs to be fully supported. I hope current arrangements can be revisited urgently.

I will start simply by echoing the statements of other Members on the direction of the roadmap regarding businesses closing, reopening and then closing again and the long-term consequences not only for our economy but also for those who work in the businesses and industries that have been devastated over recent months. As we know and have accepted at this stage, we will be living with Covid for well in excess of 12 months, if not more. Even if a vaccination or feasible treatment is developed in the next few months, it will probably take 12 to 18 months to roll it out to the country. We have to take that on board. I want to focus primarily on mental health, fatigue associated with Covid, messaging and the lack of positivity, among citizens as opposed to the State, regarding how well we as a country have managed to deal with this virus. In spring, there were camaraderie and togetherness in communities throughout the country, with people working together to help the vulnerable, including the elderly and the immunocompromised. The exceptional weather probably helped to raise people's spirits but we are now approaching the winter, when we will be facing 14 or 15 hours of darkness per day. In the context of mental health, the manner in which people are being bombarded with information, often negative, in the guise of necessary information is problematic. NPHET and the Minister need to spend a little more time talking about the fact that citizens in general have done exceptional work in stepping away from one another and taking the responsible steps of wearing a mask, washing hands and respecting cough etiquette. To echo the comments of the previous speaker, it is problematic when the media, to a certain extent, and others regard younger people or other groups as the cause of a resurgence of Covid-19. We are all in this together, or so we have been saying for the past seven months. We have to take responsibility. The scenes from Galway over the past couple of days really make one's heart sink. The scenes in nearly every village and town I visited in the past few months would make one's heart sink. To be constructive, however, I want to reiterate what I have said to the Minister. In fairness to him, he has already implemented some of the requests made of him regarding the provision of information allowing people to see where there is Covid in their community. Most people - 1.8 million, in fact - have a Covid app that allows NPHET to communicate directly to them. That app and the opportunity it presents are not being used properly by NPHET. There is an opportunity to convey information directly to people about localised outbreaks and what people could and should be doing to prevent them. I have not yet seen what I suggest and it is critical that we now take that step.

We thrive on this identity not only domestically but right across the globe. The arts, however, have been decimated by this pandemic and we must rebuild them. We can start small by allowing dance classes to return. We know that dancing bolsters physical and mental health. It improves posture and flexibility. It lifts our mood and it eases our anxiety. For children, dance classes offer so much more than just dance. They provide an opportunity to make friends, learn a new skill and, most important, build confidence. Kids in my area - Lucan and the rest of Dublin Mid-West - are desperately missing their Dancity classes, their Irish dancing classes and the beats of Zumba. Dancing is a fun activity that sharpens the mind, increases strength and builds social bonds. For older people, dance classes may be the highlight of the week but, owing to Covid, they can no longer rely on that social outlet. Loneliness is often described as being more detrimental to older people's health than physical illness but not every older person wants to play bridge, bingo or bowls. Some want to dance. Let us face it: human beings of all ages, cultures, religions and countries all love to dance. Dance, whether it is Irish dancing or the Maori haka, is a part of life. While many of us have got used to dancing in our sitting rooms during lockdown, there is nowhere better to dance than at a live gig. The live entertainment industry is bursting with talent. It is an industry that has offered employment to everyone from sound engineers and roadies to musicians and dancers. All are real people and all are missing their income and outlet right now. All are in need of hope right now. The Minister has the opportunity to give them hope. We have plenty of opportunities to facilitate smaller, more intimate crowds in large venues using social distancing. We have the ability to tweak the pandemic unemployment payment rules so people can do the odd gig or resurrect their dance class without losing the payment that has become a lifeline for them. Let us reignite the arts by thinking outside the box and by moving outside our silos. Music and dance are so much more than jobs or hobbies; they are passions. I do not know one artist who would not jump at the chance to play to a crowd again, no matter how small. They live for performing and so does the next generation of artists and dancers, who should be preparing for their Christmas concert right now. We must offer them hope and trust so we can get dance back in our legs, music back in our ears and creativity back flowing in our veins.

Front-line staff are at burnout and cannot continue to work overtime in understaffed conditions. This is not safe or fair to the staff or the patients they care for. Trolleys line the corridors and there is not enough staff to look after patients. Staff are being moved from one area to another. I welcome that extra capacity has been provided, as in the case of Mayo, in terms of the stepping down of patients from Mayo University Hospital to the Sacred Heart home, but extra staff are also needed and nobody seems to understand that. There is also an issue around communication with staff. Decisions are being made without staff being consulted. We do not need reports and expertise to know of the issues in our health services. We need only to listen to the front-line staff. We need to listen to nurses and the health care assistants who are on the wards coping with the people coming in and out of the hospitals. Unless managers listen to the front-line staff, I fear for what is going to happen this winter. It is only 1 October and in Mayo there are already trolleys lining the hospital corridors. There will be many more trolleys lining those corridors and not enough staff even to look after patients in the corridors. This is a serious situation. Staff tell me that every night they go into work they do not know where they are going, who will be left with them or where they are going to be. Emergency meetings are happening without them. They are being treated like pawns on a chessboard in terms of trying to deal with a really serious situation. We want people to live with Covid, we do not people to die from it. Many nurses are in fear of losing their registration because of the stress that they are under and the mistakes that they may make. The message that I want to go out from this debate is that we need to listen to the staff. They have the answers and they are willing to work. They are already working very, hard and I thank them for the work they are doing.

We all appreciate that this framework was needed and that it is a roadmap for living with the virus over the coming months. However, it quickly became clear that the announcement was not as clear as was hoped. From day one, we heard Dublin was being placed on a type of level 2.5. It has since moved to level 3.5 or thereabouts. All of us in this House appreciate the need for this type of roadmap as we learn to live with the virus. While this framework reduces the numbers of people permitted to attend weddings and sports events, there is no mention of reduced class sizes in our schools. The Government has been forced to extend the deadline for new applicants to the pandemic unemployment payment. It must be accepted that this payment and other wage supports need to be secured for the foreseeable future while there is a possibility of rolling lockdowns and closure of businesses. There has been no mention of people with disabilities in these guidelines. These people are being left behind by the Government in terms of reduced capacity in our care centres and reduced respite services. Prior to Covid, people with disabilities were attending classes five days per week. Many of them have seen either a reduction in the number of days or hours that they can attend, or both in some cases. Regarding visitation rights in our hospitals and care homes, I appreciate that the framework allows for visits across the health care system, and I particularly welcome that it allows for visits on compassionate grounds. We need to ensure that this continues as we cannot underestimate the need for family support for people at the start of life and at the end of life. As a mother of five children, I had the experience of having my fourth child completely on my own. Thankfully, everything went okay. I cannot imagine how that experience would have been or is for any woman left completely on her own in a clinical environment. The announcement of this roadmap was welcomed but it only ever appeared to give a broad outline of the procedures by which we are to live. The specifics of it were never detailed. For example, I have heard from principals of schools in Clare that they are winging the guidelines, with some of them carrying out temperature checks and others not doing so. They feel that they are burdened with ensuring that the guidelines are being adhered to. The messaging around the guidelines has not been clear, concise or coherent. This needs to be rectified.

They have endured incredible hardship and they are facing a grim outlook for the foreseeable future. Despite all of the suffering and hardship they have endured, the situation, once again, is deteriorating. The message that we are all in this together, which underpinned the huge efforts that people made in the early stage of the pandemic, has been blown out the window by the Government. Day in and day out young people are being lectured about their behaviour or supposedly endangering public health because of family gatherings or other gatherings in their homes. They are being berated yet it is deemed disproportionate to ask a judge of the Supreme Court who attended a party to resign. It is one law for society and another law for those who are supposed to uphold the law. The Government is allowing the banks once again to crawl over the backs of people who have lost their jobs and income as a result of Covid. The pandemic unemployment payment is being cut as these people face into further restrictions and the likelihood for many of their jobs and income being severely reduced for the foreseeable. At the same time, Ministers of State are given shocking pay increases on already excessive salaries and politicians are to receive pay increases. All of this does nothing to underpin the solidarity that we need to face the threat of Covid-19. The Government manages, in a PR, self-protecting way, the information about what is actually happening with Covid-19 rather than being honest with people and trusting their intelligence by giving them the information they need and a part in the debate on what type of strategy is necessary when it is very obvious that the strategy is failing. I held a briefing last night with the zero-Covid island group which believes we are heading back towards lockdown because of the failing Government strategy, yet the Government does not want to entertain an open and honest debate about that strategy. The Government needs to change or it is going to lose the faith of the people. In fact, I think it is already losing the faith of the people.

They were attempting to draw attention to the terrible financial plight that they face with their families and the lack of action on the part of the Government. If Cork is moved to level 3, their financial position will worsen, as will the financial position of many other working people.People need supports, including the supports that have been taken away from them. Those supports must be put back in place. I refer, among other things, to the cut in the pandemic unemployment payment. People had €50 or €100 per week which they need taken from their pockets last week. That must be reinstated. Incidentally, taxi drivers and other people who are aged over 65 years need that payment too. Yesterday, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government released information about the numbers living in emergency accommodation in the State at the end of August. The number in emergency accommodation in Cork had increased from 376 adults at the end of July to 400 adults at the end of August. It is insane to force people to go traipsing around the city looking for accommodation instead of keeping them in their current accommodation. The blanket ban on evictions, which the Government ended at the beginning of August, must be reinstated now, at the start of October. That is not special pleading for Cork or Dublin. It must be done nationwide. Catriona Twomey is a well-known figure in Cork. She is the head of Cork Penny Dinners, a soup kitchen for needy people. She recently expressed her fears and concerns to The Echo in Cork about the effect of a continuing pandemic coinciding with the winter season on the mental health of the people with whom she deals. She said:We have already lost so many people. Now we're worried that we are going to lose more. ... This [the issue of suicide] hasn't levelled off since March and the Government is going to have to take it seriously.Implicit in those words is a feeling that the Government is not taking it seriously. The spend on mental health in the State must be doubled immediately. Catriona's call for on-street, one-to-one mental health supports must be acted on straight away.

As a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, I have had, perhaps, more opportunity than many Members to hear the different perspectives on this pandemic and the many opinions on how the Government should deal with restrictions, health interventions, testing regimes and the devastating economic and social impact on society. There are those whom one might describe as the Covid hawks, who want zero tolerance and maximum restrictions. On the other hand, there are those who might not quite be calling for herd immunity but who are seeking to tip the balance towards living with the virus more than public health restrictions allow. My view is that the Government has treaded a middle course between the two in dealing with the pandemic. It has sought to protect lives and livelihoods in equal measure. In many ways, we have protected the most vulnerable in society from this virus, and the financial intervention for those who are working and not working has been unprecedented. I welcome the plan. It helps us look forward for the next six to nine months. The strategy is to suppress the virus. It is a public health-led plan which involves acting quickly and locally and targeting the spread of the virus to protect lives, health services, schools, colleges and jobs. It has easily understood geographical boundaries for restrictions and easily understood levels of restriction. Each level is not a judgment on how a particular sector is operating or even how safe that activity is. Instead, it is a judgment on how that activity increases discretionary social contact or decreases it. That is the guiding light in this plan. That is the coherence and beauty of the plan. Undoubtedly, this virus has had a massive impact on mental health. Sport is a great outlet to help deal with that. I understand the restrictions, but I call on the Minister to review the restrictions in level 3 for fitness classes, which I believe can be meticulously balanced for fitness classes that help mental health and have safe regimes. I have been contacted by entrepreneurs who have invested in sport and business in my local community. They are on their knees. I believe we can help them while still protecting against the virus. We can also do the same regarding sports matches without spectators for children. I call on Sport Ireland to have a level playing field in how it governs restrictions for all sports codes.

It is a valuable contribution to the debate. It is also a valuable contribution to the public in terms of how to deal with this crisis. I also welcome what the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, said earlier, that in this chapter of Covid-19 the State is seeking to open up the country while, at the same time, trying to suppress the virus. It is important that Members of the House discuss this issue and how the country should propose to deal with it. Many issues must be taken into account when deciding, as a society, how to respond to the pandemic. Obviously, public health must predominate, but other factors must be taken into account as well, such as mental health, particularly of younger people, and the economic impact of the restrictions on society. I believe we probably have three options, and the Government has done well in identifying the roadmap it is setting out in the Covid-19 plan. I do not have great wisdom on this matter. No Member of the House is absolutely sure what the correct answer is. Although this is not an unprecedented event, it is an extraordinary one. Some individuals advocate that we should take the elimination route. I have great respect for the individuals who advocate that, but I am concerned about how attainable it is. When one sees how this virus is spreading around the world and sees its spread in Ireland in light of the restrictions we have been imposing for six months, my opinion, and I could be wrong, is that we will not be able to eliminate the virus from this country in the short term. A second option is to reduce human activity to a considerable degree in the hope that the reduction will result in a reduction in the case load of the virus and consequent deaths. We are seeking to do that in a measured way under the Government, but we must also recognise there are consequences to that. Deputy McAuliffe mentioned the impact it is having on sport. For the life of me I cannot understand why we cannot let children play matches. One of the great public health measures for children is to enable them to get involved in sport. What we learn from this pandemic and our reaction to it is that our response in any area is not risk-free. There is no risk-free response we can take to this virus. I am concerned about reducing human activity and if we are going from one level up to another and down again. It is going to have a consequential impact on mental health and other public health issues. There are other public health issues facing the country, be it mental health, cancer or heart disease. All are very serious, and that is not in any way denigrating the seriousness of Covid-19 as a disease and pandemic. A third option is what the Government has set out, which is trying to live with Covid-19 as best we can while suppressing it. That is the approach we have adopted. We must ensure that it is a measured approach. Obviously, it will have consequences for people if it is the case that we are moving up levels all the time. As time goes on, we will be able to see what the impact is of moving up a level and whether it will simply reduce the numbers in the short term and when we go from the higher level to a lower level the numbers return again. We are all learning as this develops and we need to keep a close eye on it. We should not try to fool ourselves into believing that we can deal with this pandemic as though it is some other political issue such as housing, homelessness or unemployment.The language we use in respect of it is that we are going to fight this. I hear people say we are going to crush it into the ground. I do not think we are ever going to be able to do that. We need to recognise that around the world they have tried to control this virus through coercion, regulation and law. Regrettably, that approach has not succeeded yet. That does not mean it will not succeed and I am not advocating that we go down the route of complete libertarianism where there is no regulation. There has to be strict regulation in respect of it. However, we need to recognise that where coercion and regulation have been used around the world, to date they have not succeeded. I know people who disagree and refer to China, Taiwan and New Zealand. Certainly they are at present in a different, much better position than Ireland although I am sceptical as to what is the actual position in China. In other countries around the world, particularly in Europe, we can see that notwithstanding the enormous efforts that have been made by societies and countries to try to ensure that we get on top of this pandemic, as the restrictions have been lifted the numbers have inevitably risen. The reason that has happened is that we are social animals. We have to cut down on our sociability but we made a decision centuries ago that we were going to live proximate to other humans. That is what cities and large towns are about. It is what schools and collective community activity are about. It is very difficult to tell people to pull away from that proximity to other humans. It is a huge ask. We have done extremely well in this country to date and we should recognise that. It is difficult. Deputy McAuliffe spoke about sports and others have spoken about young people. I have spoken probably too much about young people. There are two groups that have suffered very much from this. One is young people and the other is the elderly, who have been put in a position in their lives where they are very fearful about going out and meeting younger persons and their relatives. I suppose they have to be very careful. NPHET was before the Covid-19 committee yesterday and gave us some very valuable information. The median age of the 1,803 people who have died to date is in the late 80s. Obviously elderly people need to be particularly careful. I know it is a dangerous disease that affects everyone but people who are elderly need to be particularly careful, especially if they have underlying conditions. The roadmap is a good map. We need to give it time. We need to listen to the public health advice we are being given. However, we also need to recognise that we cannot close our minds to the societal and economic impacts, the other public health impacts and the mental health impacts of the restrictions. We can see the consequences of the pandemic by looking at the tragic figures representing those who have died in Ireland and around the world. What we cannot see are the repercussions of the restrictions around the world and here. They will be measured in mental health and other public health issues, the impact on children and elderly people and in moving from a society we have built up over many centuries.

I do not think we ever really realised how important sport is. For those watching and participating in sport it has been immensely important in so many ways. However, the public health guidelines for team sports are very unclear, as Deputy McAuliffe mentioned. There is much confusion and unanswered questions for clubs playing soccer. I raised this issue with the Taoiseach yesterday and his sidestep was very impressive but that was all. I got no real clarity. Different sporting organisations are interpreting the rules differently. It is possible to play or train with a rugby or GAA club but not a soccer club. St. Pat's CYFC women's team cannot play their matches but the same players can play for their GAA club. Juvenile soccer players cannot train with their clubs unless they are part of the elite structure yet the same kids can train with their rugby or GAA teams. These examples are replicated across Dublin to Aungier Celtic, Liffey Wanderers, Kilbarrack and Clontarf. Right across Dublin clubs are being excluded from playing their sport. The Government has taken a back seat on this and has only added to the lack of clarity around public health rules for national sporting organisations. The wording of the guidelines is not clear enough. If it was, all sports would be treated equally. The Government needs to give clear guidance to sports organisations. Why can amateur GAA sports clubs and amateur rugby clubs play while amateur soccer is excluded? No one is willing to answer this question. Playing sports should be open to everybody. Thousands of kids are missing out on football and it is impacting on their mental health. Covid does not attack amateur soccer players and leave amateur GAA and rugby players alone. All sports clubs, whether rugby, soccer, GAA or hockey, should be open or closed at the same time. All sports must be treated equally.
#PatriciaRyan	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-party	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-dob	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	221	Today is International Day of Older Persons, a group of people who have been left behind in the many roadmap announcements over the past few months. I have asked on numerous occasions in this House that the Government consider older people when formulating plans and that it consider those who have different abilities. We cannot continue to ask them to live like hermits. We need a balance between physical and mental health. They need to be allowed to have a quality of life. Day care centres need to reopen. They are an invaluable service and we should be investing in them. A lady called into my office the day after the roadmap for living with Covid-19 was announced. Her words to me were very telling. She said that if people were not confused, they were not paying attention. I ask the Minister of State to save our money, ditch the PR firm and talk to the National Adult Literacy Agency for advice on delivering messages in plain and easy to understand language. On this International Day of Older Persons I commend all groups working with older people on ensuring they have an improved quality of life and that their voices are heard at the highest level. I have met many of them and hope to meet others over the next few weeks. It will most likely be online due to the current restrictions. I would particularly like to commend my former volunteering colleagues in the Vincent's shops in Kilcullen and Athy. Many of the older volunteers were the backbone of these important fundraising outlets. I urge everyone to keep donating and purchasing from these charity shops.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	222	There is no doubt that we have seen unprecedented times over the past seven months and unfortunately we continue to experience them. There was no previous roadmap to deal with Covid, which makes our task all the more challenging. I welcome the publication of the Government's plan to deal with the virus over the coming six to nine months. It is important that we as public representatives work together to ensure that correct decisions are made on how to safeguard the people of this country first and the economy second. At all times the health and safety of our people must take absolute priority over everything else. This virus does not distinguish based on age, gender, health or vulnerability. It simply looks for the next victim regardless. Unfortunately I fear we will be living with this disease for the foreseeable future and as such we need to plan for this scenario. There was no roadmap for dealing with a pandemic like Covid. However, we know that we as individuals have the power to control this virus by following the health guidelines. It is important that this message is constantly given and that the public is made aware of the importance of it. I feel that over the past couple of months this message was lost and the public let its guard down. As a result, the virus has started to take hold. The public health measures must be at the front of any campaign. Even in this House we must reiterate their importance. These measures include washing our hands properly and regularly; wearing face coverings on public transport and in shops, shopping centres and all indoor settings where social distancing is difficult to achieve; having good coughing and sneezing etiquette; always maintaining social distance; reducing social interactions; working remotely where possible; isolating immediately and contacting our GP if we experience any symptoms; and downloading the Covid tracker app.If we, as a group of people, can observe these actions then there is no doubt we can control this virus and protect the most vulnerable in our society. The next area we need to look at is protecting our economy. Without a functioning economy we will not be able to maintain our public services. I welcome the supports put in place for businesses already but certain sectors will need more support than others. The hospitality sector has been badly affected and we must ensure every support is given to ensure its survival. This sector employs a great number of people and we must protect their jobs. The tourism sector in my constituency has been badly affected. The north of the county, including the Carlingford and Cooley region, has seen the number of tourists greatly reduced and the knock-on effect has been felt by many businesses there. We must ensure at all costs that our businesses are given every opportunity to survive. We will hear many people say we cannot afford to keep supporting the economy in the way we have. My view, however, is that we cannot afford not support them. If businesses are allowed to fail then they are gone; jobs are lost forever. This will be a greater cost to the economy. Over the past number of weeks, the number of incidences of Covid-19 in my constituency increased to alarming levels. This was particularly true for the north of the county. One measure we need to look at is restricting cross-Border travel to essential travel only. I do not advocate closing the Border but we need to address the issue of large Covid-19 numbers along this area. Restricting travel to essential travel, as happened in Dublin, will probably help to control the numbers.  Another issue is that of the mental health of younger generations during the pandemic. From working with many of our younger generations I know of the pressure this pandemic has brought on them both emotionally and physically. We must be able to reach out to them and offer real support. Finally, I wish to put on the record my support for the Government in its efforts to beat this virus and urge all Deputies from all sides of the House to work together in this regard. We must protect the most vulnerable in our society and help them at the most critical time. We must offer hope to everyone that there is an end to this pandemic and that everyone working together will defeat this virus.

This is a serious illness. It is a significant threat to life and health and to the country. We need to do all we can to make sure we reduce the numbers and be careful and cautious. I hear both sides of the debate about this on a regular basis. The truth of the matter is that nobody knows what will happen in the future with regard to Covid-19 so we need to be careful. It is an absolute disgrace that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, did not see fit to remain in this Chamber to listen to Deputies from all sides with regard to the most serious issue that is happening in our country. Right now, there is absolutely no democratic accountability for the significant decisions being made in this country. We have a society where businesses are being massacred. Hundreds of thousands of people are being pushed into poverty and significant sections of our health service are being decommissioned from their normal activities and reorientated. Today, 480 people got cancer and 24 people died of cancer. Today, approximately 27 people will die from heart disease and a similar number will die from a stroke. That number is roughly the same as the entire number of people who died from Covid-19 last month. I do not say that one is more equal than others. All those deaths deserve an equal response from the State to protect those lives but they are not getting it. I spoke to a doctor recently who told me that, thankfully, none of his patients had died from Covid-19. He had, however, three cancer patients. All had delayed diagnosis and delayed treatments and he was of the view that their lives were lost. I spoke to another doctor recently who has a patient with serious heart disease who has been waiting for treatment since last April. He has been told he will not get it until next year as a result of this. The Minister for Health has stated that between 20% and 50% of the capacity of the health service has been taken out from normal serves and reoriented towards Covid-19. These serious decisions need to be teased out, discussed and debated. The truth of the matter is that I asked the previous Minister for Health what research has been undertaken by the State regarding the level of mortality and morbidity in all the other elements of society. Right now, 200,000 women are affected by the cancer screening backlog in this country. The previous and current Minister have admitted to me that no research has carried out at all by the State with regard to the cost of the current plan. When we try to ask questions of the decision-makers - NPHET, which is the most powerful organisation in the country at the moment - we are not allowed. I know of Deputies who must ask journalists to ask NPHET questions about what is happening in the country at the moment. We are having a debate at a time when the Covid committee has been wrapped up and the Minister for Health will not bother his arse to sit in this Chamber and answer questions from Deputies. It is an absolute disgrace. Perhaps he has a busy timetable where he has to be away somewhere else and that is fine. It should, however, have been possible to schedule Deputies' engagement with the Minister for Health in some way that we could ask questions and give our views. This is a serious illness and we need to do our best to reduce the numbers. NPHET has an important job, and I believe it is doing the best it can, but its terms of reference are narrow. Our terms of reference as a Dáil and as a parliament of the people is to deal with all the issues in society. We need to make sure that cancer, heart disease, stroke and mental health patients are not put to the back of the queue. We need to make sure businesses can operate at some level and that workers and children are not pushed into poverty. We need to be able to live with this illness. To do that, we need to be able to make decisions collectively as a Dáil. That right, which the people gave us when they democratically elected us back in February, has been taken away from us and it is absolutely wrong.

We all have our part to play working together and that is what we are here to do. It is important that we arm our society with the tools to live with Covid-19. We cannot afford rolling lockdowns. Locking down within hours has really hurt businesses. Going forward, if there must be restrictions will the Minister please give us fair warning because people's livelihoods are at risk? That is important. Recently when we had restrictions I saw the effect on businesses and the confusion about what was happening. It is important that we give more communication to the areas that are restricted, perhaps via local radio, newspapers, local authorities or politicians. I repeat that all of us working together to play our part is what will get us out of Covid-19.

I also want to congratulate the older people because their numbers have seriously decreased. That is important. Again, the elderly are playing a great part. I mention that today is international older people's day and fair play to them. They have done everything they could and have stuck by the guidelines. They have done their best and we need to congratulate them. On Tuesday at the Covid committee I asked if there was an active recruitment campaign for a dedicated test and trace workforce and I was told there was. However, I was contacted by someone who tried to apply for such a position and he was told the recruitment was internal. Are we recruiting? Who are we recruiting? What is the timescale on recruiting? It is vital that we employ those who returned to answer Ireland's call and are now unemployed. It is vital that we recruit people with several languages. We are a multinational country and we cannot use language barriers as an excuse for not tracing properly. We need to get in front of Covid-19 and not continue to react to it. There may still be things we do not know but we have learned an awful lot in the last seven months. I repeat that the HSE staff and all those front-line services, our advisers and all the public health officials have done a tremendous job so let us do what we must and learn what we must. It is a learning curve. I wish to talk about schools. With regard to school cases, a total of 4,328 children and teachers have been tested for Covid-19.The rate of positive results in schools has been 1.9%. If we are to live with Covid, how are we to reduce the number of negative tests and target more accurately? I would be very careful and wary of that. It is great that our schoolchildren are back in school because everybody needed it. Whether it is mentally or physically, we all need a proper roadmap in the sense that we know there are supports available for people who need mental health services and other services. With all the talk about living with Covid, we seem to have forgotten the other major disruption in our lives, which also has a relationship to our food industry and supply, and that is Brexit. Beef farmers are living without any certainty on beef prices and markets. Our economy has suffered major losses because of Covid-19 and we are faced with potential tariffs that could cost €740 million.

This document is a useful guide for business planning and provides hope for future economic recovery. The onus is on us as parliamentarians to display leadership and hope. It is more important than ever that we focus on the language of economic recovery. In times such as this, a rising tide lifts all boats. This document and the Return to Work Safely Protocol will be fundamental documents in the months ahead for employers and their staff as we adapt to the challenges presented by the pandemic. Many of my constituents in Mayo ask when things will return to normal. While none of us can definitively answer that, I take solace in the roadmap's plans for resuming public service delivery as well as building economic and community resilience. The importance of our rural post offices is not covered in the roadmap document. They are facing problems significantly compounded by Covid-19. Post offices in Mayo, from Binghamstown to Shrule, and from Louisburgh to Bunnyconnellan, are often the only places where Mayo residents engage with public services. Having a strong network of local post offices, thereby avoiding people having to travel to large urban centres, is more important now than ever. Many of us have spoken about the importance of our older people being able to remain connected during the Covid-19 era, and our post offices play an important role in that. The roadmap refers to the European Commission's plan to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within the EU. Something similar should be done with the common travel area. Ideally both plans should be aligned as much as possible. Such a move would greatly benefit airports such as Ireland West Airport Knock as all its flights operate to the UK and EU countries. I particularly welcome the focus on community well-being, including mental health support and supports to encourage community working. Many community organisations will need support to resume as close as possible to normal services. I note the commitment to support local community development committees in assisting local community and voluntary groups to adapt their operations to fit into the new Covid-19 reality. However, I hope the Minister of State will be able to provide further details on such supports for community well-being. Many voluntary organisations provided useful services in pre-Covid times and their work is now critical in this pandemic. I especially think of Castlebar voluntary social services, including the meals on wheels service, which many older people rely on as they limit their movements.

We had a frank and open discussion, including suggestions from members for how we might further engage with the public. As has been said in this session and in others, we are in uncharted waters. Nobody has the right answer. We are learning as we go. It is important to listen to suggestions and take them on board. We all need to work together. I also welcome this opportunity to discuss the Government's resilience and recovery plan, the Roadmap for Living with Covid-19. I note that the national framework is built on three pillars: healthy people, strong businesses and resilient communities. I will touch on those in the time I have. With the roadmap, there is a doubling of the public health workforce and the publication of the guidance on visits to long-term residential care. The doubling of the public health workforce is critical because we need more staff there. I welcome that the recruitment is under way. On the guidance on the long-term residential care, many if not all of us have had contact from constituents who have loved ones in nursing homes. They want an easing of restrictions so that they can visit them. I welcome that that is contained in the plan. It gives a clear roadmap for those families who wish to visit loved ones in residential care settings. I hope the Government will be able to develop an all-island response, both North and South. I know the acting CMO here in the Republic is in discussions with his counterpart in the North. That is a very important part of any future plan. Care and assistance in our communities, which is one of the three pillars in the roadmap, is critical. The local authorities are playing a crucial role in this. As I have mentioned in the Chamber previously, the local authority community calls represent an essential part of engaging with those who are isolating or cocooning. Volunteers in sports clubs and other groups have given their time to deliver groceries and medicines to people. I also commend the library service which is delivering audiobooks and engaging with those who cannot or do not want to leave their homes. I hope the Government will take this on board. As we work with this roadmap in the next six or nine months - it could be longer - we need to bear in mind outpatient appointments and screening services. Many people with other ailments may be nervous of going into a hospital or healthcare setting. It is very important to keep those services running as much as possible, irrespective of the level we are at. It is equally important that partners and husbands are permitted to attend maternity appointments. That issue needs to be dealt with. Earlier my colleagues spoke about sports. While training is taking place and it is very important for children, it is critical for mental health. The green ribbon campaign was launched today. The two of them are part and parcel. I hope there will be improvements to the Covid app. I suggested some improvements through the parliamentary question system and the Minister might take them on board.

As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know from being a Member of a smaller group speaking at the end, it is very annoying for the Minister always to run away. This is a serious issue throughout the country. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, but the Minister just disappeared. He has a habit of doing that. This is a very frustrating situation and above all our people need hope. I compliment Deputy Lahart on his powerful speech earlier. People need hope. The demonising of students in Galway and the demonising of old people and the fear that has been peddled and portrayed on RTÉ morning, noon and night are wrong. I would love to know how much the local radio stations are getting for advertising. I will be asking questions about that. It is shocking. We seem to want people frightened, wearing masks, cowering in corners and afraid to move. It is shocking. It is the wrong way to deal with it. Have we looked at European best practice or how issues work in Europe? Based on OECD data, Denmark with a population of 5.8 million has had 27,464 cases, about 33% less than Ireland, and 650 deaths, about 70% less than Ireland. Hungary with a population of 9.7 million, approximately twice Ireland's, has had 26,461 cases, about 67% less than Ireland, and 765 deaths, about 80% less than Ireland. Finland with a population of 5.5 million has had 9,892 cases, more than 50% less than Ireland and 345 deaths, a staggering 80% less than Ireland.There is something wrong here. We are manipulating the figures and I have evidence of this. People have been in touch with me whose loved ones died and were recorded as Covid deaths although they had tests which were clear. We need to get honest here and level with the people. The people showed the meitheal spirit and did everything they were asked to, as did all of the GAA clubs, the community development associations and everybody else, and in that respect I want to salute again the Garda Síochána community policing units in Cahir, Clonmel and all of County Tipperary. However, mind games are being played now with the people and they are getting fed up with it or are already fed up with it because it is not good enough. As I said, before we start clapping ourselves on the back for a job well done, we need to have a national debate on why Ireland has a Covid-19 case rate so much higher than the three countries I mentioned. Additionally, and perhaps more alarmingly, we have dramatically higher death rates than they do. What can be learned from these comments? I hope the Minister for Health and the Minister, Deputy Harris, are listening. Has the Government been in touch with these countries to find out how we can improve? Are we just cocooning here and saying we know best? We have a bad history with the HSE. The CMO, Dr. Tony Houlihan, is coming in back and I hope his wife is well but he has a bad history in the HSE with the cervical smear deaths and the death sentences perpetrated on women. We have not got a great history on a plethora of issues. Consider the waste on the national children's hospital and the scandals that went on. We need to discuss and scrutinise these numbers. We cannot have a situation where anyone who speaks out or questions the system is shut up or sacked from senior positions, and that is what is happening. One such individual who spoke out recently was Dr. Martin Feeley, the former clinical director of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. He called for a debate and raised some concerns at the imposition of restrictions and the approach being taken several weeks ago. What happened to him? He was fired almost instantly. He was sacked and it is not good enough and we have to ask why. What kind of suppression are we trying to get here? Is it going to be a complete communist state? That is the way it is heading. Sections of the community have got nothing. The elderly, the publicans and those over 66 have not got a penny in any payment whether they were bus drivers or business people or whatever. Look at our only source of help, namely, artists and the creative and music industries. They have been blackguarded and they are not getting a shilling. Now the moratorium has been lifted from the banks and they can mercilessly take those people's houses, vans and equipment. That is what is going to happen. There is something sinister going on here and something rotten in the State of Ireland. Dr. Martin Feeley has since spoken out on the RTÉ "Prime Time" programme this week and called for a full debate on the ongoing strategy and restrictions. I support him in this call because I believe in democracy, including freedom of speech which we are suppressing too. Dr. Feeley said the cost to the community, financially and socially, is enormous, as we know, and one of the difficulties with this is we cannot measure those costs. We cannot. It is international mental health day today or suicide awareness day. I want the Minister of State to write this down because I want answers. Has the collating of figures on self-harm and suicide been stopped? I want a specific answer to that, please, and the Minister of State might take note of it. It has been asked here before and I did not get an answer. However, I can say, again according to Dr. Feeley, that most people are depressed and the country is depressed and this is why we need a debate on this. We have no debate and discourse here. There is no engagement with party and group leaders. It has stopped. The damage to our children, our youth, our mental health people and everything else is just enormous. We must have meaningful debates and answers to questions, not a Minister who floats out, especially when I come in, because I will ask the questions without fear or favour.

Mention was made by other Deputies about people waiting for cancer smears, bowel screening and prostate cancer. It is all stacking up and people are dying. The figures were given of people dying from all the other ailments. It is one every hour for cancer and 27 a day from stroke and heart disease. There is no talk about it, and some of these are being put down as Covid deaths. I have one last question for the Minister of State. One day the figures were corrected downward by 500 from about 1,700. They were corrected by the HSE. That was the day the Tánaiste, then the Taoiseach, was out sunning himself in the park on the day before. The figures are back up again and the figures that are being peddled on RTÉ and everywhere else are not true should be corrected. Why perpetrate lies and untruths to spread the fear?

One overarching area where we could improve things is to make every effort we can when moving from one level to another to give businesses more notice. The Minister of State knows as I do that many businesses have lost heavily because they only get 24 or 36 hours' notice. People feel they are only back up and running again and the rug has been pulled. It is not so much that the rug is pulled but the speed at which it is pulled and the uncertainty around the financial loss that many people experience. While I understand Covid moves swiftly, I would make that general point first. Before I address the framework itself, I have a comment about some of the debate today. There is a lot of debate about what the figures tell us about the second wave of Covid. While every single death is a tragedy for the individual and their family, the argument is being made nonetheless that because deaths in August were 14 and September were 27, somehow the second wave is not as deadly because the ratio of infections compared with the number of deaths is less than it was back in April and May. However, that misses the extremely important point that we are testing far more people now than we did in April and May, so any comparisons we make of figures have to be valid. Otherwise conclusions that flow from them are simply invalid. The one thing we cannot do is lose control of this virus because we know what happens if we do. I do not know how some people can have forgotten what happened in northern Italy, the scandal of people walking out of care homes in Spain and other countries and the terror that was New York. Members may know the phrase "it has not gone away" and Covid has not. People really need to be careful about what they are saying and the messages they are giving out. Many things have changed, however, and one area where we remain behind the curve is testing and subsequent tracing. I am convinced we can do much better and we must do so if the Government's three pillars are to stand and its framework is to hold. As the Minster of State knows, there are new tests on the market. There is pilot PCR testing taking place where between ten and 20 people can be tested at a time. If it comes back positive, all of these people have to be tested individually, but if it returns negative, then at least ten tests have been done in one go. Given that the positive testing rate is around 2%, it means that kind of test statistically should work very well. As such, if we can move forward with our testing and upgrade and update our regime, the pillars of the Government's roadmap will, as I said, be much more likely to remain in place and give us a fighting chance of living with Covid. Otherwise we will be looking at looking at living at level 2 the odd time, but more likely level 3 to level 4. The Minster mentioned the three pillars and I will return to pillar 1 when we are discussing the winter plan later. For the few minutes I have however, I want to concentrate on pillar 2. I have said it before and will say it again, we need to increase the PUP to what it was. This is a safety net for so many people so that they can continue to pay part of their mortgage and so that their lives do not simply fall apart.The Minister of State and I know these people cannot work because sectors are closed. We speak to them and hear from them all the time. They have no understanding of why that payment has been cut. It is an act of solidarity. As I have said previously, we must pay it because it keeps families and households afloat. That is what we are asking for if we are to live with Covid. The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, mentioned a cut in VAT rates. The Minister of State and I come from the Border region. We know the importance of lowering the VAT rate in the hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9%. I ask again that the Government considers it. While the employment wage subsidy scheme is good, it absolutely needs to be revised because it is a cliff edge for businesses. If their turnover drops by 30% or more, then businesses can access these supports, but if their turnover drops by 15%, 20% or even 28%, they receive no assistance for employing people. Many businesses have contacted me about this. If two businesses are side by side and the turnover of one drops by 30% and the other by 22%, one of them will get full support and the other will get nothing. I ask for a graduated approach. For example, if turnover drops by 10% a business might get €50 per employee, a drop of between 10% and 20% would mean €100 per employee, a drop of between 20% and 30% would mean €150 per employee while a drop of more than 30% would mean, as it does now, €200 per employee. This would be a much fairer system for businesses and would significantly improve the workings of the scheme.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	243	I thank the Deputies throughout the House for their contributions in this vital debate on the Government's response to Covid-19, including the plan for living with Covid-19, Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021. Our overall goal is to reopen our society and economy as safely as possible. This is a challenge facing governments the world over. We have seen the statistics from the WHO in recent days that worldwide case numbers have passed 33 million and worldwide deaths have exceeded 1 million. In many parts of the world, the pandemic is returning at an increasing and alarming rate and we do not want this to happen in our country. The resilience and recovery plan sets out a very clear framework for decision-making with regard to this public health pandemic. Our objective is to strike a balance between what is safe and what may risk increasing transmission of the disease. Therefore, we are prioritising certain sectors of society at this time in the knowledge that we will be able to return to normal life in future. We have now moved from the initial emergency response phase and objective of flattening the curve to the next chapter of opening society while living with the virus. That said, the objective remains, as it always has been, to eliminate and eradicate the virus wherever it is detected. This is the reason for the robust testing and tracing strategy put in place by the HSE. The plan has a framework for decision-making by the Government. We also to continue to promote the very clear public health advice for individuals, much of which has not changed for many months. These include good cough and hand hygiene, wearing a face covering where required by law and when visiting vulnerable people, avoiding crowded places, including public transport, as much as possible, and working from home if possible, and I recognise that for many people this is not an option due to the nature of their work. As a society, to suppress transmission of the virus and reduce the impact of the disease, it is important for all of us in all walks of life to heed this advice. While the Government can legislate for mandatory face coverings on public transport and in retail settings, we cannot legislate for every situation. We must all take an element of personal responsibility. We have contained outbreaks of the virus in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, and more recently we have seen how the efforts of the public in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford have turned the tide of the trajectory of the disease. We succeeded in doing this thanks to the collective efforts of the public, who adhered to the guidelines, as well as the expert knowledge and advice from our public health specialists and the dedication and hard work of all front-line workers. We need individually and collectively to keep doing the basic things right, which the vast majority of us are doing already. I will now deal with some of the issues raised by Deputies. Deputy Harkin outlined the fact that businesses need more notice. We will take this on board. It has been an issue in recent months, certainly in the north west and Donegal. Many businesses did not get enough notice. It is something we have taken on board. The Deputy also spoke about northern Italy, Spain and New York and the new tests and pilot testing. There are certainly options. She spoke about the employment wage subsidy scheme and that businesses that loses 28% of turnover get nothing. Perhaps there can be a better system than a cut-off point. The Deputy also spoke about the VAT rate reducing from 13.5% to 9%. I hope this will be considered in the budget. Deputy Mattie McGrath spoke about Deputy Lahart's contribution. He also praised the Garda, the GAA and various organisations for the work they are doing. He stated that figures on mental health and self-harm have not been collated since April. I will try to get the figures for the Deputy through the Department as soon as I can. Deputy Shortall spoke about considering the experience of other countries with regard to minimising Covid-19 and the messaging is key. She spoke about influencers and that the GAA in Dublin could be serious influencers on the ground. We find that a certain cohort of people, perhaps those aged over 50, still get their news from the old traditional news outlets, such as local and national newspapers or the news on television at 6 p.m. It is a very effective way but it is not getting through to younger people. We do need to use different outlets. Deputy Cathal Crowe spoke about dental care and the backlog for orthodontic services. He asked about a tax rebate for people who have to get private treatment. There is merit in this. He also spoke about communication when a school has an outbreak and that perhaps communication between the HSE and the principal might be a bit quicker instead of waiting 24 hours. Deputies Alan Farrell, McAuliffe, Boyd Barrett, Barry and Jim O'Callaghan spoke about mental health and fatigue . It is an issue we are facing after many months of living with Covid and with regard to businesses and industries. We may have to look at a different way of approaching it. I know NPHET and the Government are working together. Somebody said that perhaps businesses and other people could be brought onto NPHET. The NPHET team is primarily from the health sector but they also have knowledge of sporting events and business. Just because somebody is from one area does not mean to say they do not have knowledge. It would be ideal to bring in people from sporting organisations but the NPHET members also have links with sporting organisations. Deputy Higgins spoke about the arts and dance classes for young and old. It would be great to get those classes back. She also spoke about opening venues that are capable of bringing in fewer people than they used to and that the Covid payments could be tweaked so sound engineers, roadies and musicians could get back working. She absolutely has a point. Deputy Conway-Walsh spoke about staff burnout in Mayo University Hospital and the need to listen to them. Deputy Wynne spoke about visiting hospitals and other health services on compassionate grounds. She has a point too. Deputy Boyd Barrett talked about trusting the people and giving them the information they need. Deputy Barry spoke about taxi driver protests and their financial plight, as well as emergency accommodation and suicide in Cork. It is an issue which I heard loud and clear. Deputy McAuliffe spoke about protecting the vulnerable in society. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan had some interesting views that we could crush the virus into the ground but we need to open up sport. It is spreading around the world but reducing human activity may not be the right approach. Young people will gladly listen to messages but it is having a serious economic impact. Deputy Andrews spoke about team sports and the difference between soccer, Gaelic football and rugby. Hopefully, soccer might be included in the sports allowed. I would have thought it was but maybe junior soccer is an issue. Deputy Fitzpatrick talked about the health and safety of people. We need to protect jobs. Deputy Tóibín spoke about cancer screening and cancer patients. There are many other areas in the health services from where people have gone to work on the Covid-19 issue. It is hard to get the right balance. Deputy Murnane O'Connor spoke about older people. Deputy Dillon spoke about leadership. Hopefully, we can return to normal. Deputy Devlin spoke about uncharted waters but we need an all-island response. That is what we are doing. I know the various teams from the health Departments in both jurisdictions are working together. There is another meeting between them tomorrow. We need to work collectively, across the island of Ireland, North and South, east and west, to sort out and attack this virus as quickly as possible.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	244	I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the winter plan which was published last week. Every winter, our healthcare system faces increasing pressures, resulting in difficulties for many people and many patients, particularly older people, in accessing services in a timely way. This becomes most evident, as we know, in the hospital emergency departments in the form of overcrowding, longer waiting times and patients receiving care on trolleys. Before Covid arrived in Ireland, we already had the longest waiting lists in Europe. Last winter saw the highest trolley counts since records began. That was our starting point. Since March of this year, Covid has caused a substantial increase in waiting lists due to the necessary pausing of many aspects of healthcare. Covid has also caused a very serious fall in our healthcare capacity, due largely to the need for extra infection prevention and control measures. In short, it takes longer and it costs more to provide the same care to the same patient. For all these reasons, this winter is likely to be the most challenging time our health services have faced in many years. The winter plan is one of the ways that we are responding to this challenge. None of us wants to see patients and staff enduring overcrowded conditions. The problems giving rise to these challenges are varied. Many are rooted in the way services have been historically delivered. This is why a strategic approach was agreed on an all-party basis to bring about long-term structural reform to our healthcare system, namely, Sláintecare. I re-emphasise the Government’s and my commitment to the implementation of Sláintecare. I know colleagues recognise, and the Sláintecare report itself acknowledges, that these deep-seated reforms, which we need to make, take time to implement. There is no magic formula to immediately fix the various waiting list and trolley issues that we see. Nonetheless, Sláintecare is the strategy we are pursuing and the winter plan is designed according to Sláintecare principles and, I am very happy to share with the House, in a way that substantially accelerates the implementation of Sláintecare. I welcome the publication of the plan. It is ambitious. Its aim is to deliver safe, efficient and effective services this winter and to do this by reorienting service delivery towards primary care and community-based services. I particularly welcome the HSE's undertaking to reduce the number of patients receiving care on trolleys in emergency departments and the improvement of patient experience times while they are in emergency departments. Both of these objectives are critically important to keeping patients and staff safe in response to Covid-19 this winter. Last winter, more than 620,000 people visited emergency departments. While anybody who needs emergency medical treatment should, of course, receive it, it is generally accepted among experts that there are many patients who could be cared for in alternative settings other than hospital and who would indeed be better cared for in non-acute settings. Therefore, it is a central part of this plan to provide alternative pathways of care where they are appropriate. This is to ease pressures on the hospital system, including emergency departments, to speed up patient discharge and to provide patients with care as close to the home and their communities as possible and where possible. This will, of course, free up hospital resources for the patients who need to access acute care. The Government's determination to meet the challenges of winter this year and support the healthcare system are demonstrated by the commitment of €600 million to underpinning this plan. That includes €200 million for the rest of this year and an additional €400 million for next year - that is, the 2021 part of this coming winter. The plan is designed to enable patients to be seen in the community wherever possible.It does this by providing a better service in the community healthcare settings. The plan supports patients receiving timely care in hospitals when needed and supports patients returning home or to appropriate care settings when they are well enough to leave hospital. It does this by providing home care and step-down options. I am particularly pleased to share with the House that there are additional supports in the plan for people at greater risk, including elderly people, homeless people, those in addiction, those with chronic illnesses and many more by allowing them to stay home while they are receiving the right level of care. The plan provides for building capacity and resilience in the system. One of the big challenges facing us is building this extra capacity in the acute hospital system. In 2018, the health service capacity review was published. It sets out the necessity for increased acute and non-acute bed capacity right across the system in the context of major reforms being implemented in the way healthcare is delivered. These major reforms are a critical part of the plan. The plan that has been set and to which we are all working has approximately 2,590 acute beds but it is worth noting that the capacity review states that this is one end of a range and if the necessary reforms are not delivered, we would need in excess of 7,000 beds. These are essential reforms. The programme for Government commits to continuing investment in our health services in line with the recommendations of the capacity review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040.  The winter plan provides additional health service capacity across a range of services and settings, including acute capacity, to reduce admissions and facilitate egress. Key initiatives include funding for nearly 900 acute hospital beds, nearly 500 sub-acute beds, 631 rehabilitation places and 530 repurposed community beds. Some of those are beds that have been put in place since the arrival of Covid-19 and were funded for several months through the initial Covid-19 response fund. The winter plan will continue the funding of those beds until the end of April and double the number of acute beds in the same timescale. The plan also provides for the utilisation of private hospitals for urgent complex care to reduce waiting lists and for their use in the event of a surge of Covid-19. Many of these measures are aimed at reducing the number of those over 75 years of age who need to be treated in, or admitted to, acute hospitals. They also aim to reduce the number of patients whose discharge from hospital is delayed because of a lack of alternative care available to them. We saw that happen last winter although it was tackled with some success at the time. It must be comprehensively tackled this year. The plan also provides additional community healthcare networks, more community specialist teams and additional acute hospital front-of-house teams. This will create the foundation and organisational structure through which integrated care can be provided locally within the community at the appropriate level of complexity. These networks and specialist teams will work closely with the National Ambulance Service to deliver end-to-end care with the aim of keeping people out of hospital or, where they are admitted, to ensure they are discharged without delay. It is anticipated in the plan that these measures could lead to a decrease of 20% in the number of emergency department admissions for people who are over 75. Having mentioned the National Ambulance Service, I would like to put on the record my acknowledgement of the extraordinary work the men and women in that service have provided. They always do extraordinary work, but their response to Covid-19 has been nothing short of exemplary. The plan also commits to delivering more diagnostics in the community, allowing patients to be seen closer to home and avoid going to hospital. The plan puts in place supports for GPs, including those in rural practices, to support service continuity. GP access to diagnostics has been coming up for many years. GPs all over the country are firmly of the view that they can reduce admissions to hospital and referrals to consultants and emergency departments by accessing diagnostics and bringing their own patients back to their practices to continuing their care. This winter, we are putting a substantial investment into making that happen and I hope we will see exactly the sorts of results that the GPs intend to deliver. The plan also aims to double the existing level of home support hours to support the Home First initiative. This is designed to enable those with high and moderate levels of frailty to be cared for in their own homes. With this objective in mind, 4.7 million additional home support hours are being provided for in the plan. A key action will be a comprehensive flu vaccination programme. The HSE has placed orders for approximately 1.35 million doses of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine as well as 600,000 doses of the live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is essentially a nasal spray rather than an injection for children aged two to 12. I remind people that the flu vaccination for these vulnerable groups is being administered for free, which is an important message and I would appreciate the help of my colleagues to get that message out to people that if they are in one of the vulnerable groups, they should approach their GP or pharmacist for a free vaccination. Funding is also provided for waiting lists. I would like to acknowledge and support the necessary decision taken earlier this year to defer elective care. I know that this has had an impact on scheduled care waiting lists. Hospital waiting list figures are higher than at the start of the year with the inpatient day case and outpatient waiting lists 17% and 10%, respectively, higher than at the start of January. However, there are some indications of improvement which I think are worth noting. As a result of concerted efforts by front-line workers, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the trajectory of growth in waiting lists has been slowed since services resumed in June. There has been an almost 11% reduction in the numbers waiting for inpatient procedures since May, with early evidence that the rate of growth on the outpatient list has slowed. The HSE has actively sought to improve productivity through the increasing use of alternative work practices. This includes telemedicine, virtual clinics and other alternative settings. Private hospitals, community facilities, atypical outpatient settings, the HSE and particularly community health organisations have been innovative and deserve great credit for their response to Covid-19. They have responded with great creativity and professionalism. The HSE is also currently working to secure access to private hospital facilities for urgent and time-critical procedures for public patients. The National Treatment Purchase Fund has resumed its activities on behalf of public patients and is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients. These include the increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, and funding see-and-treat services where minor procedures are provided for at the same time as outpatient consultations. The funding of hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients and the funding of virtual clinics and clinical validation are also included. We need, of course, to acknowledge that waiting lists are at record levels but the combined impact of this work should help to offset to some extent the awful impact of Covid-19 on waiting lists. The HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund will continue to work together to address this issue. I very much welcome today's debate and look forward to hearing from my colleagues their views on the plan. The objective of the Government is to fully implement Sláintecare and I want to work collaboratively with all stakeholders and right across this House to do so. Sláintecare is not owned by this Government, it is owned by the Oireachtas and I hope to see it implemented to a great extent in the coming months and years. In the immediate term, we need to get services back up and running to at least the level they were at prior to the outbreak of the pandemic.The winter plan is part of that process and is designed to meet the immediate challenges we anticipate this winter. With the ambitious targets in it and the funding provided by the Government, I am confident that we can make inroads into the problems in the system. I hope this is something all Deputies in the House want and will support.

I will take ten minutes and she will have five minutes. I have said to the Minister on a number of occasions, and I think he has accepted it because it is a statement of the obvious, that we are facing a very difficult winter. The onset of Covid has been tragic in many ways for our health services, not just in terms of trying to battle Covid and save people's lives but also because of the impact it is having on non-Covid care across a range of areas. We need to get it right as we try to strike a balance between protecting people against Covid and maintaining all critical non-Covid care. We would both agree that we are facing into a very difficult winter for our front-line staff and patients. The Minister will have seen from the most recent figures from the National Treatment Purchase Fund that we now have record numbers of people waiting to see a consultant and get into the system, and people are also waiting for treatment. We need urgent resources and an injection of serious capacity. We needed a serious long-term plan that would deal with the challenges we face. There is some additionality in the Minister's plan, which I welcome, but much of it resembles more of a wish list. It lacks urgency and ambition. In the first week of August, I launched the Sinn Féin proposals. We launched a plan that would succeed, not a plan that was designed to fail. We called for 1,100 additional acute beds between now and the end of the year as well as all necessary staff, a proposal that was completely costed and funded. We also called for 2,500 additional staff between now and the end of the year to take the pressure off front-line staff who we know have worked extremely hard and face very real difficulties and challenges. We committed to €50 million in additional spending on cancer services and, separate from our plan, we also talked about additional resources for disability services, mental health and other areas. The Minister's plan for most of those areas has been underwhelming. I have listened to many stakeholders, including health trade unions and advocacy groups. Over the past week alone, I have met over 20 groups. I have listened to what they have to say because they are on the front line advocating for patients across a range of areas. The one thing that keeps coming up is that this is a temporary plan with temporary sticking-plaster solutions. While that is in part because of the winter challenge, there was an opportunity to make sure all of the additional beds which are being provided would be provided on a permanent basis. In our plan, we provided for 609 modular rapid-build units. The work could have been done during the summer and the beds would then have been ready to be opened in the winter. We would have them on a permanent basis in our health service, which is what we need. Temporary solutions do not cut it and are not what was promised in Sláintecare. They are not what any of us were promised when we canvassed for people's votes in the most recent election. There are no targets in the Minister's plan in terms of staff. There is no mention of staff in the plan. In the press conference, that information had to be dragged out of some of the people who were there. The plan is still lacking in targets. How many staff will be recruited and how they will be recruited? Will they be agency staff? How long will they be employed for? What type of contracts will they be on? I refer to doctors, nurses, consultants, medical scientists and so on. We know the winter plan is only funded to the end of April and will not, therefore, be a medium-term to long-term solution for all of the challenges we face. In my view, it does not go anywhere near enough to deal with the challenge we have in delivering Covid and non-Covid care. This is a winter like no other. This is a winter when we have to deal with Covid and non-Covid care. However, there should be some opportunity to catch up on all of the missed care. I have listened to cancer patients who have not had access to their consultants at the times they were promised. Their appointments, procedures and surgeries have been cancelled. I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister on children with scoliosis, a matter which he quite rightly raised with other people when he was in opposition. It is a fundamental issue of children who are in pain and need treatment. There was a 30% reduction in medical procedures for children with scoliosis for the first eight months of this year compared to the first eight months of last year. That is obviously because of the Covid restrictions, but it is all the more reason why we need a catch-up plan, investment and resources to ensure children with scoliosis and cancer patients are not waiting longer for treatment. The plan made no mention of disability services. It failed to provide additional funding, resources and investment for disabilities and dementia services. The Minister has since announced a meagre €10 million for these services, which was met with shock and disbelief by all of the advocacy groups representing people with disabilities. I very much hope that they will see much more from the Minister, and the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, on budget day because this is an area that deserves a lot of our attention. The Irish Cancer Society has said we need €40 million for cancer services. All the Minister has provided in the winter plan is €2.3 million in additional funding next year to deal with what he called restarting or kick-starting cancer services. That falls far short of what is needed for us to be able to make sure oncology services are operating at the same levels that they were pre Covid. I do not underestimate the challenge, but there is another important area I want to raise with the Minister. For the past number of weeks I have compiled as much data as I can on dental and orthodontic wait times, which are beyond shocking. Children are waiting four and five years for services. I have received emails from the parents of children who are in extreme pain and cannot get the treatment they need. I do not know whether the Minister has looked at the waiting times recently, but they are shocking. It is one of the areas where there was a pause in treatment. I know people who are not even being referred for treatment; they are instead being told a referral cannot be made because of the lack of capacity. In the Be On Call for Ireland waiting pool of 1,600 staff, there are dentists and dental assistants. Why are they not being hired and brought into the public system to ensure we can treat people and make sure children get the treatment they need? That is the point. We have to live with Covid, as I said, but we also have to live with it in a way that non-Covid-related healthcare can be delivered. We are saving lives, which we need to do in terms of Covid and taking all of the necessary precautions. On the other hand, people are waiting far too long for cancer treatment, children are waiting too long for all sorts of medical treatment and across whole range of areas, from cardiology to neurology and many others, we have longer and longer wait times. Over 600,000 people in the State are waiting to see a hospital consultant. I can guarantee that by the end of the year, given the lack of urgency in the plan, that will get worse because the Minister has not provided for measures to deal with that. The plan lacks the detail, ambition and urgency needed to inject the capacity that is needed. The Minister knows full well that if we are to have any chance of catching up or, if we are to be brutally honest, any chance of keeping up we need far more beds than are being delivered in the plan. The Minister has put more pressure on acute hospitals to find whatever space they can in their hospitals to open up beds . There are no new builds whatsoever. There is no reference to modular building, or to medium-term or long-term planning. The plan is about what can be provided by acute hospitals, which are bursting, and putting them under pressure to get all of these beds in place which will of course all be closed at the end of April. We will be back to where we were with a lack of capacity in the system. I want to finish on an issue I have raised several times with the Minister. It has been raised on the floor of the Dáil with the Taoiseach. I refer to cardiac services in Waterford and the south east. There is very real concern about the second cath lab that was promised which will now only deliver diagnostic services. I attended several meetings with senior officials from the Department of Health, the previous Minister for Health and others where we were promised that the lab would provide interventional and diagnostic care.That needs to happen.  The final point I will make in the 30 seconds remaining is that I, as a Waterford Deputy, want to work with this Minister for Health, so that he can be the Minister that delivers health equality for the south east, and delivers the 24/7 cardiac care people want. He has it within his power to work with those in the Department and the HSE and with others to make that happen. He knows from his colleagues and others in the south east that this is not just a Waterford issue but that this is needed. I appeal to the Minister to work with others on this issue and to be the Minister for Health who delivers that facility for the people of the south east. Gabhaim buíochas.
#PatriciaRyan	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-party	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-dob	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	246	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Cullinane. This winter plan is a wish list which is short on targets, on timelines and on ambition. I am very fearful of a winter crisis at Portlaoise, Tullamore, and Naas hospitals. When Covid-19, in particular, is taken into account, the plan is lacking in detail, targets and timelines for staff recruitment and bed delivery. It falls far short of what is required to safely deliver appropriate care in the coming winter months. We need a plan that will catch up on missed care and to build capacity. This plan does not deliver enough ambition to catch up to where we were pre-winter, let alone when the usual barrage of the winter causes our emergency departments to clog up. When I refer to clogging up I mean clogging up in the normal conditions. I fear it will be much worse in the socially-distanced world we now live in.  I spoke last week to a man from Portarlington who attended an accident and emergency department in Tullamore recently. Despite suffering from chronic pain he stood at the edge of a waiting room as this room was too packed, and despite most people wearing masks, he felt unsafe being in such close proximity to a large number of people given the Covid-19 crisis. The man was understandably nervous as he injects a biologic monthly to suppress his immune system in an effort to manage his condition. When he could not stand any more he sat near a window. He had been sent to the accident and emergency department by his doctor who had immediate concerns for his health. He spent eight hours in the accident and emergency department on a Friday evening in September. Imagine how long he might have had to spend in January if he was in that same waiting room. The Sinn Féin plan which was launched in early August would deliver 1,100 additional acute and subacute beds and 50 intensive care unit, ICU, beds this year. It would provide €40 million to kickstart cancer care and bring on an additional 2,500 staff ahead of winter, not after winter but ahead of it. The Government plan will only deliver 251 acute beds and 89 subacute beds in 2020, and 232 acute beds in early 2021. The 17 ICU beds proposed is far short of what is needed. Additional ICU beds in early 2021 will be crucial but no target has been set.  The HSE has admitted that the so-called new beds will only mitigate Covid-19-related capacity shortfalls and not meet demand. There are hundreds of unfilled vacancies across the health service, including many in Laois, Offaly and Kildare. As the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, have said, without filling these vacancies new beds cannot be opened. Without clear commitments and rapid recruitment, the burden on existing staff will not be relieved. They are overworked and have worked hard through this pandemic with little or no relief.  There is no mention of disability services. I have spoken with CEOs of disability services as recently as this morning and I can tell the Minister that they are in disarray. There is no funding for mental health services. Why is this the case? There is also no funding to kickstart cancer services this year. I welcome the investment in occupational welfare supports for front-line staff and investments in community care, in community intervention teams and the winter flu expansion. These were a core part of Sinn Féin’s capacity protection programme, but these alone are not enough. The rest of the plan misses the mark. It is in another missed opportunity to deliver a proper health service for the people of the midlands I represent. Finally, I am concerned that not enough is being done for carers through the winter plan. Carers are burned out. We need to prioritise carers and day care centres. These need to be reopened and they need this help now. Gabhaim buíochas.

I welcome the fact that we are having a discussion on this issue this evening. As with my earlier contribution on the roadmap, I would appreciate if the Minister would take on board some of what I am going to say in the limited time available to. On the flu vaccine, I understand the international issues. Last October some of us were advocating that everybody should get the flu vaccine. We would have had a head start. Unfortunately, we did not do that. While there are international factors, we could have been ahead of the game. Can the Minister, or the Minister of State coming in to sum up, update us on where we are on the roll out of the flu vaccine? Dr. Nina Byrnes and other prominent GPs across the country have been saying that it has been coming in small doses and some people in my own constituency have said the same thing. Are we going to be able to get to the target group? Are we going to be able to get to the over 80s, about whom I spoke earlier and which includes my own parents, and to the vulnerable groups on time? The second issue I wish to raise is on non-Covid19 healthcare. I want the Minister - I will be asking the Taoiseach next week and he will probably revert to the Minister - to provide me with a table for January to September 2019 and 2020, showing the number of people diagnosed with cancer per month and the type of cancer and the same for coronary conditions. I also want the table to show the treatments. We have to deal with Covid-19 healthcare but we also have to deal with non-Covid-19 healthcare. It is not a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. I appreciate that the Minister for Health has a very difficult job but we have to look after both of these groups. There is no point saying that, unfortunately, we lost one person through Covid-19 in the past couple of days, if we are losing more people due to other chronic and serious issues like cancer, or heart conditions. It is as simple as that. I want the Minister for Health, through the Taoiseach, to ask that question. It is very rare for the leader of one of the parties in opposition to give the Government a week to get information, and to say that he will ask the same question next week. We need to know this as does the country. We have to diagnose proportionately the same number of people, and probably improve in some categories, as we were last year. We have all heard anecdotal evidence. I heard of a surgeon in the mid-west who is a specialist in rectal cancers. He has not been diagnosing the same number of patients as he was last year. That means that there are many males, in particular, who do not know that they have cancer. That means delayed outcomes and more mortalities. Put that in an equation versus what we are doing about Covid-19. We must then get these statistics. I remember the Minister sitting beside me here for years, and also in committee, and he always used the phrase that it is all about the data. Let us find out the data. I have also tabled parliamentary questions on this and I have asked the Taoiseach. We need more detail on the beds issue. I have said here on numerous occasions that the numbers announced in the plan and the real numbers are different. I will not bother boring everybody by going through it again but the net effect is that there are not as many beds as is being said. I want to see the detail of this plan. Where are the beds going? There is a chronic issue in University Hospital Limerick, UHL. It has to get that 96-bed block and it has to be built using this rapid-build technology. Use the Covid-19 emergency legislation. I will make a positive suggestion to the Minister. The Covid-19 emergency legislation which allows the Minister to do a whole range of different buildings will run out soon. It needs to be extended because some of the projects may be outside its remit and may face planning or other issues. I know about that because there is a €1.5 million outpatients department being put in Nenagh, and in Thurles there is a €2.4 million facility to deal with elderly members of the community as a hospital prevention measure. Can the Minister tell us where the beds are going to go? We are desperate in the mid-west to know what is going to happen there. I welcome all the hospital prevention measures being brought in across the country. I have serious questions on staffing. Some 12,500 staff members were mentioned. I was here when questions were asked about this and I could have answered them because according to the plan, there will be 5,000 staff provided before Christmas and 7,500 will be provided after Christmas. I will tell the Minister in a straightforward way that if he can get 12,500 staff members into the health service by next April, I will buy him a good bottle of whiskey.If he can even get the 10,000, I will buy him a good bottle of whiskey. I know we are being flippant, and it is not a joke, but I want to see a plan and I will work with the Minister on where we will get all of these nurses, and particularly specialists and doctors, that he is committed to delivering. On cancer screening, I want to see a clinical reason BreastCheck screening has gone to three years. I have asked that question. The screening was always every two years but now, because of Covid-19, it will be every three years. I do not buy that and most people who have knowledge of this do not buy it either. I want to raise a couple of other issues. As regards the funding that has been announced, I have a huge interest in people with intellectual disabilities. They have been let down. They are our most vulnerable. We need to ensure the plan deals with that issue, and obviously with mental health also.  I want to see more diagnostics going into the community. I refer to all the different doctors who are in co-operatives across the country. We all know they are co-operatives and are private practice but they need extra supports because they are acting in a different way now. They are acting as part of a different type of network in an emergency. They need supports so the Minister should target them. I have a real issue with what happened with regard to private hospitals. It is not today or yesterday I said that but I will always stand over it. At the beginning of this crisis we should have bought one of the two main private hospitals in Dublin, if not both of them. The Minister will need capacity. That is the quickest way of getting it. People are saying the total amount of public and private beds will be the same but we need public capacity. I believe it would be cheaper in the long term and I still believe the Minister should consider it.

I want to recognise that our healthcare workers have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic and that investment will support them as they care for their patients, both those who have Covid-19 and those who have other healthcare requirements. I welcome the Home First approach that emphasises reablement in providing extensive home care support packages for those with more complex needs, including people with dementia who are being supported through additional resources that have been allocated towards that area. The roll-out of community specialist teams to support older people and those with chronic illnesses is also hugely positive. Those teams will help them to stay at home or, if they need hospital care, to get them home more quickly afterwards. Under the current programme for Government, the commitment towards primary care facilities and recognising that hospitals are often not the best place for people to be in on a long-term basis is a positive move. My home town of Youghal, for example, does not have a primary healthcare centre and such developments in communities such as Youghal would be very welcome in the future. I look forward to working with the Minister to try to deliver that for the people of my constituency. I would also like to raise a point about funding for communication strategies to communicate the message about Covid-19 to young people. I do so as the youngest Member of this House. Dr. Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization said that there was an ongoing shift in Covid-19 to younger adults. The shift in the disease being detected in our younger population is probably because they are the ones who came back into society at an earlier stage as they were returning to work, college and university. Younger people may suffer a less severe version, in some cases, of the Covid-19 disease but it is not guaranteed that this will always be the case. There is always a risk of passing it on to older populations and more vulnerable members of society. Transmission from younger to older generations can occur, especially if younger people are asymptomatic. If the disease is passed on to older generations again, Dr. Ryan said the hospitals will refill, which is something we do not want to see happen. I want to highlight the need to target the messaging specifically to young people when it comes to Covid-19. As a young person, I understand that young people do not consume information in the same way as older generations of our society. We need to adapt our approach to ensure every section of our society is aware of the ramifications of the Covid-19 disease, not only for themselves but also for others in the community. I do not want this to come across as young people needing to be specifically singled out and communicated to or, worse, to be lectured but I am conscious that the media consumption patterns have changed so dramatically between generations that this issue cannot be left unaddressed. I commend the Minister on his hard work, which he has shown since he came into his Department. As he is aware, I have highlighted my concerns around some of the mental health constraints that Covid-19 is placing on our citizens and young people across this country. The lives of many young people have been turned upside down because of this pandemic. They now face very few job prospects in many cases and a very uncertain future, which can greatly impact on an individual's mental health. The general direction of the winter plan is to ensure that we continue to keep the level of deaths from Covid-19 low and that other illnesses are treated also, but in a time of great change for so many across the world it is important that we do not forget to look after our mental health. I refer to measures such as reducing our social contacts. For many young people, not being able to attend university can be draining. I want to say here today that young people are not forgotten in this fight against Covid-19 and that the Minister's Department is looking to ensure that any person who is suffering throughout this pandemic, or at any time, can get the support they need. Young people need hope that we can get through this pandemic without our health service being overrun, hope that everyone is doing their best to ensure we have a healthcare system in place that will overcome this pandemic, and hope that the future will be better and that we will get through this together.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	255	I thank the Minister for facilitating this debate. It is very encouraging to see that the winter plan has strongly accounted for building capacity and service continuity and ensuring pathways of care during the pandemic era. It is welcome that more than €600 million will be spent as part of the plan, under which the largest spend will be on home support and Home First, totalling in excess of €130 million. Many of us expressed our support for the healthcare workers on the front line, be it those working in our hospitals, GP services, pharmacies and those providing care at home. However, I must acknowledge the work done by HSE management during the pandemic. They had to respond to a national and international challenge beyond any I can think of in living memory. They have undertaken a public health campaign on a magnitude not witnessed by many. It is inspiring to see such public service values come to the fore during a time when strong leadership and public confidence was most required. While our healthcare system has some long-standing weaknesses and legacy issues, it is important to recognise the strong leadership and to be thankful for such in times of crisis. I am hopeful this pandemic will also present an opportunity to address some of the long-term capacity challenges in our health service, in particular emergency department overcrowding. I note that the winter plan highlights that in a Covid-19 environment there is a need for zero tolerance of overcrowding in all care environments. Ensuring the delivery of the long-awaited temporary modular unit planned for Mayo University Hospital is a vital concern for me. While it is due on site by early November, I believe it is important to keep the issue highlighted until it is operational as we enter the winter months. I was recently advised by the HSE that a feasibility study is taking place within the Saolta health care group regarding the development of a 50-bed ward block at Mayo University Hospital. Any further update on that would be most welcome. In recent months, various other improvement works have been progressing at the hospital, including electrical upgrade works with the provision of a new energy centre along with the installation of additional generator capacity. Other improvements include the reconfiguration and upgrade to the hospital sterile service department as well as the replacement of existing autoclave equipment and building reconfiguration work to achieve compliance with the latest decontamination standards. Such investments are most welcome during the Covid-19 era. An area of concern which I note is mentioned in the winter plan is general practice support. I am especially conscious of single-handed practices, two-doctor practices and practices with older GPs. Some of those practices are covering huge areas of incredible rural geography, for instance, Belmullet, the Erris region or Achill. I would appreciate it if the Minister could provide further detail on the temporary crisis support to ensure the continued provision of local GP services.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	256	The Minister will be well aware that I have spoken on health issues a number of times, both in this Dáil and many times in the Thirty-second Dáil, so here we go again. I feel I have to do so because of the constituency I represent, which is Limerick city and includes part of Tipperary. We have University Hospital Limerick in that constituency.I have to speak so often on health because, unfortunately, the issues of overcrowding and low staff levels are ever present in the hospital. The number of patients waiting on trolleys is nearly always the highest in the State. A total of 1,146 patients waited on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick in September this year. The numbers are massive and totally unacceptable. While they are down on last year, the Minister will be aware that the pre-Covid figures for January and February were much higher than those for 2019, which will be a major cause of concern after Covid. In February 2020 there were 1,286 on trolleys, by comparison with 973 in February 2019, and in January 2020 there were 1,215 on trolleys, by comparison with 973 in January 2019. Before Covid, the emergency department was often bursting at the seams and it was clearly unsafe for patients and needed urgent intervention. University Hospital Limerick is a fine hospital and the staff, from porters to nurses and doctors, do an incredible job, but they often do so in very difficult conditions. I hope the Government's winter plan will provide some remedy for the problems faced by the hospital. These issues will become even more difficult to manage with the onset of the winter flu season, as the Minister is well aware. I accept that the winter plan was never designed to be, or going to be, a panacea for all these issues. I hoped it would provide some solutions and comfort to the people of Limerick. Unfortunately, it seems my reasonable expectations were overly optimistic. As my colleagues said, we were not presented with a plan but with a fantasy list. The Minister knows, or at least should know, the difficulties faced by University Hospital Limerick. I have spoken about them here often enough and he is well aware of them. We are presented with offers and no remedies. What this plan offers is clearly inadequate. It is inadequate in terms of its ambition to increase the number of beds and, most important, in terms of targets to increase the number of staff needed to deliver appropriate care through the winter. The plan aims to improve patient experience times in emergency departments and reduce trolley numbers by 30% compared with the winter of 2019. These are good ambitions but, quite frankly, the resources needed are not committed to. The plan proposes to open an additional 251 acute beds and 89 sub-acute beds in quarter 4 of 2020, and a further 232 acute beds in quarter 1 of 2021. I welcome any increase in available beds but I wonder whether the targets can be met. There are hundreds of unfilled vacancies across the health service. I am aware, from speaking to nurses recently, that there are a large number of vacancies in University Hospital Limerick. Without filling these positions, the new beds promised cannot be opened. There is construction in Limerick but there seems to be no real plan to make sure the facility will be equipped properly when the beds are in operation. The plan does not show enough ambition. Sinn Féin's health plan, Better for Health, is ambitious. It would require significant and sustained public investment but would deliver results, not short-term achievements of metrics. It would result in a long-term commitment to move from a two-tier public-private health system to a universal healthcare system. Our plan targets the delivery of 1,100 additional acute and sub-acute beds and 50 ICU beds. I have a difficulty with what is in the Government's plan and with the question of whether it can be delivered, but I wish to highlight what is not in it, that is, a commitment on mental health. In fact, not only does the plan not make any commitments on this important issue, it does not even refer to it. Mental health services have been chronically neglected for years. The winter plan is meant to be a short-term tactical plan but it is outrageous that mental health is absent from it. The Minister will be well aware that Deputies of all parties have raised their concerns over the number of mental health issues and suicide levels caused by Covid. Funding and resources for mental health are critical in my city, Limerick. The Covid committee has heard expert opinion and anticipates an increase in the number of mental illness cases due to the stress of Covid but there is no plan for this. Throughout the country, there are some wonderful mental health organisations that for far too long have been carrying a burden that the Minister’s Department should be helping with. I commend them on their often unseen and unreported work. The Minister and his Department have a responsibility in this matter. There is no reference to disability services and no funding allocated for this year to kick-start cancer services that I can see. The Minister mentioned funding for 2021. I welcome the community specialist teams, however. This is a good idea. If this initiative is used correctly, it could support older people and help manage conditions outside the hospital setting. Visiting a hospital is daunting enough at any age but this is especially true with the added concerns about Covid-19 transmission. I am deeply concerned about what will happen in University Hospital Limerick, especially the emergency department, over the winter. If I were to grade the Minister's plan, I would give him a low C but I am sure the algorithm of his colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, would reduce this mark further.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	257	There is no doubting that the headline figure for the winter plan, €600 million, is very substantial and dwarfs any amount set aside in previous winter plans. It requires and deserves further scrutiny, however. The small print indicates that only one-third of the amount is to be spent in the current year and potentially two-thirds - the funding has not been secured yet - will require agreement in the budgetary process. Theoretically, just one third of the amount is to be available for spending this year. A lot of digging down has to be done into the details of the figure. It includes expenditure on many services that have been put in place in recent months. Therefore, there will not be new services to the net value of €200 million this year. On a very positive front, I very much welcome the considerable allocation made for home care. Many of us have been looking for that for years. It makes absolute sense. It should have happened long before now. The amount provided, as I understand it, will address the needs of the 6,000 people at home who have been approved for home care but who have been on a waiting list. Those people, in the main, are in very vulnerable circumstances. They may be on their own or infirm and they desperately need care. I hope all the waiting lists can be cleared with the allocation made. I hope it will ensure that, in so far as it is possible, they will not end up hospital or nursing homes. That is all the allocation will do, however. It will not cater for new people who require care. A very considerable number who are ready to be discharged home from hospital need to be catered for also. These are the two separate groups. In the time remaining, I wish to concentrate on what I believe to be glaring omissions. Three points arise: the lack of any provision at all for mental health services, the lack of any provision for disability services, and the wholly inadequate position on ICU beds. With regard to mental health services, many of us have been talking in recent months and years about the underlying underinvestment in mental health services. There are long waiting lists for children, in particular, and adults. I provided the figures here a couple of weeks ago. Thousands of children are on waiting lists for community services, whether child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, or community psychological services. That was the situation before Covid. We are aware that A Vision for Change was not funded adequately. There has been a shortfall of €50 million in funding in recent years for the implementation of A Vision for Change. Sharing the Vision has finally been published, and it has a price tag attached to it. It has not been provided for in the winter plan. That was the pre-Covid position. With Covid, it is significantly worse. We heard the very good contribution of Deputy Lahart, who very eloquently described the circumstances in which people find themselves as a result of the major psychological impact of Covid. Isolation, depression, anxiety, grief and loss are all taking a very significant psychological toll. More than ever, we need to put in place significant funding to address the major mental health problem we are storing up, which is at the point of exploding. Most Members of this House have referred to it as a crisis coming down the tracks very quickly owing to inadequate services. It is just shocking that no provision was made for mental health services in the winter plan. I cannot understand it. I cannot understand what the Minister has been doing, nor can I understand what the Minister of State has been doing. It is deeply disappointing. I urge the Minister to make this a priority in the budget in a couple of weeks. There is a major omission in respect of disability services. There is no mention of these in the winter plan. There was an announcement of €10 million last Sunday but the Minister knows that falls very far short of what is required.We now have a situation where large numbers of family carers are looking after their loved ones at home because many services closed during Covid. At this point, some of them are opening, but only gradually and for approximately one day per week or, at most, two days per week. There is a huge level of need in this area. There are 1,250 primary carers over the age of 70 caring at home for somebody with an intellectual disability, 400 of whom are carers aged 80 or more. This is shocking and it has been going on now for over six months and is taking a huge toll on people. Many children with disabilities for whom timely services are essential in order to meet their milestones are being denied access to essential therapies that should be provided at community level, including speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and so on. Many respite services are closed or severely restricted. People with intellectual disabilities are experiencing severe mental health challenges as they struggle to cope in the current circumstances. The Minister is aware of the cost of addressing the huge gaps in services. He is also aware of the cost of putting in place the additional services that are required as a result of Covid and meeting all of the requirements under public health advice. What he provided last Sunday was a small fraction of that cost. It is not good enough. These are the most vulnerable citizens and they must be catered for and looked after in the upcoming budget.  On intensive care beds, we knew pre-Covid that we were hugely underprovided in this area. We had less than half the recommended number according to European standards. There has been some small number of additional ICU beds provided. The fear last March was around the low level of ICU beds. We had so much catching up to do. What is provided for in this plan in terms of net additional beds is 17. Inclusive of all that is funded under the winter plan, we are still more than 200 beds short of the pre-Covid requirement. I put it to the Minister that this is hopeless.

The winter plan seeks, in part, to protect services and patient care delivery. I am concerned about the lack of services in the community for those in need of palliative care. Palliative care teams are fantastic but there is not enough of them. People could die without this care because of under-resourced services. This winter more people will die but we cannot allow their families to spend precious last days fighting for care for their loved ones. It is imperative that the Minister properly staffs this resource. We cannot have a family sharing a palliative care team with another family and have one patient die while the team is attending the other patient. This happened in my constituency this week. The family concerned was devastated. I have been working with them since. No family should have that experience because of a lack of resources. Today marks the beginning of breast cancer awareness month. When will breast screening services resume? I have been told that there is a waiting list of 12 to 14 weeks. While cancer can in some cases be slow to move, anxiety is not. Patients were not able to access screening because of Covid and in some cases they were too afraid to discuss their symptoms with their GPs or they could not access a GP because of Covid. Adding to their anxiety by extending waiting times is not acceptable. I know that this is a priority area for the Minister and I ask that he provide me with an update on it. I want to comment on the current restrictions in Dublin and Donegal. I think restrictions might be imposed on more counties soon on the basis of the current figures. As things stand today, will restrictions have an impact on services in counties? In other words, if restrictions are imposed on more counties will services be affected? Will people be told to not attend services? I also want to speak about the impact of Covid-19 on our mental health services. It concerns me that this pandemic exposes the huge gaps in our services. Many more people are seeking to access supports during this difficult time. We know that our mental health system was under serious pressure prior to the pandemic and it is even more stretched now. Our communities are in dire need of funding to support them through this tough time. Mental Health Reform, the national coalition of 70 plus different organisations, launched its pre-budget submission seeking an increase in staffed mental health services, the development of an out-of-hours crisis service to give people quick and easy access to services, investment in primary care mental health and talk therapy to enable prevention and early intervention, support for the community and voluntary sector to continue providing essential mental services , investment in individual placements and support to help people get back to work. We need to resource these services. Earlier, the Minister spoke about the excellent work being done by our paramedics. I compliment the service in Carlow. We have excellent paramedics who are going to houses to carry out testing. We are two or three days behind. I raised the following issue at the recent meeting of the Covid committee but it is important to raise it again now. For three years now, I have been raising the Department's promised investment of €350,000 for a building to house this service. Currently, it is housed in a prefab with one shower to cater for a number of paramedics. It is important that funding is provided. My other concern is in regard to staffing in general. It is brilliant to have ambition for the plan. I believe this winter plan is ambitious but I have concerns. Who will staff these beds? How will those staff be paid? Will our student nurses be paid, as our student doctors are paid? How will we pay for these resources in the middle of the pandemic? Are we represented on the national doctors training and planning, NDTP, medical workforce speciality review specific to each area of medicine in Ireland? I am conscious of glaring gaps in our medical workforce. For example, in the south west for a population of over 500,000 there are only 2.4 public health specialists, which is not near enough. I welcome the announcement yesterday that 250 more specialists are to come on stream nationwide. Is the HSE actively recruiting and to what areas will staff be deployed? It is important we know this. I welcome the €138 million for home care supports and additional hours. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has been working hard on this provision. I welcome that provision. It is so important. When will the funding be made available and will the Minister of State provide a breakdown of the allocations, in particular for CHO5, which is my area? I also welcome the ten new dementia advisers. When will these jobs be taken up and, again, will any of them be deployed to CHO5? This is a €600 million plan. We have to welcome it. How we use that money is important. I know from interactions with the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Rabbitte, in regard to disability services that a lot of services will get funding, although I note it was mentioned earlier there is nothing much in the plan in regard to disability services. The flu vaccine was mentioned. We will be living with Covid for a long time and we are heading into the winter, which will be a difficult time for young and old. We are living in a different world. We will probably never see anything like this again in terms of the recession and the changing times. Families are trying to watch out for each other and people are afraid to go outside in case they catch the virus and pass it on to someone else. We have to be careful. Do we have enough flu vaccine and, if not, do we have a plan if we run out of it?

As we are all acutely aware, 2020 has presented a monumental challenge for our health services. We have demanded huge sacrifices from our nurses, doctors, paramedics and all of the staff who keep our hospitals and all medical facilities running safely every day. This winter, unfortunately, promises to present even more challenges for our health infrastructure and front-line staff. It is imperative that we prepare in the right way to ensure we have the ability and capability to deal effectively with the obstacles that we will be faced with in the months ahead. Members of this House will be acutely aware that Covid-19 will remain with us for some time. We will likely see spikes in infection and hospitalisations. We know also that during the pandemic other illnesses do not cease. People still require hospitalisation for a myriad of conditions and we must have adequate resources in place to manage these risks and prevent our health services being stretched insofar as we can. I am pleased that we have a commitment to a significant increase in spending, staff and beds. These will be much needed as our front-line staff endure what is no doubt going to be a difficult winter. As we continue our fight against Covid-19 in the months ahead, testing will become an important feature for us to understand the direction in which the virus is heading. We must remain ambitious in this endeavour and put in place operational capacity to avoid the development of backlogs and other associated pitfalls. In the early stages of the pandemic there was a large reduction in the number of people attending emergency departments, as has been mentioned during this debate. There have also been reductions in the number of people presenting with other non-Covid related illnesses for fear of contracting the virus. We do not yet know the full extent of the ramifications this will have for the long-term health of the population. Successfully overcoming many conditions requires timely intervention. Providing confidence to the public will be an important feature of avoiding a repeat of this situation, along with the implementation of improved access to healthcare through technology, remote clinics and improved community care, which will be greatly appreciated in my constituency of Dublin Fingal and is included in the winter plan. It is also vital that there is a significant take-up of the winter flu vaccine, as my colleague just mentioned. Historically, we struggled to have large take-up of the vaccine, even among healthcare professionals. This year, however, there is an obvious need for maximum engagement. The expansion of free access to the vaccine was a very positive step in this regard. As the vaccine is available now, we must encourage as many people as possible to get it, through information and communication campaigns across all media platforms. By doing so, we will avoid the potential for increased pressure on the health services as a result of a bad winter flu season. I wish to refer to a comment made by Deputy Shortall in a previous debate on a previous day when she spoke about the need for political parties and none to engage collectively in promoting the message of engaging with the health services for ailments that might be worrying people. She referred to influencers and the like. There should be some unity of purpose in the House in terms of the political leadership that is shown to promote the uptake of a winter flu vaccine by collectively messaging the public. Perhaps it could be through a single video to show the unity of purpose of this House and the Seanad. It could also relate to the messaging on Covid-19. It is worthy of our consideration. Success in respect of the availability of the winter flu vaccine may also enhance our ability to encourage take-up of the Covid vaccine, should one be developed and approved for use in the near future. This afternoon, RTÉ published a poll showing that 32% of people expressed an unwillingness to take up the first vaccine for Covid when it becomes available and a further 12% were unsure if they would take up the vaccine. The winter plan, correctly, focuses on protecting as many vulnerable people as possible. This is the challenge for all of us. We must come together as a nation to protect vulnerable people, their families and friends, our neighbours and even strangers we may never meet. We will survive the pandemic due to the individual sacrifices of people. The Irish people are ready and willing to protect these people again. It is our job to ensure we can provide a strong and capable health service that will have the ability to cater for the demands of this winter and, indeed, repay the sacrifice of front-line workers who are at the coalface each day.

A number of Members mentioned the necessity for test, trace and isolate capacity. I reiterate that somebody must examine areas such as Dundalk and north County Louth, which has problems at present with an increase in cases. However, the test centre is moving to Ardee. That must be examined. In fairness, Deputy Munster has been strongly urging that Drogheda also needs a test centre. These are two major urban areas. Members referred to the flu vaccine. We must ensure we have the stocks and the capacity. This must happen because otherwise we will create a pile of problems for ourselves. A number of Members have said that the plan has stop-gap fixes and spoke about the need for more long-term planning, particularly on delivering ICU bed capacity. I hope some of their questions will be answered, be it by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, or the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. I wish to deal with a number of issues regarding non-Covid care. I previously raised the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS. I have been contacted by a number of people who use these services and also use intellectual disability services. There are far fewer dental practitioners using the scheme at present. It is a difficulty for anybody who has a medical card. It requires action and a delivery plan because there does not appear to be a solution at present. We have all heard the horror stories about children in very bad circumstances. Today, one of my colleagues raised the fact that St. John of God Community Services says it will cease its involvement in the provision of community services by 1 October 2021. It currently provides intellectual, disability and mental health services to more than 8,000 children, adolescents and adults and employs 3,000 staff and volunteers in 300 locations across Dublin, Kildare, Kerry, Wicklow, Meath and Louth. A large number of people will be impacted, including workers. Families are incredibly worried about whether the service provision will happen. We must get some type of solution. I am thinking of the families, the service users and the workers in places such Drumcar and the St. John of God Venegas Centre in Dundalk. Perhaps we could get an answer regarding a plan. Like many Members, I am worried that this plan does not deal with mental health services. I spoke to the Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte and Butler, earlier this week about a number of cases of County Louth that are incredibly important and which will require a follow-up meeting with mental health services in the county. Perhaps the Minister of State would be good enough to meet some of the families to hear about their issues, because it is an ongoing situation and we need to provide some clarity on protocols and a solution that facilitates a service that people deserve. I would be grateful if that could happen as quickly as possible. I am also curious about another issue relating to St. John of God Community Services. I understand that a system had been set up whereby a portal was to be opened and services were to put in their requests for what they would require to operate in the present circumstances. While I accept that, at times, not every request will be delivered, I am confused about how we went from that to a situation where St. John of God Community Services is saying it is ceasing operations. There should be clarity about that as soon as possible. As this is my last opportunity to speak in the House this week, I welcome the fact that the European Commission has taken legal action against the British Government due to its illegal action with the Internal Market Bill, which is endangering the Irish protocol, the withdrawal agreement, the Good Friday Agreement and business, society and life across Ireland.

The conflicting advice, confused rules and regulations and lack of clarity about what needs to be done and what we are doing from the Government are feeding into that fear.In this context, I would love to be able to say something positive about the announced winter plan. I am afraid I cannot because those at the front line of the health service, our nurses, doctors and consultants, have made it clear that this plan is not addressing the crisis. We could say it is a sticking plaster but in reality it is more akin to a policy of saying a prayer and hoping for the best. It is said that Covid-19 is ruthless in seeking out the most vulnerable, those with underlying conditions or with a fragility. That is one reason the fear in this country is so high. We have over 1 million citizens with underlying conditions and their families and loved ones are also in fear. This pandemic is also ruthless in exposing the weaknesses and underlying conditions in our economic, social and health systems. When this crisis started last March, the then Minister for Health acknowledged that a two-tier, dysfunctional health system was not fit for purpose in dealing with a pandemic. He gave us the impression that the Government was gone all socialist and was going to provide a one-tier system based on need and not on the ability to pay. It is now clear that no such policy was ever planned. Even as the virus ploughs ahead, we remain committed to a two-tier health system. The winter plan will see us repeat temporary purchasing at very high prices from the private sector with no vision of the permanent capacity increase that we need. Of the 1,500 new beds announced as part of the winter plan, which is to cover us from now until April, there seem to be only 528 actual new beds. Will the Minister of State confirm that or is it more PR spin that the Government thinks will fool the virus? That lack of real vision of a plan to fundamentally change the system is another reason people have real fears. We must compare these details with what the front-line workers are saying. The Irish Hospital Consultants Association says we need an extra 2,000 inpatient beds at a minimum and has called for a doubling of ICU beds. We are getting an extra 17. The INMO has pointed out that many of the 300 beds opened under last year's winter initiative are now closed due to staff shortages. If we cannot keep beds open from last year because of staff shortages - one hospital in the east has 400 nursing vacancies - how in the hell can we be confident that we will staff this plan? In a pandemic crisis such as this we need emergency steps. We need to take over the private hospitals, end agency staffing and bring workers into the HSE in a permanent capacity on permanent contracts to end this two-tier system and to show everybody that we are indeed all in this together and that there is real social solidarity.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	267	Last week it was announced that Tallaght hospital has had to cancel elective surgeries and close operating theatres due to the second wave of Covid and the major threat it poses to our entire health service. This comes on top of the closure of Tallaght hospital's children's accident and emergency department and its rushed downgrade last month. Decades of Government neglect mean our hospitals have a serious underlying condition, namely underfunding. Thousands of hospital beds have been closed. Pleas for more staff have been ignored. The result is that we have a health service that struggles to cope. Winter is coming and our health staff and hospitals need urgent support. We also must learn the lessons of this crisis and vow to reverse the decades of neglect which Deputy Bríd Smith has spoken about, the entrenched two-tier system which is further and further entrenched, and instead build a one-tier, quality national health service in Ireland. Tallaght hospital needs immediate relief but it also needs long-term investment. It is shameful that mental health services have been completely forgotten in the Government's winter plan. Not a single cent has been set aside in this plan for mental health services. Even before the pandemic, we had massive backlogs and waiting lists for basic mental health services and supports. The Covid crisis has made it much worse. As well as the extra stresses and strains on people resulting in a significant increase in referrals to mental health supports, we have also seen the suspension and delaying of many of those supports. We need emergency funding for mental health services. We need to be investing in remote psychotherapy and counselling services for those in need and supporting our mental health services.  It struck me in the course of the last week with the extra round of announcements of advisers for junior ministers that the Government now employs 64 special political advisers but only 60 specialist public health doctors. It is a Government that has more spin doctors than public health doctors. In the midst of a global pandemic, the Government is finally talking about investing in public health but we need urgent action here. We need significant investment in tracking and tracing in particular. Despite all of the Government's spin, the reality is that Ireland is still testing at about half the rate of similar sized countries like Denmark. We are still not testing many close contacts such as those in schools. We need to invest in public health, testing and tracing as part of a strategy to crush the curve and to eliminate community transmission. Otherwise we will be caught on a merry-go-round of outbreaks and lockdowns which will continue to disrupt people's lives and our society over the course of the next year.

I welcome the Government's decision to invest an additional €600 million in health services this winter. Healthcare workers the length and breadth of the country have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic and we are going to ask even more of them in the coming months. This investment will go some way towards supporting them as they care for their patients. The plan provides more hospital and community beds and significantly increased homecare support. Some 34 new beds are to be opened at Cork University Hospital under this plan and additional beds are also due to be opened at Mercy University Hospital. While this is a welcome and much-needed measure, any extra capacity also requires extra staffing. I note that the INMO general secretary, Phil Ní Sheaghdha, has expressed concern about the lack of detail around the staff planning arrangements. The success of this plan will be contingent on the recruitment of additional staff. I would like to ask the Minister of State whether her Department could provide further clarity or detail on how the HSE intends to recruit the 12,500 additional staff to provide this care. A constituent of mine was due to undergo an assessment in hospital recently but the doctor carrying out the assessment was deployed elsewhere as a result of Covid-19. A few months later another doctor was assigned. It is my understanding that a few assessments resumed but were halted again in recent weeks due to the increase in cases. I would be hopeful that the Minister could put in place a significant and detailed staffing plan to avoid incidents like this over the coming months. We are all too aware that waiting lists are at record levels and Covid-19 is affecting the overall capacity of the system. I have been contacted by many constituents expressing concern that their elective procedures may be cancelled. The winter plan is estimating some 10,000 outpatient appointments, 2,879 inpatient procedures, nearly 18,000 day case procedures and nearly 3,000 gastrointestinal scopes. I ask the Minister of State to do everything possible to ensure these procedures go ahead. Cancer services have been mentioned by a number of Members this evening. I ask that the Minister of State ensure that reduced cancer services do not become the new norm in Ireland as the Covid-19 pandemic continues. Cancer patients need to be diagnosed and treated at the earliest opportunity. I ask the Minister of State to commit the necessary funding to cancer services. As we are all well aware, the three screening services, BreastCheck, BowelScreen and CervicalCheck were cancelled in March. CervicalCheck reopened in July and BowelScreen in August. I would be grateful if the Minister of State could provide confirmation of when BreastCheck will reopen. In respect of all three screening services, I ask that a huge effort is made to ensure that screening and cancer test backlogs are cleared as early as possible. I welcome the €10 million that was made available to disability services last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. She met a number of groups in Cork in the past few months including Cope Foundation and various others. It needs to be acknowledged that the additional funding will make a big difference to day services not just in Cork but around the country. I was listening to the debate from my office before I came down and wish to respond to some of the adjectives that were used by members of the Opposition. We are not even in the middle of winter yet. People are calling for unity on one stage. I do not think it is the time for ideological battles.There are Members on this side of the House who believe in ending a two-tier service in healthcare. I do not believe now, in the middle of a pandemic, is the time to be talking about ideological differences. We are facing what will probably be the worst winter in our history in terms of healthcare provision and the people need to get behind the Department of Health, the Minister for Health and the various Ministers of State who have a very difficult task ahead. As I said, I was baffled by some of the adjectives used, such as "underwhelming", "fantasy list", "lacking ambition" and "a failure". It is a failure and it has not even started. We all knowledge there are difficulties in the Department of Health and in healthcare provision in this country. In the middle of a pandemic, however, and facing the worst winter we are likely to face in terms of flu and with Covid-19, the people need to get off the stage and get behind the health services and the Ministers.
#ChristopherOsullivan	unknown-#ChristopherOsullivan-party	unknown-#ChristopherOsullivan-dob	unknown-#ChristopherOsullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	269	I am here behind the Minister but I have his back, so it is okay. He need not worry. I very much welcome the plan. It is unprecedented in scale and funding of €600 million. We have never seen the likes of it previously for a winter plan. Clearly, the Minister's fingerprints are all over it with, I believe, close to five million hours of home care. That is huge and it is significant. It is something previous Governments and previous Members, including Opposition leaders, have been calling for consistently, and that is something we will deliver on. I congratulate the Minister on that because it will make a huge difference to families, to communities and, most importantly, to the elderly people who this was intended to help. I congratulate him on that and fair play to him. He came into this role with a lot of passion and fair play to him for fighting for that allocation. It is incredibly important. Of course, the winter plan was never going to be all-encompassing. There were elements that all of us, Government Members as well, would like to have seen included. Perhaps, therefore, the following could be seen as much as a budget plea as a plea to have it included in the winter plan and that it could be included in aspects of the health budget. The first topic I wish to touch on is disability services. I appreciate from the announcement that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, fought tooth and nail for funding towards disability services. She managed to secure €10 million in conjunction with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly. Unfortunately, in terms of the overall scale and the overall picture for disability services, it is only the tip of the iceberg and only scratches the surface. The truth of the matter is that because of chronic underfunding in previous years, the reality is that disability services need a budget of in or around €100 million to bring them up to an absolute acceptable standard. That is just the reality. While I appreciate that €10 million will go some way towards that, we certainly need more allocated towards disability services. I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was briefed by the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers during the week. I believe the picture and the story the representatives painted for her was pretty bleak and told a story of where we are at. There are approximately 26,000 users within the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers. Of that figure, for 400 of the families the main carer is in his or her 80s. I believe it was alluded to earlier in the House. That has massive implications. Obviously, because the carer is elderly, it completely limits the amount of services the actual service user, which is a child in this situation, can avail of. That is worrying. Obviously, the person cannot go out into the community because of the fear of the elderly carer contracting coronavirus, which we know is devastating for people in their 80s and upwards. A further non-Covid related issue is the fact that many of these children and servicer users are well into their 40s, 50s and 60s. There is a fear and anxiety that goes with the fact that their parents and main carers are becoming elderly and there is no service coming in to replace that. That is a pretty stark reality. There are some users with primary carers in their 90s, so it is pretty stark. That goes further, because another group is coming up behind where the main carers are in their 60s. Unless we put the residential care facilities and day care facilities in place, there will be serious concern and anxiety and those vulnerable groups will be left exposed. Services obviously have had to be greatly reduced during Covid-19. They are only running at approximately 40% capacity from what I can gather. I know first-hand of a fantastic voluntary service provider in west Cork called CoAction West Cork, and I have spoken to the Minister about this previously. It is fantastic and I have seen first-hand the difference it makes for its service users. The interaction between the staff and the service users is phenomenal. Obviously, over the past six or seven months there has been an absolute void and it has been running at a very reduced capacity. That will have an impact going forward. With that said, to make the disability service sector work properly, it needs significantly more funding, and budget 2021 is an opportunity to do that. Another aspect of health that could have been more strongly represented in the winter plan, but again this can be taken as a budgetary plea, is the whole area of mental health, which has been touched on a lot here. Historically, it has been chronically underfunded but now, for the first time, perhaps, in the past five or six years we have started to open up and talk about mental health and our own mental health experiences within the family and the community. That is important. However, that conversation exposes the fact that the whole service has been chronically underfunded. As a Government, we now need to step in and address that because so many families and people nationwide are impacted by this. That has been stressed all day in the Chamber during this debate. I must make a plea for Bantry General Hospital in my constituency of west Cork. I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, on several occasions about this and he is well aware of it. I wish, however, to make this plea in the Dáil. There is a 24-hour acute emergency access service in Bantry hospital at the moment. It is vitally important when one thinks about the geographical nature of west Cork and how big it is. The journey from somewhere like Castletownbere to Cork University Hospital takes hours, so Bantry provides a really important service. There is 24-hour acute emergency access there at the moment. That is underpinned by the provision of an anaesthetist but we need support anaesthesiology there to ensure the service remains. The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is aware of it but I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight it in the Dáil Chamber.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	270	A previous speaker from the Fianna Fáil Party suggested that we should all put our differences aside and simply get behind our health services and the Ministers. I would like nothing more than to do that. It is very difficult, however, to just simply get behind our Minister and our health services when dealing daily, as I do and, I am sure, as other Members do, with sectoral interests, people who are at the coalface and people who are in need of services and treatment, none more so than those reliant on our disability services. The failure of the Minister to include additional funding resources or investment provisions for disability and dementia services in the winter plan is astounding. His subsequent announcement of a meagre €10 million for disability day services and home support six months into the pandemic has been met with shock and dismay by the sector. To say it falls short of the urgent needs of the 643,133 people with disabilities in the State today is an understatement of the highest order. Disability services, as the Minister will be aware, submitted their Covid-related costs to the HSE in June, so the Minister knows that the moneys that were announced on Monday past are just a fraction of the funding needed to deliver services. I should not have to remind the Minister of his Government's commitment under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I cannot overstate the personal toll and long-term impact of the withdrawal of care and supports for people with disabilities, their families and carers. I am calling and pleading again on the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to address the funding crisis for disability services in budget 2021 and to bring their funding resources and capital investment needs on a sustainable footing going forward. On that note, I wish to raise this issue again with the Minister, because every time I try, unfortunately, for one reason or another, I cannot eyeball him across this Chamber, the issue of the group home for people with disabilities in Carrickmacross. This group home was accepted as a very important resource that was warranted back the early 2000s.From that point on the families of the people who will reside in this group home had to fight tooth and nail every step of the way. The building was finally completed in 2016 and then disgracefully and remarkably the HSE announced it had no money to run it. Every year we have been told that it will be considered for the following year's Estimates. Unfortunately, at a political level during the terms of several Ministers, the response has been to say that this is a HSE matter. I ask the Minister of State to bring this message once again to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly. This is a political issue and we need political accountability. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, responds to my request. He should bring together the relevant officials in his Department and in the HSE along with representatives of any other bodies involved, such as the Respond housing agency, Monaghan County Council and whoever needs to be brought around a table to resolve this issue. These are young adults with very profound physical and sensory disabilities. Their needs have been assessed and the health services have decided that they are best placed in the long term in this group home. The group home, which is finished, is a fine building. It needs a few bits and pieces to be changed, but it is essentially ready to become operational. Unfortunately, the HSE has decided that its operation will be outsourced to a private company if it can get somebody to tender for it, which is incredibly disappointing because there was no reference to that before the building was completed. I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to convene that round-table meeting as I have suggested, after which I will be the first to commend the Minister and get, as the Minister of State's Fianna Fáil colleague asked us to do, behind the Minister and the health services because we want the winter plan to work. Those at the coalface of the disability services need the cash, the resources and the infrastructure to do it. A key part of that infrastructure in the south Monaghan and surrounding area is the group home in Carrickmacross. I again plead with the Minister of State to ensure it becomes operational without delay. 
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	271	I want to put on record my support for any measures that will help beat this virus. The Government plan is framed under a number of headings including: building capacity; service continuity; pathways to care; PPE; testing and contact tracing; public health; and e-health. I agree that we need to address the building capacity in the current climate. The proposal to open an additional 251 acute beds and 89 acute beds from now until December and a further 232 acute beds in the first quarter of 2021 is to be welcomed and supported. It is stated in the plan that we can increase efficiency levels by 30% to 40% through new ways of working. If this can be achieved it will be welcome, but I would be interested to know how exactly this efficiency can be achieved and if successful why it has not been implemented prior to this. I welcome the that intermediate care capacity is to be expanded. One of the measures being undertaken is the repurposing of some centres through refurbishments and extensions. I ask the Minister to expand on this and give a timeline for these measures. I am concerned that we need the measures now and when I hear that extensions and refurbishments are involved, I fear that these will be drawn out and not delivered on time. However, I welcome the plan for an additional 530 new rehabilitation beds to be operational by April 2021. I note also that the HSE will once again enter into an arrangement with private hospitals should a surge in Covid cases happen. Again, I would be concerned at the costs involved. Can we be sure that we are getting full value for money? With regard to the service continuity section of the plan, I note that a restoration of services in the community is necessary for the continuation of support of people in maintaining health and well-being and to avoid activity being directed to acute settings. As the Minister knows I have constantly advocated for the restoration of services to Louth County Hospital in Dundalk. The hospital in Dundalk is a fantastic facility and needs to be supported. Now is the perfect opportunity to increase the services at the hospital with this winter plan. Furthermore, any investment in the hospital is a long-term investment and not just for the winter season. The Louth County Hospital in Dundalk has the potential to make a real difference to the north east. It can act as a real support to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which as we know has suffered from capacity issues in the past. The investment at the Louth County Hospital will show real results immediately. I once more urge the Minister to consider the potential of the Louth County Hospital to make a real difference in this current crisis. I invite him to visit the hospital and see for himself the real difference it can make. I note from the pathways to care section of the plan that it is planned to have a total of 20 hubs available from the period January to April 2021 and I welcome this. However, I am concerned that it is anticipated that only 70% of pre-Covid-19 productivity can be achieved with regard to emergency department pathways for non-Covid presentation. We must be aiming for 100% and more. Unfortunately waiting lists have now reached record numbers standing now at 704,000 in total. This is unacceptable and must be properly addressed. Cancer treatment services have also been reduced during the Covid crisis. While I understand the pressures that were placed on the health services, it is simply not right that those requiring cancer treatment or diagnosis were left untreated. This cannot be allowed continue. We must prioritise those who require urgent treatment. Cancer treatment must not suffer. The plan notes that many centres are now struggling to deliver pre-Covid levels of service and this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The plan contains many proposals, but we need real action now. In the section on PPE, testing and contact tracing, the plan states that the HSE is in the process of developing a sustainable Covid-19 test-and-trace service and that the new service model being developed will strengthen underpinning processes to ensure that the service is sustainable and of a high quality into the winter months and beyond. It also states that the detailed design for the final model is still a work in progress, which is unacceptable. How can a final model still only be a work in progress at this stage? It is important that the HSE gets value for money in its purchasing of PPE. I am glad to note that this is mentioned in the plan although it only states that the HSE expects to achieve price reductions. There is little mention of the flu vaccine in the plan other than stating it is to include two to 12 year olds. It is vital that we get the flu vaccine right. Many GPs are complaining that they do not have supplies of the vaccine now. We must not create a new problem with the flu vaccine in our fight with Covid. It is important for the Minister to make a statement on the availability of the flu vaccine and give clarity on the availability now. I welcome the publication of the winter plan and while I agree with a substantial part of it, it is important that the Minister addresses the issues I have raised today. We need clarity on the value-for-money element of the plan to work with private hospitals, clarity on the continuing treatment for cancer sufferers to ensure that they do not become a victim of this pandemic, clarity on the testing-and-tracing system and why it is still only a work in progress and clarity on the availability on the flu vaccine. I once more invite the Minister to visit the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk to see for himself the great work that is currently taking place there and the great potential the hospital has for additional services. I have no doubt once he sees the potential of this hospital, he will see how with some investment the Louth County Hospital will once more have the services that people of the north east deserve.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	272	Since the arrival of Covid into our country a clear and present danger has existed not just to the lives of our elderly and vulnerable, but also to the social and economic cohesion of our State. Covid-19 is largely a killer of the elderly and those with underlying medical vulnerabilities. Thankfully our knowledge of dealing with and treating this illness has advanced greatly over the past six months. Despite its dangers, Covid must not be allowed to sideline the many other significant healthcare areas in which patients need support, particularly cancer, trauma, disability, mental health and chronic disease. The recent Government announcements of increased funding for the winter plan and the overall healthcare sector include the addition of €600 million to fund more front-line staff to develop additional ICU and HDU bed capacity, to provide additional hospital beds and to ramp up to 4.7 million additional home care support hours, which are greatly welcomed. While the funding is welcomed, along with these resources, health service managers must seriously look at how they can reorganise and innovate to deliver increased efficiency in hospital throughput. In our acute care hospitals, the issues of Covid planning pathways must be reviewed with respect to daily case scheduling. We need innovative thinking such as expanding diagnostic services, particularly in scanning and scoping to address the backlog of cancer patients awaiting access to care and treatment. We need increased radiology, diagnostic scoping and biopsies to address the significant waiting times which are emerging in symptomatic and prostate cancer services. Medical needs extend to my constituency of Waterford, where, as the Minister of State will know, waiting times for diagnostic angiograms have extended up to 12 months again. We must consider the use of the National Treatment Purchase Fund in both public and private hospital settings to support extending these service opportunities. Our first priority must continue to be to secure the health of our elderly, particularly those in residential accommodation. We need to ensure ongoing randomised testing of healthcare workers and strict visitor infection protocols particularly over the winter months.Rapid diagnostic tests, though shunned by NPHET to date have shown a pathway to increasing random testing elsewhere in the world, and it is to be hoped we will see their use authorised here as soon as possible. The announcement of the additional 700 swabbers and contact tracers is welcome given that is should allow health staff to return to their jobs where they are so badly needed. The focus in the winter plan on keeping people with physical health needs out of hospital is welcome. However, patients with ongoing mental health and disability issues appear to have been bypassed in the plan as no money has been provided to address their needs or how they can be cared for in the community. This is an area of healthcare that must receive additional priority and allocation of resources. The Government has given us a winter healthcare plan, and although it is extensive in comparison to previous years, the health care needs of our nation have never been greater. We must continue to rely on the truly great legions of healthcare workers in our State who look after our citizens as well as they can. We must persevere in calling all in our community to continue adhering to all of the Covid rules that we have learned in recent months so that, despite intermittent cluster outbreaks and lockdowns as months elapse, we can repair our economy and health services and, it is hoped, steer a path from this global pandemic.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	273	I will make a number of points with respect to the winter plan. First, I welcome the additional funding across a number of areas. The reality is that this must, out of necessity, be a dynamic process as it is responding to a situation that is changing almost daily. However, there are a number of challenges that come with that uncertainty and the need to respond quickly. I draw attention to those requiring services on a long-standing basis who have found the last number of months incredibly difficult. It is very encouraging that extra funds for homeless supports have been included in the measures. This is an issue that impacts the whole country but is keenly felt in my own constituency. Services were already under pressure from increased numbers in 2019. Dublin Simon Community saw an 18% increase in demand for homeless healthcare services last year and provided access to treatment for more than 1,200 people. There was also an increase in waiting times for access to related services over the previous year. For example, for access to detox services the wait time increased by 84%. The same organisation has now also warned of a health crisis in the homeless population in the capital due to the pressure on funding and a shortage of suitable accommodation. Covid has brought the entire system for homelessness and addiction supports to the very brink of capacity. I am aware in my own constituency that the constraints of the pandemic mean that many service providers need additional space. They need more sanitation facilities in particular. A lack of facilities has not only impacted the people who need this most basic human right but it also has a knock-on impact in the local community as service providers spill out. I would urge the Minister for Health to consider capital funding and confirmed multi-annual funding for the provision or lease of buildings to those groups to accommodate the increase in need along with the constraints that Covid represents in terms of delivering those services. Similarly, I very much welcome the inclusion of considerable funding for home care, for community health networks and for GP diagnostics. I am very aware though that Covid has put immense pressure on people's mental health and has had a huge impact on persons with disabilities and their families. I would urge the Minister for Health to consider the long term impact of poor mental health and a lack of disability services within the community and to bear this in mind when making decisions around the budget in the next few days, as the sector needs far more than has been announced or included in the winter plan. Second, I draw the Minister’s attention to the report this week from the Parliamentary Budget Office on expenditure undertaken this year and its concerns around transparency and accountability. Again, I am aware from my own constituency that private hospitals in many cases provided absolutely vital capacity to the public sector during the Covid-19 crisis and they facilitated the continuation of care in other medical specialties. This was really important and worthwhile. However, the winter plan document outlines that almost 10% of the total winter plan spend of €604 million is going to go to private hospitals. There is, however, scant detail provided on what we are getting for this other than that some of it will be used for elective procedures, which is not in itself a bad idea if it increases capacity in public hospitals, but again we do not really have enough detail. None of it is being used for surge capacity and this would need to be provided separately. If we were going to spend taxpayers’ money with private hospital operators, we need to be clear right now on what exactly we are getting for the amount we are spending and what outcomes we are expecting as a result of that spend. Covid has changed us and our communities irrevocably, and no winter plan will paper over the cracks of a system that needs reform. The pandemic has been a shock and awe event for our health service. The leadership of clinicians and front-line staff has never been more meaningful or more impactful, and the reality is that our health service for years has focused on servicing the needs of organisations, not always the needs of patients. Covid has allowed us to cut through some of that. We need Sláintecare and we should seize this moment because we need it now. Let us allow our time of adversity also be our moment of clarity. Let us begin the active implementation of Sláintecare. Let us give ourselves a deadline. I think it should be spring 2023. That is 30 months. Let us be ambitious. The NHS in the United Kingdom was established in 1948 at a time when their public finances were in total disarray and the future seemed incredibly challenging and very uncertain. That sounds very familiar to all of us right now but they pushed forward towards their vision of universal health care for everybody and we should push forward with ours.

I offer my condolences to their families and to all those that have lost loved ones to Covid-19 here in Ireland. We have known this winter would be a significant challenge since the Covid-19 pandemic emerged here in March. The pandemic, combined with the flu season, will place enormous challenges on our health service and front-line workers. Pre-Covid, many of our hospitals were already operating at 90-95% capacity. I welcome today's announcement of the €600 million financial commitment made by the Government for this winter plan. In particular, I welcome the plan to provide 892 acute beds with 484 sub-acute beds. The extra capacity will be crucial this winter. The extra 500 isolation beds will provide reassurance that capacity exists if Covid cases continue to increase. At the heart of the strategy to combat Covid is the strong testing and tracing infrastructure. Extra funding to bring our public health teams to in excess of 3,000 professionals is welcome, as is the commitment to bring the capacity to more than 100,000 test per week. The flu vaccine will be issued to more than 1.5 million people over the coming weeks, starting with front-line workers, schoolchildren and vulnerable members of the community. I welcome innovative plans to allow pharmacists to inoculate people in their cars and other socially distant locations. I am sure all in the House are grateful for the flexibility pharmacists have shown. I welcome the additional 4.7 million home support hours. People with a disability and the elderly have made huge sacrifices during this pandemic. Many of them lost home care supports during the acute phase of the lockdown in April and May, and this support was gradually reintroduced. Supporting people at home and helping them avoid the need to attend a hospital is critical in this pandemic, particularly as we head into the winter months. The extra support for home help hours is welcome and necessary. Earlier today, we were informed that St. John of God, which provides crucial services not only to my own constituency in Dún Laoghaire but across south Dublin and indeed the rest of the country to more than 8,000 adults and children with disability and their families, would be withdrawing from its HSE contract. The announcement has caused great concern worry in the community, and many people have been in contact with my office today. Covid-19 has been exceptionally difficult for those families, and this is adding an additional stress and strain. I ask the Minister to intervene directly with the HSE. We must ensure continuity of service for this cohort. I hope the Minister can give us assurances this evening.

I am sure she will be fantastic in the role because she has been bringing great energy and enthusiasm, so I wish her the very best of luck. It is vitally important that we have a sufficiently resourced health service, now more than ever. What is of equal if not greater importance, however, is that we have a significantly escalated plan to achieve major increases in staffing levels right across the services and specialties. I made this point recently when I called on the Taoiseach to ensure that sufficient ICU and critical care staff are available to deal with any increase in demand for beds at the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore and the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise.Staff members at the hospital have told me that increasing staff numbers is the core issue that must be addressed. I accept what the plan says about providing 1,500 additional staff at national level but they have to be deployed to areas of most acute need. This debate also highlights how important it is for hospitals and health facilities to be able to engage in future strategic management. Unfortunately, this cannot be said of the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise as there is still an absence of clarity on plans for the hospital. In July, I welcomed receipt of confirmation from the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, that he is emphatically committed to securing and further developing the role of Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise in the Dublin Midlands hospital group. However, it is still a source of significant concern to learn that no decision has yet been made on the draft action plan for Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise. While I welcome the statement provided by the Minister because at the very least we now have the outline of a real political commitment to the future of the hospital in Portlaoise, we do need further commitments, especially on the status of the appointment of an independent facilitator at the hospital. This is urgently needed if local confidence in the process is to be maintained. What we need to hear from the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is a substantial level of detail on just what securing and further developing Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise will mean in real terms. Without that hospital we will not be able to plan for the future and it is affecting the hospital in terms of recruitment of specialist staff and the development of the maternity unit. It is holding up many developments. I hope we will have some resolution and a concrete plan and commitment. The next issue I want to raise is the absence of mental health facilities and services for children and adults. This is a huge issue throughout the State, which I know the Minister of State is aware of and very passionate about. Services need to be put into Laois and Offaly urgently to try to deal with an escalating situation where people are suffering. The Covid pandemic has not helped and has led to the escalation of many cases. There is a big hold up in the transfer of cancer patients. I am aware of one man in my constituency who received a shock diagnosis a few months ago. He is still waiting to be transferred to St. James's Hospital in Dublin. He is very concerned as is his family. I would be greatly appreciated if something could be done to curb the delays.

This is the second time today that he has abandoned the Chamber for the later speaking slots. It is no disrespect to the Minister of State and I thank her for coming to Clonmel to see the mental health issues there. The youth mental health charity, Jigsaw, saw an increase of 50% in demand for its service in August compared to last year. There has been a more than 400% increase in traffic to its online mental health platform over the past six months. Inclusion Ireland, which represents people with intellectual disabilities, has stated day services are running at a rate of 50% of what they were prior to Covid-19. Many people cannot access these services due to transport limitations. This is chronic. It is now crystal clear that mental health needs must be treated as a core element of the response and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. It is so unfair on these people. It is all about Covid and all about instilling fear. I said this earlier. The figures need to be explained and the true figures need to be explained. I will not repeat what I said earlier. I ask the Minister of State to insist the figures for self-harm and mental health are collated. The agency stopped collating them in April. We need to know. Why hide them? The Minister of State's saw St. Michael's unit in Clonmel. Unfortunately, officials have decided not to give us our beds. Since it was closed eight years ago it has been a disaster. We have had more issues and mental health problems. A Vision for Change did not deliver the community response. We need beds in Clonmel. The Department is able to find €700,000 or €800,000 for more beds for Covid. Mention the word "Covid" and money is like confetti or dust falling from the sky. There is no problem. However, the Government cannot look after people's mental health. It is shameful in the extreme. When there are inquiries into this in ten or 15 years' time the fear that the Government, RTÉ and the whole cabal are instilling will be exposed nakedly for what it is with no research. A doctor was sacked last week for speaking out. Dolores Cahill will not be listened to. All those with a contrarian view are all unpatriotic. We are all loony bins. The genie is out of the bottle. Today I quoted figures from Denmark, Hungary and other places. They show they have far fewer issues than we have. They have more borders but our wonderful HSE, which was dysfunctional before this started, is even more dysfunctional now and it is shameful. St. Bridget's Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir, a wonderful day hospital, which the Minister of State has passed many times, had four hospice beds paid for in the main through fundraising by the people of south Tipperary, west Waterford - the Minister of State's area - and south Kilkenny. It is closed and has been taken off the people because Covid is more important and to hell with the people who need palliative care. They are dying in their homes and they cannot get treatment. It is a shocking indictment of how we have gone down the road like a runaway train with Covid and to hell with cancer patients and stroke victims. One person an hour is dying of cancer and 27 a day are dying of strokes and heart conditions. There are also many other issues growing inside of people's bodies that they are unaware of because they cannot get tests. The Government will be brought to The Hague for war crimes when it is all over because of the abandonment of the people and it is shameful the way they have been treated.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	278	Every time I see or hear the word "Sláintecare" coming from the HSE, the Department of Health or Ministers I become extremely angry because I know, the Minister of State knows and everybody in here knows the Sláintecare report, as a planned approach to achieve a single-tier well-funded public health service, has been consigned to the shelves to gather dust in the Department of Health. Sláintecare as intended will never be implemented by any Government containing Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael so let us dispense with the pretence. It would not have taken any great medical expertise to know our public health care system would be overrun by a pandemic of the nature of Covid-19. The lockdown and public compliance with it prevented a catastrophe and we have to recognise that in essence our healthcare system was overrun with the cancellation of many essential services in diagnostics, screening and elective surgery. All Deputies have received a particular email and I will read from it because it is important with regard to disability services. It is from parents of adults with intellectual disabilities who, since the onset of Covid-19, have struggled with a lack of useful help for them and their adult children. The adult children's day and respite services were drastically cut to the point of being non-existent for most of the time up to September. They had hoped the promised winter plan would start to address some of the issues but instead they find their adult children and themselves once more ignored and neglected. They are bitterly disappointed and join Family Carers Ireland and Inclusion Ireland in expressing their dismay. They state that once again the authorities have let them down and let down the entire disability community. This email is one example and we could all give further quotes from a range of organisations, such as the Irish Cancer Society, urging emergency action. The glaring omission of serious funding for mental health services is hugely disappointing and, as has been said already, I hope it will be addressed seriously in the budget. Having said that, the measures taken were necessary given the underfunding of the health service over decades. It is also necessary to record the tremendous work carried out under very difficult circumstances by those who work in the public health services, including doctors, nurses, porters, cleaners and all ancillary staff. In this context, a plan that calls for an injection of €600 million over the next six months is to be welcomed, as are the proposals for 570 new beds, 12,500 extra staff, the extension of community assessment hubs and more home help hours. Unfortunately, the €4.76 million for home help will not deal with the issue because many people did not have their home help needs met prior to Covid and they are looking for more hours. There is a huge backlog of people waiting for home help hours. People who were independent prior to Covid now face the need for home help hours. It is a question of having 6,000 new staff to deal with this.One can only imagine how much better the service would be if the Sláintecare proposals for €600 million a year over five years had actually been implemented over the past three years. It would have made a huge difference.

Today, we are discussing the HSE winter plan and how it underpins the first pillar of the framework for living with Covid-19. The Minister earlier described the winter plan as ambitious but ambition needs to be underpinned by resources, competence, as well as systems which work collaboratively and efficiently. It also needs to have timelines, not just targets. Within those targets, there need to be specifics and pathways to achieve those specific targets. Unfortunately, I do not see this in the plan which is disappointing. We must ensure CervicalCheck is fully reinstated and resourced in order that it catches up with those women left behind since March 2020. The waiting time for those who have had their tests and who urgently need biopsies or colposcopies is far too long. I have a constituent who has been told that the waiting time for her urgent cervical biopsy is eight weeks. She is beside herself with anxiety and fear. The service has to be improved. The winter plan refers to extra beds which is welcome. However, we need to see the specifics, namely, where, when and how. In that context, I want to see real progress on the 42-bed unit for Sligo University Hospital. It has got planning permission and approval in principle. While it is out of the starting blocks, it is painfully slow. If the winter plan is to mean anything, we need to see an ongoing timetable which delivers those beds in the shortest possible time. Four intensive care unit beds are coming to Sligo University Hospital which we are very happy to see. Every Member has referred to mental health today. I read the plan but there were only two mentions with nothing specific or definite. The GRASP Life, a mental health service foundation in Dromahair, County Leitrim, which services Sligo and Leitrim, recently stated that, during Covid, the number of calls to its service increased by 70%. That is across the board with all kinds of issues. It stated the local county councils and HSE were supportive but its fundraising has dried up. Accordingly, it is caught at both ends. We need to see more supports for mental health. The Minister of State and I know it. People are desperately crying out for these services.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	280	I thank all Deputies who contributed to this important debate today. I welcome the opportunity to make the closing remarks to it. I have taken notes and will pass individual requests back. The suggestions made and the issues raised will be borne in mind as the winter plan is implemented. I was disappointed that not one Member today welcomed the fact that €830,000 will be spent on ten dementia advisers. I sat on the opposite side of the House for the past four and a half years and I championed the appointment of dementia advisers every week. Up to last year, there were eight dementia advisers in the whole country, meaning getting one could be a postcode lottery. We finally made the breakthrough last year and we managed to get ten more in the budget. To get another ten in the winter plan means we now have 28. The optimum number according to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland is 33. I fought doggedly for the €830,000 to get ten extra dementia advisers. I cannot believe I have been in the Chamber for the past 75 minutes but not one Member mentioned it. Up to 11 people are diagnosed with dementia every day. I chaired the all-party committee on dementia for the past four and a half years. It was a committee at which politics was left at the door. It had members from every single party and none. We all worked together to raise awareness. As stated by many Members, as well as the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, this winter will be challenging for our health and social care services. It is like a perfect storm. We are heading into the winter. We do not know what is coming. We could have the winter vomiting bug and the winter 'flu. We will have all our usual challenges with capacity, overcrowding and trolley numbers. Coupled with all that, we have Covid. Last week, I was delighted to launch the HSE winter plan with €600 million funding, 20 times more than what the plan is normally. It is an adequate plan. As I have said many times, the devil is in the detail, however. We will work as hard as we can to ensure those supports are put in place. We are dealing with a global pandemic which has disrupted the level and the delivery of healthcare since March, while placing significantly increased demands on healthcare staff. I wish to pay tribute to all our healthcare staff and carers who have made such efforts to provide care in such difficult circumstances. I also wish to remember all those, including healthcare workers, who have passed away as a result of Covid-19. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Members that we need reform. That is why the winter plan is designed in line with Sláintecare principles. We need investment and reform. I take on board the point made by Deputy Joan Collins about the €600 million funding. We need to see more of that if we want to implement Sláintecare. The €600 million investment in the winter plan represents a significant commitment from the Government which will allow us to commence the process of pivoting care and the required resources towards home and community care. As Minister with responsibility for mental health and older people, I am particularly pleased with the emphasis placed on supports for older people and those groups at greater risk in this plan. This is essential. Older people are more likely to be admitted to an acute hospital following a visit to an emergency department. They are more likely to experience a wait on a hospital trolley. Accordingly, I welcome the additional 47 community specialist teams to support older people and those with chronic disease to stay at home, the 13 additional community assessment hubs, the additional community beds which will allow faster egress from hospital and provide care closer to people’s homes. This was piloted in University Hospital Waterford last year. Normally, the hospital would have between 20 and 25 beds for people who would be termed as late discharge. A consultant would have deemed them as fit to go home but, unfortunately, there was no place for them to go. Capacity was bought in a nursing home at a cost of €1,000 per bed as against an acute hospital charge of between €6,500 and €7,000 per week. Some of these patients needed respite, others were waiting on home care support packages or on fair deal. They were able to transfer to a nursing home for two to four weeks care, depending on what they needed. Up to 530 of these community beds will be rolled out across the country which should free up capacity in the acute hospital settings. I especially welcome the 4.76 million additional home care hours which will allow people to remain in their own homes. I welcome the commitment to provide aids and appliances to an additional 5,500 people. Such simple initiatives can make all the difference to an older person. We need to keep our older people at home, safe and secure, with the correct wrap-around supports. There are always waiting lists for those who require home care. However, these extra 4.7 million home care hours should make a big difference. Obviously, there are people on a waiting list or whose needs might have changed during Covid. We want to make sure that the support goes into the home and that somebody does not have to go to an emergency department and wait on a trolley. It is important to mention nursing homes and the important role they and their staff have played in the care of our most vulnerable older people before the pandemic and, especially, in the last few difficult months. The pandemic bore down very hard on our older people. Unfortunately, 54% of all deaths to date have occurred in the nursing home sector. Our nursing homes are where many of our older people call home and it is critical that we continue our supports to that sector. Our plans for winter will be enhanced by the extension of the temporary assistance payment scheme, which will continue to provide funding to private and voluntary nursing homes and to residential care homes to ensure they are prepared for Covid-19 so they are safe for older people who are transferring out of the hospital system. Enhancements in rehabilitation and home care will also help to ensure that our older people can be cared for in the community, thereby easing the pressure on capacity in nursing homes and providing an alternative care pathway when leaving hospital settings. I want to touch on mental health because it has been raised by almost every Deputy in the House and it forms a very important part of my remit as Minister. The winter plan, with a focus on those actions which will have an impact on winter, and specifically trolleys, is part of the larger strategic plan which the Government asked the HSE to develop for health service delivery to the end of 2021 in the context of the pandemic. I intend to seek, as part of this strategic plan in the Estimates process, additional resources to implement a number of the short-term recommendations of the mental health policy, Sharing the Vision. It is important for everyone who has spoken today to note that the 4.7 million hours which will be added to the existing 19 million hours that are already there will not differentiate whether one is older or has dementia, a disability or a mental health issue. The carer will not stop at the door and say they are only looking after older people. Those hours are there for everyone: those with mental health issues, those with disability issues, those who are vulnerable, those with dementia and the older generation. It is important to get the point out tonight that those hours are for anybody who needs support in their home. For everyone who has said there was nothing in it for mental health or people with disabilities, those hours will not differentiate. When the carer goes in the front door, he or she will not differentiate whether one has a mental health or disability issue. The winter plan is about people. It enables patients to be seen in the community and to remain in their own homes. This is the Sláintecare principle of the right care, in the right place, at the right time. However, we have a growing and an ageing population. This Government accepts that we need more acute beds in our hospital system to provide acute care to this growing population. This plan provides for a range of additional beds in acute, sub-acute and community settings along with arrangements to work with private hospitals to deal with urgent cases and waiting lists. I was struck when Deputy Harkin mentioned the four extra ICU beds going to Sligo. Each extra ICU bed needs six nurses and is at a cost of €750,000, so I am delighted Sligo is getting extra capacity. It is great to hear. These additional acute beds and measures to move care to the community will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and reduce the number of patients receiving care on hospital trolleys. Finally, I encourage everyone to do their bit to keep themselves healthy this winter by eating well, exercising, getting the flu vaccine, washing their hands, keeping their distance, limiting the number of people they are meeting and following public health guidance. I also encourage everyone to seek medical help if they think they need it. We are doing everything possible to keep our health settings safe for patients and staff.

#StevenMatthews	unknown-#StevenMatthews-party	unknown-#StevenMatthews-dob	unknown-#StevenMatthews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	282	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for being here to answer these questions. I request that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government carry out a review to examine amending the building regulations to include the mandatory installation of adequate toilet facilities for disabled people and their carers, known as changing places facilities. The Minister will know that while Part M of the building regulations states that new buildings must include standard wheelchair accessible toilet facilities, they do not allow for more severely disabled adults and teens, who may require incontinence pad changing facilities, a larger square metreage floor area to allow for carers and the use of a hoist. The campaign group Changing Places has established a template for a changing facility that allows equity of access to all. These are accessible for those who need carer support for sanitary and toilet use. Changing places rooms have a higher ceiling to allow for a hoist, a larger floor space to accommodate carers, a centralised toilet to allow for carer support and, vitally, a height-adjustable adult-sized changing bench. At the moment, there are just 15 changing places facilities in the Republic of Ireland. To put this in context, I will tell the Minister of State about Sophia. I have her family's permission to highlight her situation in the Dáil this evening. Sophia is a wonderful young woman. She is 13 years of age and loves her dog, her brother, her sister and eating ice cream. Sophia also has cerebral palsy and arthrogryposis and has had surgery for scoliosis. She is non-verbal and requires an adult-sized changing bench for toilet use. Recently, Sophia and her family visited me in Bray and when I asked where the nearest changing places facility was, her father Aaron told me there were none available in the entire county of Wicklow, and Wicklow is not unique in this regard. Many parents have experienced the frustration of seeking baby changing facilities, only to find they are not available. Usually, with a small baby one can make do. This is not the case for people with certain disabilities. In Sophia's case, every trip and visit is planned with an adequate toilet facility in mind and there are only 15 such facilities in the country. Very often, her father told me, they do not bother going anywhere at all because of the lack of access to these facilities. I believe every person should have access to adequate bathroom facilities. It is neither reasonable nor acceptable to expect people like Sophia to make do, when making do involves a complete loss of dignity. Her parents must attempt to change her in the back of their van or limit their trips to one of a handful of locations that can accommodate her needs. Recently, the UK Government announced that changes would be made to legislation to install compulsory changing places in new public buildings, such as shopping centres, art galleries, sports stadiums, libraries or larger public buildings from 2021. I believe we should now examine changing the building regulations to ensure planning applications for suitable public buildings include a changing places toilet facility. As we learn to live with Covid, we must be mindful of the vulnerable, who will look to this Government to act for them in ensuring their dignity, safety and well-being. I hope the Minister of State and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will work with me to meet the campaigners in Changing Places, who comprise representatives from many disability advocacy groups, and listen to them to ensure young women like Sophia can go about their day with the dignity they deserve. I thank the Minister of State.

As the matter stands, new buildings and extensions of material alterations to existing buildings must comply with the legal minimum performance standards set out in the building regulations of 1997 to 2019. In this context, the Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010 and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document M - Access and Use 2010, which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements a building must achieve in respect of access. The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of aim, size or disability, new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable; extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and usable; material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable; certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable; and new dwellings are visitable. Part M of the building regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment. While Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to regard the design philosophy of universal design and consider making additional provisions, where practicable and appropriate.While the latest iteration of Part M of the building regulations initially coincided with the general downturn in economic and construction activity, its positive effects on access and use in the built environment can now be seen widely. The building regulations, including Part M requirements, are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and well-being of the persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological processes and innovation. Costs are examined in the context of proposed legislative changes, particularly in the building regulations, and a cost-benefit analysis and regulatory impact analysis are carried out on any proposed amendments. The Minister and I will give full consideration to a review in respect of the provision for what is called changing places, commonly known as the changing places toilet, in certain buildings. This may involve an amendment to the requirements of Part M and the development of sufficiently detailed guidance for inclusion in the associated technical guidance document M to ensure proper practical implementation in certain new buildings and existing buildings undergoing works. Separately, it is open to any person who feels discriminated against to refer a discrimination complaint to the equality tribunal under the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2018 which prohibit discrimination on nine specific grounds, including that of disability. It should also be noted that requirements set out under the equality legislation are a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality.

It will, of course, involve an amendment to Part M of the building regulations. I believe we should address the issue quickly and I will continue with the Minister of State and his Department to ensure that we can provide these facilities for people who urgently need them. As I said earlier, there are only 15 of these facilities in the country. Similar facilities are provided throughout Northern Ireland and Great Britain. People in those countries have the same needs as people here, and I believe we should make those provisions available so that people who have those needs can enjoy the freedom to go about their business with confidence and not be forced to restrict their journeys to the locations of those 15 facilities. This impacts on entire families and not only people who are in need of those services. I thank the Minister of State for his response and look forward to the Minister's appraisal of the need to review the regulations in this regard.

I agree with the Deputy. There are 187 such facilities in Scotland, as far as I am aware, and 1,300 across the UK. As the Deputy mentioned, there are more mandatory guidelines in place in those jurisdictions. The accompanying technical guidance document to Part M of the building regulations, dealing with its access and use, came into effect on 1 January 2012. It sets out the minimum statutory requirements that a building must achieve in respect of access. Under Part M, there is a requirement to ensure that "regardless of age, size or disability", these accessibility issues are resolved. Part M of the building regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment, and while Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practical and appropriate. Our Department will look at the possibility of setting up a departmental working group to examine this issue and the required changes under Part M. The Deputy is Chair of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and that can give us a good way forward to progress this matter. We have an opportunity to progress the matter and make the necessary amendments to Part M. I commend the Deputy on bringing the issue to the Dáil, and we can make progress on it over the next number of months.

Since I was elected as a councillor in 2014, I have encountered strong, resilient people and families and have had the privilege of getting to know them. Many of those people have suffered acute brain injuries and spinal injuries resulting from farm and road accidents and so on. It is with admiration that I look upon both those people who have suffered those traumas and their families. It takes much work, not just medically but also mentally, to get people's lives back on track. I have brought this Topical Issue matter to the floor of the House because a number of reviews and reports have been compiled since 2012 in relation to the South/South West Hospital Group. The group is responsible for approximately 1 million people in its catchment area across counties Cork, Kerry, Waterford and south Tipperary, more than 20% of our country's population, but, unfortunately, it has no access to the full range of rehabilitation services akin to what is provided in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. It is difficult to get a place in that rehabilitation centre, as the Minister of State knows. Many can be waiting for six to 12 months to get a place in that unit. In 2017, Dr. Andrew Hanrahan undertook a review of rehabilitation services within the South/South West Hospital Group. A further review was taken in May 2019 and outlined the requirements for rehabilitation services in the area. In 2012, a regional specialist rehabilitation unit was first proposed for the South/South West Hospital Group to provide for patients with high to moderate intensity inpatient rehabilitation. This unit was to support patients with moderate to severe physical, cognitive or communicative disabilities, or a combination thereof. Services would be provided by trained rehabilitation staff and rehabilitation medicine consultants, supported by consultant neurologists. The review also recommended the development of a full range of rehabilitation services in the South/South West Hospital Group. That was in 2012. We are now eight years on and I am asking that the Minister of State makes the aspiration a reality for the people of the south and the south west. I welcome, in response to a parliamentary question, a letter from Mr. Gerry O'Dwyer, chief executive officer of the South/South West Hospital Group. He stated that discussions are progressing about the development of a rehabilitation unit in Cork and an announcement will be made in the next few weeks. That is most welcome, especially for those families in Cork, Kerry, the Minister of State's native Waterford and south Tipperary who heretofore have been waiting up to 12 months for admission to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. People should be cared for in their own region, particularly in the context of Covid-19. It makes no sense that patients from the southern region would continue to travel to Dublin for specialist treatment that can be provided locally. While I welcome the announcement that the rehabilitation unit is being progressed, I urge the Minister of State in the meantime to accede to requests made by consultants in Cork University Hospital for the provision of the required specialists who deal with trauma to be sanctioned. They are looking for additional rehabilitation consultants, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists, among other specialists. If this team could be put in place before the construction of a new rehabilitation unit, we could make a considerable difference to the lives of people who suffer from such debilitating diseases and serious traumas. There is currently an application with the HSE for the provision of that team, which is distinct from the application from the unit. I hope that the HSE would look favourably on that application. I will share my remaining two minutes with Deputy O'Connor after the Minister of State has replied.

This is an important issue for all of those who live in the area. Rehabilitation is a critical component of any modern healthcare system and is essential if patients are to regain or maintain their quality of life after serious illness or injury. Rehabilitation improves health outcomes and reduces disability. There is a growing body of evidence that rehabilitation in specialised environments is not only effective but also cost effective. This has been demonstrated in a variety of settings such as inpatient units and community teams, and in different diagnostic groups such as trauma brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis and acquired brain injury. The demand for rehabilitation services is growing and is anticipated to continue to grow with changes of population and the advances in healthcare, new interventions and technology. The model of care under the national clinical programme for rehabilitation medicine was launched in 2018 and presents, in line with National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015, an outline for future provision of specialist rehabilitation services in Ireland.The model of care proposed is a hub and spoke model consisting of a tertiary centre linking at least four managed clinical rehabilitation networks, each one serving a population of about 1 million people. The network will connect acute and post-acute rehabilitation units and community specialist rehabilitation clinicians in a formal governance structure to allow the delivery of co-ordinated rehabilitative care for patients across all levels of complexity. The HSE has advised that a review of rehabilitation services in the South/South West Hospital Group was, as the Deputy said, undertaken in February 2017 and was further updated in May 2019. The review outlined a number of recommendations in regard to the development of rehabilitation services in the South/South West Hospital Group. The HSE also advised that, in line with the model of care for the provision of rehabilitation medicine in Ireland and the neuro-rehabilitation strategy, the review recommended the development of a regional specialist rehabilitation unit for the South/South West Hospital Group to support patients with moderate to severe physical, cognitive and communicative disabilities. The HSE has further advised that the review recommended the development of a full range of rehabilitation services in the South/South West Hospital Group, including hyper acute rehabilitation as well as associated specialist post-acute inpatient rehabilitation units. The HSE has advised that these units will operate in a hub and spoke model with the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dublin, through managed clinical rehabilitation networks, which is consistent with the model of care for rehabilitation medicine.

She and I go back a number of years and I know she is an exceptionally hard worker for the constituency of Waterford. I am deeply grateful that she has been appointed as a Minister of State. As my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, has stated, a review of the patient services in the South/South West Hospital Group has been undertaken. I agree that such personnel should be located in Cork University Hospital, CUH, now that the process is under review. I welcome that a major trauma centre is to be placed in CUH to provide high to moderate intensive inpatient rehabilitation for patients who can tolerate an intensive rehabilitation programme or who require a structured environment. It would be wise to locate one of these designated trauma units attached to such a major trauma centre in Mallow General Hospital. Mallow is the crossroads of Munster. It has great connections to CUH, and the development of the new M20 motorway will allow greater connectivity to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dublin. The location of Mallow General Hospital would fit excellently into the managed clinical rehabilitation networks hub and spoke model proposed under the review and should be taken into consideration.

This has led to an overwhelming requirement for specialist rehabilitation services which are essential if patients are to regain or maintain a quality of life after serious illness or injury. It is important to note that the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future has committed to the continued implementation of the neuro-rehabilitation strategy. The HSE has also advised that the South/South West Hospital Group and Cork Kerry Community Healthcare are progressing discussions in regard to the development of a rehabilitation unit in Cork which is consistent with the recommendations of the review of rehabilitation services in the South/South West Hospital Group. While discussions on this development have been delayed due to the Covid-19 emergency, it is expected that a submission will be finalised in the coming weeks.

I am sure it has been raised with her before. The Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Home in Roscrea is something that is cherished by the people of Roscrea and its surrounds. It has looked after its residents for a long time. It provides care that is second to none. It is an incredible unit based in the centre of the town. There have been an awful lot of promises made about the unit. In the northern part of Tipperary there is a fantastic state-of-the-art public elderly care unit in Thurles, Community Hospital of the Assumption. In Nenagh a new 50-bed unit is being built, St. Conlon's Community Nursing Unit, beside the hospital. Work is commencing soon and it will be a fantastic facility. Roscrea is the other major town that has a public unit which needs to be rebuilt. There is a history in regard to this. The people of the town have had enough. We need to get this sorted. HIQA has done inspections, which the unit has passed. I have all of the details, but on top of that we also need to ensure there are long-stay beds. It is not good enough to say that it will be turned into a short-stay facility. The people of Roscrea and surrounds will not tolerate that. I, as a public representative, will not tolerate that because those who are resident now and who will be resident there in the future want it to be a long-stay facility. The building is very similar to St. Conlon's in Nenagh. It needs to be completely redone. It does not meet HIQA requirements in terms of single bedrooms, space, facilities and everything else. It is on a site in the middle of the town beside a church and is within walking distance of many people. The site can be rebuilt on. The council is willing to work with the HSE to build on the site if necessary. Before the last general election another public representative made a commitment that a new nursing home would be built in Roscrea. That seems to have disappeared. We need to draw out a plan. We need more public beds and capacity in Tipperary so that we can look after the elderly. We need a plan for the home. I must commend the Minister of State's predecessor, Jim Daly. He was the first person to say that we will deal with the units and make sure it is a long-stay facility. I and other Deputies met him on 17 December in Government Buildings. He visited Roscrea with a local community group on 27 January. He gave assurances that under no circumstances would the unit be closed and that consideration would be given to how it would be funded. He gave assurances which were the most comprehensive assurances we had ever been given. To be fair to him, he was quite a good Minister. We need to chart a plan for the nursing home because the community of Roscrea will not tolerate anything else. To be honest, neither will I. Other public representatives feel the same. We are all united in this. This has been going on for too long. The town has been let down in many ways. It has lost industry. No other issue unites the people of the town as much as this nursing home and its future. I ask the Minister of State to look at her funding capacity. We do not mind waiting as long as there is a plan.

I heard about it recently. A key principle underpinning Government policies is to support older people to live in their homes with dignity and independence for as long as possible. In recent years there has been a shift in healthcare provision focused towards home care. Home support services are key in facilitating older people to remain at home, and with our ageing population, they will become even more important in the future. While our stated objective is to promote care in the community so that people can continue to live with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, we also have patients who are in genuine need of residential care, either on a long or short-stay basis. Their safety and well-being is of paramount concern. Residential care is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision. It is worth highlighting that the budget for long-term residential care in 2020 is in excess of €1 billion. The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Unit. There are 27 beds in the unit providing continuing care, respite and palliative care, as the Deputy has said. The HSE has confirmed that it is committed to ongoing improvements at the unit. The current capital programme of works is managed and delivered by the HSE’s estate division. I understand there have been extensive works carried out in Dean Maxwell in 2019 and in 2020, which includes the repainting of bedrooms, new lights fitted, rewiring completed throughout the unit, and fire safety works completed in early 2020 with sign-off by fire safety consultants in June 2020. Further development works were completed in April 2020 with a new nursing office, clinical room, and a hairdressing and activity area. Dean Maxwell remains a facility registered under the Health Act 2007 with HIQA for the provision of a range of care services to older people. The unit is currently registered until March 2022. The most recent inspection report was published by HIQA on 11 September 2019. The report was very positive and the facility has complied with HIQA standards. However, HIQA has recommended that from 2021 the single bedrooms in the unit are unsuitable to meet the needs of the residents due to their current infrastructure. There is no capital project in the HSE capital plan to replace Dean Maxwell. The HSE intends to move the emphasis at the Dean Maxwell facility from long-stay to short-stay care, which is an increasing area of service requirement. However, it is the intention that this will take place over a number of years and the changes will occur in a seamless fashion to ensure that they will not impact on individual service users. Were any such eventuality to arise in an unavoidable individual situation, the HSE has assured the Department that the resident or his or her family would be fully involved and included in any plans. Dean Maxwell services will continue and will be supported by the other community nursing units with increased capacity in north Tipperary. This will create county-wide access to older person services, which will include long-stay, short-stay, respite care, palliative care and day services. The HSE has assured the Department that it is committed to engaging in partnership with all of the relevant stakeholders. This engagement will be key to prioritising the service requirement for the population of north Tipperary and I inform the Deputy that I am also willing to engage on this issue.

Her response is actually going backwards from that of her predecessor. The people of Roscrea and the surrounding area will be furious when they see this. Dare I say it but the Minister of State’s own party members are going to be furious. This is just not acceptable. We, collectively, across politics, are going to have to get a plan here. To say that we are gradually going to move to short-stay and that this will not impact on families is not acceptable. The Minister of State’s own colleague, who is the mayor of Tipperary, Councillor Michael Smith, has done some work with me on this and has worked with the council on a plan to build on the site. I have spoken to the chief executive of the council on this and the council is willing to give over land for this, such is its importance to the community. There is going to be a new capital plan. In that capital plan service provision is going to have to be widened out because we are going to have to look after our elderly in a different way. Can this unit be put on the capital plan? In the past three weeks I have seen what can be achieved. Some €2.4 million is going into the hospital's Assumption grounds for units to look after the elderly in the area. Some €1.4 million is going into the grounds of Nenagh hospital, which I was pleased to tell people about this week. That amounts to €3.9 million. These are all hospital prevention measures and all are designed to look after the elderly in the majority of cases. Here we have Roscrea, again, not getting any form of Government support. Some €4 million was given out in three weeks. I welcome and support this but we have to have a plan. To say that this unit is just going to close to long-stay patients and will not have any such patients is a regression from the position with the former Minister of State and Deputy, Jim Daly, who had a very good meeting with the representatives down there, including the Minister of State’s colleague, Michael Smith, and members of the Roscrea Community Development Council, RCDC, and they were very happy with this. We know that there are deadlines in capital plans and with HIQA but there has to be a new capital plan. It is the Minister of State's and her Government’s decision to choose whether this is going to be on the plan.

There has been investment at Dean Maxwell in recent times and the HSE has confirmed its commitment to the ongoing provision of services. It is very important as we leave here this evening on this topic that this point has to be made very clear. Whereas a new build is not included in the HSE capital plan, as I have just said, there has been investment and a commitment given by the HSE on the provision of ongoing services. The HSE has also assured the Department that it is committed to engage in partnership with all of the relevant stakeholders. This engagement will be key to prioritising the service required for the population of north Tipperary. We do not need to run away with ourselves here. The HSE has confirmed its ongoing commitment. The new build is not included in the capital plan but many good things have happened in the past couple of years and the facility is compliant with HIQA, but I will certainly speak to the Deputy about this issue.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	296	I congratulate the Minister on her appointment and I have not interacted with her in this new Dáil as of yet. I know that she is relatively new to the role and I hope she will have a better impact than those who preceded her in dealing with the issue of drugs in Limerick city. It truly needs a cross-departmental response. Drugs, as the Minister is aware, crosses many Ministries, health and justice, to name just a few. The drugs crisis in parts of my own city is worsening daily, it seems. It is an indictment of the priorities of previous governments that the funding for drugs and alcohol task forces was cut each year between 2008 and 2014. I am also a director of the Mid-West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Task Forum, which I have been a member of for a great number of years. Despite the escalation in the drugs crisis, funding for many groups has effectively been frozen since 2014. This lack of proper funding has severely affected the delivery of services for communities and we need to restore that funding to 2008 levels as soon as possible. I wish to return to an issue in my own city of Limerick. In recent drug seizures in the city crack cocaine was among the drugs seized. Crack cocaine, as I am sure the Minister is aware, is a devastating drug. It has destroyed communities across the world. It is extremely addictive and is regarded as the most addictive form of cocaine. There really is a special place in hell for anyone who sells, distributes or benefits from the sale of crack cocaine. These dealers really are the scum of the earth. I attended the AGM yesterday, via Zoom, of the Mid-West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Task Forum. Among issues of concern raised, I was specifically asked to raise the issue of drug dealing in Limerick and the devastating effect it is having on some of our local communities. After that meeting I wrote yesterday to the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for the national drug strategy, Deputy Feighan, and in fairness his office responded quickly to that correspondence. I thank him for that and I will be following this matter up with him. In particular, I mentioned to the Minister of State a Limerick estate which I do not wish to name publicly but which needs urgent intervention from the Minister of State with support from the Minister’s Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda Síochána, and additional resources from the Criminal Assets Bureau, Limerick County Council and other agencies.I wish to focus my comments on that one estate in Limerick. This is an older, very settled housing estate with many wonderful working families living there for generations. Unfortunately, drug dealing operates in the estate on an almost 24-7 basis. Taxis often form queues while people from all over the region purchase their drugs. Many people simply walk into the estate. It is like a non-stop, 24-7 supermarket. The vast bulk of the people purchasing the drugs do not live in the area. This is ongoing 24-7. It is non-stop. Many elderly people who worked all their lives are living through this constant criminality. While the Garda, in fairness to the force, has made a significant number of arrests and seizures, the local community feels utterly abandoned. Will the Minister prioritise the work of the courts to ensure that those recently charged are before the courts as soon as possible? It has been said to me on numerous occasions that the most vulnerable can be brought to court for often minor offences but the drug dealers, many of them facing serious charges, can swan around our city selling their filth while ruining lives and communities. I have spoken to senior gardaí about that. They are deeply concerned that they are charging people, bringing them to court, but because the courts are not sitting properly, they are out selling drugs on a 24-7 basis. The local drugs gang regularly gives two fingers to everybody. The Defence Forces were redeployed recently to assist the Criminal Assets Bureau. The Defence Forces should be called on again, if necessary, to deal with this ongoing problem. The two fingers from these drugs gangs are not just to me, the local community, An Garda Síochána or Limerick council. They are two fingers to the Minister and definitely two fingers to the entire State. The Minister is the Minister for Justice and Equality and I am asking her to intervene personally. I am happy to speak with her in private, if she wishes, at a later time.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	297	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. As he clearly outlined, this is an issue and an area of concern that falls under a number of Departments and Ministers. The Deputy mentioned particular groups and funding and, unfortunately, while I cannot help in that area, I will outline the area that falls under my remit, which is the work of the Garda, and I certainly would be happy to speak to him afterwards if there is further work that we can do. I am very conscious of the impact of antisocial behaviour caused by this type of issue and the impact it has on the quality of life not just of residents within local communities but also of those working in those communities and visiting our towns and cities. Gardaí are working very hard to try to tackle this and all forms of criminality in our communities and urban areas to try to make them safer for all members of society. I am assured that the occurrence and the prevalence of crime and antisocial behaviour, including drug dealing, is constantly monitored at national and local level by Garda management to ensure that appropriate policing responses are designed and delivered, as appropriate, given the area or considering what is happening in the area. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the specific area of interest to the Deputy is policed by three Garda stations, all located within the Henry Street division. It has Henry Street, Roxboro Road and Mayorstone Park. As at the end of August 2020, there are 453 gardaí assigned to those three stations. That is an overall increase of 7% since 2015, up from 422. In addition, these Garda members are supported by 60 Garda staff members representing an increase of almost 67% since 2015, again up from 36. The Garda staff levels support the redeployment of gardaí from the administrative posts to the more operational policing duties where their training, expertise and ability to engage with the communities on the ground is used to best effect. In addition to that, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads in tackling all forms of drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs in Ireland. It is supported by the divisional drugs unit, which tackles drug-related crime on a local basis throughout the country. I am informed by the divisional drug units that they are now established in every Garda division. An Garda Síochána also remains committed to tackling the supply of drugs by supporting local communities through various preventative and detection initiatives and engagement with local and regional drug and alcohol task forces. There are also the Garda youth diversion programme and projects, the Garda schools programme, the joint policing committees and the community policing forums. It is not just about the number of gardaí we have but how they engage with the different forums and, in turn, with the communities. There should be a whole-of-community approach. I am pleased to say that, overall, these Garda measures have continued unabated during the Covid-19 pandemic, the additional demands on policing, and the range of the public health restrictions we have seen over the past six months. The Garda Commissioner emphasised at the very outset of the Covid-19 pandemic that An Garda Síochána's policing measures to respond to Covid-19 would not affect Garda resources assigned to special units, in particular and including the drugs units. The Deputy might also be aware that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, published its recorded crime statistics for quarter 2 of 2020 earlier this week. Increases in simple possession and drugs for sale or supply have contributed chiefly to the overall increases in certain drugs-related offences recorded by the CSO. That is the reason the multi-strand Garda response I outlined previously is so important in all of this. The uninterrupted policing of organised crime at a national level and the strength of divisional drug units at a local level during the policing of Covid-19 has undoubtedly contributed to the recent success in seizing controlled drugs and in the apprehension of those involved in the sale and supply of the substances involved. I take the Deputy's point and acknowledge the challenges that the courts have been facing, in particular in recent months. They have made every effort to try to deal with the more severe cases but a backlog has arisen and, since September, there has been a concerted effort to try to reduce that backlog. There is always a place for me, as Minister, to try to improve the overall structures and the way the courts operate, including the criminal courts. I will be bringing forward further criminal justice legislation throughout this term to allow us to try to improve the overall ability of people to go through the court process and to speed up that process. I might come back to the Deputy on that.

The gardaí in Limerick are very frustrated because they are arresting people on clear evidence and bringing them to court but there is no follow-up on that and they are back on the streets, often hours later, selling their drugs in the same place where they were arrested. The Minister will be aware that former Ministers of State who oversaw the national drugs strategy have warned that the delivery of the national drugs strategy plan is in danger of collapse as powers are being centralised under the HSE. I know that is not the Minister's remit but I want to put it on the record. The warning must be adhered to and we must ensure that task forces are once again made responsible for drafting and implementing local strategies to combat the drugs crisis locally. I am contacted almost daily by constituents of mine who have concerns regarding drug use. They often feel very little is being done to address their concerns. From my own work in local areas I have spoken to local people, community leaders and workers who have told me how bad it has got, and many of them say they have never seen it as bad, and that is saying a lot. Drug dealing, unfortunately, is rife in areas of Limerick. I have raised this issue in many Dáil debates. I will do so again at the joint policing committee, JPC, in Limerick, and I will raise it in whatever forum I can do so. We need a specific task force type of set-up in the area that can be modelled on what has been achieved in areas of Dublin. As I said earlier, I wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, as the Minister of State with responsibility for tackling the drugs issue. He needs to visit Limerick to get a fuller sense of the desperate situation on the ground in some of our estates. I ask him specifically to come to Limerick with me to see the situation for himself. However, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, is the Minister for Justice and I ask her, please, not to ignore the clear evidence I am presenting as, unfortunately, people did in the mid-2000s when Limerick needed massive Government intervention but people did not listen. I am pleading with the Minister because we are on the cusp of going back to where we were at that time. That intervention ultimately led to the Limerick regeneration programme. We do not want to return to those days. As I said, I am happy to meet the Minister later to discuss the issue in private. The residents need some assurance that they will not be abandoned.

Again, I appreciate the urgency with which he is raising this issue. We have seen in the past in Dublin, as he mentioned, that where not just the Garda but the community, the local councils, the education bodies and the community groups come together, a huge amount of work can be done in tackling this very issue. We have a project under way and a scoping exercise in Drogheda, the town next to mine, for that very reason. That is the approach we need to be taking overall. The introduction and implementation of the Commission on the Future of Policing puts this at the very forefront. That is the approach we need where gardaí are on the ground engaging with communities but where the sole responsibility is not on gardaí and they can engage, co-operate and work with all of those vital services. Unfortunately, the management of resources and how the Garda deploys the resources is not a matter for me. It is a matter for the Commissioner. However, I am assured that he keeps this under continual review, and where there is a need to redeploy, move and engage, in particular with communities, that is kept constantly under review. I will commit to engaging with the Deputy, and with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, on this issue to see if we can come together to support the communities even further. A lot of work is being done to try to address this, but it is to see where we could support them even further.

I wish to share my time with Deputies Barry and Boyd Barrett. I am thankful for the opportunity to have this debate. It is an important debate not only in this Chamber but also in the State itself. I wish to remember Marie Fleming, whose life ended seeking legislative change in regard to assisted dying in Ireland. Marie's incredible bravery and the fight she brought to the highest court in the land brought national attention to the most profound decision anybody could make. Her decision was to leave on her own terms, not in pain, not alone, but in dignity and surrounded by the ones she loved. Her life lives on. Her memory lives on. If she were here at this moment, she would be willing us all on to do the right thing. I thank Tom Curran, Marie Fleming's partner, Gail O'Rourke and Vicky Phelan for their input over the past five weeks. I want to thank Vicky especially for her support and for speaking candidly about the issue over recent weeks. Whatever the outcome next Wednesday, this issue can no longer be shunned away. The Bill has 15 Parts. The Bill would change the law in Ireland and help terminally ill people to control their own death when they decide their suffering is no longer bearable. At present, it is illegal for doctors and medical professionals to help terminally ill people in unbearable pain to end their own lives. This Bill would change that. Some people suffering from a terminal illness that will inevitably result in death face losing control over their lives and may have conditions that no longer respond to palliative care. The Bill would allow a person, who must be over 18 and suffering from a terminal illness, to make a declaration to two independent medical professionals requesting assistance to end his or her life. A third individual, an independent witness, must be present. The person seeking assistance must be diagnosed as having an incurable and progressive illness that cannot be reversed by treatment. The medical professionals must be sure the person has the capacity to make a rational choice and is fully aware of the alternatives, such as palliative care. Fourteen days after the process, the medical practitioner can administer substances to the person to assist in his or her passing. This Bill has safeguards and protections to ensure the person seeking help can make a decision independently and not under duress of any kind.  This Bill does not allow for assisted dying in cases where a person looking for help does not suffer from a terminal illness. People suffering from depression or any mental health issues could not access this law. People suffering from life-threatening physical illnesses could not avail of assisted dying. People of advanced age could not avail of this law. It applies only to those suffering from a terminal illness and only to adults with full mental capacity and who are able to make a rational and conversant decision about their lives. Opponents of assisted dying say it would lead to a slippery slope, whereby the value of human life would be diminished. They fear vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and disabled, will be pressurised into assisted dying because they feel they are a burden on society. In fact, in the countries and regions where laws have been changed to help people, there is no evidence that this has ever happened. Oregon, for example, has had a similar law since 1997 and none of these trends has been observed. Other regions and countries have had the same experience, namely, Colorado, California, Washington, Montana, Vermont, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Luxemburg and certain states in Australia. We want better supports and care for our elderly and those with disabilities. We want greater resources for hospice care and palliative care but there is no contradiction in supporting these and the right of people coming to the end of their lives who are suffering from unbearable pain. Some opponents of this legislation have used completely inappropriate language to conflate suicide and voluntary assisted dying. It is wholly inappropriate and irresponsible to use this kind of language. I ask Deputies to reflect on their positions and desist from using such language. I understand that the Government is tabling an amendment to this Bill. As I stated a number of days ago, this will unduly delay the Bill's progression to pre-legislative scrutiny. I do not understand why it has to go to an all-party committee because it has been discussed at length, even by an all-party Oireachtas committee on equality and justice two and a half years ago. I do not see why the Bill has to go down the route the Government would have it go down. I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister and other Deputies in the Government benches but I doubt the rationale for unduly delaying the Bill with the amendment. This debate is extremely difficult for everybody, regardless of their views. All voices and opinions should be taken into account but the most important voice in the debate is that of a person with a terminal illness who does not want to go through unbearable pain. He or she should have a choice. This Bill is about giving a choice to people facing unbearable pain. We should support them and not vilify them. Let me refer to a lady called Gaynor French, who passed away a number of years ago. I will always remember an article of hers in the Irish Examiner. I read it today again. It contains a statement that says everything about this very important issue: "I have lived with dignity. I want to die with dignity."
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	302	I commend Deputy Gino Kenny on introducing the Dying with Dignity Bill 2020. He has put a great effort into it, as have all who have worked with him, some of whom have campaigned for many years to get to this point and ensure people have the right to make a decision on the end of their life and to have their life end with dignity in the way they choose. It is very disappointing that the Government has tabled an amendment. It is wholly unnecessary. It is very unfortunate that it has used the phrase "assisted suicide" because I do not believe it captures at all what we are talking about. It conjures up very different notions. What we are talking about is people who, like pretty much all of us, have wanted to live but whose choice about living is taken from them at the end, often in really awful circumstances. It is a question of whether life should end on their terms and whether they should have a choice about how their life should end so they can die with the utmost dignity and with as little pain and suffering as possible.I do not understand why anybody would want to deny people whose choice to live is taken away from them by illness, which illness is certain to end their life, the right to choose the terms on which that should happen in order to minimise the pain and suffering, physical and spiritual, that they undergo in those circumstances. I do not see why anyone would do that. In some cases - it is not an exaggeration to say this - to deny them that right is to torture them. It is literally putting them through excruciating, unbearable suffering and hardship against their will. That is a form of torture in an already difficult situation. Why would we want to do that to somebody? What right has anybody to deny a person the right to decide the terms on which his or her life should end when his or her life is certain to end?  Society has moved on from the days when people in the State or the church or from some moral code they held thought they could dictate to other people how they should live their lives. I thought we had moved past that. It seems, however, that with the delaying tactics, we are bending to the will of people who want to hold back that progress in Irish society. There is no justification for it. There are, for example, no constitutional issues arising. As the Supreme Court stated in 2012 that there were no constitutional issues, what do we need to consider? The matter has been discussed before in committee. If this Bill passes Second Stage, it will be discussed again in an all-party committee. All the Government needs to do is allow this Bill go to the next Stage where it will get all-party consideration. If the Government wants to set up other parallel processes that can be done as well but there is no reason to delay the Bill. Every moment of delay means that a small number of people - this is about only a small number of people - may suffer unnecessarily. Why would we do anything that would allow that to happen? I appeal to the Government to withdraw its amendment and to allow this Bill to proceed in order that we can have a mature discussion about the legislation and, hopefully, get it enacted soon, to make a difficult and tragic situation for many people a little less unbearable and cruel.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	303	The two previous speakers, my colleagues, made points about pain and people who die in pain. I want to speak about the people who are facing into an undignified death without control of their bodies or bodily functions and who make the choice to leave this world in a different way, namely, voluntary assisted death. If I had a terminal illness, getting progressively worse, and I was facing an undignified death would I want a choice in that situation? Yes, I would want to be able to say that if I am leaving this world, I am doing so on my terms and not on the terms dictated to me by an illness that is outside of my control. I also would want to make sure that the loved one or friend I reached out to and asked to help me in that situation would not face legal consequences, which is currently the position here. We know the example of Gail O'Rourke, who helped her friend, Bernadette. On behalf of Bernadette, she went to the travel agent to pick up the tickets for the flight to Switzerland to Dignitas, where Bernadette hoped to have a dignified death, only to be met by the Garda, brought to Rathmines Garda station and later before the courts facing the possibility of 14 years' imprisonment. Gail did not go to jail but the possibility was hanging over her. This shows it is not a case of this practice being introduced into this county. It already exists in this country and has done for years but it is illegal. It is wrong that it is illegal. It should be legal. It should be put in proper legal context and people should have the right to die in dignity.

I acknowledge it reflects a sincere and humanitarian objective to minimise suffering and distress at the end of life. We all know someone who has died in this way, in distress and pain, and we would not wish for ourselves or for anybody else. No matter what way we look at it, assisting someone to die is a very complex issue, medically, ethically and morally. It also gives rise to criminal justice and constitutional issues. Consideration also needs to be given to the vital public interest in protecting persons who are nearing the end of their lives and who might be vulnerable and at risk of abuse. I do not suggest this applies in every case. In legislating for the complex issue, Ireland would become one of only a small number of countries in the world to legislate for assisted dying. We are not currently an outlier in this regard. In my speech this evening, I will deal with a number of issues, including the existing law in this country, the changes proposed in this Bill, the issue of safeguards and the Government amendment and the merits of detailed consideration by a special Oireachtas committee and the need for a wider public debate on this issue. On the existing law, it is an offence under the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993 to assist another person in taking his or her life. Prosecution of the offence can result in a term of imprisonment of up to 14 years. The constitutionality of the legislation was upheld by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the Marie Fleming case on 29 April 2013. The court held - I am using its language - that there is no constitutional right to commit suicide or to arrange for the ending of one's life at a time of one's choosing. The court also found that the prohibition on assisted suicide was not discriminatory and was not contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. The courts have said that while it is open to the Oireachtas to legislate in this area, it would be a matter for the courts to consider if whatever the Oireachtas may propose, if it proposes change at all, is constitutionally permissible. The Private Members' Bill before us would decriminalise, subject to certain conditions and safeguards, assisting the death of a terminally ill person. As Deputy Kenny outlined, the Bill provides a number of safeguards, including that the process is medically-led and that the person must be terminally ill. That is why we have a joint response this evening from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health.  In terms of the safeguards, it is clear that if the House is to legislate in this area, the competing interests of the individual will have to be balanced with the wider public interest in safeguarding people who are nearing the end of their lives and who might be vulnerable and at risk of abuse. The High Court has made a number of comments in relation to the development and policing of safeguards. The court held:But such might well be the unintended effect of such a change, specifically because of the inability of even the most rigorous system of legislative checks and balances to ensure, in particular, that the aged, the disabled, the poor, the unwanted, the rejected, the lonely, the impulsive, the financially compromised and the emotionally vulnerable would not disguise their own personal preferences and elect to hasten death so as to avoid a sense of being a burden on family and society. The safeguards built into any liberalised system would, furthermore, be vulnerable to laxity and complacency and might well prove difficult or even impossible to police adequately.There is a vital public interest in protecting vulnerable persons, which all Members wish to ensure, and it is important that the Oireachtas takes its time to consider the proposed law and safeguards. In terms of the next steps, the timed amendment I am proposing to the motion proposes that we take the necessary time to consider what are complex issues. It would mean that the Bill would be read a Second Time 12 months hence - this is not an attempt to delay - and that a special joint Oireachtas committee would be established to consider this matter in detail. This committee would be established very soon. Among the issues the special committee would be asked to consider, and this is not conclusive, would be: the medical, ethical and moral issues, as well as criminal justice and constitutional issues which arise; the issues identified by the High Court regarding developing and policing safeguards, which are needed to ensure that a qualifying person is not subjected to any pressure by any third parties; how unintended consequences that create any adverse impact on vulnerable persons could be avoided; the safeguards found in the regulatory regimes prevailing in jurisdictions such as Switzerland, the Netherlands and certain US states, such as Washington and Oregon, which have legislated in this area; what role or legal rights a family member should or could have in the process; and what role the legal profession or those with a function under law in supporting decision-making or making decisions on a person's behalf should have in the process. The Oireachtas justice and equality committee of the previous Dáil examined the issue of assisted dying, but I understand it did not go into the detail that we would like. While it did not come to a conclusion on whether legislative change is required, it raised a number of questions which need to be answered if change is to be considered. I hope that the new special Oireachtas committee, if approved, will take up these questions. The new committee would report back to this House within 12 months with recommendations. The subject of assisted dying is complex and cannot be rushed. A special Oireachtas committee is best placed to ensure that there is full consideration of the issues which arise in this Bill. That is why I ask Deputies to support the countermotion I am proposing. It will also give all Members, as well as the general public, the time to consider the fundamental questions and detail of what is being proposed. On the Bill specifically, there are a number of legal and technical issues which require much greater consideration. These include the implications the law would have for other countries which could regard such assistance as on offence, notwithstanding that it takes place outside of their territories. While the legislation allows for conscientious objection, many doctors would equally have an objection to an imposed duty to transfer and enable the death of a patient. That section, if enacted, would be likely to be the subject of legal challenge. We have other concerns as well. The question being asked of the House in this Bill could not be of more fundamental importance. It is asking us to consider whether we should legislate to allow some of our citizens who have a terminal illnesses to choose to end their lives. The past decade has seen this country make a series significant social changes in a relatively short period. We do not need to recount the old arguments today, but on every occasion each of us took positions which were sincerely held and honestly argued. However, the decisions we made, from that relating to the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act to those in respect of the referendums to usher in marriage equality and repeal the eighth amendment, followed years of debate. Once again, debate on a profound social issue cannot be confined to the Chambers and committee rooms of the Oireachtas. Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill, and the Government's countermotion establishing an Oireachtas committee, will hopefully lead to a wider public debate on the merits, consequences and implications of assisted dying. Furthermore, each side of the debate must try to respect the opposite point of view. Those who will argue for assisted dying must respect people who feel that it devalues other lives, such as those of our citizens who have life limiting conditions. Opposition to assisted dying must also acknowledge that advocates for change are motivated by compassion and care for their fellow citizens. I refer to Michael Nugent. Mr. Nugent came before the Oireachtas justice and equality committee of the previous Oireachtas to speak about his late wife Anne, who had medication available to her which would have ended her life. He said:Anne died naturally, as do most people who make these preparations. It is not about the act of dying, it is about the peace of mind one has while one is still alive of knowing one can avoid unnecessary suffering if one has to. There are deeply held views and worries on both sides. As we open the debate this evening, I ask that mutual respect is maintained in the Oireachtas and across the country generally.

I appreciate the comments of Members so far and the Minister's response. A decision on whether to change the law and on how best this can be done if there is a decision to change it, cannot and should not be rushed. I am glad the Minister referred to the significant societal changes that have happened in the past and that were finalised in this House. They were not instigated here, but in kitchens, living rooms and coffee shops around the country. The journey this House and its Members went on with those profound societal changes, such as marriage equality and the repeal of the eighth amendment, might not have suited everybody, but the majority of people supported them and those decisions were finalised in this House. Deputy Gino Kenny referred to the previous Oireachtas committee. I served on the committees of the Thirty-first and Thirty-second Dáileanna, and I can say with certainty that the work of all-party Oireachtas special committees on profound moral and societal issues was deserving of the careful and methodical deliberation on the part of Members of the House. This Bill raises profound emotive questions of morality and ethics. I accept the position the Deputy has adopted regarding his wish genuinely to assist people in what can only be described as a tragic and painful situation. In that vein, he said he accepted the bona fides of the Government parties in proposing a counter motion. I suggest that the Deputy ask the Department of Justice and Equality, perhaps through a parliamentary question, to speculate on how long it would take the Parliamentary Counsel in that Department and in the Department of Health to take a Bill from Second Stage through to the Fifth Stage. I will confer with the Minister later, but I believe that nine months is probably conservative. I say that as a former member of the justice committees of the Thirty-first and Thirty-second Dáileanna. As the Minister said, there are questions about certain parts of the Bill which could be problematic. For that reason as well, further consideration should be given to it. I listened to "Drivetime" on a podcast recently while I was driving home. I listened to the member of the public the Deputy mentioned, whose name is Bernadette. I was aware of this prior to that as I had heard from a few correspondents about it, but not many. I must say that this has the potential to be another one of those journeys we have all been on in the last number of years because it is a profoundly personal question that is currently not answered by the law. It is prohibited by the law. However, Bernadette's story of trying to assist a friend and being arrested at the door of a travel agent for doing so resonated with me. I was left with time to think as I drove. Something as profound as this should not be rushed. It will require all of us to listen carefully to experts, who we will not have access to in the same way as we will with an all-party committee holding hearings such as those that took place in the past. Perhaps some will change their views, in either direction, but perhaps a majority of members will decide that this is something they will support and the Bill may progress further. There is no reason that it will take the full 12 months for the committee to be established and report, albeit there are difficulties with meeting for more than two hours and so forth. I am sure there are ways such a committee can be constructed to expedite its element of the work. I finish as I started, by commending the Deputy on bringing the Bill forward.It is something we should consider carefully . That consideration can really only take place in the forum we have used in the past. It would be worthy of all Members to take the time to consider the countermotion and the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Justice and Equality before they make their decision to either stop this from proceeding further or to attempt to adopt a Bill which, I believe. will not be passed by the House.

I commend Deputy Gino Kenny on moving this Bill and ensuring that we have this important and, in many ways, historic debate. I also commend the former Minister of State, John Halligan, who, as people know, had done a significant amount of work on this issue, as well as all the campaigners Deputy Gino Kenny mentioned, who have been doing a lot of work on this issue, understanding its complexity and advocating their position from a compassionate perspective. For obvious reasons, it is important that we are clear on what the Bill does. It is a divisive Bill in the sense that there are opposing views. I am respectful of all of the views and opinions. Personally, I am in favour of this Bill and of the principle behind it. However, I also understand that there are people in this House and outside it who have genuine and legitimate concerns that need to be responded to. The Bill provides for assisted dying in the event of terminal illness only. Assisted dying would only be permitted after assessment by the attending medical practitioner and an independent medical practitioner. Before countersigning a patient's declaration, they must verify that the patient is terminally ill, has the capacity to make the decision to end his or her own life and has a clear and settled intention to end his or her life which was reached voluntarily, on an informed basis, without coercion or duress. There is a clause in the Bill which protects conscientious objectors, and rightly so, providing that no medical practitioner would be obliged to provide assisted dying. There are amendments I would want to make to the Bill. These relate to a waiting period for reflection, psychiatric evaluations, hearing more from experienced medical practitioners and confirmation that criteria are met by a High Court judge, a medical person and a layperson. There are amendments that I would make to this Bill and my party will make. I also accept that we need proper scrutiny of this Bill. While I will support the Private Member's Bill and oppose the Government's amendment, if there is a special committee set up, of course it should do its job. We all have to be responsible and compassionate in how we approach this issue. My party and I will certainly play our part in all of that. I want to make a point that is very personal. I have heard some people already make the argument that somehow this will undermine palliative care. Assisted dying is not a replacement for palliative care. In January 2018, my mam went for what she thought was a routine test. She went on her own to a hospital. Unfortunately, she got bad news that she most likely had cancer. Within a couple of weeks of getting that news, she ended up in St. James's Hospital and had most of her stomach removed. She fought a long battle over a number of months. My family and her friends followed and supported her in that battle every step of the way. Every single day was a battle. In November 2018, we thought she was through the worst of it but the cancer was still there and it was growing. She ended up back in St. James's Hospital and was there for five or six weeks. She could not eat. We had a fair idea what was happening but we were hoping it was something that could be dealt with. On Christmas Eve 2018, she went for surgery. I remember I was putting my two kids to bed on Christmas Eve when I got a phone call to say she was dying, the cancer was back and she had a few short weeks to live. I immediately got into the car, drove to the hospital and saw my mam. I had spoken to her on the phone before she went for her surgery and she was full of hope. The first thing I noticed was that the life was gone out of her, I could see it in her eyes. It was obviously an awful experience. It was in a very small hospital room. She was eventually transferred to a palliative care unit. We did not have one in either Waterford or the south east at the time. The unit was in Harold's Cross. She got absolutely tremendous care. They did every single thing that was humanly possible to make sure that she did not die in pain. That was the one thing she kept saying to us. She was very brave all the way through. I am sure people have their own experiences and similar stories. My mam did not want to die in pain. The staff did absolutely everything. There are, however, people for whom palliative care simply does not do that because of the nature of the illness. That is the point. Then it is a matter of personal choice. We should face up to that. We can name the diseases although I am not going to name them. There are people who have those diseases who would make a decision not to end their lives, even if the legislation was there. That is the case and should be respected. Equally, there are people who would make a different choice if they were in that situation and were facing into what we can only describe as a horrible death. There should absolutely have to be safeguards to protect vulnerable people, make sure individuals make this decision voluntarily and that it is done in the most sensitive and compassionate way and in the most legally sound way, with all of the advice that can be possibly given and with a cooling off period. In those circumstances, compassion and humanity tell me that we should allow people to have that opportunity and that choice. I know that is going to be difficult for some people and that this debate is going to be difficult. I genuinely hope that this debate does not turn into what we have seen with previous debates on issues that were, perhaps, similar. Notwithstanding differences I will have with some people in this Chamber, I sincerely understand their point of view and that it raises moral and ethical issues. People have already contacted me. We are all being lobbied by individuals with different views and perspectives. I will oppose the Government's amendment but not because I do not believe there should be scrutiny or full examination. I agree with Deputy Farrell when he says that this will take time. It should take time if we are sincere about this. I am of the view that the author of the Bill is sincere about it. He has said he wants scrutiny of and proper debate on this issue. If we are sincere about it, we have to give it the time it deserves. I am glad it is the Oireachtas doing it and not the Citizens' Assembly. I am not against the Citizens' Assembly but we are the legislators. We are elected to Dáil Éireann and we have to make decisions. Ultimately, the people who make the decisions are the ones who should carry out the scrutiny. We are the ones who should conduct the discussions on this issue. I want to hear from everybody. I want to hear all views. I will go in with an open mind. I have already seen that this is not as black and white as sometimes we can make it. There are grey areas and we have to accept that. It is not going to be straightforward. A lot of work will need to be done. In that spirit, I commend the author of the Bill. I genuinely want to speak to those people who have done a huge amount of work on this issue over the past number of years, those who have lost loved ones and those who have battled in the to the courts to get this issue dealt with.The fact we are debating it here today is a step forward, even if the Government amendment is passed and even if there is a committee that takes longer than some of us might like. It is a big, genuine and good step forward on this issue. The tone in which I wish to see the debate conducted is a passionate and understanding one that reflects the diversity of opinions and views and that whatever we settle on will be settled upon. Therefore, let us have that debate over the next number of months. I certainly look forward to engaging with people in this Chamber and outside it.

#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	310	I will share a few minutes with Deputy Shortall at the end. The Dying with Dignity Bill clearly comes from a place of compassion. We all recognise this. There is no sinister agenda or malice behind it. There are, of course, moral and emotional minefields to be negotiated to arrive at a consensus between two ends of a spectrum of opinion. One is that the taking of life is always wrong and assisting in taking a life is even more wrong. The other opinion is that everyone has the right to do with his or her life what he or she wishes when it comes to ending his or her life. Sinn Féin, in recognising this issue needs a detailed, deep and compassionate analysis by this House and by the Seanad, supports the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. When it reaches Committee Stage, it should be extensively and comprehensively scrutinised with regard to the sensitivities of the issues and, as has become clearer since the Bill was published again recently, the lack of consensus among citizens regarding the right of any individual to end their life or not, no matter what the consequences. We will have to seek evidence, testimony and advice from the full spectrum of opinion and expertise on the matter and the nation must feel the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill was accessible and reasonable. Within this scrutiny, there must be thorough, intelligent, informed and compassionate exploration of the logistics of any assistance to be offered to those who might choose to take that ultimate step of ending their own lives. There must be an examination of the consequences and further consequences, the hard and painful cases and the suffering that may be relieved or, indeed, inflicted through all of this and it must all be viewed with clarity. The nub of them matter is that no one is an island. For every person who might decide to end his or her life, for reasons that seem logical and reasonable and justified to him or herself, there are lovers, spouses, children, close family members, religious advisers, support groups and friends who are, through that relationship, involved in the action of ending the human life as well. Indeed, we as a society, and those of us elected to represent that society as lawmakers, must take on the consideration and passage or not of this Bill as the huge responsibility it is. There are many people who, when one talks to them, believe it is permissible for people with a terminal diagnosis to die by choice. Some may even call that a right. From there comes the argument that if a person has such a right, then he or she has the right to enlist the assistance of others. That is what is legally difficult. It is also counter-intuitive, is sad and painful and is hard for us to agree. I have not, however, met a single person who has watched a loved one die slowly and in pain who did not wish, at some stage, he or she was able to help that loved one to die sooner. That is a long way from the fear that the choice of assisted dying would become preferable to families of vulnerable older people in comparison to the payment for their care in homes for many years. That brings in the issue of hospices and palliative care and the need for more and better services in that regard. If we agree that the right to die is to be vindicated, do we then automatically acquire a responsibility to assist someone to take his or her own life? It is never black and white. We know this. Like every other moral issue, there are times we feel one way and occasions when we feel another. The rationality of the decision is a major issue and, of course, there must be some strong safeguards against assisting in the death of those who cannot make a rational decision on the matter. There are questions that must be asked of everyone contemplating this hard option and anyone contemplating assisting such people, especially the terminally ill. Is it an optional that I want to consider? Should I hold out for the chance of cure? How should I time my death? What weight should I give to the welfare interests of others?  It is an interesting point that despite their experience in the treatment of terminally ill patients, in opinion polls medical doctors have shown themselves to be more opposed to assisted dying than the public. Perhaps, that is because they will be the people who will have to be of assistance in the vindication of any right to die. There are those who find their lives damaged beyond recognition by accident or by illness and feel it is not worth living a miserable life waiting for death by natural causes. We have, of course, also seen a huge plague of suicide in our society. We have seen too many young people die like this. We have seen vulnerable groups particularly affected by this and have all called out for more mental health services, more emergency interventions, more awareness campaigns and every possible measure to prevent people dying in this manner. Then, however, we also saw the intelligent, rational, loving arguments put forward by Marie Fleming and her husband Tom. We are now listening to the intelligent, rational and compassionate statements of Vicky Phelan and we are wavering between those two ends of that spectrum. That should show us there is no black and white. There is no absolute right or wrong and if we are going to legislate, or not, on assisted dying then we had better do so in the calmest, most informed and most respectful way possible.  This Bill should proceed to Committee Stage and we must do our best possible job of scrutinising it and making informed determinations. This Oireachtas has the responsibility to deal with this matter. While it might be easier to avoid it, the right thing to do is work together to build consensus and maximum agreement on this difficult issue. With that in mind, I urge members to allow this to go to the next Stage.

It is a pity we are under so much time pressure because I believe many people would like to contribute. It is an important issue. At the outset, I commend Deputy Gino Kenny on the work he has done in this area in bringing the Bill forward and allowing debate on this important issue in the Dáil this evening. We all accept this is an extremely complex ethical issue. It is sensitive and its complexity is all the more reason we should hear this debate tonight and that we should engage with this issue. I acknowledge at this point the outstanding work done by Tom Curran and his beloved late wife, Marie Fleming, in terms of bringing this issue, in particular, to the fore. They played a central role in that and I commend all their campaigning work.  My party passed a motion at the party conference last year calling for clear policy in this area. We have just completed some policy work and I hope we can input that into the debate that will happen, hopefully, over the coming months. As a nation, we need to have an in-depth and nuanced conversation about end-of-life care. As we all recognise, this is an incredibly personal issue and it deserves a frank, honest conversation about the value of life, the complexity of terminal illness and the right to dignity and autonomy at the end of life. Of course, end-of-life care covers a whole spectrum. We are more familiar, of course, with home care, hospice care and palliative care and we have not been great about resourcing those properly. Successive Governments have not done that and it must be a critical part of end-of-life care. So too, however, are issues like a living will, the right to decide on resuscitation or not and, I believe, ultimately, the right in the case of a person who has a terminal illness to decide on the timing of his or her passing. I believe we all have a responsibility to respect those rights. An important contribution was made to the debate by Mr. Michael Nugent with regard to his late wife, Anne, to which the Minister referred. There was also an important contribution this week from Mr. Fintan O'Toole regarding his late father's death. In both cases, the point was made that the big fear of the person struggling with the terminal illness was that they would not be able to take that decision themselves. Once they were given an assurance, either on medication or support in accessing the carrying out of a decision with regard to ending their life, they relaxed about it. Once they were given that reassurance the anxiety went and, as it turned out, both people concerned had natural deaths. That is a fundamental right that I believe any of us would want for ourselves or for our loved ones. We cannot avoid this issue any longer. I commend Deputy Gino Kenny on his work. Ultimately a person with a terminal illness should be able to decide to choose the time of his or her passing and the State must respect that decision. This debate needs to take that frank look at the importance of personal choice and autonomy, and the importance of ensuring that medical treatment will be available when the person takes that decision. We need to include many issues in this. We need to take expert advice from a range of different people. We need to have a national conversation and debate. When the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality looked at the right to die, there was a recommendation for it to be referred to the citizens' assembly. While that has merit, taking it in committee, ideally a Dáil committee, which is established quickly and is time limited would be the best way to do it. The example is the Joint Committee on the Repeal of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. Wonderful work was done on that and it was broadly based. It was a respectful debate and came to a very clear consensus. We need to follow that in this case.

I commend Deputy Gino Kenny on introducing the Bill tonight, as I have done in private on a number of occasions. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the former Minister of State and Deputy, John Halligan, who ploughed a lonely furrow for a considerable period. I hope he is watching tonight. He is still advocating for it. It is vital to handle this issue sensitively irrespective of one's view. It is quite an emotive topic and many people have differing views. I have met people who have changed their views in the past week. I respect the Government's position. I respect the conversations we have had. I do not agree with the Government's position in delaying this for a year. During the Covid crisis it would not materialise. I appreciate the sincerity with which it was put forward. At the end of the day we are legislators and we need to legislate. We must legislate for this issue now. This is not a perfect Bill. What we are doing tonight is putting forward our principle that we need to deal with this as legislators. The Labour Party has a number of issues with the Bill and we will deal with them on Committee Stage in the coming weeks and months. We have gone through considerable societal change in recent years. Irish people have always come through a process and showed their caring nature irrespective of their opinions on very sensitive issues. We have also gone through a very tough six months with Covid and many people have questioned their own mortality. We have had different conversations around our kitchen tables. When a loved one becomes sick with a serious illness and the end of their life is nearing, we all want to do whatever we can to help them and stop their pain and suffering. Improving end-of-life care and providing outlets for dying with dignity are imperative. This issue cannot be kicked down the road any longer. I acknowledge the work of Gail O'Rourke and the sacrifices she made. I also acknowledge Marie Fleming and Tom Curran. We all know Marie's story. While she was in the final stages of multiple sclerosis, she brought a landmark case in the Supreme Court to challenge the State's legal ban on assisted suicide. We know she lost her battle, but through her spirit what she advocated for was the spark that has ignited this discussion and brought us to where we are tonight. Her campaign is ongoing and she kick-started a national debate on these matters, which will be her lasting legacy. I have said many times in this House that I have met one of the bravest women many of us have ever heard or have had the privilege of meeting. I have become a good friend of hers. I am speaking about Vicky Phelan. I listen very closely to Vicky Phelan. I know the proposer of the Bill does also. I was reassured by her stance in the multiple conversations I had with her. I speak to her every week and I spoke to her earlier today. She asked me to read something into the Dáil record tonight. The following words are not mine, but Vicky Phelan's:You have been asked to debate a very important Bill this evening - the Dying with Dignity Bill. I understand that there will be very many of you who may not agree with what this Bill proposes - assisted dying. However, all that I am asking of you is to park your own views on this issue for a moment and consider this:Imagine that you are dying from an incurable cancer. You are still relatively young with young children. You do not want to die yet you know that, barring a miracle, this is not going to happen.You do not know how long you have left yet all you can think about is dying and leaving your children behind.You know that people suffering from the same cancer, who have died before you, endured a lot of pain in their final weeks.Indeed, you have sat with some of these patients in their final weeks and watched them and their loved ones suffer unnecessarily while they waited for the last breath.You will never forget the sound of the death rattle, a sound that you know is facing you when your time comes and which haunts you when you imagine your young children having to witness this.Now, imagine that there is another way.Imagine that you can choose to control the circumstances of your inevitable death.Imagine that, by virtue of this Bill, that you are allowed to die, gently, at home, surrounded by your family and friends when your time is nearing its end.I do not have to imagine.THIS is what this Dying with Dignity Bill would do for me and my family.I do not want to die.I am NOT choosing between living and dying.My cancer is incurable.The option of living will no longer be available to me in the not too distant future.I just want to be allowed to have the choice to control the circumstances of my death much as I have made decisions about my own life.Please, I ask all of you who have a free vote on this issue:Do not vote for the amendment proposed by Cabinet and [Government] and send this Bill to a Special Committee to be scrutinised for another 12 months.Vote for this Bill to go through to the Second Stage and allow for pre-legislative scrutiny to take place NOW, not in 12 months time.Do not kick this issue down the road for another 12 months.Please.Voting for this Bill will bring a huge amount of comfort and clarity to people, like me, who know they are going to die, and die with a certain amount of suffering and pain.Allow people to make choices for themselves. We all know that this is not a black-and-white issue. We all know there will be grey areas and that we will have to go through this legislation in a huge amount of detail. We all know we will change parts of the legislation, to which the proposer is very much open. We all know there are concerns about people who are considered vulnerable and that people could potentially be taken advantage of. We all know checks and balances will have to be put in place. We in the Labour Party value people's dignity above all else and want to ensure that everybody is protected and everybody can have the fullest life that he or she deserves. This is not something that is a replacement for palliative care. Please let no Member stand up here and say that this is a replacement for palliative care. No one in this House should do so because that is not what we are dealing with. There a number of legal issues and a number of issues in the Bill which will have to be changed. These issues relate to, for instance, section 2 of the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993, which prohibits aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the suicide of another person. This Bill is concerned with removing that ban. However, section 12 of this Bill seems to override section 2 of the 1993 Act in its entirety. This is an issue we will have to deal with as we go through this Bill on Committee Stage. There is another issue with section 12 of the Bill, which states that nothing in the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993 make unlawful the provision of assistance in accordance with this Bill. However, this Bill is concerned with more than just providing assistance. It authorises in circumstances the direct administration of substances by the attending physician. Therefore we are going to have to deal with that as well. Supporting this Bill is a brave stance to take and I am glad to be a Member of this House and to supporting it with colleagues from across all different forms of politics. I urge Members to consider this Bill very deeply as they make up their minds and to consider the people advocating for it and, most of all, to consider the fact that we, as legislators, have to deal with this legislation in a very timely fashion. I ask Members to please support the Bill and not the Government's amendment.

I strongly oppose the Bill before us. We in Ireland have just come through a seven-month period which has been appalling for many of our older and more vulnerable citizens. Tens of thousands of them have been confined to their homes and have seen a huge decline in their morale, health and quality of life as a result. Many have been cut off from their families and their communities. Hundreds of our older people were left isolated and alone in nursing homes and were in some cases left to die at the height of the coronavirus last April. The lack of planning and consideration for the needs of older, more vulnerable people contributed in no small way to this tragic loss of life. It is absolutely shocking that against this backdrop, when some of the most vulnerable people in our society turn on their radios these days, they are bombarded with media stories pushing the case for legalising assisted suicide. At the very time when we should be encouraging people and putting supports in place to help the morale and well-being of people who have been through so much in recent months, the Dáil is spending time talking about introducing a law that would sanction the ending of people's lives. The title of the Bill does not convey what the Bill would actually permit, which is euthanasia, plain and simple. Euthanasia is a deeply sensitive issue for many older people and those who are most vulnerable in our community. Today is the United Nations International Day of Older Persons. It is a very sad thing that we are debating a Bill about ending life rather than talking about assisting and enriching lives on such an important day. There was a letter in The Irish Times last week from Dr. Martin Owen, a medical doctor based in Ontario, Canada. I expect all Deputies, and those on the Government side in particular, to read it. In this letter Dr. Owen pointed out that in Canada, where euthanasia was only legalised in 2016, already 81% of all euthanasia is carried out on people over 65 years of age and that one third of people is over the age of 80. The Canadian Government has proposed a new Bill which would extend euthanasia for non-fatal conditions, including many disabilities like cerebral palsy.

Once the law permits the ending of life, very soon it is no longer confined to the so-called hard cases. The door to unrestricted euthanasia is thrown open. Using phrases like "a very restrictive Bill with lots of safeguards" does not make it so. The only thing that matters is the text of the Bill and the Bill before us this evening would open up the door to one of the most extreme regimes anywhere in the world. Having good intentions is not good enough in this situation. What matters are facts and the facts show that in every country that has introduced similar laws to the ones proposed in this Bill, it is only a matter of time until there is unrestricted euthanasia. We have a suicide crisis at present and huge efforts are being made in the area of suicide prevention. Members should think of the mixed messages and signals this sends out to people who are struggling with suicidal thoughts to hear people on the radio and in the Dáil making the case for assisted suicide. The amount of correspondence I have received in recent days from healthcare professionals is unbelievable. They all raise serious concerns about the impact a change in the law in this area would have on the very vulnerable people in the area. Away from the soft-focus interviews that many in the media have been conducting on this issue in recent weeks, there are people all around Ireland who have been listening to this debate and are disconcerted and upset by what they have heard. I know the supporters of the Bill never intended to add to their suffering and I would never level this charge. However, the message the medical professions have been sending to Deputies in recent days is loud and clear. The impact of what is said in debates like this and the changes to the law in the area can be devastating for the most vulnerable and fragile members of our community who oftentimes start to see themselves as a burden on society with a duty to end their lives. We must listen to what the experts are saying in this regard. Before I conclude, some months ago I raised an issue in this House about a do not resuscitate, DNR, order that has been placed on the medical charts of some residents of nursing homes without the consent of the residents themselves or their loved ones.The matter was also raised in a recent HIQA report.

I am grateful to Deputy Gino Kenny and his colleagues for highlighting the need to address assisted dying and for contributing to the debate. I do not doubt the Bill has been tabled with the best of humanitarian objectives in a sincere effort to ensure every Irish person who is dying, no matter from what, has the right to die with dignity. The Bill raises significant legal, ethical and policy issues and issues of freedom, justice and compassion, which deserve our full consideration. Dying is a highly charged and emotional matter. Most of us simply find it too difficult to have the necessary conversations involved to face up to the fact of our own death or that of someone we love. We prefer to stick our fingers in our ears and get on with living. When we add assistance into the idea of death it makes it an even more intense conversation. There are deeply held views in the Oireachtas and throughout the country on this issue, and in taking the next steps as a Parliament and Government we must respect and hear all of them. We all hope we can leave this world peacefully and with dignity. Will the Bill help or hinder this process? As I believe we need to discuss this and give it the time and attention it deserves, I am adding my support to the countermotion of the Minister for Justice and Equality, which proposes a time delay that would allow scrutiny by a joint Oireachtas committee in order to adequately consider the policy and legal issues raised in the Bill. The Bill requires careful deliberation. We need to consider it together with wider society and expert professional groups as well as a wide range of Departments and the Office of the Attorney General. Which aspects of the Bill do we need to consider? Is it more compassionate to allow people the right to end their lives or to protect people's lives at all costs? Does the Bill do enough to protect and safeguard the vulnerable and vindicate their constitutional rights? As the High Court asked in 2013, are the safeties in place for the aged, disabled, the poor, the unwanted, the rejected, the lonely, the impulsive, the financially compromised and the emotionally vulnerable so they would not disguise their own personal preference and elect to hasten death because they do not want to be a burden on family and society? From the legal perspective of protecting the vulnerable and vindicating their constitutional right to life, further consideration needs to be given to the period of time given to persons with a terminal illness and how that time might make them eligible to access assisted dying. More discussion on the role of the patient's family members or those acting in a position of enduring power of attorney needs to be had. The Bill makes no mention of this, which is a crucial oversight. Like it or not, death is an issue that every one of us will face and because of this we need to give the Bill serious time, attention and consideration. This is a highly emotive subject. To some, the issue is anchored in the rights of a person to have some control over the time and manner of his or her death. For others, there are very real concerns about the potential for knock-on consequences, including inappropriate deaths, the normalisation of suicide and the impact on palliative care. We must recognise the legitimacy of all of these viewpoints and take them all into account in our deliberations. We have big questions to ask about the Bill. For me, the biggest one at present is whether the current legal status of assisted dying is in step or out of step with Irish public opinion. What does the electorate want? As elected Members of the Dáil, we need to ensure we are correctly representing people. I do not believe we have the time and space to do that properly without the proposed amendment the Government has tabled. The proposed joint Oireachtas committee would provide the time and space to undertake a detailed examination of the proposal in the Bill, hear expert advice and make recommendations on how best to proceed, including on possible amendments. The Government is aware that if we are to deal with assisted dying comprehensively in law we must give it the careful nuanced consideration it deserves. Allowing a committee time to consider all the issues involved is the best way to make sure the law we put in place takes a careful, measured and well evidenced approach and will do the best for all our citizens. We are all ultimately on the same side; we all want to do the best for the people of Ireland.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	375	I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that our most vulnerable citizens have been treated despicably in the Covid period in nursing homes. He is right about that and this Bill does not even exist in law. The protection of vulnerability is not contained in the Bill's existence; it is dependent on the sort of society we have. It is dependent on whether we provide the resources that older people, sick people and sick children need or whether we have charity balls, fundraisers and coffee mornings for the palliative care that is required because that is done mainly by charities through the hospice instead of the State providing the care needed for those who are most vulnerable. The question of vulnerability is really a distraction by the Minister of State and Deputy Fitzpatrick because actually there is an argument to be made that if we legislate for assisted dying, we will protect people even more. In that circumstance, they can have frank and honest conversations with the medical profession, they can make decisions, there are time limits in place, the process is overseen by two medical persons who are qualified to do so and there is less vulnerability. I know a couple of people who collect their medicines. They do it so that some day if they want to pass away quietly and quickly rather than going through months and months of decreasing life quality, they will have the option to do so. For them, it is a dirty secret. It is a bit like how termination of pregnancy was once a dirty secret in this country. Talking about the most vulnerable is not where it is at and we have missed the point here and missed an opportunity to have the argument about it. I have a short time to speak but I want to make a couple of points. Euthanasia is not something that is carried out in abundance in countries that allow for assisted dying. That is absolutely false and we can prove it in a longer debate. Euthanasia or assisted dying is not done to people but with them and not all of the people concerned are old. Vicky Phelan is not old. The woman whose life story I read in The Irish Times, who went on hunger strike and ended up starving herself to death because nobody would give her assisted dying facilities, was a young woman. Friends of mine who I know are facing terrible trauma are young. People do not have to be old to be vulnerable and they do not have to be old to make what I consider to be a very courageous choice. Often that choice is made out of love for life and love for the lives of those being left behind. I ask Members to remember this when we are discussing the topic. I object to the idea that we should drag out the debate and the idea that a committee would not have enough time. I tabled a climate emergency Bill that is still not sorted out after two years. We have been talking back and forth about it for two years. The first Bill tabled on abortion was tabled by Clare Daly in 2013. We did not get legislation until 2019. The Government can take as long as it wants but it should not do so. Vicky Phelan and others are waiting and Deputy Gino Kenny is willing to pursue this.

It is a shame there was not more time for the debate because I would like to have heard other people's views, even though I completely disagree with them, but that is what the debate is about. This is quite a complex debate. It is a very profound debate about mortality, our lives, futures and friends and the people we love. These are very difficult circumstances. For 16 years of my life, I have been a carer. I have cared for people in very difficult circumstances coming to the end of their lives.This is not about ending life. This is about living. People are in situations in which they do not want to die by any means. They want to live. I take exception to conflating this with suicide. People with a terminal illness are not suicidal. They want to live every second, minute and hour of every day and week to see their family and enjoy life. Sometimes, however, life is extremely cruel and a terminal illness chooses a person. No one chooses it. This will be an ongoing debate and these are the issues that will be teased out over time. I am not against having an all-party committee. My concern is that we have had reports and committees before but nothing ever happened. That has been my experience here. It is extremely frustrating when nothing happens. I hope this time it might be different. What is important in this debate is that politics is left outside. I know it is difficult sometimes but if we can leave our political allegiances outside, I think we can progress on this debate. This is about humanity, compassion and empathy for our fellow human beings who find themselves in the most difficult circumstances. They do not want to go through unbearable pain for themselves or for their families. On that basis, will the Minister of State drop the amendment to allow the Bill to proceed to pre-legislative scrutiny? This has been an honest but hard debate. While there are only a number of us here, many people outside are listening to this debate. They want us to step up to the plate and do the right thing.

Yesterday was a very difficult day for the leaving certificate class of 2020. The announcement that was made has inevitably generated much anxiety and worry for them. While the announcement yesterday was important, we could not provide all of the answers to their questions at that time. I apologise sincerely once again to the leaving certificate class of 2020 for what has happened. Deputies will be aware that two errors in the calculated grade system for this year’s leaving certificate have been identified. They are errors that should not have occurred. I am very clear on that point. As part of work being done for the leaving certificate applied fifth year cohort, an inconsistency in how the data was performing was detected by Polymetrika International Inc., the contractor for the calculated grades process. Polymetrika contacted the calculated grades office on Tuesday evening to notify it that the inconsistency had been identified. It was agreed immediately that Polymetrika would seek to investigate this anomaly further and report back to the calculated grades executive office the following morning. This report was received by the calculated grades executive office on Wednesday morning and identified that Polymetrika had made a mistake in the writing of code for the standardisation process. On Wednesday afternoon last, I was told that a mistake had been identified by Polymetrika. At that point, we knew that one line out of 50,000 lines of code had a mistake in it. We knew that mistake would impact on the results of some students but we did not know exactly how many would be affected. We knew it was important to find out as much as possible about the error before making an announcement. Polymetrika and the calculated grades executive office then began a detailed analysis of 50,000 lines of code, affecting more than 400,000 exam results. The system was meant to take a number of factors into account in computing the leaving certificate results. Among these were the results of the students' junior cycle examinations, which were considered at an aggregated class level. It is important to say that the junior cycle results of individuals were not used to predict or influence their leaving certificate results. The data was to be used at an aggregated class level. The system was meant to draw on the core subjects of Irish, English and maths and combine them with students' two best non-core subjects. The coding error instead combined them with the students' two weakest non-core subjects. In the course of the review which the calculated grades executive office immediately undertook on Friday, staff found a further error in the code. The results relating to civic, social and political education, CSPE, were meant to be disregarded by the system. They were not. They had been included in error. Following discovery of the second error, the calculated grades executive office undertook a detailed walk-through, taking every parameter and rule underpinning the standardisation model and verifying, in conjunction with the contractor, that it was working correctly. While nothing further was found as a result of this exercise, I wanted a further level of assurance. As such, I instructed my Department to seek an independent expert to review the code, most importantly of all, to give our students the assurance they would now require. My Department has engaged Educational Testing Service, ETS, to provide a review to offer an independent expert opinion on the adequacy of the coding. Furthermore, it is my intention that a full review of the calculated grades process will be conducted in due course. ETS is a US-based not-for-profit organisation that conducts research and develops assessment programmes such as the scholastic assessment test, SAT. ETS is one of the largest testing and assessment services in the world. It develops and administers more than 50 million achievement and admissions tests each year at more than 9,000 locations in the United States and 180 other countries. We expect to have the outcome of ETS's work as soon as possible and I will make that information available at the earliest opportunity. While we do not yet have the final figures, and we will not have them until the independent review which is under way has been completed, our checks to date indicate that the error has affected approximately 7,200 grades. There were over 400,000 calculated grades in total issued on 7 September. As a result of both errors, approximately 6,500 students received at least one result which was one grade lower than they should have. That has been rectified. In addition to the students who received lower grades than they should have in this year's leaving certificate, some students received higher grades. They will not be affected in any way; their grades stand. Those who received lower grades will have their proper grades restored. When all the grades are completed, we will issue the corrected results to the students affected. As soon as it is possible to do so, every student will be contacted by text message and informed whether they are impacted upon. Those who are affected will be directed to the calculated grades student portal, where they will find a new statement of provisional results, which will replace the one they received on 7 September. I would have liked to have had complete and final answers to all of the issues so that I would not be leaving students with questions once the issue was announced. I would also like to have had the certainty that everything had been cross-checked but that would have taken further days. We were conscious that the Central Applications Office, CAO, was issuing round three on Thursday and might need to incorporate what our analysis had revealed in their plans. The decision was therefore made to inform CAO on Wednesday morning of what we knew at that point and to call a press conference at 4 p.m. that day. Furthermore, a dedicated helpline for students was set up within my Department. This came into operation at 4 p.m. yesterday. All students received a text message yesterday advising them that an issue had arisen with the calculated grades. The Opposition were briefed in advance of the press conference. The information I have outlined here is available to students on gov.ie/leavingcertificate. The dedicated helpline for students is available on 01 889 2199 and is open today and tomorrow from 8.30 a.m. until 5 p.m. and on Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m. In addition, the National Parents Council Post Primary, in conjunction with guidance counsellors, has kindly agreed to reopen its leaving certificate helpline for next week running from Monday to Friday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day. I understand that approximately 200 calls from students and parents were made to the helpline yesterday afternoon and evening. Approximately a quarter of the calls sought further information on when the review process would be completed and revised results issued. Other topics included whether those with exemptions in Irish had their results properly reflected, when revised CAO offers would issue and a separate issue of when calculated grades appeals would be completed. The announcement I made yesterday changes things for students. Even if for many of them it improves their situation, it should not have happened. On behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, I apologise sincerely to our leaving certificate students for the situation we are now in and for the upset it has caused. I appreciate that students and their families now want to know what happens next. The results data have now been rerun through the corrected model.Once the review by ETS has been completed and the results are finalised, the Department will have full information on which students will benefit from improved grades and which specific subjects are involved for each student. The Department will then contact all students, advising them when they will receive a higher grade or grades, or whether they are not impacted. The Department will send a corrected file of student results to the CAO in order that it can work with higher educational institutions to determine if a student is due a new offer and to do everything possible to facilitate his or her admission. Any student who would have been entitled to a different offer in previous CAO rounds if he or she had received the correct grade on 7 September will receive this offer or a deferred offer as soon as is practicable under the updated results. Equally, if students receive improved offers but would like to defer their places until next year, I would encourage them to contact the institutions concerned in order to establish if deferral is possible. It is important to say that this is in line with the practice that occurs in the appeals process every year. Where a student who has already started college receives a deferred offer as a result of an upgrade, the student can continue in his or her existing course this year and, in respect of next year, remain eligible for free fees and Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, funding as if he or she was starting college for the first time. Any student who had applied to a higher educational institution outside the State who believes his or her grade change will impact upon those arrangements can contact the Department through a dedicated email address, lc2020@education.gov.ie. Students continue to have the option to register for the postponed written examinations. These will commence on 16 November. The closing date for this registration was to be tomorrow at 5 p.m. I have asked the State Examinations Commission to extend that registration deadline until next Wednesday. I acknowledge that students have had an exceptionally difficult year and they have coped unbelievably well with the challenges posed by Covid-19. As was confirmed by the Taoiseach to the House yesterday, we will do everything to support students who now have the chance to change their course and might wish to do so.

Every year the leaving certificate is difficult but no other leaving certificate class has had to contend with a pandemic, the postponement and cancellation of exams and the ongoing chaos of the calculated grading process. Sinn Féin expressed serious reservations about calculated grading from the beginning. We argued for a different approach that would have focused on allowing as many students as possible to achieve their first choice course at third level and university-based assessment in courses with high competition. We communicated this in a detailed proposal to the then Minister, Deputy McHugh. When the Government was determined to stick with calculated grades, it became our priority to ensure maximum transparency and minimise the risk as much as possible. That is why we called for all the details of the model to be published before the results were released. I cannot help but wonder whether, if the Minister had published the algorithms much sooner and been transparent and open about the grading process instead of keeping it under lock and key, some of these issues might have been identified a lot sooner and the consequences less severe. Even if the Minister had communicated to us these errors when she learned of them seven days ago, it could have made a big difference to students who were waiting on round two CAO offers and to students who signed leases for student accommodation in the past week. The Minister knew that the consequences for many students would be massive. Why did she keep this information to herself and why did the Taoiseach do likewise? I also want to ask how Polymetrika came to take up this job. We now know that it was not subject to tendering. We know that the company was well paid. It was meant to cost €71,500 and cost €163,000 in the end. How did Polymetrika come to be selected? What positive factors led to the Department choosing the company? Was it chosen because it was the cheapest option? This is a back-and-forth, question-and-answer session.

As he is aware, the anomaly was first discovered on Tuesday of last week and the calculated grades office was informed. All that the office was informed of at that stage was that there was an anomaly. It was worked on through the night and on Wednesday morning an official of the Department was informed by the calculated grades office and the Secretary General was informed in the morning. I was then informed on Wednesday afternoon. At that point, what we knew was that an issue had arisen. That issue was an error in the code. Information about how many students it impacted, what its scope and potential might be, and who the affected students might be was not available. It was necessary that further and continuous checks be run to ensure that we had all of the information available so that we could make it available, as I accept is necessary. Following further checks on Friday, a second error was identified. At that stage, I sought and received an opportunity to source external expertise and oversight on the errors that had arisen. That was secured through a company called ETS from the United States, whose staff are international experts in the field of statistics, psychometrics and educational testing. Those checks are still running and theirs are the third pairs of eyes, if you like, on the process, along with the contractor and the calculates grades office. We were aware that CAO offers were becoming available on Wednesday and we made the decision at that stage, as I have outlined, to release not the full information, because we still do not have it, but the information we had at that point. When we did not have the full information, it was impossible to make the information available. I wish there was more information available but we did make available on Wednesday, as soon as we had concrete data, the information that we had at the time.

The company is entirely independent of the Department and this process. A paper from the national standardisation group to the independent steering group and the programme board stated that Dr. Kentaro Yamamoto was appointed in an expert role, which included a level of contingency cover for Polymetrika, as technical adviser on the standardisation process and to provide expert advice and oversight regarding data integrity. He was part of checking the data integrity in the process that the Department set up. Am I right in saying that Dr. Yamamoto is an ETS employee, the same ETS that is essentially externally reviewing the calculated grades process? Does the Minister see a problem with that in terms of a conflict of interest?

That was part of the State Examinations Commission's contingency plans. The decision to postpone the examinations was taken by the then Minister on 8 May and calculated grades was the process with which it was chosen to move forward. In order for the calculated grade model to be of value to students, it was known that results had to be issued by early September to make Irish and international deadlines for entry to higher and further education. There was no time to run a normal, full procurement process, as I understand it. The area of psychometrics and field of educational testing are highly specialised.

It is a question people want answered. I will put it in another way. People find it absolutely incredible that the Cabinet sat around collectively and did not think this was serious enough to discuss. The Minister did not even get the basic data right. We have to remember that an awful lot of pressure was put on teachers and schools to submit all of the results before the end of June. The Minister has had all of that time since. There was a further delay to get this right and rerun the model. The basic constant piece of data in the model was not right and that is what people find quite incredible.  There has been collective Cabinet responsibility for this mess and the students are the victims. The anguish and uncertainty that the Minister has consistently released on students since May is completely unacceptable in terms of delays, accommodation, costs, fees and all of that.  Is the Minister sure that additional places will be made available when it was already stated that could not be done for leaving certificate students from prior years? They have been left out of this situation. What is happening with the legal process? What if the legal process means that even more additional places have to be made available?  The Minister is admitting to two mistakes. Is it possible that there are more mistakes than that? Has the Minister looked at the North in terms of capacity in the universities and colleges there?

I would say to the Deputy that at all points I acknowledge that the primacy and principle in the situation is and has always been the students and their best interests. In terms of not getting the basic detail right, in an ideal world there would be no mistakes and no errors. We do not live in an ideal world. Therefore, mistakes and errors can occur. It is very important that when an error occurs or a mistake is made, every possible proactive action that needs to be taken to correct that error is taken, and that is what is occurring now.

She tried to reopen schools and deal with a lot of inherited messes on her desk. Nobody is suggesting for a second that all of this is her fault. There are things she has to address in the coming time. She has to address too-large class sizes in primary and secondary schools. A teaching union is balloting for industrial action because of the nature of what is going on in second level schools. She has to sort out pay inequality. She has to provide proper pay and conditions for school secretaries. Her Department has to begin to deal with special needs assistants in a more respectful manner and vindicate the rights of children with special educational needs to get a school place. There is a huge amount on her agenda. In terms of the leaving certificate, from the beginning people in opposition had strong views on this and were not listened to. The then spokesperson on education, and current Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, said in a tweet that the written exam should be cancelled. We in the Labour Party said from the beginning that we did not agree with that assessment because we were completely unconvinced that a proper, fair and robust manner could be found to replace the leaving certificate in such a short amount of time. From the off we said that school profiling was a bad idea. It should have been deleted by the Minister's officials immediately but it was not. To her credit, she recognised it was wrong after the debacle in the United Kingdom and deleted it at the last second. That timeline is part of the problem. I had to force out of the Minister in the Dáil an admission that the leaving certificate result date was being delayed until 7 September because of the calculated grades system. I have come to the conclusion that if school profiling had been deleted earlier in the process, the process would have been more robust. The Minister engaged the services of this crowd, Polymetrika, without a procurement process or tender document. This process was overseen by a national standardisation group and an independent steering committee. A Dr. Janet Brown was appointed as the external reviewer. The Minister relied on the work of Polymetrika International. Apparently, one individual, who is the head of the Northern Ireland Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment, CCEA, was on the steering committee. At the same time he was apologising for the Northern Ireland debacle, he was signing off on the system in the Republic.  The Department of Education and Skills placed the dreams, ambitions, emotions and mental health of 61,000 young people in the hands of their teachers and then Polymetrika. Guess who we could trust? We could trust the teachers. The body that the Minister employed to do this work obviously made a mistake. Was the system not road-tested immediately? Did the Department not say that this is the first time in the history of the State that we are not having a written examination, and therefore we have to road-test this system?  Some of the commentary from other Government spokespersons was to the effect that mistakes and these things happen. It is a bit like a builder telling someone a mistake with the foundations was made, but 95% of the house is fine. There seems to be an attitude that these things happen, mistakes happen and we can all just move on. One of the biggest educational decisions ever made was the decision not to go ahead with a written leaving certificate. One would imagine that the momentous nature of that decision would have reverberated throughout the Department of Education and Skills so that there was no possibility that an error could have come into play. Yet, two of them surfaced. After all of this, 6,500 students will have their grades changed and improved.  I have a number of questions. The Minister said, in what was a remarkable statement from a Minister for Education and Skills but is a statement of fact, that there are students who will not be able to attend the course they have legitimately obtained through this system because of an error from the Department of Education and Skills. That is a devastating thing for somebody to hear.  Deputies told the Minister about this timeline. We told her that it was wrong for students to get their school-based assessments and see the differential between that and their final grade after the CAO offers came out. We told the Minister that was a mistake because at that stage it was too late to appeal.  What is the Department planning to do for the cohort of students who may have already set up shop or made a decision to spend three or four years living in Galway, Cork, Limerick or Dublin and now discover, because of the Department's foul up, that their lives will now be completely different? Is the Minister going to say that these things happen, it will only affect them for a year, mistakes happen and that is the way goes?  The Government was told from the off that a system of calculated grades was not a small decision. It is not something that somebody tweeted about and then decided that somebody else could sort out the ramifications. It was a monumental decision. When one includes the fact that school profiling was included and then taken out, the decision was taken so late that the system could not then correct itself in time for the results to come out.  The CAO results came out and students did not know that there were discrepancies between the school based assessment and what the Polymetrika bunch had churned out.Now we understand that her Department does not trust anybody. It does not trust her Cabinet colleagues or anybody in the education sphere because nobody knew this was coming. Nobody from the third level institutions, the students union bodies or the teacher unions knew this was coming. Obviously, the Department of Education and Skills does not trust anybody. It certainly could not tell us but it could not tell anybody about what was coming. Let us forget about the political system for a second and focus on the young people and those who are going to be hurt most by this. In the minute or so the Minister has left to respond to me, can she address one central issue? The Minister is a compassionate and capable politician who is going to deliver much good change in the education system over the coming period of time. Many of the things she has done in her short period of time in office have benefited children and young people across the land in getting back into school buildings. I want to work with the Minister to achieve more. What is the Minister going to say to somebody who discovers over the coming days that he or she is stuck in Galway when he or she wanted to be in Limerick or some other place? What practical support is the Minister going to give that person because telling him or her that there was a mistake and the Government is sorry is not going to cut it?

I salute the teachers who made it possible and put aside their objections and did it in the best interests of their students. I fully accept what the Deputy is saying in that regard. I am conscious of time but I will deal specifically with the question the Deputy raised in respect of students who may have taken up one particular offer and may now, as a consequence, be in a position to receive a higher preference offer, and I will give this issue some context. Last year 17,000 students appealed, 3,000 of whom were upgraded and 600 offers were made. As a consequence of that, all but three of those received offers within that timeframe, or within last year’s academic year. We are going to move might and main, and I know that the Minister with responsibility for higher education has said likewise, to ensure those students will be in a position to receive those offers this year, within this academic year. We will do that to the absolute best of our ability. I appreciate some students have already taken up offers, as may have occurred in previous years as well. It is important to note that as a special arrangement this year, any student who receives a higher offer, either as a result of taking the exams in November or as a result of an upgrade, will not have to pay any fees, registration or otherwise, and will of course be eligible for SUSI again. It is not an ideal situation which I absolutely know to be the case. I would never have wanted students to be in this position. All of us have an agreed agenda here which is that we only want what is best for the students. They are at the centre of all that we do in the Department of Education and Skills. I have worked all my life in the education sector and I want to ensure, through working with people like the Deputy and the Members of Dáil Éireann, that we deliver for the students. This is not an ideal situation and I regret it.

I was interested in the Minister’s opening address. Yesterday was again a very difficult day for leaving certificate 2020 students. She rectified the situation at the end when she acknowledged that this leaving certificate year had been an awful year, as a whole. It would be remiss of me if I did not go through the timeline of what has been experienced by leaving certificate students in 2020 to encapsulate the full horrors of what they have experienced. Schools closed on 13 March. On 19 March the orals were cancelled, although they were due to take place a short time later, between 23 March and 3 April. On 8 May, the leaving certificate was cancelled, although it was due to start on 3 June, and was replaced by a model, including standardisation and historical data. On 16 July an announcement was made that the results would come three weeks later than scheduled. On 1 September the school historical data was removed and on 7 September the results were issued. Yesterday an announcement was made that there had also been a cock-up in the results. I accept mistakes can be made. What is massively frustrating for me, probably for other Members of the Opposition and for people who have been commenting, asking for changes to be made and highlighting flaws and inadequacies in the system almost since March, was that at every one of those steps and every time we highlighted flaws we were met by expressions of great confidence. We were informed that everything would be okay on the day by both the Minister and her predecessor. It was only at the eleventh hour that an announcement was made that things were going to change, and that the commentary and the suggestions made by opposition parties and leading experts in the field of education, which had been made all the way through, were being acknowledged. That was grotesquely unfair to the students and to the Opposition. If there had been parliamentary scrutiny, some of the flaws that have been revealed today could have been discovered. If governance in this country is to follow the script given by the Department, to show up and cut ribbons and to get a small bit of pork barrel for our constituencies, then it is flawed and unacceptable. In many ways, it has rendered us in the situation we are in. I have some questions on the leaving certificate process but before I put those, I want to acknowledge that in our education system now, some very dark clouds are gathering, which we can all understand. My colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, touched on these a minute ago. I do not have the confidence that the Department and the leadership there now have the capacity or the ability to address the dark clouds that are gathering on a multitude of fronts, which I want to touch on now. The Fórsa union showed up at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, today to engage in discussions on the school secretaries. It was met by blockages. There were retrograde steps as to the relationship that had broken down-----

Prior to that, contingency planning was being undertaken as to what might happen if the Minister had to make the decision at that time.It is important to point out, in reference to previous points the Deputy made about the difficulties and issues around calculated grades, that calculated grades were introduced by the Minister on 8 May but they were first mooted by students and, further to engagement with representative bodies such as teachers, principals, deputy principals, managerial bodies, parents and student representatives, it was an agreed process to move forward with calculated grades. It is important to acknowledge that this was the best view at the time given that we were living in an extraordinarily difficult time. The decision was made to ensure the students, the class of 2020, would have a pathway to move forward in terms of further or higher education or whatever other pathway they would want to choose. In the interests of balance it is very important to mention that. Polymetrika and its principal, Fernando Cartwright, are experts in a highly technical and specialised field in the area of statistics, psychometrics and educational testing. Polymetrika had worked in Ireland previously and its expertise in statistics and psychometrics is especially in the high stakes fields. Having initially been engaged in an advisory capacity with the technical working group prior to April or May and as part of the contingency planning for the 2020 leaving certificate, it was then engaged to implement and deliver the system when the decision was taken on 8 May to postpone the leaving certificate.

Can the Minister confirm that the specifications signed off by her Department were explicit as to the requirements and the date of that sign-off? Who within her Department approved the sign-off, on what date and at which particular meeting? Will she be able to provide the minutes of that meeting at which the specifications were approved?

The exact time and date of the signing of a contract with Polymetrika is not available to me at this point in time. The Deputy will appreciate that it was some considerable time ago but I will make every effort to furnish that to him should he require it. I will ask my Department to do that. In respect of the aspects he has raised, I am not a statistician or an expert in any aspect of psychometrics but the Deputy mentioned the notion of oversight, quality, validation and so on. In terms of oversight, a series of mechanisms were put in place comprising the national standardisation group; the independent steering committee chaired by Dr. Áine Lawlor, formerly of the Teaching Council; the international external reviewer, Dr. Janet Brown of the Scottish Qualifications Authority; and the Educational and Research Centre, which was running a parallel system. Through that system, validations and checks, etc., were taking place. All of that was put in place and documentation relating to this has been made available on the website. If there is further specific information the Deputy requires, I will ensure my officials make it available to him.

In addition to the students who received a lower grade than they should have in this year's leaving certificate, some students received a higher grade. How many?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	428	As I said previously, it is difficult to know the finite number of students until all the checks, reviews and balances have been put in place. In terms of the students the Deputy has referenced who will go up by at least one grade, we estimate at this point that we are talking about approximately 6,500. That is an estimate at this stage. I can only estimate that, when students' grades go up, we are perhaps talking about a similar number but, again, I am not a statistician and I would not have that information fully available to the Deputy until the review is completed.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	429	I am not expecting an exact figure. To be clear, when the Minister says that in addition to the students who received a lower grade some students received a higher grade, she thinks that as many as 6,500 students could have received a higher grade.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	430	I cannot say that definitively but I am going to assume that if the estimate is that that number will go up by one grade, there is every chance that we might be talking about a similar number. When the absolute figures become available they will be made available to the Deputy, the general public and, most importantly, to the students.

We have been very clear that no student will be downgraded. Equally, it is an established practice that where a student is awarded a higher grade as a consequence of an error through no fault of their own, and this would have happened in previous years, they retain that grade. That would be the position now and I think that is only fair.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	433	I understand that that is the established practice. I want to be clear that I am not in favour of any student who got a higher grade being downgraded but in previous years there would have been a certain number of students who received a higher grade than they should have got. It is not an exact figure but the Minister might be talking about a ballpark figure of 6,500. The point I am making to her is that there must be students who applied for courses and would have got their courses if that error had not been made, but were squeezed out of getting their courses because of that error. That must surely be the case. Does the Minister agree that it probably is the case that students have been squeezed out of courses they would have wanted as a result of that error?

I reiterate that those students will retain those grades. No student will be downgraded. I can only speak in the absolute here. That is an established practice and it is what I can confirm for the Deputy.

Perhaps I am not being clear. To be clear, does she accept that it is at least theoretically possible that students who applied for courses and who would have otherwise got the courses have been now squeezed out of those courses because of an error that might affect approximately 6,000 people being upgraded?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	436	In the absolute I know that students have been upgraded. In the absolute I can tell the Deputy that no student will be downgraded and in the absolute I can say to him that it is an established practice. Where there might have been some issue in terms of students getting places that they might not have got if the system had been otherwise, that is very possible.

That is an issue that needs to be debated more but I will park it there for now.It strikes me that it is a standard testing practice, not something done once in a blue moon or regularly. It is a standard practice whereby a sample set of data is taken and run through the system, and then what is got is tested against the expected results. If that were done in this case, it would be discovered very quickly that there was something wrong. Clearly, that did not happen. My question is related to the individual in the Department of Education who signed off on an arrangement that did not involve sample testing of data, such as that described, and the company. How can that be explained? I would just like a brief comment on that before my final question.

The point I am making is that the Department has signed off on an arrangement, and a company signed up to a deal based on that arrangement. My question is whether sample sets of data were used to test results. Surely that would have shown up in the system very quickly.

I referred already to the national standardisation group, the independent steering committee, the international expert reviewer and the Education Research Centre. The Education Research Centre sampled aspects of the code. There was the initial code. Then those concerned were running what I have been informed was a process in parallel to the system being operated by the contractor. Therefore, there were checks and balances put in place. I absolutely accept that it is beyond unfortunate that errors arose. Those errors were found internally, and when they were found, immediate and proactive action was taken. That is important also.

Will the Minister give a rough idea as to when we are likely to have a result and how quickly the extra university places needed might be made available when we have the results? The Minister with responsibility for further and higher education, research, innovation and science, Deputy Harris, referred to up to 1,000 places the other day.

It could be the following day. I am very hopeful. I want this to be as done as speedily as possible, but as correctly as we would all want. Once we receive the information from Educational Testing Service, the calculated grades office will have to complete its work. Thereafter, I would like to see things move as speedily as possible. I appreciate that it is in the best interests of the students that we move as quickly as we can.

I thank the Minister for attending tonight to try to answer them. When did Polymetrika find out about this error? How did it find out about it? What safeguards had it in place to ensure its system was watertight? Why did the safeguards not kick in? How much was the company paid for the development of this system? In what way is it accountable as a result of its system not being watertight?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	454	I thank the Deputy. The error identified by Polymetrika on Tuesday evening of last week was identified as the company was working through the leaving certificate applied results, which are based on a two-year programme. These results are generally uploaded after the leaving certificate results become available. The fifth-year results from the subject area were being worked on. At that point, as I said, Polymetrika identified what it classed at that early stage as an anomaly. In other words, it became apparent that there was something not correct. As regards what that was or meant, there was no clarity at that early stage. The calculated grades office was informed. The system ran through the night and the following day work ensued, as I have outlined. The Deputy asked about the contract and payment. To the best of my knowledge, the original contract was around the €170,000 mark. I will check that and revert to the Deputy. For absolute clarity, I just want to check that. What was the Deputy's third question?

Obviously, as with any contract, there are penalties. All that will obviously be pursued to the absolute extent. On what the Deputy asked about oversight, I have outlined that there was oversight in terms of the full model.

That included oversight by the national standardisation group and the independent steering committee, which was important and which was chaired by Dr. Áine Lawlor, formerly of the Teaching Council. Equally, an international external review was conducted by Dr. Janet Brown, formerly of the Scottish Qualifications Authority. There was a further external review here by the Education Research Centre. There was validation and there were checks and balances. A number of layers were put in place. As I said previously, all the information and data concerning each of these groups have been made available and are available online. The reports they have produced and opinions they have offered are also available.

The Minister and Department, despite being aware of the error, failed to mention it in the answer, despite its being directly related to my question. Can we not trust the responses from the Department? Why was this not mentioned?

It was only on working through it that the exact nature of the error and the number of students who would be impacted became apparent. Indeed, we are still working on further, complete, absolute, substantial data.Until the fullest of data is available, we cannot make the fullest of data available. As I said, I am hoping to do that as quickly as possible.

Are they accurate and as accountable as they are meant to be? Yesterday, a text message was sent to students informing them that they had been affected, my own daughter included. Shockingly, the Department got that messaging wrong in that it sent an incorrect link to the students and they then had to be sent a second message. Why could the Department not get this right? We are dealing with the lives of young students. There has been one blunder after another. Why could the Department not get that messaging right? As the Minister said in her opening remarks, this is a very sensitive time for students. I acknowledge that the Minister has apologised. It is a trying time for every student, not just my daughter. That the Department sent the incorrect link was very sloppy and clumsy. It shows a lack of serious care for the students it was addressing.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	464	I thank the Deputy for raising that point. I acknowledge that he is 100% correct that this is an incredibly sensitive and anxious time for the students. At no stage do I want to diminish the anxiety that students are experiencing. I would go beyond that because I know that it is not just the student but the entire family who are drawn into this. I appreciate that all households become involved when a student is taking the leaving certificate examination or any examination. I acknowledge the anxiety that exists. As the Deputy has acknowledged, I have apologised previously and I will continue to apologise for the stress and anxiety that has been placed on students. On the text message, it was transmitted yesterday to students so that they would be made aware of exactly what was happening. I reiterate that students are the central and principal concern in all of this. I want to abide by that throughout this process. On the specific instance raised by the Deputy of the transmission of an incorrect link, I am not aware of that. I am aware of the text message being sent to the approximately 61,000 students. The issue of an incorrect link has not been raised with me. If that is the case, I am sorry to hear that. I will investigate that with my officials and revert to the Deputy on the matter. I again thank him for raising the issue.

If not, those students are disadvantaged? If students must move to another city to take up a place in an alternative university, who will compensate them for the accommodation for which they have already paid? Everyone had to pay for their accommodation last Friday only to be told on Friday evening that they would be taking their courses online. I ask the Minister to clarify that?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	466	If students receive an upgrade, the completed file will be sent to the CAO. The CAO will make higher preference offers to those who are deserving of them at that point. We will move to do that as quickly as possible because I appreciate that it is important students receive those offers as quickly as possible. I mentioned previously that students who receive an upgrade as a special arrangement this year, either as a consequence of the calculated grade or of taking the examination in November, will not have to pay any fees, registration or otherwise, and they will be eligible for the SUSI grant. On the number of places, I confirm and acknowledge the preparedness of the Minister with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Harris, and his Department to work with the Department of Education, the CAO and the Higher Education Authority to do all that is within our gift to ensure that the maximum number of students receive their offer and placement this year. That is the objective. It is important to reiterate that last year there were 17,000 appeals, of which 3,000 were successful and 600 students were upgraded and became eligible to receive higher preference offers. All of the 600, bar three, received their offer within the academic year last year. It is my absolute objective, in co-operation with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to ensure that, if at all possible, similar success will be achieved this year.

The context was given and the structures that existed and the people who were responsible for testing was outlined but the Minister did not tell us whether the type of testing that should have been happening did happen. That is the key question that Deputy Barry was asking. There is a piece to this that I am not getting. In response to me earlier, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, said the flaws were spotted during the process of the leaving certificate applied. I am not sure why that was being processed at that stage given that the results were already out but perhaps it was appeals. The bit I am struggling with is that any formula of this kind should be tested numerous times. It should be run on a few sets of data. It is not complicated; there is a formula. For example, a small dataset of, say, a dozen, 20, 40 or more students, is run through the formula and one should know what the outcome is meant to be because one knows the inputs and outputs of the formula and the process that should happen. If it does not produce the results expected, one works back through the formula to identify the problem. That is what should have been happening. It is exactly the detailed walk-through that the Minister says has happened. Given the way that this transpired, it is obvious that was not happening during this process. Unless the Minister can tell me otherwise, it seems to me very plain that that type of testing during the development of this process, formula or code, was not taking place. What am I not getting?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	476	In regard to the Deputy's confusion as to the reason the leaving certificate applied aspect was involved, he will appreciate the leaving certificate applied is a two-year programme and the fifth year aspect of it was being uploaded. That is why that was happening at that time. The Deputy is correct that it was at that time the error was identified. In terms of the processes, oversight and so on, I have said previously, and I say so honestly again, I am not a statistician. I am not an expert in psychometrics or examination testing. Therefore, I can only give the Deputy the layman's version as I understand it. My understanding, without any expertise in this area, is that there was oversight of the process by the national standardisation group, the independent steering committee and the international external reviewer and, most important, the Education Research Centre was running the data in parallel with the process being run by the contractor. That is my understanding of what has happening at the time. An error occurred and it was identified. Something went wrong. We are in this position now because something went wrong. I accept that. I have acknowledged that and once the error became known, positive and proactive action was taken.

It seems to me very plain that the testing that should have been happening was not happening. The Department employed an outfit that did not test as it should have tested. It bought an application that did not work. That is the reality of what happened. I am speaking not about the Minister but the Department. We are dealing with the consequences of that process at this point. The key point in all of this is the solution. I urge the Minister to work with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to do all in her power in regard to third level places. It is the only game in town in terms of resolving this matter. Every step must be taken. People talk about capacity and, obviously, that is an issue. However, it is not just about physical capacity but also staffing in terms of feedback to students. That must be the focus now and I urge the Minister to continue that work.

#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-01 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	479	I guarantee that I will work with the Minister, Deputy Harris, as I said earlier. I acknowledge his and his Department's co-operation in working through the current situation. Every effort we can make will be made to ensure that students who are offered a higher preference place will receive it within this academic year. There is an absolute determination to do that. My opening remarks gave me the opportunity to acknowledge the errors that have occurred in the calculated grades system and, importantly, to apologise for the impact these errors are having. I appreciate having the opportunity to do that once again. I have listened to the concerns of Deputies and also to the comments and questions from those with whom I met remotely yesterday afternoon. The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, are committed to ensuring that we support students in addressing the challenges that lie ahead and when the revised offers are made through the CAO. It is important to remember, with regard to the CAO and what happens every year, that following the examinations appeals process some appeals are successful and students receive revised CAO offers. In essence, that is the same sequence we propose to follow this year. The scale is considerably bigger and that is a challenge. Almost half of those who received calculated grades received their first preference choice as a CAO offer and 80% received one of their first three choices. Some of these students will receive revised grades. As regards those who receive revised grades, it is not limited to any single group of students or to a particular subject area. There will be revised grades across all subjects and students. I appreciate the earnestness and sincerity of all Deputies who have engaged in the discussion tonight, of those who engaged earlier with me and of those who engage on an ongoing basis with positive and constructive contributions for the sake of education, to which we are all greatly committed. I appreciate the wisdom, experience and, indeed, the genuine nature of the contributions Members make in the House on all that happens in the education sector. Creating and building the calculated grades process and supporting systems was a major logistical undertaking. That has been a much-used phrase over the last while but, even so, that does not take from its veracity. The calculated grades process was a direct response to challenges presented by Covid-19 and it was designed and implemented in a very short timeframe. Undoubtedly, it was done in good faith by the Minister at the time when he made the announcement on 8 May last. My focus now is on ensuring the work being undertaken by my Department, Polymetrika International and the external reviewer can be concluded as quickly as possible. I want students to appreciate that all that must be done will be done to ensure that the maximum number of students who are entitled to a higher preference offer will receive those offers. I conclude by apologising again to the students of 2020 and acknowledging the impact the two errors have had on them. We are working to resolve the situation. I appreciate the resilience, forbearance and patience students have shown to this point. I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to be here this evening.
